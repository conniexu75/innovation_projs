https://openalex.org/W2087090756,"Neurotrophins are growth factors that promote cell survival, differentiation, and cell death. They are synthesized as proforms that can be cleaved intracellularly to release mature, secreted ligands. Although proneurotrophins have been considered inactive precursors, we show here that the proforms of nerve growth factor (NGF) and the proforms of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are secreted and cleaved extracellularly by the serine protease plasmin and by selective matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). ProNGF is a high-affinity ligand for p75(NTR) with high affinity and induced p75NTR-dependent apoptosis in cultured neurons with minimal activation of TrkA-mediated differentiation or survival. The biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75NTR to mediate apoptosis and mature forms activating Trk receptors to promote survival."
https://openalex.org/W2132008384,"The manner in which terrestrial ecosystems are regulated is controversial. The ""top-down"" school holds that predators limit herbivores and thereby prevent them from overexploiting vegetation. ""Bottom-up"" proponents stress the role of plant chemical defenses in limiting plant depredation by herbivores. A set of predator-free islands created by a hydroelectric impoundment in Venezuela allows a test of these competing world views. Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1982501876,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) governs cell growth and proliferation by mediating the mitogen- and nutrient-dependent signal transduction that regulates messenger RNA translation. We identified phosphatidic acid (PA) as a critical component of mTOR signaling. In our study, mitogenic stimulation of mammalian cells led to a phospholipase D–dependent accumulation of cellular PA, which was required for activation of mTOR downstream effectors. PA directly interacted with the domain in mTOR that is targeted by rapamycin, and this interaction was positively correlated with mTOR's ability to activate downstream effectors. The involvement of PA in mTOR signaling reveals an important function of this lipid in signal transduction and protein synthesis, as well as a direct link between mTOR and mitogens. Furthermore, these studies suggest a potential mechanism for the in vivo actions of the immunosuppressant rapamycin."

https://openalex.org/W1993151010,"Marine reserves have been widely promoted as conservation and fishery management tools. There are robust demonstrations of conservation benefits, but fishery benefits remain controversial. We show that marine reserves in Florida (United States) and St. Lucia have enhanced adjacent fisheries. Within 5 years of creation, a network of five small reserves in St. Lucia increased adjacent catches of artisanal fishers by between 46 and 90%, depending on the type of gear the fishers used. In Florida, reserve zones in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge have supplied increasing numbers of world record-sized fish to adjacent recreational fisheries since the 1970s. Our study confirms theoretical predictions that marine reserves can play a key role in supporting fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2027927113,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside predominantly in bone marrow, but low numbers of HSCs are also found in peripheral blood. We examined the fate of blood-borne HSCs using genetically marked parabiotic mice, which are surgically conjoined and share a common circulation. Parabionts rapidly established stable, functional cross engraftment of partner-derived HSCs and maintained partner-derived hematopoiesis after surgical separation. Determination of the residence time of injected blood-borne progenitor cells suggests that circulating HSCs/progenitors are cleared quickly from the blood. These data demonstrate that HSCs rapidly and constitutively migrate through the blood and play a physiological role in, at least, the functional reengraftment of unconditioned bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2087679230,"We describe the high resolution structure of the large ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans (D50S), a gram-positive mesophile suitable for binding of antibiotics and functionally relevant ligands. The over-all structure of D50S is similar to that from the archae bacterium Haloarcula marismortui (H50S); however, a detailed comparison revealed significant differences, for example, in the orientation of nucleotides in peptidyl transferase center and in the structures of many ribosomal proteins. Analysis of ribosomal features involved in dynamic aspects of protein biosynthesis that are partially or fully disordered in H50S revealed the conformations of intersubunit bridges in unbound subunits, suggesting how they may change upon subunit association and how movements of the L1-stalk may facilitate the exit of tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2000217017,"We describe a method, based on single-molecule imaging, that allows the real-time visualization of the infection pathway of single viruses in living cells, each labeled with only one fluorescent dye molecule. The tracking of single viruses removes ensemble averaging. Diffusion trajectories with high spatial and time resolution show various modes of motion of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) during their infection pathway into living HeLa cells: (i) consecutive virus touching at the cell surface and fast endocytosis; (ii) free and anomalous diffusion of the endosome and the virus in the cytoplasm and the nucleus; and (iii) directed motion by motor proteins in the cytoplasm and in nuclear tubular structures. The real-time visualization of the infection pathway of single AAVs shows a much faster infection than was generally observed so far."
https://openalex.org/W2137220579,"Fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) encodes an RNA binding protein that acts as a negative translational regulator. We have developed a Drosophila fragile X syndrome model using loss-of-function mutants and overexpression of the FMR1 homolog (dfxr). dfxr nulls display enlarged synaptic terminals, whereas neuronal overexpression results in fewer and larger synaptic boutons. Synaptic structural defects are accompanied by altered neurotransmission, with synapse type-specific regulation in central and peripheral synapses. These phenotypes mimic those observed in mutants of microtubule-associated Futsch. Immunoprecipitation of dFXR shows association with futsch mRNA, and Western analyses demonstrate that dFXR inversely regulates Futsch expression. dfxr futsch double mutants restore normal synaptic structure and function. We propose that dFXR acts as a translational repressor of Futsch to regulate microtubule-dependent synaptic growth and function."
https://openalex.org/W2130515385,"We have used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to study global circadian gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. Coupled with an analysis of clock mutant (Clk) flies, a cell line designed to identify direct targets of the CLOCK (CLK) transcription factor and differential display, we uncovered several striking features of circadian gene networks. These include the identification of 134 cycling genes, which contribute to a wide range of diverse processes. Many of these clock or clock-regulated genes are located in gene clusters, which appear subject to transcriptional coregulation. All oscillating gene expression is under clk control, indicating that Drosophila has no clk-independent circadian systems. An even larger number of genes is affected in Clk flies, suggesting that clk affects other genetic networks. As we identified a small number of direct target genes, the data suggest that most of the circadian gene network is indirectly regulated by clk."
https://openalex.org/W2160769801,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) plays a critical role in regulating multiple aspects of energy metabolism, including adaptive thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and fatty acid β-oxidation. Recently, this coactivator of nuclear receptors/transcription factors has been shown to control hepatic gluconeogenesis, an important component of the pathogenesis of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes. We described here the cloning of a novel bona fide homologue of PGC-1, PGC-1β (PGC-1 was renamed as PGC-1α), first identified through searches of new data base entries. Despite the fact that PGC-1α and -1β share similar tissue distributions with highest levels of expression in brown fat and heart, their mRNAs are differentially regulated in the brown adipose tissue upon cold exposure and during brown fat cell differentiation. Like PGC-1α, PGC-1β mRNA levels are increased significantly in the liver during fasting, suggesting a possible role for this factor in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and/or fatty acid oxidation. Consistent with this, PGC-1β was shown to physically interact and potently coactivate hepatic nuclear factor 4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, nuclear receptors that are essential for hepatic adaptation to fasting. Finally, using sequence comparisons between PGC-1α and -1β, we have identified a conserved amino acid motif that serves as a docking site for host cell factor, a cellular protein implicated in cell cycle regulation and viral infection.

A number of coactivators, including the p160 family, p300/CBP and P/CAF, contain intrinsic histone acetyl transferase activity and regulate transcription by modulating histone acetylation (1Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Other coactivators, consisting of heterogeneous proteins with little sequence homology, modulate transcription by acting as protein docking interfaces that recruit histone acetyl transferase-containing complexes or associate with basal transcription factors such as RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (3Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The interaction between NRs and many coactivators requires a conserved LXXLL motif, which is believed to form hydrophobic contacts with the receptors (4Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E.

PGC-1 was initially identified as a PPARγ-interacting protein from a BAT library and was subsequently found to associate with an array of NRs and transcription factors (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W.

Importantly, PGC-1 has been shown to coordinately regulate the program of mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptive thermogenesis in BAT and skeletal muscle, mainly through the coactivation of PPARs and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of many mitochondrial genes (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar, 7Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G.

In transgenic mice, PGC-1 increases mitochondrial biogenesis and β-oxidation of fatty acids in the heart, likely through augmentation of PPARα and NRF1 transcriptional activity (10Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Recently, PGC-1 expression was found to be elevated in fasted liver and several models of type-1 and type-2 diabetes; in addition, PGC-1 can directly control the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis (11Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M.

Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Despite playing an important role in coordinating multiple physiological processes, no close homologue for PGC-1 has been found. We described here the identification of a novel coactivator, which is closely related to PGC-1, that we have termed PGC-1β. Furthermore, we identified HCF, a cellular protein that is involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and cell cycle regulation (13Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as a novel binding partner that increases the transcriptional activity of both PGC-1α and -1β. Full-length PGC-1β cDNA clone was obtained by ligating the 5′ end of PGC-1β cDNA generated by GENERACER (Invitrogen) to an expressed sequence tag cDNA clone (AA288169) that contains the 3′ end. GST-PGC-1β (N-350) was generated by inserting a PCR fragment coding for the N-terminal 350 amino acids in frame into pGEX-5X1 vector. Fusion constructs between GAL4-DBD and various regions of PGC-1β or HCF were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified cDNA fragments in frame into pCMX-GAL4 plasmid (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). N-terminal FLAG-tagged PGC-1β (amino acid 2–1014) was obtained by subcloning the cDNA insert into pCATCH FLAG plasmid (15Georgiev O. Bourquin J.P. Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Schaffner W. Hovens C. Gene. 1996; 168: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All PCR fragments were verified by sequencing. BOSC cells and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected using FuGENE according to the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reporter constructs for HNF4α (3× gAF1 luc) and NRF1 (4× NRF1 luc) were described previously (7Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B.B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar, 11Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection. HIB1B cells were maintained and induced to differentiate as described (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). To induce UCP-1 expression, differentiated cells were treated with 10 μmforskolin for 6 h before RNA isolation. For cold exposure, C57/Bl6 mice were maintained at 4 °C for 6 h before sacrifice. RNA samples were analyzed by Northern hybridization using specific cDNA probes. Binding assays using GST fusion proteins were performed essentially as described (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). Ligands were included in some binding reactions as indicated. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, BOSC cells were transiently transfected with various combinations of plasmids and lysed after 36 h in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH = 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed four times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer. The samples were then processed for immunoblotting analysis. PGC-1 is not known to have any close homologues. Because a great amount of sequence data has recently been entered into the genomic and expressed sequence tag databases, we searched these databases for transcripts with similarities to the N terminus of PGC-1. In contrast to the C terminus, this domain is uniquely found in rodent and human PGC-1. A partial transcript in the Celera mouse genome database (mCT4723) was found to encode a novel protein sharing a high degree of sequence identity to PGC-1, which we designated PGC-1β (AF453324). To keep nomenclature consistent, we thus renamed PGC-1 as PGC-1α. Sequence analysis revealed that the 3.6-kb cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1014 amino acids that has similarity to PGC-1α across the entire molecule, including three LXXLL motifs at the N terminus and one RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). Identity between PGC-1α and -1β is especially high in the N-terminal activation domain and the C-terminal RNA binding domain (40 and 48%, respectively; see Fig. 1B). Furthermore, sequence comparison of all PGC-1 family members, including PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC), revealed a novel conserved region containing a tetrapeptide motif (DHDY; amino acid 683–686) that has been previously identified in other proteins as a putative binding site for HCF, a protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and the assembly of a multiprotein transcriptional complex during HSV infection (16Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,17Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The function of this motif will be analyzed below. PGC-1β also contains two glutamic/aspartic acid-rich acidic domains, but unlike PGC-1α and PRC, it lacks most of the arginine/serine-rich domain, a region that has been implicated in the regulation of RNA processing (18Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Human PGC-1β is predicted to share over 70% amino acid sequence identity with mouse PGC-1β and is localized to 5q33. Murine PGC-1β is localized to chromosome 18. BLAST searches also revealed that the PGC-1 family of proteins is also well conserved in species such as chicken, zebrafish, and Xenopus, suggesting that PGC-1 may play important roles common to all of these species, perhaps linked to mitochondrial function and/or the regulation of other cellular and developmental processes. PGC-1β mRNA is expressed in a highly tissue-selective manner as shown by Northern hybridization (Fig. 1C). PGC-1β mRNA is most abundantly present in brown adipose tissue and heart, both notable for containing very high concentrations of mitochondria. These results strongly suggest that like PGC-1α, PGC-1β may play an important role in mitochondrial function, respiration, and/or thermogenesis. Two predominant species of PGC-1β mRNA (5 and 9 kb) were detected; this may result from the usage of two alternative polyadenylation signals present in the 3′ end of the PGC-1β gene. Moderate levels of PGC-1β mRNA are also observed in skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue. PGC-1α was initially identified as a transcription coactivator that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptive thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and brown fat. In contrast to the cold-inducible expression of PGC-1α, the expression of PGC-1β in BAT is not increased in response to cold exposure (Fig.2A). Given its abundant expression in the brown fat, it is possible that PGC-1β is an important factor in the determination and/or differentiation of brown adipocytes. To test whether the expression of PGC-1β is regulated during brown fat differentiation, the mouse brown fat cell line HIB1B was induced to undergo differentiation and examined for the PGC-1β expression (19Klaus S. Choy L. Champigny O. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Ross S. Spiegelman B.M. Ricquier D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with undifferentiated cells, the expression of PGC-1β is elevated on days 3 and 5 of differentiation, parallel with a concomitant decrease in the PGC-1α expression (Fig.2B). Upon treatments with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, PGC-1α level is rapidly induced along with the key uncoupling protein of brown fat, UCP-1. In contrast, PGC-1β expression is slightly decreased. These results indicate that PGC-1α and -1β are likely to perform distinct roles in brown fat differentiation and the regulation of other brown fat functions such as adaptive thermogenesis. PGC-1α expression is highly induced in the liver during fasting and has been shown to play a direct role in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocyte culture and rats (11Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 12Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of PGC-1α has also been shown in models of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes (11Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of PGC-1β is significantly increased in the liver during fasting, a pattern that is strikingly similar to the regulation of PGC-1α expression. These results suggest that PGC-1β might be part of the regulatory pathways that activate the hepatic adaptation during fasting, such as the elevation of gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and ketogenesis. PPARα and HNF4α are important transcription regulators implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis during periods of food deprivation (20Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether PGC-1β would physically interact with and coactivate these transcription factors. The N terminus of PGC-1β (1), which contains three putative nuclear receptor binding motifs (LXXLL), is able to “pull down” in vitro-translated HNF4α with similar efficiency as PGC-1α (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the full-length PGC-1β is readily coimmunoprecipitated with HNF4α when coexpressed in BOSC cells, indicating in vivo association of these two proteins (Fig. 3B). In contrast to PPARα and -γ, the recruitment of PGC-1β by RARα and TRβ is highly dependent on their respective ligands (Fig.3A and data not shown). Consistent with a potential role in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, PGC-1β potently enhances the transcriptional activity of GR and HNF4α on reporter constructs containing multimerized cognate binding sites (Fig. 3C). Coactivation of GR by PGC-1β is strictly dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid, indicating ligand-dependent recruitment of the coactivator to the receptor; the latter is also observed for TRβ and RARα (data not shown). Although PGC-1β alone has minimal effect on the reporter plasmids for GR and RARα, it significantly coactivates HNF4α reporter construct; this is probably because of the presence of endogenous nuclear receptors that may bind to the responsive elements. In addition to coactivating NRs, PGC-1β is also a potent regulator of the transcriptional activity of NRF1, a central transcription factor in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig.3C). Ligand-dependent binding and coactivation of several receptors by PGC-1β demonstrate that PGC-1β regulates the transcriptional activity of multiple NRs, likely through direct physical association with these factors. Significantly, these include factors known to be important in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. Sequence alignment of all PGC-1 family members revealed several conserved patches of amino acids that may be important for their function. One such region contains a tetrapeptide motif, DHDY, that is a putative HCF binding motif (HBM; (D/E)HXY). Proteins containing this motif have been shown to associate with HCF, including HSV viral protein VP16 and a basic leucine-zipper protein, LZIP (16Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HCF does not bind DNA by itself; however, it can be recruited by DNA-binding transcription factors such as Oct-1 and functions as a scaffold for the assembly of transactivation complexes (21Vogel J.L. Kristie T.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although HCF has been found in complex with Oct-1 and VP16, the cellular targets for this factor remain unclear. It is therefore possible that PGC-1α and -1β may mediate the recruitment of HCF-containing protein complexes to the NR binding sites, thereby modulating NR-regulated transcription. To test whether PGC-1α and -1β are physically associated with HCF in vivo, FLAG-tagged HCF was cotransfected with GAL-PGC-1α or -1β and analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. As shown in Fig.4A, HCF strongly interacts with both PGC-1α and PGC-1β, thus identifying a novel interaction partner for PGC-1-related coactivators. Recruitment of HCF to PGC-1β increases the transcriptional activity of PGC-1β 3-fold in a cotransfection assay (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, PGC-1β can be recruited by the N-terminal 380 amino acids of HCF, a domain that has been shown to interact with HBM-containing proteins, and potently increases the transcriptional activity of HCF fused to the GAL4 DBD (Fig. 4C). Coactivation of HCF was also observed for PGC-1α (data not shown). These results demonstrate that HCF can function in complex with PGC-1α/1β to activate transcription from target genes. We described here the identification of a transcription coactivator that is closely related to PGC-1α. PGC-1β has sequence homology to PGC-1α across the molecule, but it is clearly the product of a distinct gene. PGC-1β physically interacts with a number of NRs both in vitro and in vivo and potently augments their transcriptional activity. Expression of PGC-1β is elevated in the liver during fasting, suggesting PGC-1β, like PGC-1α, may play an important role in the activation of metabolic programs underlying hepatic adaptation during fasting. Consistent with this, PGC-1β was found to coactivate HNF4α, GR, and PPARα, transcription factors that coordinate the activation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver. PGC-1β mRNA is abundant in both BAT and heart, tissues that contain dense mitochondria and high levels of substrate oxidation. Given that PGC-1β is a potent coactivator for NRF1, it is highly likely that PGC-1β regulates mitochondrial function and respiration. In contrast to the cold-inducible expression of PGC-1α, the expression of PGC-1β mRNA is not altered by exposure of animals to cold temperature or treatment of brown adipocyte culture with forskolin. On the other hand, PGC-1β mRNA is elevated during brown fat differentiation, suggesting that PGC-1α and -1β perform distinct functions during brown fat determination/differentiation and adaptive thermogenesis. The availability of this new sequence information allows us to identify conserved motifs among PGC-1 family members that may be important for their function. We reported here that all known coactivators in the PGC-1 family, including PGC-1α, -1β, and PRC, contain a functional docking site for HCF. The association between HCF and PGC-1β enhances the transcriptional activity of PGC-1β, suggesting that the assembly of PGC-1·HCF complexes may be important in the coactivation of NRs by PGC-1. HCF is a critical component of a transactivation complex formed along with HSV VP16 and octamer-binding protein Oct-1; this complex is important for immediate early gene expression during viral infection (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Kristie T.M. Vogel J.L. Sears A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The activity of HCF is also required for cell cycle progression (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PGC-1, in complex with HCF and DNA-binding transcription factors such as NRs, plays an as yet unidentified role in gene expression during viral infection and cell proliferation, perhaps related to mitochondrial-linked energy metabolism. This must be addressed in future studies. We thank Dr. Elisabetta Muller for critically reading the manuscript.

By using conditional gene-targeting techniques, we created mice in which calcineurin activity is disrupted specifically in the adult forebrain. At hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, LTD was significantly diminished, and there was a significant shift in the LTD/LTP modification threshold in mutant mice. Strikingly, although performance was normal in hippocampus-dependent reference memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning and the Morris water maze, the mutant mice were impaired in hippocampus-dependent working and episodic-like memory tasks, including the delayed matching-to-place task and the radial maze task. Our results define a critical role for calcineurin in bidirectional synaptic plasticity and suggest a novel mechanistic distinction between working/episodic-like memory and reference memory."
https://openalex.org/W2122551230,"The OLE pathway of yeast regulates the level of the ER-bound enzyme Delta9-fatty acid desaturase OLE1, thereby controlling membrane fluidity. A central component of this regulon is the transcription factor SPT23, a homolog of mammalian NF-kappaB. SPT23 is synthesized as an inactive, ER membrane-anchored precursor that is activated by regulated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent processing (RUP). We now show that SPT23 dimerizes prior to processing and that the processed molecule, p90, retains its ubiquitin modification and initially remains tethered to its unprocessed, membrane-bound SPT23 partner. Subsequently, p90 is liberated from its partner for nuclear targeting by the activity of the chaperone-like CDC48(UFD1/NPL4) complex. Remarkably, this enzyme binds preferentially ubiquitinated substrates, suggesting that CDC48(UFD1/NPL4) is qualified to selectively remove ubiquitin conjugates from protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2001403509,"alpha6beta4 integrin and the Met receptor for HGF have been shown independently to promote invasive growth. We demonstrate here that Met selectively associates with alpha6beta4. In carcinoma cells expressing Met alone, HGF does not exert significant biological effects. Ectopic expression of alpha6beta4 restores HGF-regulated processes. Following Met activation, alpha6beta4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and combines with Shc and PI3K, generating an additional signaling platform that potentiates HGF-triggered activation of Ras- and PI3K-dependent pathways. In the presence of an alpha6beta4 mutant defective for Shc recruitment, Met cannot sustain HGF-mediated responses. Surprisingly, a truncated beta4 unable to bind laminins retains the activity of wild-type alpha6beta4. Such findings invoke an unexpected role for alpha6beta4 in cancer invasion as a functional amplifier of biochemical outputs rather than a mechanical adhesive device."

We identified 264 uncharacterized genes that were specific to or highly enriched in rods. Nearly half of all cloned human retinal disease genes are selectively expressed in rod photoreceptors. In silico mapping of the human orthologs of genes identified in our screen revealed that 86 map within intervals containing uncloned retinal disease genes, representing 37 different loci. We expect these data will allow identification of many disease genes, and that this approach may be useful for cloning genes involved in classes of disease where cell type-specific expression of disease genes is observed."

https://openalex.org/W2002446420,"Use-dependent synapse remodeling is thought to provide a cellular mechanism for encoding durable memories, yet whether activity triggers an actual structural change has remained controversial. We use photoconductive stimulation to demonstrate activity-dependent morphological synaptic plasticity by video imaging of GFP-actin at individual synapses. A single tetanus transiently moves presynaptic actin toward and postsynaptic actin away from the synaptic junction. Repetitive spaced tetani induce glutamate receptor-dependent stable restructuring of synapses. Presynaptic actin redistributes and forms new puncta that label for an active synapse marker FM5-95 within 2 hr. Postsynaptic actin sprouts projections toward the new presynaptic actin puncta, resembling the axon-dendrite interaction during synaptogenesis. Our results indicate that activity-dependent presynaptic structural plasticity facilitates the formation of new active presynaptic terminals."

One such strategy is to add the efficiency of torsion to compression so that blood is wrung, as well as pumped, out of the heart. Models of cardiac torsion have assumed uniform contractile properties of muscle fibers throughout the heart. Here, we show how a spatial gradient of myosin light chain phosphorylation across the heart facilitates torsion by inversely altering tension production and the stretch activation response. To demonstrate the importance of cardiac light chain phosphorylation, we cloned a myosin light chain kinase from a human heart and have identified a gain-in-function mutation in two individuals with cardiac hypertrophy."

We show that, in contrast to other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules that bind CD8αβ, TL preferentially binds the homotypic form of CD8α (CD8αα). Thus, TL tetramers react specifically to CD8αα-expressing cells, including most intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. Compared with CD8αβ, which recognizes the same MHC as the T cell receptor (TCR) and thus acts as a TCR coreceptor, high-affinity binding of CD8αα to TL modifies responses mediated by TCR recognition of antigen presented by distinct MHC molecules. These findings define a novel mechanism of lymphocyte regulation through CD8αα and MHC class I."
https://openalex.org/W2131188751,"During mitosis, a ras-related GTPase (Tem1) binds GTP and activates a signal transduction pathway to allow mitotic exit. During most of the cell cycle, Tem1 function is antagonized by a GTPase-activating protein complex, Bfa1/Bub2. How the Bfa1/Bub2 complex is regulated is not well understood. We find that Polo/Cdc5 kinase acts upstream of Bfa1/Bub2 in the mitotic exit network. Cdc5 phosphorylates Bfa1 and acts to antagonize Bfa1 function to promote mitotic exit. Bfa1 is regulated by multiple cell cycle checkpoints. The spindle assembly and spindle orientation checkpoints inhibit Bfa1 phosphorylation. DNA damage does not inhibit Bfa1 phosphorylation and instead causes a Rad53- and Dun1-dependent modification of Bfa1. Regulation of Bfa1 may therefore be a key step controlled by multiple checkpoint pathways to ensure a mitotic arrest."

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are key modulators of the amplitude and duration of G protein-mediated signaling through their ability to serve as guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have identified RGS-PX1, a Galpha(s)-specific GAP. The RGS domain of RGS-PX1 specifically interacted with Galpha(s), accelerated its GTP hydrolysis, and attenuated Galpha(s)-mediated signaling. RGS-PX1 also contains a Phox (PX) domain that resembles those in sorting nexin (SNX) proteins. Expression of RGS-PX1 delayed lysosomal degradation of the EGF receptor. Because of its bifunctional role as both a GAP and a SNX, RGS-PX1 may link heterotrimeric G protein signaling and vesicular trafficking."

The decrease in PPARγ expression is mediated by inhibition of PPARγ synthesis and increased degradation of PPARγ. In this study, we demonstrate that both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 are targeted to the proteasome under basal conditions and that PPARγ1 is more labile than PPARγ2. The IFNγ-induced increase in PPARγ turnover is blocked by proteasome inhibition and is accompanied by an increase in PPARγ-polyubiquitin conjugates. In addition, IFNγ treatment results in the transcriptional activation of PPARγ. Similar to ligand-dependent activation of PPARγ, IFNγ-induced activation was greater in the phosphorylation-deficient S112A form of PPARγ when compared with wild-type PPARγ. Moreover, the inhibition of ERKs 1 and 2 with a MEK inhibitor, U1026, lead to an inhibition in the decay of PPARγ proteins, indicating that serine phosphorylation influences the degradation of PPARγ in fat cells. Our results also demonstrate that the proteasome-dependent degradation of PPARγ does not require nuclear export. Taken together, these results indicate that PPARγ is targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for degradation under basal conditions and that IFNγ leads to an increased targeting of PPARγ to the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a process that is affected by ERK-regulated serine phosphorylation of PPARγ proteins.

Klaholz B.P. Moras D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, which are produced by a combination of different promoters and alternative splicing (2Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S.

Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). PPARγ1 is predominantly expressed in fat cells but occurs in low levels in multiple tissues. PPARγ2 has an N-terminal extension of 30 amino acids and is very highly expressed in adipocytes (4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

PPARγ has been implicated in the regulation of systemic insulin sensitivity. This was first demonstrated when PPARγ was shown to be a functional receptor for the synthetic antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (8Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O.

Thiazolidinediones are specific high affinity ligands for PPARγ and the order of their receptor binding affinities in vitromirrors their antihyperglycemic activity in vivo (9Willson T.M. Cobb J.E.

Direct evidence for the association between PPARγ and insulin sensitivity comes from genetic studies showing that mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ are associated with severe insulin resistance. Although not obese, these patients developed type 2 diabetes as well as early onset hypertension (10Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D.

Also, insulin has been shown to acutely regulate the expression of PPARγ in human adipocytes (11Rieusset J. Andreelli F. Auboeuf D. Roques M. Vallier P. Riou J.P. Auwerx J. Laville M. Vidal H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and mice that only express one copy of the PPARγ gene have been shown to be more sensitive to insulin (12Miles P.D. Barak Y. He W. Evans R.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that IFNγ results in a substantial loss of PPARγ expression by regulating two cellular events: 1) targeting PPARγ to the proteasome for degradation, and 2) inhibiting the synthesis of PPARγ (13Waite K.J. Floyd Z.E. Arbour-Reily P. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a cytokine that is primarily known for its roles in immunological responses but has also been shown to affect fat metabolism and adipocyte gene expression. In adipocytes, IFNγ treatment results in a decrease of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and increased lipolysis (14Doerrler W. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In 3T3-F442 adipocytes, exposure to IFNγ results in a decreased expression of lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase. Also, in various rodent preadipocyte cell lines, IFNγ inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes (15De Gregoire F. Broux N. Hauser N. Heremans H. Van Damme J. Remacle C. J. Cell.

Diabetes Med. 1998; 15: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

Substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome system are targeted to the proteasome after covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules. Ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid protein, is initially activated by E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which generally shuttles ubiquitin to ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 is bound to the targeted substrate and catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate. Once the first ubiquitin is transferred to the substrate, a polyubiquitination chain is generated via a series of isopeptide linkages. The multiubiquitinated substrate protein is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Our recent studies (13Waite K.J. Floyd Z.E. Arbour-Reily P. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have shown that acute IFNγ treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in a repression of PPARγ transcription that is independent of new protein synthesis. Yet, we also demonstrated that the half-life of PPARγ proteins was shorter following IFNγ treatment. In the current investigation, we observed that proteasomal inhibitors attenuate the TZD- and IFNγ-induced decrease in PPARγ expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that IFNγ treatment is associated with an increase in the formation of polyubiquitin-PPARγ conjugates in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Together, these data indicate that IFNγ signaling results in the increased targeting of PPARγ to the ubiquitin-proteasome system in adipocytes. In addition, we have shown that like TZDs, IFNγ increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Also, the IFNγ-induced activation of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PPARγ2 (S112A) is substantially greater than the IFNγ activation of wild-type PPARγ2. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of PPARγ2 at Ser112contributes to the targeting of PPARγ to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Finally, these studies indicate that the IFNγ-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of PPARγ occurs in the nucleus.

Proteins were separated in 12% polyacrylamide (National Diagnostics) gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk overnight at 4 °C. The immunoblots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). NIH 3T3 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and transiently transfected with either wild-type PPARγ2 or PPARγ2 S112A. To measure PPARγ activity, the cells were cotransfected with DR-1 luciferase and pSV-β-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency. FuGENE 6 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions and a FuGENE 6 to DNA ratio of 3:2 was used in the transfections. Transient transfections were carried out in OptiMEM for 8 h. After 8 h, the media were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, and the cells were incubated overnight. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with IFNγ (100 units/ml) or darglitazone (TZD) (2.5 μm), and the cells were harvested 6 h later. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). PPARγ transcriptional activity was reported as the ratio of luciferase activity (relative light units) to β-galactosidase activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of PPARγ alone or in combination with 4 μg of HA-ubiquitin per 100 mm plate using FuGENE 6 as described above. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 2 h prior to the addition of IFNγ (100 units/ml). The cells were harvested after 15- and 30-min incubations and lysed on ice in PBS, pH 7.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin and 10 μm leupeptin. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubation with a polyclonal anti-PPARγ followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen). PPARγ-ubiquitin complexes were detected by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived overnight in OptiMEM, followed by incubation with 10 μm MG132 for 2 h. At the end of 2 h, IFNγ (100 units/ml) was added, and the cells were harvested after 15- and 30-min incubations and lysed on ice in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin. Immunoprecipitations were performed with a polyclonal anti-PPARγ, and PPARγ-ubiquitin complexes were detected by Western blotting using both anti-PPARγ (monoclonal) and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes were carried out in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (5 μm) to examine the effect of IFNγ on the half-life of PPARγ proteins. The half-lives of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were calculated based on first order decay after quantitation of Western blot data using Un-Scan-It software (Silk Scientific, Inc). IFNγ was added at 100 units/ml and darglitazone was added at 2.5 μm, where indicated. The adipocytes were incubated with one of three proteasome inhibitors (5 μm lactacystin, 100 nm epoxomicin, or 10 μm MG132) in experiments designed to assay proteasome targeting of PPARγ. In these experiments, the cells were preincubated with the proteasome inhibitor for 15–30 min prior to adding the ligand or cycloheximide. A MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U0126 (5 μm), was used to assay involvement of ERK1/2 in the turnover of PPARγ, and the cells were preincubated with U0126 for 30–45 min. Leptomycin B (10 nm) was added as an inhibitor of CRM-1-dependent nuclear export (33Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with leptomycin B for 0.5–1 h prior to the addition of ligand or cycloheximide. Vehicle control additions were performed with either Me2SO (for proteasome inhibitors, TZDs, and U0126) or ethanol (for leptomycin B). We have previously shown that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with IFNγ leads to a decrease in the half-life of both PPARγ proteins (13Waite K.J. Floyd Z.E. Arbour-Reily P. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Spiegelman and co-workers (34Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have shown that TZDs target PPARγ for proteasome-mediated degradation. These results suggest that targeting to the proteasome is an important regulatory event in the control of PPARγ expression. Therefore, we examined PPARγ expression in the presence of three distinct proteasome inhibitors. As shown in Fig.1, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with either epoxomicin, lactacystin, or MG132 resulted in an increase in the levels of PPARγ proteins under basal conditions or in the presence of IFNγ or TZD. Lactacystin and epoxomicin are highly specific proteasome inhibitors and confirm that the observed effects on degradation are due to proteasomal targeting (35Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 36Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, under steady-state conditions, IFNγ treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a substantial loss of PPARγ when compared with control levels. The decrease in PPARγ after IFNγ treatment is slightly greater than the decrease associated with the presence of synthetic ligand (TZD). Inhibition of the proteasome substantially reduces the IFNγ-induced decrease in PPARγ expression. These results indicate that the loss of PPARγ following IFNγ treatment is mediated by the targeting of PPARγ to the 26 S proteasome. Interestingly, PPARγ levels in both IFNγ- and TZD-treated adipocytes in the presence of proteasome inhibitors are less than the control levels under the same conditions. This result is consistent with studies that demonstrate that both IFNγ and TZDs can also down-regulate PPARγ at the mRNA level (13Waite K.J. Floyd Z.E. Arbour-Reily P. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Rosenbaum S.E. Greenberg A.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of a substrate requires two separate steps. First, the substrate is targeted to the proteasome via covalent tagging of the substrate with a polyubiquitin chain. The polyubiquitin-conjugated substrate is then recognized by the 26 S proteasome (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). These polyubiquitin-substrate conjugates are short lived, high molecular mass intermediates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Because IFNγ affects PPARγ decay and this effect can be modulated by proteasome inhibitors, we hypothesized that there would be an increase in polyubiquitin-PPARγ conjugates after IFNγ treatment. To test this theory, we examined the formation of endogenous PPARγ-ubiquitin adducts in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PPARγ proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts that had been incubated in the presence or absence of IFNγ for the times indicated in Fig. 2. The immunoprecipitations were analyzed by immunoblotting using either an anti-PPARγ antibody (Fig.2A) or an anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 2B) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, PPARγ was detected in high molecular mass forms that are present under basal conditions and with increased intensity after IFNγ treatment. We also ectopically expressed octameric HA-tagged ubiquitin and PPARγ2 in NIH 3T3 cells and observed ubiquitin conjugation of PPARγ under basal conditions and a significant increase in PPARγ ubiquitin conjugation following IFNγ treatment (data not shown). Based on our previous studies showing that IFNγ treatment of cultured adipocytes has the dual effect of suppressing PPARγ transcription and increasing PPARγ turnover (13Waite K.J. Floyd Z.E. Arbour-Reily P. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IFNγ treatment may also decrease the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. To test this prediction, we assayed the transcriptional activity of PPARγ in NIH 3T3 cells using a luciferase reporter (DR1 luciferase) construct containing three PPARγ response elements. This construct has previously been used to measure PPARγ activity (34Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 38Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we also examined the effect of IFNγ on the transcriptional activity of the phosphorylation-deficient PPARγ2 S112A mutant. Numerous studies have shown that this mutant is more transcriptionally active and that phosphorylation at this site is associated with reduced PPARγ activity (39Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 40Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 41Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. Leff T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To measure PPARγ activity, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with DR1 luciferase and PPARγ2 or PPARγ2 S112A in pSVSport vectors in the presence and absence of IFNγ or TZD. As shown in Fig. 3, IFNγ treatment activates PPARγ2 to the same extent as the ligand-dependent activation associated with TZD treatment. In addition, activity of the PPARγ2 S112A was greater than wild-type PPARγ2, and the transcriptional activity of the mutant was also significantly induced by IFNγ treatment. However, the mutant was more potently activated by TZD treatment. Because IFNγ and TZDs both activate PPARγ and target it for degradation, we hypothesized that regulators of PPARγ activation could also contribute to PPARγ degradation. Therefore, we examined the contribution of PPARγ Ser112 phosphorylation on PPARγ degradation because phosphorylation at this site has profound effects on PPARγ activation. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor, U0126, prior to the addition of IFNγ or a vehicle control. Turnover of PPARγ was then measured in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. As shown in Fig.4A, the turnover of both PPARγ1 and γ2 was prolonged in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (control + MEK I). We also observed that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity abrogates the IFNγ-mediated decrease in the half-life of PPARγ (Fig. 4A, IFNγ + MEK I). The results in Fig. 4A clearly demonstrate that the presence of the MEK inhibitor suppresses the decay of PPARγ proteins in adipocytes under control and IFNγ-treated conditions. We also examined the effect of IFNγ and/or MEK I on PPARγ levels in the absence of cycloheximide. The results in Fig. 4B confirm that ERKs 1 and 2 and play a role in degradation of PPARγ proteins under basal as well as IFNγ-mediated conditions. In Fig. 4, A and B, the expression of STAT 5A is shown as a loading control. The results in Fig. 4A also indicate that the decay of PPARγ is much quicker than the decay of PPARγ2. Therefore, we performed an additional decay experiment to compare the decay of γ1 and γ2. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with cycloheximide, and whole cell extracts were isolated at various times over a 6 h period. Fig. 5A shows the decay of PPARγ proteins under basal conditions. The γ1 and γ2 half-lives were calculated to be 58 min and 1.45 h, respectively. The bottom panel of Fig. 5A represents an enlarged display of four of the time points from the top panel. As shown in this panel, we were also able to resolve the two bands of PPARγ1, which represent the Ser112-phosphorylated (upper band) and unphosphorylated forms of the protein. The decay experiment in Fig.5A clearly demonstrates that PPARγ1 is more labile than γ2. In addition, the unphosphorylated γ1 disappears quicker than the phosphorylated form of γ1. This pattern was also observed in the presence of IFNγ. (Fig. 5B).Figure 5PPARγ1 is more labile than PPARγ2, and the higher mobility form of PPARγ1 decays after the lower mobility form.

Many animals capture odors from turbulent water currents or wind using antennae that bear chemosensory hairs. We used planar laser-induced fluorescence to reveal how lobster olfactory antennules hydrodynamically alter the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration in turbulent odor plumes. As antennules flick, water penetrates their chemosensory hair array during the fast downstroke, carrying fine-scale patterns of concentration into the receptor area. This spatial pattern, blurred by flow along the antennule during the downstroke, is retained during the slower return stroke and is not shed until the next flick."

The importance of PKA anchoring through the association with AKAPs has recently been established in the regulation of L-type Ca2+channels.

Wild type (wt) and deletion constructs of AKAP15 were generated in the same manner and cloned in frame into the Gal4 activation domain vector, pACT2 (CLONTECH). N-terminal acylated (NAc) CT fragments of CaV1.1 were constructed by incorporating the myristoylation and palmitoylation sequence (MGALCC) of AKAP15 onto the N terminus of the CT fragments by PCR and cloned in frame into pcDNA3mycHisA (Invitrogen). For production of His fusion proteins, the CT fragments of CaV1.1 were sub-cloned into pET29a (Novagen, Madison, WI).

Co-transformants were first plated onto synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (trp−leu−) to select for colonies containing both hybrid plasmids and then transferred onto medium that also lacked histidine (trp−leu−his−) to select for protein-protein interactions. Media were supplemented with 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) to suppress background growth of the Y190 yeast strain. Only those transformants that grew on trp−leu−his− media at 30 °C were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the colony filter lift assay (18Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S.

His fusion proteins of CaV1.1 (CT3, CT4, and CT6) were expressed as soluble proteins and were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). GST-AKAP15 was first purified on a GST column and then cleaved from GST using factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences). All fusion proteins were quantified by bicinchoninic assay. His-CT fusion proteins bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were incubated with 5 μg of cleaved AKAP15 for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes bound to the beads were washed extensively in wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Bound proteins were detected with anti-AP1 antibody (1/1000 (12Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E. Hays L.G. Yates I.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). Immunoblots containing 10% of the His fusion proteins used in the binding assay were probed with anti-His antibody (Invitrogen; 1/1000). Each in vitro binding assay was repeated at least three times. TsA-201 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin plated on 15-cm dishes. Cells were transfected with 50 μg of an equimolar ratio of expression plasmid cDNA using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in ice-cold bRIA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors), and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation, and lysates were pre-cleared with protein AG-Sepharose. Pre-cleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) or 2 μg of control non-immune IgG for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein AG-Sepharose (50 μl) for an additional 2 h. Immune complexes bound to the Sepharose beads were washed extensively, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Myc-tagged NAc-CT fragments were detected using monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). For AKAP15 detection, immunoblots were probed using the anti-AP1 antibody or the RII-biotin overlay assay (16Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated at least three times. The permanent clonally derived line of BALB/c mouse skeletal muscle cells, MM14, subline DZ1A, was grown exponentially in a medium consisting of 85% Ham's F-10C nutrients (Ca2+ adjusted to 1.26 mm and 60 mg/ml gentamicin), 15% pre-selected horse serum, and 3 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor. Cultures were passaged using 0.05% trypsin plus EDTA (Invitrogen), resuspended in differentiation media (85% Ham's F-10C, 15% HS), and inoculated at final concentrations of 20,000 and 30,000 cells per 35-mm gelatin-coated culture dish (19Neville C. Rosenthal N. McGrew M. Bogdanova N. Hauschka S. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 52: 85-116Crossref Google Scholar). This protocol was designed to provide relatively sparse cell densities in which greater than 90% of the cells were differentiated within 24 h (determined by myosin heavy chain immunocytochemistry), but in which cell fusion was minimized. Recordings were made from elongated myotubes containing 2–4 myonuclei 48–72 h post-differentiation. Barium currents through skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels were recorded from MM14 myotubes using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Patch pipettes (2.5–3.5 megohms) were pulled from micropipette glass (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA) and fire-polished prior to use. Junction potentials were corrected after placing the tip of the electrode in the bath solution and before gigaohm seal formation, which was achieved via gentle suction. After establishing the whole-cell configuration, capacitative transients elicited by symmetrical 20-mV clamp steps from −80 mV were recorded to calculate cell capacitance and access resistance. Capacitative currents were measured and electronically compensated (>90%), and the remaining linear components were subtracted using a P/4 leak subtraction protocol. The average membrane capacitance for all experiments was 62.3 ± 2.3 picofarads (n = 41). Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) and sampled at 5 kHz after anti-alias filtering at 2 kHz. Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by pClamp software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments), and data were stored for later off-line analysis. The extracellular bath solution contained (in mm) 150 Tris, 1 MgCl2, and 10 BaCl2. The intracellular recording solution consisted of (in mm) 130N-methyl-d-glucamine, 60 Hepes, 2 MgATP, and 1 MgCl2. The pH of both solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid (300–310 mosm l−1). All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n cells. Statistical significance was tested using Student's t test. Values of p < 0.01 were considered significant. Previous work has shown that AKAP15 co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel in transverse tubule membranes (12Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E.

Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which AKAP15 associates with the Ca2+ channel complex has not been elucidated. To examine the possibility that AKAP15 directly interacts with the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.1), the yeast two-hybrid system was used. cDNA encoding the intracellular loops of the α1 subunit of CaV1.1 (Fig.1A) and AKAP15 were co-transformed into the Y190 yeast strain using standard techniques. Positive interactions were assayed by growth on selective medium dependent on activation of the nutritional selection marker geneHIS3 and by staining dependent on activation of the second reporter gene, lacZ, using the β-galactosidase assay. Fig.1B shows that AKAP15 interacted with the C-terminal domain of the α1 subunit of CaV1.1. This interaction was specific for the two proteins since neither AKAP15 nor the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 activated reporter gene expression when co-transformed with empty vector alone (Fig.1B, +pACT2). To identify the minimal region within the C terminus that interacted with AKAP15, a series of deletions spanning the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 were generated (Fig.1C), and their ability to interact with AKAP15 was assessed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Deletion analysis revealed that a 68-amino acid AKAP15 binding domain (CT7; amino acids 1774–1841) in the distal half of the C terminus was sufficient to interact with AKAP15 (Fig. 1D). To confirm this interaction in vitro, bacterially expressed His fusion proteins encompassing different regions of the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and incubated with cleaved AKAP15. Following extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.2, AKAP15 bound specifically to CT4 and CT6, which contain residues 1774–1841, but not CT3, which lacks this sequence. Hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins of the intracellular loops I–II and II–III also failed to bind AKAP15 in this assay and served as negative controls (data not shown). Thesein vitro binding data suggest that AKAP15 directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 at a site located between residues 1753 and 1873, the boundaries of CT6. We did not examine CT7 in these experiments because of poor expression in bacteria. To verify the interaction between AKAP15 and the C terminus of CaV1.1 in vivo, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in mammalian cells. The N terminus of AKAP15 contains a consensus sequence for myristoylation and palmitoylation that is required for its insertion into the plasma membrane (12Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E.

Langeberg L.K. Westphal A.M. Dean R.A. Marrion N.V. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This N-terminal acylation (NAc) sequence of AKAP15 was engineered onto the N terminus of fusion proteins encompassing different regions of the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 to target them to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A), and their ability to interact with AKAP15 was examined by immunoprecipitation studies. TsA-201 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged NAc-CT constructs and AKAP15. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody or non-immune IgG, and the immunoprecipitated AKAP15 protein was detected with the anti-AP1 antibody. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-AP1 or anti-Myc antibody demonstrated robust expression of AKAP15 and the NAc-CT constructs, respectively (Fig.3B, lower panels). AKAP15 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with CT1, CT4, CT6, and CT7 but not CT3 (Fig. 3B, upper panel), consistent with our yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. 1). Furthermore, failure of AKAP15 to co-immunoprecipitate with CT3 rules out the possibility of nonspecific interactions due to the presence of the NAc sequence. Interestingly, AKAP15 also co-immunoprecipitated with CT8 (residues 1774–1821), suggesting that a 48-residue AKAP15 binding domain (ABD) in the distal C terminus of CaV1.1 is sufficient to interact with AKAP15. Taken together with the yeast two-hybrid andin vitro binding data, we can conclude that the ABD is located within residues 1774–1841, the boundaries of CT7, and probably is within residues 1774–1821, the boundaries of CT8. To identify the region within AKAP15 that binds to the CaV1.1 ABD, a series of constructs spanning different regions of AKAP15 were generated (Fig.4), and their ability to interact with the CaV1.1 ABD was assessed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. A 27-amino acid fragment (residues 28–54) was sufficient to interact with the CaV1.1 ABD (Fig. 4). This region contains the amphipathic helix (residues 28–40) of AKAP15 that binds the type II regulatory subunit of PKA (12Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E. Hays L.G. Yates I.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the amphipathic region of AKAP15 was not sufficient to mediate the interaction, as deletion of the last 41 amino acids of AKAP15 (AKAP15(1–40)) abolished binding to the CaV1.1 ABD (Fig. 4). These results suggest that a region distal to the amphipathic region of AKAP15 interacts with the CaV1.1 ABD. Secondary structure prediction analysis revealed that the helix of AKAP15 extends beyond the amphipathic region to form a coiled-coil, characterized by a leucine heptad motif (Fig.5A). Leucine and isoleucine zipper (LZ) motifs are α-helical heptad repeats that have recently been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions that target kinases and phosphatases to macromolecular complexes (20Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 21Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The region of AKAP15 (residues 28–54) identified as critical for binding to the CaV1.1 ABD contains a leucine heptad motif between residues 42 and 49, raising the possibility that AKAP15 interacts with the CaV1.1 ABD via its LZ motif. If AKAP15 interacts with the CaV1.1 ABD via its LZ motif, then a similar LZ motif would be expected in the ABD of CaV1.1. Secondary structure prediction analysis revealed that this region of the Ca2+ channel has a high probability of forming an α-helix, interrupted by two glycine residues at positions 1795 and 1796 (Fig. 5A). Whereas the CaV1.1 ABD does not contain the “classical” LZ motif, it does contain a valine-leucine heptad motif between residues 1786 and 1814 (Fig. 5A), and valine residues have been identified in hydrophobic heptad zipper motifs in proteins (22Yu M. Miller R.H. Emerson S. Purcell R.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7085-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stone-Hulslander J. Morrison T.G. J.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that alanine substitutions of one or more leucine residues in LZ motifs greatly diminish the ability of LZ motifs to mediate protein-protein interactions without disrupting the overall α-helical structure (25Simmerman H.K. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar,26Moitra J. Szilak L. Krylov D. Vinson C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12567-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that AKAP15 binds to the C-terminal domain of CaV1.1 via an LZ-like interaction, leucine residues in AKAP15 at positions 42 and 49 were mutated to alanine to generate AKAP15LZM. In addition, valine and leucine residues at positions 1793 and 1800, respectively, were mutated to alanine to generate CaV1.1 ABDLZM. These residues in the CaV1.1 ABD were chosen for mutagenesis because of their central location in the motif and because the “d” positions of heptad repeats are often important for mediating protein-protein interactions (27Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 101-168PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of these mutants to interact was first examined using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Fig. 5B shows that alanine substitution of the leucine residues in the coiled-coil region of AKAP15 abolished the interaction with the CaV1.1 ABD (Fig.5B, upper panel). Similarly, the CaV1.1 ABDLZM mutant failed to interact with either wtAKAP15 or AKAP15LZM (Fig.5B). Confirmation of these results were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Lysates of tsA-201 cells co-expressing wtAKAP15 or AKAP15LZM with either the CaV1.1 ABD or CaV1.1 ABDLZMwere immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody or non-immune IgG, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using the RII-biotin assay. We found that binding of either AKAP15LZM towtCaV1.1 ABD or wtAKAP15 to CaV1.1 ABDLZM was significantly diminished (Fig. 5C, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, co-expression of AKAP15LZM with CaV1.1 ABDLZM completely eliminated binding (Fig. 5C, upper panel, lane 4). Immunoblotting of cell lysates with RII-biotin or an anti-Myc antibody demonstrated robust expression of AKAP15 and the NAc-CT constructs, respectively (Fig. 5C, lower panels). Failure of AKAP15LZM to co-immunoprecipitate the CaV1.1 ABDLZM was not due to disruption in the α-helical structure of the protein because RII retained its ability to bind the amphipathic helix of AKAP15LZM (Fig. 5C,lower left panel). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the LZ motif of AKAP15 (residues 38–54; AKAP15LZ(38–54)) was generated and used in peptide competition co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Lysates of tsA-201 cells co-expressing wtAKAP15 and the CaV1.1 ABD were first incubated either in the presence or absence of the AKAP15LZ(38–54) peptide, immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody or non-immune IgG, and the immunoprecipitated AKAP15 protein was detected with the anti-AP1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5D, pre-incubation of cell lysates with the AKAP15LZ(38–54) peptide abolished co-immunoprecipitation of AKAP15 with the CaV1.1 ABD. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that AKAP15 and the CaV1.1 ABD specifically interact via their LZ-like motifs. Previous studies (4Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Potentiation induced by a 200-ms conditioning prepulse to +100 mV was measured by comparing the amplitude of barium currents (IBa) elicited by test pulses to variable voltages before and after the conditioning prepulse (Fig.6A).

Previous studies have shown that Pak1/2 is implicated in both Ras-dependent and -independent activation of Raf-1 by phosphorylating Raf Ser338. The present study explores the structural basis of Raf-1 phosphorylation by Pak1. We found that Pak directly associates with Raf-1 under both physiological and overexpressed conditions. The association is greatly stimulated by 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and nocodazole and by expression of the active mutants of Rac and Ras. The active forms of Pak generated by mutation of Thr423 to Glu or truncation of the amino-terminal moiety exhibit a greater binding to Raf than the wild type, whereas the kinase-dead mutant Pak barely binds Raf. The extent of binding to Raf-1 is correlated with the ability of Pak to phosphorylate Raf and induce mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Furthermore, the Raf-1 binding site is defined to the carboxyl terminus of the Pak catalytic domain. In addition, our results suggest that the amino-terminal regulatory region of Raf inhibits the interaction.

This molecular switch is mainly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor that catalyzes an exchange of GDP for GTP and by GTPase-activating protein that activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and thus converts Ras-GTP to GDP. Loss of GTPase activity due to mutations of Ras, frequently found in human cancers, contributes to cell transformation, tumor malignancy and metastasis (2Bos J.L.

Raf is activated at the plasma membrane through binding to the membrane-associated Ras-GTP and by additional modifications such as phosphorylation. The active Raf then triggers sequential activation of MEK1 and MAPK. The activated MAPK in turn phosphorylates a variety of intracellular substrates including such transcription factors as Myc, AP1, and Elk1, necessary for cell growth. On many occasions, Ras signals diverge to the Rho GTPase family, which elicits cytoskeletal changes also required for cell growth (10Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) have elaborated distinct roles of two residues in the Ras effector domain critical for the activation of Raf and Rac. Mutating either of them causes loss of Ras ability to induce DNA synthesis. Mutation of one interferes with Ras activation of Raf, and mutation of the other abolishes Ras induction of membrane ruffling. The full function of Ras can be restored by introducing both mutants into cells. Furthermore, active mutants of Raf and Rac cooperate to induce transformation of fibroblast cells (10Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The p21-activated kinases (Paks), mammalian homologues of Ste20-like Ser/Thr protein kinases, are direct targets of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases (13Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The Pak family consists of at least six members (Pak1 to 6), among which Pak1 to 3 are well characterized (13Knaus U.G.

Members of the Pak family have been implicated in a variety of intracellular signaling events, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, stress response, production of oxidative species, cell adhesion, and motility. These regulatory processes are accomplished mostly through kinase-dependent but some through kinase-independent mechanisms. Pak is composed of an amino-terminal regulatory region and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. The amino-terminal moiety of Pak1 to 3 inhibits the catalytic domain by direct interaction. Activation of Pak requires binding of GTP-bound Cdc42 or Rac to the amino-terminal p21-binding domain (PBD) so as to disrupt the inhibitory interaction between the amino-terminal domain and the kinase domain. As a result, Pak undergoes autophosphorylation to secure an active conformation (16Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Pak1 and 2 have also been shown to be necessary for the activation of Raf-1 by V12Ras (24King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S.

We have recently linked Pak to a signal originating in changes in microtubule dynamics by showing that nocodazole activates Pak and consequently causes Raf Ser338 phosphorylation and activation (27Zang M.

Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34728-34737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has also positioned Rac/Cdc42 and Pak in the V12Ras-induced Raf activation pathway. Although an increasing number of studies support that Rac/Cdc42-regulated Pak phosphorylates Raf Ser338 during Raf activation, a recent report does not agree with this notion (29Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further clarify whether Pak is a physiological kinase phosphorylating Raf, the present study attempts to examine the direct interaction between Raf and Pak. Here, we show that Raf-1 interacts with Pak1 under both physiological and overexpressed conditions. The association is closely related to the activation state of Pak1, since it is significantly stimulated by such agents as 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and nocodazole and overexpression of active mutants of Rac (V12Rac) and Ras (V12Ras). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of Pak1 showed much stronger binding to Raf than the full-length Pak1, whereas the kinase-dead mutant Pak hardly bound to Raf-1. Furthermore, the binding site for Raf-1 was mapped to the carboxyl kinase domain of Pak1. Nocodazole and TPA, and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) were purchased from Sigma. GSH-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies against Raf-1 (E10) and GST (B14); polyclonal antibodies against Raf-1 (C12), Pak1(N20) and MEKK1(C22); Raf-1 (E10) and Pak1 blocking peptides; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies; and protein A/G-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat monoclonal antibody against Raf phospho-Ser338 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies against MAPK (Erk1/2) and phospho-MAPK (Erk1/2) were from Cell Signaling. Anti-Myc (9E10) antibody was used as previously described (27Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A.

Pak cDNAs for wild type, active mutant (T423E), and kinase-dead (K299A) were inserted into pEBG or pCDNA3 in which a Myc epitope was engineered at the amino terminus of Pak1.

For deletion mutations of Pak1, pairs of primers were synthesized, and cDNAs for Pak variants were amplified by polymerase chain re- action with Pfu polymerase and inserted into pEBG or pCDNA3.1Myc (for ΔC and ΔN only). The primers are as follows: ΔC (aa 1–247), up: 5′-AGCTTTGAATTC(EcoRI) ATGTCAAATAACGGCCTAGAC-3′, down: 5′-AGCTCTCGAGCGGCCGC(NotI)TATTTAGGCTTCTTCTTCTGCTT-3′; ΔN (aa 248–545), up: 5′-AGCTTTGGATCC(BamHI)ATGTCTGATGAGGAGATCTTG-3′, down: 5′-AGCTCTCGAGCGGCCGCTTTTAGTGATTGTTCTTTGTTGCC-3′; P1 (aa 347–545), up: 5′-AGCTTTGGATCCTTGGCTGGAGGCTCCTTGACA-3′, down: same as ΔN; P2 (aa 464–545), up: 5′-AGCTTTGGATCCCTCAATGAAAACCCTCTGAGA-3′, down: same as ΔN; P3 (aa 248–346), up: same as ΔN, down: 5′-AGCTCTCGAGCGGCCGCTAGTATTCCATAACAACCCACAG-3′; P4 (aa 248–463), up: same as ΔN, down: 5′-AGCTCTCGAGCGGCCGCTAGTATGGAGGCTCCCCTTCAAT-3′. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293T) or COS7 cells as indicated were used in this study. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A day before transfection, 293T cells were split onto 100-mm plates to allow them to reach 50–70% confluence the next day and transfected with plasmid cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (27Zang M.

COS7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 16–20 h and treated with or without TPA or nocadazole, as indicated in the figure legends (Fig.3A, 5B).Figure 5Raf binding site is located in the carboxyl kinase domain of Pak1.

The complexes were purified with GSH-Sepharose beads after cell treatment with TPA as described in Fig.3A. Immunoblotting of Myc-Pak, GST-Raf, and GST proteins was performed after or before purification. These results were reproduced twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentrations using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates containing recombinant proteins were incubated with specific antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for kinase assay. For purification of recombinant GST fusion proteins, GSH-Sepharose was incubated with lysates and washed as immunoprecipitation. The precipitates were then analyzed by Western blot. For Western blotting, proteins from 10–50 μg of cell extracts were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) in a transfer buffer consisting of 154 mmglycine, 20 mm Tris, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked and incubated with specific antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. For endogenous proteins, 1 mg of HEK293T cell extracts was immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 μg of anti-Pak1 antibody preimmobilized to protein A/G-agarose beads in the presence of 2 μg of Pak blocking peptide if necessary and washed five times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%) using the Bio-Rad minigel system (1-mm thickness) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 mA for 1 h. The membranes were then blotted overnight with Raf-1 E10 antibody (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml of Raf blocking peptide, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and developed by chemiluminescent method. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed in the same way. For in vitro binding, Pak1 was expressed in HEK293T cells, purified with GSH beads, and incubated with purified baculovirally expressed recombinant Raf-1 at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound Raf was then washed out, and the retained Raf was blotted with anti-Raf (C12) antibody. Recombinant GST-Pak1 (full-length) and the carboxyl kinase domain were prepared as described above. Raf-1 tagged by GST at the amino terminus and six histidines at the carboxyl terminus was expressed in JM 109 cells and purified by sequentially passing GSH and Ni2+ NTA-agarose columns (Qiagen). Phosphorylation of Raf was conducted by incubation of GST-Pak1 recombinant proteins (full-length or the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain) with Raf-1 in the kinase buffer containing 0.1 mmATP and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Ser338antibody. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that Pak links Ras and Rac signaling avenues by phosphorylating Raf and MEK1 (21Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell.

To understand the mechanism by which Pak participates in regulation of Raf, the present study attempted to investigate the structural basis of Raf phosphorylation by Pak by examining whether there is a physical association between these two proteins. In the first study, endogenous Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells, and co-purification of Raf-1 was examined by an anti-Raf-1 blot. As shown in Fig.1A, Raf specifically bound to Pak1 (lane 1), as the Raf signal was diminished by adding specific peptides used for production of antibodies, either the Pak1 peptide during immunoprecipitation (lane 2) or the Raf peptide during immunoblotting of the associated Raf-1 (lane 3). Conversely, Pak1 was also found in the Raf immunoprecipitates (data not shown). In the second experiment (Fig. 1B), Pak1 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells as a GST fusion protein and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. When the precipitates were subjected to Western blot, endogenous Raf was found in the Pak1 precipitates. In contrast, MEKK1, which is parallel to Raf-1 in a different MAPK signaling cascade, was not detected. Next, we expressed both recombinant Pak and Raf and assessed the strength of association. In this experiment, GST-Pak1 was transiently expressed with Myc-Raf-1, and the recombinant proteins were purified with GSH beads or by immunoprecipitation and visualized by reciprocal blotting with antibodies against Myc or GST. Fig.2A shows that the association of Pak with Raf increased with increasing doses of Pak1 cDNA. Fig.2B reveals strong interaction between Pak and Raf-1, which withstood high salt washing. To determine whether Pak1 directly associates with Raf, an in vitro binding assay was conducted. Thus, GST-Pak1 was expressed in HEK293T cells, precipitated with GSH beads, and incubated with baculoviral expressed recombinant Raf-1. The association was then assessed with anti-Raf-1 blot. As shown in Fig. 2C, some endogenous Raf copurified with GST-Pak1, and the signal was increased about twice as much by the addition of recombinant Raf-1. The affinity appeared to be low, yet specific, since under the same conditions it was obviously lower than that of 14-3-3, a well known binding partner, and none bound GST. The low affinity of binding may reflect nature of the kinase-substrate relationship and could also be attributed to their inactive conformations, as both Raf and Pak were inactive wild type in this assay. Therefore, all of these results demonstrate that Pak1 directly associates with Raf-1. The crystal structure of Pak suggests that inactive Pak folds into a closed structure through the interaction between the autoinhibitory domain and the catalytic domain (30Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Active Rac or Cdc42 binds to Pak PBD, which overlaps the autoinhibitory domain, leading to derepression of the catalytic domain and changes in conformation so that Pak is available for its substrates. Hence, it is possible that active Pak has stronger interaction with Raf-1 than inactive Pak. To test this, Myc-Pak1 was co-transfected with GST-Raf-1 into HEK293T cells, and the cells were treated with either TPA or nocodazole. As shown in Fig.3A, the recovery of Pak1 by Raf-1 was greatly stimulated by both agents. Additionally, when Pak1 and Raf-1 were co-expressed in the presence of an active mutant of Rac (V12), the association was also notably enhanced. A similar result was obtained in an experiment with co-expression of a constitutively active mutant of Ras (V12 KiRas) in which Raf/Ras interaction was not apparently altered by Pak1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results indicate that the interaction between Pak1 and Raf-1 depends on their active conformations. To further evaluate the preference of active Pak1 in binding to Raf-1, we employed Pak1 mutants, active or kinase-deficient, as compared with the wild type Pak1. In the first set of assays, GST-Pak1 (wild type, active mutant (T423E), or kinase-dead mutant (K299A)) was co-expressed with or without Myc-Raf-1. When the GST-Pak1 complex was pulled down by GSH beads and blotted with anti-Raf antibody, the active mutant of Pak exhibited a binding to Raf-1 greater than that of the wild type, whereas the binding was barely detectable with the kinase-dead mutant. The same result was obtained with immunoprecipitation of endogenous Raf when single transfection of Pak variants, active or kinase-dead mutant, was performed. As shown in Fig.4B, the strongest binding was observed with the active mutant of Pak1, with the wild type showing some binding and the kinase-dead mutant showing no binding. To further ascertain that the binding is specific, another version of Raf tagged by the FLAG epitope was used along with Myc-tagged Pak1, and the recombinant proteins were reciprocally immunoprecipitated and blotted. The results revealed that wild type Pak1 bound to Raf-1, whereas the kinase-dead mutant had no binding (middle part) or remarkably low binding (upper part) (Fig.4C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the active conformation of Pak is important for binding to its substrate Raf-1. Fig. 5A depicts the structure of Pak1. To determine where the Raf binding domain resides on Pak1, we initially engineered constructs encoding the amino-terminal regulatory region (ΔC, aa 1–247) and the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (ΔN, aa 248–545) and expressed them in HEK293T cells. We noticed that although the carboxyl terminus contains 51 more amino acids than the amino terminus, the migration of the amino terminus on SDS-PAGE appeared to be slower than we predicted (Fig. 5B). This could be due to differences in structure (e.g. there are four proline-rich domains in the amino terminus) or post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. When full-length Pak, the amino-terminal portion and the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of Pak were each co-expressed with GST-Raf, both full-length Pak1 and the kinase domain of Pak1 bound to GST-Raf, and the binding was again intensified by TPA treatment of cells, whereas the amino terminus did not show any detectable binding. Thus, the result demonstrates that the Raf binding site is encompassed within the kinase domain of Pak1. To define the Raf binding domain further, a series of truncations of the kinase domain were made by polymerase chain reaction as indicated in Fig. 6A. The PCR products were inserted into pEBG plasmid, as done with the wild type Pak1. Fig.6B shows that the full-length Pak1 kinase domain (ΔN, aa 248–545), P1 (aa 347–545), and P2 (aa 464–545) each bound to Raf-1. Next, we tested another set of mutations in which deletions were made from the carboxyl terminus. The result showed that the Raf binding site was contained within the sequence (residues 347–545) that bears a conserved substrate binding site (VIb–IX, aa 387–459) (Fig.6C) (30Lei M. Lu W. Meng W.

These enzymes provide the acyclic branch point intermediates for the biosynthesis of numerous terpenoids, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes, and polyterpenes such as natural rubber. GGPP synthase and FPP synthase occur nearly ubiquitously in plants, animals, and bacteria (1Ogura K. Koyama T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). GPP synthase appears to be of much more limited distribution in nature, having been identified most frequently in essential oil (monoterpene)-producing plants (2Wise M.L. Croteau R. Cane D.E. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry: Isoprenoids Including Carotenoids and Steroids. 2. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford, UK1999: 97-153Google Scholar). Most isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, including the short-chain prenyltransferases, catalyze the divalent metal ion-dependent 1′-4 condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) with an allylic prenyl diphosphate cosubstrate (3Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 1.

Thus, GPP synthase catalyzes a single condensation of IPP with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to form, specifically, GPP (C10). FPP synthase and GGPP synthase catalyze sequential condensations of IPP with an allylic primer (i.e. DMAPP, GPP, or FPP, as appropriate) to form the respective C15 and C20elongation products.

(Tokyo). 1999; 126: 556-571Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A random chemical mutagenesis approach has also provided an altered FPP synthase capable of producing GGPP (11Ohnuma S. Nakazawa T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10087-10095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and has yielded homodimeric GGPP synthase mutants capable of producing FPP (5Ohnuma S. Hemmi H. Ohto C. Nakane H. Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and polyprenols greater than C20 (12Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Hemmi H. Ishida C. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18831-18837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This work eventually led to the direct mutagenesis of an archaeal GGPP synthase so as to produce FPP by the modified enzyme (13Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5192-5198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These experiments clearly indicate that amino acid substitutions to alter the contour of the active site may either restrict or allow sequential elongation of the polyprenyl chain. cDNAs encoding the large and small subunits of GPP synthase were isolated from a peppermint (Mentha piperita) oil gland library and were confirmed by functional coexpression of the heteromeric enzyme (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, GPP synthase, in which both subunits are absolutely required for prenyltransferase activity, is unlike both FPP synthases and GGPP synthases that are functional homodimers (1Ogura K. Koyama T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The GPP synthase large subunit (GPPS.lsu) shows a high level of deduced amino acid sequence identity (56–75%) with GGPP synthases of plant origin and a lower level of deduced amino acid identity (21–37%) with FPP synthases of plant origin. The large subunit sequence also contains two highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs found in other prenyltransferases (Fig. 2). Numerous lines of evidence have indicated these aspartate-rich clusters to be involved in substrate binding and product determination (15Marrero P.F. Poulter C.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21873-21878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Song L. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) by forming a salt bridge to the divalent metal ions that are coordinated to the diphosphate group of the reacting ester (8Tarshis L.C. Proteau P.J. Kellogg B.A. Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These aspartate-rich domains are noticeably absent in the GPP synthase small subunit (GPPS.ssu), which shares only 24–29% deduced amino acid sequence identity with plant GGPP synthases and shows no significant homology with FPP synthases. Because the small subunit lacks the aspartate-rich functional motifs and is alone inactive, it was hypothesized that the small subunit may bind to and modify the otherwise inactive large subunit to promote transfer catalysis while restricting chain length elongation specifically to the C10product. If the GPPS.ssu plays such a role, then it also seemed possible that the small subunit might be capable of influencing the chain length specificity of other types of prenyltransferases. To test this possibility, a His8-tagged version of the small subunit (GPPS.ssu.his) was coexpressed in Escherichia coliwith FPP synthase or GGPP synthase to permit affinity-based purification of any resulting chimeric species. Product analysis and kinetic evaluation of the resulting hybrid heterodimers, and comparison to the parent homodimeric transferases, demonstrated that the GPPS small subunit modifies the specificity of GGPP synthase by promoting the kinetically competent production of C10 chains. [4-14C]IPP (54 Ci/mol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled IPP, DMAPP, GPP, and FPP were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). Authentic terpenol standards were from our own collection. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 ligase, PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, and CodonPlusE. coli competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Synthesis of oligonucleotide primers was performed by Invitrogen. pET vectors were from Novagen. Alkaline phosphatase, apyrase, and protein molecular weight standards were purchased from Sigma. Standard molecular biology protocols were followed (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using molecular weights and extinction coefficients calculated from the PeptideSort program (18Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 10.0. Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI1998Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (20Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Antibody preparation and immunoblotting protocols were described earlier (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), as were radio-gas chromatography methods (21Tholl D. Croteau R. Gershenzon J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A truncated version of the GPP synthase small subunit (designated GPPS.ssu), in which the plastidial transit peptide was deleted, was prepared from the original pSBET13.18 cDNA clone (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) for transfer into pET-37b using forward primer (5′-CC GCC GCC CAT ATG CAG CCG-3′) to create an NdeI site and code for a starting methionine (in place of amino acid Ser-48 of the original protein) and reverse primer (5′-G GAT CCG AAT AAG CTT CTA AGC CG-3′) to generate a HindIII restriction site downstream of the stop codon. The resulting amplicon was digested with NdeI and HindIII, gel-purified, and directionally ligated into theNdeI/HindIII-digested pET-37b vector to yield pETGPPS.ssu. Mutation of the stop codon, to permit translation through the carboxyl-terminal His8-tag provided on the pET-37b vector, was accomplished by PCR amplification using pETGPPS.ssu as template and forward primer (5′-GGA GAT ATA CAT ATG CAG CCG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CC CGC AAG CTT CCC AGC CGC G-3′), thereby resulting in a lysine substitution for the stop codon six residues from the His8-tag. The resulting amplicon (designated GPPS.ssu.his) was digested and gel-purified as before and directionally ligated into pET-37b that had been digested with NdeI andHindIII. A similarly truncated version of the GPP synthase large subunit was prepared from the original pMp23.10 cDNA clone (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using forward primer (5′-GCG CCT TCG ACT TCG CAT ATG TTC GAT TTC GAC GG-3′) to create an NdeI site and code for a starting methionine (in place of amino acid Ala-83 of the original protein) and reverse primer (5′-CAC TAT AGG GCG AAT TGG GAT CCG GGC CCC CCC TCG AG-3′) to convert the downstream KpnI site (GGTACC) in the original pBluescript SK− version (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) into a BamHI site (GGATCC). The amplified sequence (designated GPPS.lsu) was digested withNdeI and BamHI, and the gel-purified fragment was ligated into pET-32a that had been similarly digested to yield pETGPPS.lsu. A truncated version of the Taxus canadensis GGPP synthase, from which the amino-terminal plastid targeting peptide was also deleted, was prepared from the original full-length cDNA clone (22Hefner J. Ketchum R.E.B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using forward primer (5′-CC CGA AGA CAT ATG TTT GAT TTC AAC G-3′), to install an NdeI site and thus mutate Glu-98 to Met-1, and reverse primer (5′-CTA GCC CGG TCG ACC TCA GTT TTG CCT GAA TGC-3′), to create a SalI restriction site downstream of the stop codon. The amplified sequence (designated GGPPS) was digested withNdeI and SalI, gel-purified, and ligated into the pET-32c vector that had been identically digested to yield pETGGPPS. A truncated version of the Abies grandis GGPP synthase was similarly prepared. An FPP synthase cDNA clone was prepared from a full-length sequence located in a peppermint (M. piperita) oil gland expressed sequence tag library (23Lange B.M. Wildung R.M. Stauber J.E. Sanchez C. Pouchnik D. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 97: 2934-2939Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar) using primer (5′-GGG TGA TTA CAT ATG GCG AAT C-3′) to create an NdeI restriction site at the starting methionine and reverse primer (5′-GTA TTT CAA AGC TCG AGT TTA TTT CTG C-3′) to create an XhoI site downstream of the stop codon. The resulting amplicon was digested with NdeI andXhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into similarly digested pET-32b to yield pETFPPS. Cotransformations with two plasmids (e.g. both GPP synthase subunits and pETGPPS.ssu.his with pETFPPS or pETGGPPS) were performed in a single transformation event. Positive transformants were screened for multiple resistance with kanamycin (pETGPPS.ssu and pETGPPS.ssu.his), carbenicillin (pETGPPS.lsu, pETGGPPS, and pETFPPS), and chloramphenicol (conferred by the pACYC-based plasmid of the BL21-Codon Plus host cells that also contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, andleuW tRNA genes). Transformants were initially grown in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani medium and then transferred to 1 liter of the same medium and grown at 20 °C until A600 reached 0.6. The temperature of the culture was then lowered to 15 °C prior to induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for an additional 16 h. Following induction and incubation, the transformed cells were pelleted by centrifugation (20 min at 2500 × g) and resuspended in either 20 ml of buffer A (see buffer description below) or in 10 ml of His-tagged lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm histidine). The suspended cells were disrupted by brief sonication (VirSonic, 100% power, two 30-s bursts at 4 °C), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g (30 min) to pellet debris and then at 195,000 × g (1.5 h) to provide the soluble enzyme fraction that was filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (Nalgene, 0.2 μm). Crude recombinant GPP synthase was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using an HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) containing Poros PI anion-exchange medium (PerSeptive Biosystems) that was previously equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Mopso (pH 7.2), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT and 1 mm benzamidine) and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient (0–50%) with buffer B (buffer A containing 2m NaCl). Recombinant GPP synthase eluted at 200–300 mm NaCl, and the pooled fractions were adjusted to 2m NaCl and applied to an HR 10/10 column containing phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer B and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient (0–100%) to buffer A. GPP synthase eluted in fractions containing less than 500 mm NaCl, and the combined material was desalted on Econo-Pac10DG Columns (Bio-Rad) and applied to an HR 5/5 column containing a strong anion-exchange matrix (Source 15, Amersham Biosciences) that was previously equilibrated with buffer A. A 30-ml linear gradient (0–50% buffer B) eluted recombinant GPP synthase at 250–270 mm NaCl to provide the protein at >90% purity as determined by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant GPPS.ssu, GGPP synthase, and FPP synthase were similarly purified. For metal ion-affinity chromatography of the His8-tag recombinant proteins, the initial extracts (10 ml; ∼150 mg of protein) were combined with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen), mixed on a rotary shaker for 1 h at 4 °C, and then poured into a 10-ml Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) to gravity drain. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix was then washed with 16 column volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mmhistidine, followed by elution with 2 ml of the same buffer containing 250 mm histidine. The protein fraction eluted with 250 mm histidine was desalted (Bio-Rad Econo-Pac10DG) into buffer A, loaded onto a HR 5/5 column containing Source 15 strong anion-exchange matrix that was equilibrated with buffer A, and then eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient (0–50%) of buffer B. For size exclusion chromatography, 200 μg of purified enzyme was loaded onto a calibrated XK 16/70 column of Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted (at 0.3 ml/min while monitoring at A280) with 25 mm Mopso buffer (pH 6.7) containing 10% v/v glycerol, 1% ethylene glycol, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 4 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with electronic speed control and photoelectronic scanning. GPP synthase (purity >90%) in 25 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2 was loaded into a 12-mm double-sector cell containing 3-mm columns, and molecular weight was determined from the average of scans at three different velocities and three radii using two enzyme concentrations, by calculation in SEDNTERP (24Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) using sigma (ς >95% confidence level, determined using NONLIN (25Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorsen H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar)) and a partial specific volume (0.7427 ml/g determined from amino acid sequence) calculated in SEDNTERP (24Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Assays used to determine steady-state kinetic constants and to evaluate product chain length distribution were based on the acid-lability procedure (26Holloway P.W. Popjack G. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Lynen F. Agranoff B.W. Eggerer H. Henning U. Moslein E.M. Angew. Chem. 1959; 71: 657Crossref Google Scholar) in which the product allylic diphosphates are solvolyzed to mixtures of the corresponding cis, trans, and tertiary allylic alcohols that are partitioned from the remaining unincorporated (acid-stable) IPP by hexane extraction. For kinetic assays, 50–200 nmol of enzyme was combined with 100 mm Mopso (pH 6.7) containing the appropriate amounts of MgCl2, [4-14C]IPP, and the allylic cosubstrate (DMAPP, GPP, or FPP) in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 2 min, and the linear reaction was then quenched with 100 μl of a 9:1 (v/v) methanol:3 nHCl solution. The acidified mixture was then overlaid with 1 ml of hexane, shaken for 10 min to allow completion of solvolysis, and then centrifuged briefly to separate the aqueous layer from the hexane layer (containing allylic alcohols), an aliquot of which was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic data were evaluated using Enzyme Kinetics software (Trinity Software) and the Hanes-Woolf algorithms. Reported values for substrate KM are the means of three experiments; the reported KM values for MgCl2 are the means of two experiments. Preparative assays used for product analysis were similar to those described above with the exceptions that 400 ng of protein was employed at saturating substrate concentrations, and the reaction time was extended to 10 min followed by the addition of 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.5) containing 10 units each of bovine alkaline phosphatase and potato apyrase to hydrolyze the diphosphate esters. The reaction mixture was overlaid with pentane and allowed to incubate for 3 h at 31 °C, after which the contents were vigorously mixed and centrifuged to separate phases. The extraction procedure was repeated twice with 1-ml portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic extract was dried over Na2SO4, diluted with internal standards, and concentrated under N2 (to 20 μl) for radio-gas chromatographic analysis. Unlike other short-chain prenyltransferases that are homodimers (1Ogura K. Koyama T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), GPP synthase is composed of two subunits, a large subunit (GPPS.lsu) that resembles GGPPS (but when expressed alone is inactive in prenyltransfer catalysis) and a small, similarly inactive, subunit (GPPS.ssu) that does not closely resemble any known prenyltransferase but appears to confer function and chain length specificity in the subunit interaction (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To investigate whether GPPS.ssu could interact with other prenyltransferases (FPPS and GGPPS) to influence chain length distribution of the prenyl diphosphate products, it was first necessary to develop suitable expression systems and purification methods for characterizing the target proteins. Heterologous expression in E. coli of functional GPPS had been demonstrated previously (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), yet the amount of soluble recombinant protein produced was low due to the propensity to form inclusion bodies. Both GPPS (28McConkey M. Gershenzon J. Croteau R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Soler E. Feron G. Claster M. Dargent R. Gleizes M. Ambid C. Planta. 1992; 187: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and GGPPS (30Kuntz M. Römer S. Suire C. Hugueney P. Weil J.H. Schantz R. Camara B. Plant J. 1992; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar, 31Okada K. Saito T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Kamiya Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) of plant origin have been localized to plastids. Thus, these nuclear gene products are expected to be translated as preproteins bearing an amino-terminal plastidial transit peptide for directing organellar import and subsequent proteolytic processing to the mature form (32Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Crossref Google Scholar, 33Schnell D.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 97-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both GPPS.ssu and GPPS.lsu appear to be translated as such preproteins based on the comparison of the deduced amino-terminal sequences (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to those of other transit peptides (34von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Previous studies with other plastidial enzymes, including monoterpene and diterpene synthases (35Williams D.C. McGarvey D.J. Katahira E.J. Croteau R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12213-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 36Williams D.C. Wildung M.R. Jin A.Q. Dalal D. Oliver J.S. Coates R.M. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and GGPPS (22Hefner J. Ketchum R.E.B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), have demonstrated higher levels of heterologous expression of soluble, more readily purified proteins when truncated to resemble the mature forms. Therefore, both the GPPS small and large subunits were truncated for expression from the pET vector. The truncation sites selected (Fig. 2) yielded proteins of a size consistent with the molecular weights of the native subunits previously determined by SDS-PAGE (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Coexpression in E. coli of the truncated versions (pETGPPS.ssu and pETGPPS.lsu) demonstrated substantially improved expression over the previously employed preprotein forms and a higher net yield of recombinant enzyme when both subunits were expressed simultaneously (data not shown). Purification of the recombinant GPPS (from coexpressed pETGPPS.ssu and pETGPPS.lsu) by the procedure described yielded greater than 5 mg of protein (>90% purity) per liter of culture, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). Polyclonal antibodies raised against the mature subunit versions of GPPS (14Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) readily detected the corresponding truncated subunit versions of the enzyme in these preparations, at a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 4,B and C). Radio-gas chromatographic analysis of the enzymatically dephosphorylated reaction products confirmed that the recombinant, truncated GPPS produced exclusively geranyl diphosphate (Fig. 5B).Figure 4Immunoblot analyses of purified prenyltransferases.

To understand the significance of cytokine expression by enterocytes, enterocyte transgenic mice that overexpressed the eosinophil-selective cytokines eotaxin and interleukin (IL)-5 were generated. Transgenic mice, generated by utilizing the rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein promoter (Fabpi), overexpressed the mRNA for these cytokines in the small intestine. Overexpression of IL-5 resulted in marked increases of eosinophils in the bone marrow and blood, whereas eotaxin overexpression resulted in similar levels compared with nontransgenic control mice. In contrast, both IL-5 and eotaxin transgenic mice had significant accumulation of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal mucosa compared with control mice. Eotaxin-induced gastrointestinal eosinophilia was substantially higher than that induced by IL-5 and was especially prominent within the lamina propria of the villi. Interestingly, genetic rescue of eotaxin deficiency (by transgenic overexpression of eotaxin in eotaxin gene-targeted mice) resulted in significant restoration of gastrointestinal eosinophil levels. Finally, the intestinal eosinophilia induced by the eotaxin transgene was β7 integrin-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that expression of eotaxin and IL-5 in intestinal epithelium induces compartmentalized dysregulation of eosinophil trafficking and the important role of the β7 integrin in gastrointestinal allergic responses.

These studies have revealed that eosinophils normally reside in the lamina propria of the stomach and intestine and that their base-line level is regulated by eotaxin, an eosinophil-selective chemokine (4Matthews A.N. Friend D.S. Zimmermann N. Sarafi M.N. Luster A.D. Pearlman E. Wert S.E. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 5Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Lee J.J. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the constitutive expression of eotaxin is not sufficient for tissue eosinophil trafficking, because some gastrointestinal segments (such as the tongue and esophagus) express eotaxin but are normally devoid of eosinophils and eotaxin-lung transgenic mice do no have elevated levels of pulmonary eosinophils (5Mishra A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8453-8459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This may be explained in part by the cooperation of eotaxin with the eosinophilopoietin interleukin (IL)1-5, a cytokine that promotes eosinophil growth, development, survival, and responsiveness to chemoattractants (7Collins P.D.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of IL-5 are present in biopsy specimens from patients with food allergy and eosinophilic gastroenteritis (9Vandezande L.M. Wallaert B. Desreumaux P. Tsicopoulos A. Lamblin C.

Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 768-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis have shown that eosinophils overproduce their own growth and activation factors (e.g.IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor), suggesting an aggressive autocrine pathway (10Desreumaux P.

In addition, elevated levels of eotaxin mRNA are present in the intestinal lesions of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (12Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Rothenberg M.E. Ownbey R.T. Celestin J. Leder P. Luster A.D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Mice overexpressing IL-5 in T cells (CD2 transgenic mice) have increased levels of eotaxin-dependent eosinophils throughout the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract (5Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Lee J.J. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-5 and eotaxin regulate distinct steps in an experimental model of oral antigen-induced eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammation; IL-5 primarily affects the circulating level of eosinophils, whereas eotaxin has a dominant role in regulating allergen-induced eosinophil accumulation and pathology in gastrointestinal tissue (13Hogan S.P. Mishra A. Brandt E.B. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6681-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Hogan S.P. Mishra A. Brandt E.B. Royalty M.P. Pope S.M. Zimmermann N. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced eosinophil recruitment into mucosal tissues is finely regulated by the coordinated interaction between eosinophil adhesion molecules (e.g. selectins and integrins) and their counter-receptors on endothelial cells (15Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). In particular, eosinophils express members of the β1 (e.g.very late antigen (VLA)-4), β2 (e.g. CD18 family of molecules), and β7 (e.g.α4β7 molecule) integrin families (17Bochner B.S. Schleimer R.P. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The CD18 family of molecules expressed by eosinophils includes lymphocyte function antigen-1 and Mac-1 that both interact with endothelial cells via intracellular adhesion molecule-1, whereas the VLA-4 integrin binds to the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Eosinophil recruitment into the lung and skin has been shown to be β1 and β2 integrin-dependent, but the role of β7 integrins in eosinophil recruitment has not yet been evaluated (13Hogan S.P.

The α4β7 molecule, which is co-expressed by lymphocytes and eosinophils, may be the most important integrin for eosinophil recruitment into the gastrointestinal tract (21Hamann A. Andrew D.P. Jablonski-Westrich D. Holzmann B. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3282-3293PubMed Google Scholar, 22Simon H.U. Allergy. 2000; 55: 791-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This integrin binds to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM)-1, a major adhesion molecule expressed on high endothelial venules in the intestinal lamina propria, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches, sites where eosinophils and lymphocytes co-reside (2Rothenberg M.E. Mishra A. Brandt E.B. Hogan S.P. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,23Erle D.J. Briskin M.J. Butcher E.C. Garcia-Pardo A. Lazarovits A.I. Tidswell M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 517-528PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, extensive studies focused on inhibiting the β7/MAdCAM interaction with neutralizing antibodies or with β7-deficient mice have supported a central role for this pathway in regulating lymphocyte homing into the intestine (24Shaw S.K. Brenner M.B. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The findings that eotaxin-induced eosinophil recruitment to the lung and eotaxin-mediated chemoattraction in vitro are dependent upon VLA-4 (α4β1) (25Kitayama J. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Puri K.D. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3929-3939PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Lloyd C. Gonzalo J.A. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 500-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggest that the other α4-associated integrins on eosinophils (e.g. α4β7) may also be involved in eotaxin-mediated events. Consistent with this, a recent report has demonstrated delayed intestinal hypersensitivity (including lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltrations) in response to intestinal infection withTrichinella spiralis in β7-deficient animals; however, the specific role of β7 integrins on eosinophils was not examined (27Artis D. Humphreys N.E. Potten C.S. Wagner N. Muller W. McDermott J.R. Grencis R.K. Else K.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, we were interested in testing the consequences of overexpressing eotaxin and/or IL-5 specifically in the intestine. To examine this, we took a transgenic approach utilizing the intestine-specific promoter of the rat fatty acid-binding protein (Fabpi) gene (28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Cohn S.M. Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This promoter has been extensively used to direct the expression of genes specifically in enterocytes of the small intestine (28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Cohn S.M. Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Importantly, enterocytes have been shown to express diverse chemokines (e.g. ENA-78 (epithelial cell-derived neutrophil activating protein-78 or CXCL5), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), and interleukin-8 (CXCL8) under healthy conditions and in lesions from patients with inflammatory diseases (30van Deventer S.J. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 11: 116-121PubMed Google Scholar, 31Keates S. Keates A.C. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A. Kelly C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G75-G82PubMed Google Scholar, 32MacDermott R.P. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge,Fabpi-regulated chemokine transgenic mice have not been reported. Employing an Fabpi transgenic construct, we demonstrate that overexpression of eotaxin or IL-5 discretely affects eosinophil trafficking in hematopoietic and intestinal tissues. Furthermore, we report (by a genetic rescue approach) that ectopic expression of eotaxin is able to resolve the eosinophil deficiency seen in eotaxin-deficient mice. Additionally, we demonstrate the critical dependence of eotaxin-induced gastrointestinal eosinophilia on the β7 integrin. Oligonucleotides containing BamHI sites were ligated to both ends of a 330-bp fragment containing the entire coding region of the murine eotaxin cDNA. A 415-bp fragment of the entire coding region of murine IL-5 cDNA was amplified by PCR incorporating an improved Kozak consensus sequence and BamHI restriction sites on both ends. Both cDNAs were ligated into theBamHI site of the PBSIF1178-hGHpgkNeo plasmid (28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), which contained a 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing nucleotides −1178 to +28 of rat Fabpi promoter linked to nucleotides +3 to +2150 of human growth hormone (hGH) gene (except for its 5′ regulatory sequences) as represented by Fig. 1. The transgene plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and the transgene fragment was liberated by EcoRI endonuclease digestion and purified using the QIAEX DNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). After extensive dialysis, the linearized fragment was microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice (Transgenic Core Facility, Children's Hospital Medical Center). Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analyses after restriction fragment digestion with EcoRI, using the hGH genomic fragment to ensure specificity for identification of the transgene. Mice transgenic for eotaxin (iET) were also identified by PCR using a forward primer (P1) (TCTATTCCTGCTGCTCAGGG) specific for the eotaxin cDNA in the transgenic construct (Fig. 1) and a reverse primer specific for the hGH (P2) (GTGAGCTGTCCACAGGACC) (Fig. 1); the transgenic band was ∼350 bp. Mice transgenic for IL-5 (iIL-5) were also identified by PCR using a forward primer (P3) (TTGAGTGTTCTGACTCTCAGC) specific for the IL-5 cDNA in the transgenic construct (Fig. 1), a reverse primer specific for the 3′-untranslated region of the endogenous IL-5 gene (CCTAGAGAGGTCCCCATCC), and the reverse primer specific for the hGH (P2) (Fig. 1); the wild-type and transgenic bands were 1080 and 480 bp, respectively. To estimate relative transgene copy number, Southern blot analysis was performed, using the hGH fragment as a probe, and the relative density of the transgene band was compared with the single-copy flanking band. Quantitation was performed by phosphorimaging (Storm 860; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). All mice were maintained in a barrier facility, and animals were handled under IACUC-approved protocols. There was no serologic evidence of pathogens and no evidence of bacterial or other infection in sentinel mice maintained with the colony. No serological evidence of viral infection or histological evidence of bacterial infection was detected in transgenic mice at necropsy. Mice bitransgenic for eotaxin and IL-5 were generated by mating iET and iIL-5 mice and examining the genomic DNA for the presence of both transgenes using PCR-specific techniques for each transgene. In addition, eotaxin-deficient mice expressing the Fabpi eotaxin transgene (genetically rescued mice) were generated by mating eotaxin-deficient (−/−) mice of the BALB/c background (34Rothenberg M.E. MacLean J.A. Pearlman E. Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) with iET mice and subsequently mating iET+ F1 mice with eotaxin (−/−) mice. The resulting F2 mice were screened by Southern blot analysis for the presence of the eotaxin transgene (hGH probe) and for the homozygous deficiency of the eotaxin gene (using the 1.4-kbStuI eotaxin genomic fragment) as previously described (34Rothenberg M.E. MacLean J.A. Pearlman E. Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In other experiments, β7 integrin-deficient mice that contained the iET were generated. Mice deficient in the β7 integrin (C57Bl/6) (35Wagner N. Lohler J. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. Leung E. Krissansen G. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Nature. 1996; 382: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) were mated with iET mice, transgene positive offspring were subsequently mated with β7 (−/−) mice, and mice containing the Fabpieotaxin transgene in the β7 (−/−) background were used for analysis. The β7 integrin gene locus was analyzed by PCR as described previously (35Wagner N. Lohler J. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. Leung E. Krissansen G. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Nature. 1996; 382: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Control mice were matched for chimeric backgrounds by wild-type mice derived from both original backgrounds. Segments of the gastrointestinal tract including the jejunum, colon, and stomach were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, processed using standard histological techniques, and immunostained with antiserum against mouse major basic protein (MBP), as previously described (5Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Lee J.J. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-μm sections were blocked with normal goat serum and stained with a rabbit anti-murine MBP antiserum (gift of J. and N. Lee, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). The slides were washed and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody and avidin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC Peroxidase Elite kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slides were then developed by nickel diaminobenzidine, enhanced nickel cobalt chloride to form a black precipitate, and counterstained with nuclear fast red. Quantification of immunoreactive cells was performed by morphometric analysis using the Metamorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) as described (14Hogan S.P. Mishra A. Brandt E.B. Royalty M.P. Pope S.M. Zimmermann N. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The intestinal sections were taken from the same position in each set of mice, and at least 4–5 random sections/mouse were analyzed. Using digital image capture, tissue regions associated with the entire lamina propria or with the lamina propria associated with villi only were quantified for the total MBP+ cell numbers relative to the total tissue area. Calculated eosinophil levels are expressed as cells/mm2. For bronchoalveolar fluid analysis, lavage fluid was obtained with two replicate volumes (0.8 ml) of normal saline containing 0.02 mm EDTA and analyzed for eosinophil counts as reported previously (34Rothenberg M.E. MacLean J.A. Pearlman E. Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 36Rothenberg M.E. Ownbey R. Mehlhop P.D. Loiselle P.M. Van de Rijn M. Bonventre J.V. Oettgen H.C. Leder P. Luster A.D. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 334-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow analysis was performed by irrigating each femur with 5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, using a 23-gauge needle to isolate femoral marrow leukocytes. Displaced cells were gently resuspended. Cells were then centrifuged at 400 × g at 20 °C, and erythrocytes were removed using hypotonic lysis. The cells were recentrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and counted with Neubauer hemacytometer for total cell numbers. Differential cell counts were obtained from cytocentrifuge preparations stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics of Puerto Rico, Inc., Aguada, Puerto Rico). Peripheral blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) by collecting pooled blood from the inguinal artery of anesthetized mice. Eosinophil levels were directly determined with Discombe's stain (37Discombe G. Lancet. 1946; 1: 195Abstract PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical significance comparing different sets of mice was determined by Student's t test. Enterocytes have been demonstrated to be a chief source of select chemokines (e.g. IL-8, MCP-1, ENA-78) in inflammatory lesions in patients with diverse gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders (32MacDermott R.P. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38MacDermott R.P. Sanderson I.R. Reinecker H.C. Inflamm.

We were interested in examining the consequences of expressing eosinophil-active cytokines by intestinal enterocytes. The 1.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the rat Fabpigene contains all of the necessary elements to promote specific expression of transgenes into enterocytes in the small intestine (28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,40Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16060-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We initially generated transgenic mice that utilized this promoter to direct expression of eotaxin or IL-5 in the intestine (see transgenic construct (Fig. 1)). Three different eotaxin transgenic founder lines were established (designated iET-1–3) that had ∼1, 4, and 10 copies of the transgene insert (for iET-2, iET-1, and iET-3, respectively) as assessed by Southern analysis. Northern blot analysis with an eotaxin-specific cDNA probe revealed increased expression of eotaxin in the intestinal mRNA of transgenic mice (Fig.2A). The wild-type mRNA species was detected as a predominant single band of ∼1 kb, whereas the transgenic mice had eotaxin mRNA migrating as multiple mRNA species. The predicted mature mRNA was detectable at ∼500 base pairs. The higher molecular weight mRNA species may represent the presence of chimeric eotaxin-hGH mRNA in the transgenic construct (28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 40Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16060-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, five different founder lines for theFabpi-IL-5 transgenic mice (designated iIL-5–1-5) were also derived. These mice were found to have transgene copy numbers of ∼6, 15, 7, 5, and 9 for each iIL-5 line, respectively. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B) revealed markedly increased levels of IL-5 mRNA in the transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. In wild-type mice, no IL-5 mRNA was detectable, whereas the transgenic lines had readily detectable IL-5 mRNA species present, migrating as multiple mRNA species. We were next interested in testing the hypothesis that overexpression of IL-5 or eotaxin in intestinal enterocytes would have consequences on eosinophil levels in hematopoietic organs. To initially analyze this, eosinophil levels were determined in the bone marrow of wild-type and transgenic mice. In the six lines of iIL-5 transgenic mice, marked increases in bone marrow eosinophil levels were seen compared with wild-type mice. For example, eosinophils accounted for 2.4 ± 0.85% and 22 ± 10% (mean ± S.D.; n = 4; p < 0.01) of the bone marrow cells in wild-type and iIL-5 transgenic mice, respectively. In contrast, overexpression of eotaxin did not affect eosinophil levels in the bone marrow (3.4 ± 2.1 and 2.8 ± 1.5% eosinophils for wild-type and iET mice, respectively;p > 0.1). We were next interested in analyzing the level of circulating eosinophils in the transgenic mice. Consistent with the expansion of eosinophils in the bone marrow, eosinophil levels in the peripheral blood of iIL-5 transgenic mice were increased 17 ± 12-fold (mean ± S.D., n = 11) compared with wild-type mice when combining data from all transgenic lines. In contrast, eotaxin transgenic mice had no significant alteration in the level of circulating eosinophils. Circulating eosinophil levels from representative transgenic and wild-type mice are shown in Fig.3. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ectopic expression of IL-5 in intestinal enterocytes, in contrast to overexpression of eotaxin, dramatically increases eosinophils in the bone marrow and peripheral circulation. It was relevant to determine whether overexpression of eotaxin or IL-5 in the intestine would induce the accumulation of eosinophils specifically in the intestine. We focused our attention on eosinophils in the jejunum because this is the intestinal region with the highest level of Fabpi transgene expression (Refs. 28Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9611-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholarand 40Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16060-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). We first examined eosinophil levels in the gastrointestinal tract of IL-5 transgenic mice. Mice overexpressing IL-5 had a 3.0 ± 1.1-fold (mean ± S.D., n = 4) increase in gastrointestinal eosinophil levels compared with wild-type mice. Eotaxin transgenic mice had an even larger increase in the levels of gastrointestinal eosinophils (p < 0.05 for iET versus iIL-5). Mice overexpressing eotaxin had 8.5 ± 4.4-fold (mean ± S.D., n = 10) increase in eosinophils compared with wild-type mice. Eosinophil accumulation occurred within the lamina propria in the submucosa and villus (Fig. 4). Anti-MBP immunohistochemistry revealed that eosinophils were not extensively degranulating, as demonstrated by the predominant cell-associated anti-MBP staining (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The tissue eosinophilia induced by overexpression of eotaxin with the Fabpi promoter was restricted to the small intestinal mucosa because eosinophil levels in the stomach (37 ± 16 versus 30 ± 10 (mean ± S.D.,n = 4 mice) eosinophils/mm2), colon (57 ± 7 versus 55 ± 15 (mean ± S.D.,n = 5) eosinophils/mm2), and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (560 ± 590 versus320 ± 280 (mean ± S.D., n = 4) eosinophils/ml for wild-type and transgenic mice, respectively) were comparable between transgenic and control mice.Figure 5Immunohistochemical staining of jejunum sections from wild-type and transgenic mice. The jejunum from wild-type (WT; A), Fabpi-IL-5 transgenic (iIL-5; B), orFabpi-eotaxin transgenic (iET; C) mice was stained with anti-MBP.

https://openalex.org/W1976193732,The respiratory exchange system of insects must maximize the flux of respiratory gases through the spiracles of the tracheal system while minimizing water loss. This trade-off between gas exchange and water loss becomes crucial when locomotor activity is increased during flight and metabolic needs are greatest. Insects that keep their spiracles mostly closed during flight reduce water loss but limit the flux of oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the tracheal system and thus attenuate locomotor performance. Insects that keep their spiracles completely open allow maximum gas exchange but face desiccation stress more quickly. Experiments in which water vapor was used as a tracer gas to track changes in the conductance of the respiratory system indicated that flying fruit flies minimize potential water loss by matching the area of the open spiracles to their gas exchange required for metabolic needs. This behavior maintained approximately constant pressure for carbon dioxide (1.35 kilopascals) and oxygen (19.9 kilopascals) within the tracheal system while reducing respirometric water loss by up to 23% compared with a strategy in which the spiracles are held wide open during flight. The adaptive spiracle-closing behavior in fruit flies has general implications for the ecology of flying insects because it shows how these animals may cope with environmental challenges during high locomotor performance.

Although the two kinase families are highly homologous, they phosphorylate distinct substrates and are functionally non-redundant. Type I PIP kinases phosphorylate PtdIns 4-phosphate at the D-5 hydroxyl group and are consequently PtdIns 4-phosphate 5-kinases. By contrast, type II PIP kinases are PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinases that phosphorylate PtdIns 5-phosphate at the D-4 position. Type I PIP kinases, in addition, also phosphorylate other phosphoinositides in vitro and in vivo and thus have the potential to generate multiple lipid second messengers. To understand how these enzymes differentiate between stereoisomeric substrates, we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach. We show that a single amino acid substitution in the activation loop, A381E in IIβ and the corresponding mutation E362A in Iβ, is sufficient to swap substrate specificity between these PIP kinases. In addition to its role in substrate specificity, the type I activation loop is also key in subcellular targeting. The Iβ(E362A) mutant and other mutants with reduced PtdIns 4-phosphate binding affinity were largely cytosolic when expressed in mammalian cells in contrast to wild-type Iβ which targets to the plasma membrane. These results clearly establish the role of the activation loop in determining both signaling specificity and plasma membrane targeting of type I PIP kinases.

Growing evidence suggests that the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at specific intracellular locations is dynamically regulated and signals the recruitment or the activation of specific proteins involved in mediating the distinct downstream effects of PtdIns(4,5)P2(4Hurley J.H. Meyer T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Martin T.F. Curr. Opin.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 also serves as the precursor to the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (3Toker A. Curr. Opin.

Consequently, the generation and degradation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also required for initiation of these additional signals. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms that control the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is key to understanding many cellular processes regulated by PI signaling. However, until recently, little was known regarding the temporal and spatial regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis. The cloning and characterization of the PIP kinases that synthesize PtdIns(4,5)P2, together with the solution of the first three-dimensional structure of one of the PIP kinases, serve as an entry point to understand the regulation of PI signaling processes at the molecular level (8Fruman D.A.

To date three distinct subfamilies have been identified that share significant sequence homology in their catalytic domains but differ in their substrate usage, subcellular localization, and function (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 10Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Two of these subfamilies, the type I and type II PIP kinases, are responsible for the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2, albeit by different pathways. The type I PIP kinases phosphorylate PtdIns(4)P at the D-5 hydroxyl group and are, thus, PtdIns(4)P 5-kinases (14Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C.

The type II PIP kinases, in contrast, are PtdIns(5)P 4-kinases that phosphorylate PtdIns(5)P at the D-4 position to generate PtdIns(4,5)P2 (14Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The third class, type III PIP kinases, of which yeast Fab1 is the prototype, does not generate PtdIns(4,5)P2 but rather phosphorylates PtdIns(3)P to PtdIns(3,5)P2 (16McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T.

The distinct substrate specificities of type I and type II PIP kinases are likely physiologically significant because members of the two subfamilies are functionally not redundant and primarily localize to different cellular compartments (19Kunz J.

Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in aspects of tumor necrosis factor α-mediated signaling (35Castellino A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5861-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the precise function of type II PIP kinases in the regulation of these processes has not yet been identified. Although it was generally thought that the physiological function of type I and type II PIP kinases involves the generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 only, recent findings suggest that their cellular roles may be more complex. Two reports demonstrated that type I and type II PIP kinases also use other phosphoinositide substrates in vitro, although typically with lower efficiency (15Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Type I PIP kinases are the most promiscuous enzymes and phosphorylate PtdIns(3)P on both the 4- and 5-hydroxyls forming PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,5)P2. Moreover, they can generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by the successive phosphorylation of PtdIns(3)P on the D-4 and D-5 positions of the inositol head group (15Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). At least some of the three mammalian type I isoforms can also generate PtdIns(5)P from phosphatidylinositol and may thus be responsible for the synthesis of this novel lipid (36Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E.

Type II PIP kinases also use PtdIns(3)P as a substrate; however, the product of this reaction is PtdIns(3,4)P2 (15Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O.

These findings suggest that type I and type II PIP kinases have the potential to generate phosphoinositide second messengers that were previously attributed to the action of PI 3-kinases. Indeed, a type I isoform, murine Iα, has recently been shown to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in response to oxidative stress in platelets (37Halstead J.R. Roefs M. Ellson C.D. D'Andrea S. Chen C.

Biol. 2001; 11: R371-R372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, a key to understanding signaling by PIP kinases is to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which these kinases specifically recognize and bind the closely related substrates. To reveal these mechanisms, we focused our study on two specific PIP kinase isoforms, human type Iβ and type IIβ. By using chimeras of Iβ and IIβ, we have previously shown that the substrate specificity of type I and type II PIP kinases is determined by an ∼25-amino acid region, termed the activation loop (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This small domain is diagnostic of the different PIP kinase subfamilies and is topologically equivalent to the activation loop in protein kinases (9Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because the loop region was disordered in the three-dimensional structure of IIβ, the first PIP kinase to be crystallized (9Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it is unclear how substrate is recognized and bound by any given PIP kinase subfamily. However, activation loop sequences contain a limited number of residues that are conserved in a type-specific manner, suggesting that the differences in substrate preference might be controlled by few amino acid residues. To identify these specificity determinants, we generated an array of mutants within the Iβ and IIβ activation loops by site-directed mutagenesis, and we characterized their activity toward phosphoinositide substrates. We report that mutation of a single residue within the activation loop is sufficient to switch substrate preference of IIβ to that of Iβ and vice versa. Moreover, in agreement with earlier findings (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we find that mutations in Iβ that decrease the affinity for PtdIns(4)P impair the ability of the kinase to localize to the plasma membrane. These results establish a dual role of the activation loop in defining substrate specificity and promoting membrane association and indicate that PtdIns(4)P binding is critical for the localization of Iβ to the plasma membrane. Synthetic PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(5)P dipalmitoyl esters were purchased from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT). LipofectAMINE Plus, Opti-MEM, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Ni2+-conjugated agarose columns were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Mouse monoclonal M2 antibody directed against the FLAG epitope was obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. All radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Escherichia coli expression vectors containing human Iβ or IIβ cDNAs in pET28 (Novagen) or the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3-FLAG have been described previously (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P.

The mutants used in this study were constructed by PCR-based overlap extension mutagenesis (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6805) Google Scholar) using mutagenic oligonucleotides that incorporated the desired codon changes (nucleotide sequences are available upon request). Flanking primers were FR8 (CTGGAGCCAGTGGATCCTTG) and JK91 (CAAACAGTGATGGAGTGCTAG) for Iβ and Boro12 (GAACTTCCTGGAGAAACTGAAGC) and SP6 (TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG) for IIβ. For the construction of single and double substitutions, wild-type IIβ cDNA was used as a template. The IIβ(K377Q/K378Q/K379Q) triple mutant was constructed by performing PCRs using the IIβ(K377Q/K378Q) mutant cDNA as a template in conjunction with mutagenic oligonucleotides containing all three mutated codons. The IIβ-IβC chimera was constructed as follows. In the first round of amplification, PCRs were performed using primers 2FOR2 (AGCTGCACATGCTGCCAAAGCTCTTGTTTATGATG) and SP6 on IIβ-Iβloop (19Kunz J.

The resulting two fragments were then linked in a second round of PCR using primers SP6 and Boro12. Likewise, for creating the IIβ-IβN chimera, primary PCRs were performed using primers 2FOR1 (ACGGTGAAACACGGGGCAGGGGC) and SP6 on IIβ template DNA and primers 2REV1 (CCCTGCCCCGTGTTTCACCGTTTTCCAGGAATGTT) and Boro12 on IIβ-Iβloop template DNA, respectively. For the construction of the Iβ-IIβC chimera, primary PCRs were performed using primers 1FOR2 (GCTGCACATGCTGCCAAAGCTCTTGTTTATGATGG) and JK91 on Iβ−IIβloop template DNA and primers 1REV2 (CCATCATAAACAAGAGCTTTGGCAGCATGTGCAGC) and FR8 on Iβ template DNA (19Kunz J.

The secondary PCR was performed on the combined PCR fragments obtained in the primary reaction using primers JK91 and FR8. Similarly, the Iβ-IIβN chimera was constructed using primers 1FOR1 (GTTAGAACATTCCTGGAAAACGGTGAAACACGGGG) and JK91 on Iβ template DNA and 1REV1 (CCCCGTGTTTCACCGTTTTCCAGGAATGTTCTAAC) and FR8 on Iβ−IIβloop template DNA in the primary PCRs followed by extension using primers JK91 and FR8 in the secondary PCR. The introduction of only the desired changes in each mutagenized region was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The mutagenized Iβ fragments were cloned back into pET28::Iβ and pCDNA3-FLAG::Iβ (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol.

The FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vectors were constructed by shuffling a 1.3-kbBamHI-XhoI fragments containing the entire IIβ cDNA from the pET28 vector into pCDNA3-FLAG. All the Iβ and IIβ wild-type and mutant variants were expressed inE. coli BL21(λDE3) as described previously (15Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O.

Recombinant proteins were purified on Ni2+-chelating agarose beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Lipid kinase activity assays were carried out for 4 min at room temperature in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 μmsubstrate (0.25–100 μm for kinetic studies) presented in micelles, and 50 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, 5 μCi/reaction).

Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Semi-confluent cultures grown on glass coverslips were transiently transfected and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H.

Cells were examined using a 60× plan oil immersion lens (NA 1.4) on a Bio-Rad MR 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope mounted transversely to an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200. The microscope was controlled by the Lasersharp 3.2 program (Bio-Rad). Z series were created by sequentially scanning green and red channels at 0.4-μm steps. Single sections or projections built with the Lasersharp 3.2 program were exported to Adobe Photoshop 6.0 for final image processing. To identify the substrate specificity determinants in the activation loops, we first bisected the loop and constructed four chimeras, termed Iβ-IIβN, Iβ-IIC, IIβ-IβN, and IIβ-IβC, in which either the N- or the C-terminal portions of the Iβ and IIβ activation loops were reciprocally exchanged (Fig.1 B). An invariant lysine residue positioned in the middle of both loops (Lys-366 in Iβ and the corresponding Lys-385 in IIβ) was used as an anchor point for the construction of the chimeras. The four chimeric kinases were expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and tested for their ability to phosphorylate synthetic phospholipid substrates. We found that the N-terminal portion of the activation loop was both necessary and sufficient to confer the substrate specificity of the donor enzyme. As could be expected, the IIβ-IβN chimera, in which the N-terminal portion of the IIβ loop was replaced with the corresponding region from Iβ, gained the ability to phosphorylate PtdIns(4)P but could no longer phosphorylate PtdIns(5)P (Fig.2, lanes 3 and 9). By contrast, the IIβ-IβC chimera, which contained the C-terminal portion of the Iβ activation loop, behaved like wild-type IIβ and efficiently phosphorylated PtdIns(5)P but did not utilize PtdIns(4)P as a substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and10). Thus, it appears that replacement of the N-terminal portion of the IIβ activation loop with the corresponding region of Iβ is sufficient to swap substrate specificity suggesting that this region contains the residues defining substrate specificity.Figure 2The N-terminal portion of the PIP kinase activation loop determines substrate preference. Lipid kinase activities of Iβ (lanes 1 and 7), IIβ (lanes 2 and 8), the Iβ-IIβN(lanes 3 and 9), and the Iβ-IIβC(lanes 4 and 10) chimeras, as well as the IIβ-IβN (lanes 5 and 11) and the IIβ-IβC (lanes 6 and 12) chimeras toward PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(5)P (indicated on top of thepanels). PIP kinases were expressed in E. coliBL21(λDE3) as His6 fusion proteins, purified on Ni2+ beads, and tested for kinase activity against the synthetic substrates. Phosphorylated phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography. An autoradiogram of the kinase assay is shown. Arrows indicate the positions of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and lysoPtdIns(4,5)P2 as well as of the origin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results were corroborated by the characterization of the substrate usage of the Iβ-IIβN and Iβ-IIβC chimeras. Accordingly, the Iβ-IIβC chimera retained the substrate specificity of wild-type Iβ and exclusively phosphorylated PtdIns(4)P but not PtdIns(5)P (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 12). By contrast, the Iβ-IIβN chimera, which contained the N-terminal activation loop region of IIβ, gained the ability to phosphorylate PtdIns(5)P, in contrast to wild-type Iβ that did not efficiently utilize this substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 11). Interestingly, whereas the Iβ-IIβN chimera strongly preferred PtdIns(5)P as a substrate, it did not completely lose its ability to phosphorylate PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 2, lane 3). These findings indicate that additional residues that are possibly present in the C-terminal portion of the activation loop are required for more complete exclusion of PtdIns(4)P. At present, we cannot distinguish whether residues in the IIβ loop are required for active exclusion of PtdIns(4)P or whether the PtdIns(4)P-binding site extends further into the C-terminal portion of the Iβ activation loop. Nevertheless, these combined results suggest that the amin"

The peripheral inner membrane protein, Tim44, recruits mtHsp70 in an ATP-dependent manner to the import sites. We show that DnaK, the closely related Hsp70 of Escherichia coli, when targeted to the matrix of yeast mitochondria, interacts in a specific manner with Tim44. The interaction is, however, not regulated by ATP, and DnaK cannot support protein translocation. We used truncated mtHsp70s and chimeric proteins consisting of segments of mtHsp70 and DnaK to analyze which portions of mtHsp70 bind and functionally interact with Tim44. We show that Tim44 interacts with the β-stranded core of the peptide binding domain of mtHsp70 and of DnaK. The α-helices A and B of the peptide binding domain of mtHsp70 are required to transmit the nucleotide state of the ATPase domain to the peptide binding domain.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It was proposed that Tim44, Ssc1p, and its co-chaperone Mge1p are all parts of an ATP-dependent molecular motor that drives translocation of preproteins by a “hand over hand” mode (6Moro F.

It is then released from the inner membrane, and the Ssc1p-preprotein complex can move further into the matrix. A central question regarding this pathway is how Tim44 can sense when to release mtHsp70 that has bound a preprotein. To address this question it is important to determine which portions of mtHsp70 interact with Tim44. mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 proteinase K dihydrofolate reductase methotrexate wild type nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 proteinase K dihydrofolate reductase methotrexate wild type nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 family are composed of two domains, an N-terminal ATPase domain of about 45 kDa that is connected by a short linker to a peptide binding domain of ∼25 kDa (9Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The first part of the peptide binding domain consists of eight anti-parallel β-strands that form the substrate binding pocket (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gotesman M. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The β-stranded core is followed by an α-helical portion consisting of five helices, αA–αE, and a C terminus of unknown structure. αB consists of two halves connected by a flexible hinge. αA and the first half of αB are packed against the β-stranded core. The second half of αB and αC–αE correspond to a compact α-helical subdomain (11Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To efficiently close the substrate binding pocket, the α-helical subdomain folds like a lid over the β-stranded core. Hsp70s bind unfolded polypeptides in an ATP-dependent manner (12Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 13Szabo A. Langer T.

When Hsp70 is in the ATP form, the substrate binding pocket of Hsp70 is open; the chaperone can rapidly bind and release polypeptide substrates. In the ADP form the substrate binding pocket is closed, and polypeptide substrates can hardly bind to Hsp70, whereas bound polypeptides are tightly held and not released. A cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis allows Hsp70s to associate with an unfolded polypeptide in the ATP form and then hydrolyze ATP to tightly hold the substrate and finally release the bound polypeptide after exchange of ADP by ATP. To bind and release polypeptides on a physiologically relevant time scale, Hsp70s cooperate with co-chaperones that accelerate the nucleotide reaction cycle (15Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D.

Co-chaperones also tag the relevant substrates and thereby recruit the chaperones for specific tasks (21Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Tim44 is such a co-chaperone, and it recruits mtHsp70 for protein import. Here we show that DnaK, the Hsp70 of Escherichia coli, when targeted to the matrix of yeast mitochondria, is also recruited by Tim44 to the inner membrane import sites. The interaction with Tim44, however, is not modulated by nucleotides, and DnaK does not drive protein translocation. We constructed a series of chimera between Ssc1p and DnaK to identify the segments in Ssc1p that are necessary for a functional interaction with Tim44. We show that Tim44 interacts with the β-stranded core of the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p and of DnaK but not via the substrate binding pocket. The interaction is independent of nucleotides. The α-helices A and B of the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p, but not of DnaK, modulate the interaction between the β-stranded core and Tim44 in a nucleotide-dependent fashion. Implications of the mechanism of protein translocation are discussed.

Mitochondria (1 mg/ml protein) were suspended in import buffer (600 mm sorbitol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 2.5 mmATP, 5 mm NADH, 10 mm phospho- creatine, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase. Import reactions were started by the addition of 35S-labeled precursor proteins synthesized byin vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysate. After a 5-min incuba- tion at 25 °C, samples were transferred on ice and split into two aliquots. One aliquot remained untreated, and the other was treated with 50 μg/ml PK or trypsin for 25 min on ice. Protease digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, respectively, and mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation. Proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by autoradiography. Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing either 4 mm EDTA (-ATP) or 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATP (+ATP). After a clarifying spin, the detergent extracts (250 μg) were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4 °C with affinity-purified antibodies against Tim44 bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (6Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times for 5 min with 1 ml of lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Ssc1p and Ssc1-3p were detected after Western blotting with antibodies against Ssc1p. DnaK and DnaK/Ssc1p chimera were detected with antibodies against DnaK. Radiolabeled pSu9-(1–69)DHFR was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in import buffer containing 3 μm MTX. Then, import buffer was supplemented with 2.5 mm ATP and 5 mm NADH, and mitochondria were added and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and solubilized in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium acetate, 0.4% Triton X-100, 15 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were subjected to a clarifying spin, and the supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA beads. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer. To target E. coli DnaK into the matrix of yeast mitochondria, the open reading frame was fused to the presequence of the ATPase subunit 9 of N. crassa (pSu9) (Fig.1 A). A His tag was introduced between the presequence and the N terminus of DnaK. This construct was expressed under control of a galactose-inducible promoter in the temperature-sensitive yeast strain ssc1–3, which carries a mutation in the major mtHsp70 (23Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.-J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). DnaK was processed to the mature form and localized in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1 B). The amount of DnaK that could be isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography was comparable with the amount of Ssc1-3p in control mitochondria as estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown). This finding indicates that DnaK was expressed at a physiologically relevant level. The mitochondria-targeted DnaK bound to ATP agarose (Fig.1 C), suggesting that it was properly folded in the matrix of the mitochondria. However, when yeast cells were shifted to nonpermissive temperature, DnaK in the mitochondrial matrix did not rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the ssc1–3strain (data not shown). DnaK interacted with Mge1p, the mitochondrial homologue of the bacterial co-chaperone GrpE, in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Using an antibody against Tim44, DnaK coimmunoprecipitated with Tim44 in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 2 B). Apparently, the interaction between DnaK and Tim44 was not regulated by ATP. Furthermore, DnaK did not support import of pSu9-(1–69)DHFR into mitochondria that were preincubated at 37 °C in order to inactivate the mutant Ssc1-3p (data not shown). What are the functional elements that allow Ssc1p, but not DnaK, to interact with Tim44 in an ATP-dependent manner and to drive protein translocation? DnaK and Ssc1p are the two members of the Hsp70 protein family that share the highest degree of sequence similarity. The N-terminal ATPase domain and the β-stranded portion of the peptide binding domain are highly conserved between DnaK and Ssc1p (65 and 68% amino acid sequence identity, respectively). The α-helical portion, which comprises the lid and the C-terminal domain, is significantly less conserved (22% identity). Based on the sequence alignment with Ssc1p and on the crystal structure of the peptide binding domain of DnaK (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gotesman M. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A and B), we divided the chaperones into four structural elements: (i) the ATPase domain; (ii) the β-stranded core constituting the substrate binding pocket (β1-β8); (iii) helix A plus helix B (αA–αB), the latter containing the flexible hinge; and (iv) the C-terminal lid domain (αC–αE plus the C terminus). Combining these four structural elements, we constructed chimeric Hsp70s (Fig. 3 C). The elements originating from Ssc1p and DnaK are indicated by “C” and “K,” respectively, in the appropriate position of a four-letter acronym. When the chimeric chaperones were expressed in the ssc1–3strain, none of the chimeric Hsp70s was able to rescue the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the ssc1–3 strain (data not shown). Similarly, the chimeric Hsp70s did not complement a disruption of the SSC1 gene (data not shown). As estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, the expression levels of the chimera were significantly lower (∼25%) than those of Ssc1p in mitochondria from WT cells yet were comparable with those of Ssc1-3p (data not shown). Thus, it is not clear whether the failure of the chimera to substitute for Ssc1p is because of the lower expression levels or reflects functional deficiencies of the chimera. For purposes of functional characterization, mitochondria fromssc1–3 cells harboring DnaK or one of the chimeric Hsp70s were lysed with Triton X-100 in the absence or the presence of ATP, and the His-tagged chimera were adsorbed to Ni-NTA beads. WT mitochondria containing a C-terminally His-tagged version of Ssc1p were used as a control. Like DnaK and Ssc1p, the chimeric Hsp70s interacted with Mge1p in a nucleotide-dependent manner (data not shown), demonstrating that all Hsp70s underwent physiologically relevant nucleotide-dependent conformational changes. To study the interaction of the chimeric chaperones with Tim44, immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified antibodies against Tim44 was performed in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 3 D). In the absence of ATP, Ssc1p, DnaK, and each of the chimeric Hsp70s coprecipitated in a complex with Tim44. In the presence of ATP, the complexes of Tim44 with DnaK, CKKK, and KKKC were stable. In contrast, the complexes of Tim44 with KKCC, KCCC, and Ssc1p dissociated in the presence of ATP, indicating a nucleotide-dependent interaction of these Hsp70s with Tim44. Thus, the α-helices A and B of the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p appear to be necessary to transmit the nucleotide-induced conformational changes from the ATPase domain to Tim44 and thereby regulate the interaction of the chaperones with Tim44 in an ATP-dependent manner. To characterize the interaction of Ssc1p with Tim44 in more detail, we constructed C-terminally truncated versions of Ssc1p (Fig.4 A, left). The deleted structural elements are indicated by a “0” in the corresponding position of the acronym. CC00 lacks the α-helical portion and C-terminal domain, and C000 consists only of the ATPase domain. In addition, we constructed DHFR-0CCC and DHFR-0KKK, fusion proteins between the chimeric preprotein pSu9-(1–69)DHFR and the entire peptide binding domain of Ssc1p and DnaK, respectively. To study the interaction of the chimera with Tim44, radiolabeled precursors were synthesized in vitro and imported into isolated mitochondria. The radiolabeled precursors of Ssc1p and pSu9-(1–69)DHFR were imported for control. After the import reactions the samples were treated with PK to remove precursors associated with the surface of mitochondria. All precursors were efficiently imported into the matrix and processed to their mature forms (data not shown). Subsequently the mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitations with antibodies against Tim44 were performed in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 4 A, right). Radiolabeled Ssc1p coprecipitated with Tim44 in the absence but not in the presence of ATP, indicating that the imported chaperone behaved like the endogenous Ssc1p. CC00 coprecipitated in a complex with Tim44 in the absence but also in the presence of ATP. This supports the conclusion (see above) that the α-helices A and B are required for the ATP dependence of the Tim44-Ssc1p interaction. C000 (ATPase domain) was not coprecipitated with Tim44, indicating that it either did not bind stably to Tim44 or that it could not efficiently compete with the endogenous Ssc1p. This result contradicts earlier findings by Krimmeret al. (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, DHFR-0CCC and DHFR-0KKK interacted with Tim44, whereas imported DHFR did not coprecipitate Tim44 (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that the peptide binding domains of Ssc1p and DnaK interact with Tim44. The interaction of both chimera with Tim44 was not modulated by ATP. In particular, the β-stranded portion of the domain is required for the interaction with Tim44, whereas the helices αA and αB are not required for binding per se but modulate the interaction in response to nucleotides. To obtain further evidence that Tim44 interacts with the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p in a specific manner, we constructed DHFR-0CCC1–2, a fusion protein between pSu9-(1–69)DHFR and the peptide binding domain of Ssc1-2p (Fig. 4 B, left). The conditional mutant protein Ssc1-2p contains a mutation in the β-stranded core of peptide binding domain (Pro to Ser in position 442 of the precursor) (23Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.-J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). At nonpermissive temperature, Ssc1-2p interacts with substrate proteins in mitochondria but no longer interacts with Tim44 (3Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 25Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ashen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Purified Ssc1-2p protein in the ADP form displays a reduced on-rate for peptide (26Liu Q. Krzewska J. Liberek K. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6112-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that the flexibility of the closed peptide binding domain is compromised because of the mutation. DHFR-0CCC1–2 and, for control, DHFR-0CCC were imported into mitochondria, and immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Tim44 was performed (Fig. 4 B, right). To induce the temperature-sensitive phenotype associated with the ssc1–2mutation, the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 37 °C or at 4 °C for control. DHFR-0CCC was detected in the immunoprecipitate at 4 and at 37 °C. In contrast, the complex between Tim44 and DHFR-0CCC1–2 was stable at 4 °C but dissociated at 37 °C. This indicates that the mutation in Ssc1-2p affects the conformation of the peptide binding domain independently of the ATPase domain. Because Ssc1-2p binds substrate proteins at permissive and nonpermissive temperature, the observation demonstrates that Tim44 is not bound like a substrate by the chimera DHFR-0CCC1–2. To investigate whether the chimeric Hsp70s facilitate preprotein translocation, mitochondria were first preincubated at 37 °C to inactivate endogenous Ssc1-3p and then incubated at 25 °C with the radiolabeled precursor pSu9-(1–69)DHFR (Fig.5 A). pSu9-(1–69)DHFR was not imported into the matrix of mitochondria from the ssc1–3strain, demonstrating that the mutant chaperone was efficiently inactivated by the preincubation. Rather, as observed previously, low amounts of the intermediate form, which was processed only once by the matrix-processing peptidase, accumulated as a dead-end translocation intermediate in the intermembrane space (data not shown). Likewise, no import above background was observed with mitochondria harboring the chimera CKKK, KKKC, or KKCC. In contrast, pSu9-(1–69)DHFR was imported into mitochondria harboring KCCC where it was efficiently processed to the mature form. The import efficiency was lower than that of mitochondria harboring Ssc1p, indicating that the chimera KCCC was not fully functional and/or not present at the same level as WT Ssc1p. For further analysis mitochondria were preincubated at 37 °C, and then the kinetics of import were measured at either 25 or 37 °C (Fig. 5 B). At 25 °C, mitochondria harboring KCCC imported the precursor efficiently, yet at a slower rate than WT mitochondria. This difference was even more pronounced when import was carried out at 37 °C; import of pSu9-(1–69)DHFR into WT mitochondria was faster at 37 °C than at 25 °C, whereas import into mitochondria containing KCCC was slower at 37 °C than at 25 °C, suggesting that the chimera KCCC is temperature-sensitive. We asked whether the chimera KCCC interacts directly with translocation intermediates that are arrested in a membrane-spanning fashion at the import site. To generate translocation intermediates, mitochondria were pretreated at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with pSu9-(1–69)DHFR in the presence of MTX to stabilize the folded DHFR moiety and thereby prevent unfolding and complete import of the precursor (27Rassow J. Guiard B. Wiehhues U. Herzog V. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were then lysed with Triton X-100 in the absence of ATP, and the His-tagged chimeric Hsp70s were precipitated with Ni-NTA beads (Fig. 5 C). The arrested translocation intermediate coprecipitated with KCCC, whereas no interaction of pSu9-(1–69)DHFR with DnaK or KKCC was observed. Finally, we asked whether KCCC was able to tightly hold an arrested precursor in the import channel. Mitoplasts were prepared and incubated with pSu9-(1–69)DHFR in the presence of MTX (Fig. 5 D). In mitoplasts the arrested translocation intermediate spans the inner membrane and is processed to the intermediate form, iSu9-(1–69)DHFR (5Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which readily allows identification of arrested species. In mitoplasts generated from WT mitochondria iSu9-(1–69)DHFR was resistant to treatment with PK. This indicates that the MTX-stabilized DHFR moiety was tightly apposed to the outer face of the inner membrane because of interaction of Ssc1p with segments of the precursor exposed into the matrix. In mitoplasts from the ssc1–3 mutant (after preincubation at 37 °C) and in ssc1–3 mitoplasts harboring DnaK, little iSu9-(1–69)DHFR was generated, and its resistance to protease treatment was very low (Fig. 5 D). Thus, Ssc1-3p and DnaK did not interact with the membrane-spanning intermediate. In mitoplasts containing KCCC iSu9-(1–69)DHFR was generated, but it was largely sensitive to added PK (Fig.5 D). This indicates that KCCC was not fully competent to hold iSu9-(1–69)DHFR tightly apposed to the inner membrane and to efficiently prevent retrograde movement of the preprotein through the import channel. In summary, DnaK and the chimeric Hsp70s specifically interacted with Tim44, indicating that Tim44 recruits the Hsp70s via a conserved interface. Two of the chimera interacted with Tim44 in an ATP-dependent manner, but only KCCC, a construct that contained the ATPase domain of DnaK and the whole peptide binding domain of Ssc1p, interacted with a preprotein in transit and supported import in vitro. Yet, KCCC was not fully functional; it supported import at reduced rates and in a temperature-sensitive manner, and it could not efficiently hold a translocation intermediate in the import channel. The hybrid protein was temperature-sensitive in function; expression levels in vivo were significantly lower than those of Ssc1p. Thus, despite the striking similarity between DnaK and Ssc1p, KCCC could not substitute for Ssc1p in vivo. Fine tuning of the interaction between the ATPase and the peptide binding domain appears to be necessary to drive translocation at rates sufficiently high to support biogenesis of mitochondria in vivo. What are the determinants in mtHsp70 that enable it to interact with Tim44 and to drive ATP-dependent protein translocation into the matrix of mitochondria? To answer this question we targetedE. coli DnaK to the mitochondrial matrix of yeast cells. This DnaK could not substitute for Ssc1p, the authentic mtHsp70,in vivo. In particular, DnaK in the matrix was properly folded but did not facilitate mitochondrial protein translocation, a process essential for the viability of yeast under all growth conditions. What are the determinants that enable Ssc1p but not DnaK to drive protein translocation? DnaK in the matrix interacted with Mge1p in an ATP-dependent manner and was assembled into a specific complex with Tim44. However, the interaction between Tim44 and DnaK was not regulated by ATP. Accordingly, the defect in protein import may be due to the deficiency of DnaK to interact with Tim44 in an ATP-dependent manner. We used this situation to study which domains of Ssc1p interact with Tim44 and what the elements are that regulate the interaction in response to ATP. To this end we analyzed chimeric Hsp70s in which portions of DnaK were replaced by corresponding segments of Ssc1p. The result of these domain-swapping experiments is that the helices αA and αB of the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p are required for a nucleotide-dependent interaction of Hsp70 with Tim44. This finding is in agreement with the observation that a C-terminally truncated version of Ssc1p lacking the helices αD and αE was reported to interact with Tim44 in an ATP-dependent manner (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We showed that Tim44 interacted with a C-terminally truncated version of Ssc1p that lacked the entire α-helical subdomain in a nucleotide-independent manner. Thus, the helices αA and αB are required for the nucleotide-dependent regulation of the interaction but not for the interaction per se. The chimeric fusion proteins in which the ATPase domains of Ssc1p or DnaK were replaced by DHFR were isolated in a stable complex with Tim44. This clearly demonstrates that Tim44 interacted with the peptide binding domains of Ssc1p and DnaK. A corresponding construct was not investigated by Krimmer et al. (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We did not detect a complex of Tim44 with a truncated Ssc1p consisting only of the ATPase domain. In contrast, Krimmer et al. (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) could coprecipitate newly imported ATPase domain with Tim44. In both approaches immunoprecipitation with Tim44 antibodies was used to assess binding. In addition to the strong interaction of Tim44 with the peptide binding domain demonstrated here, an additional weak interaction of Tim44 with the ATPase domain cannot be ruled out on principle grounds. However, characterization of the interaction of Tim44 with the conditional mutant protein Ssc1-2p provides further evidence supporting that Tim44 does not or only weakly interact with the ATPase domain. Ssc1-2p carries a single mutation in the β-stranded core of the peptide binding domain. When the mutant phenotype is induced, Ssc1-2p remains soluble and interacts with nucleotides in a similar manner as Ssc1p (26Liu Q. Krzewska J. Liberek K. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6112-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Yet, despite the presence of a functional ATPase domain, Ssc1-2p does not interact with Tim44 at nonpermissive temperature (3Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 25Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ashen O. Pfanner N. Voos W.

On the other hand, the peptide binding domain of Ssc1-2p, when fused to DHFR, forms a complex with Tim44 at permissive but not at nonpermissive temperatures. Furthermore, all intragenic suppressor mutations of Ssc1-2p that restore the binding to Tim44 have been mapped in the β-stranded core of the peptide binding domain (25Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ashen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Liu Q. Krzewska J. Liberek K. Craig E.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7097-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This finding supports the notion that the peptide binding domain rather than the ATPase domain of Ssc1p mediates the interaction with Tim44. Finally, because the truncated version of Ssc1p consisting of the ATPase domain and the β-stranded substrate binding pocket interacted with Tim44 independently of ATP, a putative interaction of the ATPase domain with Tim44 must also be independent of ATP. Yet, the coprecipitation of the ATPase domain with Tim44 reported by Krimmer et al. (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was not observed in the presence of ATP. Interestingly, the ATPase domain of Hsp70s is structurally related to actin (31Hurley J.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and Ssc1p was shown to have a tendency to form dimers and higher oligomeric assemblies in the absence but not in the presence of ATP (32Azem A. Oppliger W. Lustig A. Jeno P. Feifel B. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20901-20906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the small fraction of the ATPase domain that coprecipitated by Tim44 antibodies in the absence of nucleotides (24Krimmer T. Rassow J. Kunau W.H. Voos W. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) could be mediated via dimerization with a full-size Ssc1p in complex with Tim44. Such a complex would be indirect and dissociated by ATP. Our data demonstrate that Tim44 interacts with the β-stranded portion of the peptide binding domain. Tim44 in this way appears to recruit Ssc1p and precisely position the substrate binding pocket at the outlet of the import channel. This would facilitate the binding of Ssc1p to a preprotein as soon as it emerges from the import channel and trigger ATP hydrolysis in order to close the peptide binding domain and efficiently trap the incoming polypeptide chain. The conformational change in the peptide binding domain associated with the binding to the incoming preprotein may then destabilize the interaction between Ssc1p and Tim44. This may facilitate the release of the chaperone-preprotein complex from the import site, a step required for further inward movement of the translocating preprotein. Inward movement could be driven by Brownian motion (7Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tim44 may serve as a fulcrum at the inner membrane, and Ssc1p may actively pull on a translocating polypeptide to facilitate unfolding of the folded precursor (25Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ashen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, as Tim44 interacts directly with the peptide binding domain of Ssc1p, there would be no lever arm available that could translate a conformational change into a substantial movement of the peptide binding domain perpendicular to the membrane.

B-Myb shares amino acid homology to other family members in three main regions (3Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R.

First is a highly conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, which is composed of three α helical repeats (R1, R2, and R3) (4McIntosh P.B. Frenkiel T.A. Wellborn U. McCormick J.E. Klempnauer K.H.

Reakes C.F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A MBS is not always necessary for B-Myb activity (2Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Sala A. De Saitta B. Luca P. Cervellera M.N. Casella I. Lewis R.E. Watson R. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which argues that B-Myb may also transactivate via protein-protein interactions. A second conserved domain is the acidic region, which has been shown to contain transactivation potential (8Watson R.J. Robinson C. Lam E.W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This domain is regulated by the carboxyl-terminal tail of B-Myb (9Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the transactivation potential of B-Myb has been shown to be cell line-specific and dependent on binding of a putative co-factor to the carboxyl-terminal tail (10Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that other domains in B-Myb are involved in regulation of the transactivation domain. The third region of similarity is the conserved region (CR) of B-Myb. The CR shares homology with other Myb family members, but diverges in structure by the absence of the leucine zipper and the EVES motif found in c-Myb (11Kanei-Ishii C. MacMillian E.M. Nomura T.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Finally, the CR is flanked by two nuclear localization signals (15Takemoto Y. Tashiro S. Handa H. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The expression and biological activity of B-Myb is regulated at multiple levels in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In quiescent cells, the expression of B-Myb mRNA is repressed, but upon entering the cell cycle, expression is up-regulated in late G1 and maximally expressed during S-phase (16Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M.

Although not well understood, B-Myb is also regulated at the protein level by phosphorylation. During S-phase, B-Myb can be hyperphosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 in conjunction with cyclin A1, cyclin A2, or cyclin E (19Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr.

Tissue distribution of the Myb proteins may also play a role in their function. Although A-Myb and c-Myb have restricted tissue expression (3Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T.

Furthermore, recent reports indicate that B-Myb is the only Myb expressed in embryonic stem cells and it has been shown to be required for development of the early embryo (16Saville M.K. Watson R.J.

Recently, the co-activator p300 has been implicated in transcription of the FGF-4 gene where it may mediate the effects of Sox-2 and Oct-3 (47Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). p300 and the related family member CREB-binding protein (CBP) are co-activators that mediate transactivation of RNA polymerase II (41Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). p300/CBP presumably function by acting as a bridge between transcription factors and the general transcription initiation machinery (42Abraham S.E.

Interestingly, the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and NF-Y have also been shown to interact with p300 (45Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

We determined that B-Myb substantially activates the FGF-4 promoter in HeLa cells. By utilizing mutant forms of B-Myb, we demonstrate that specific domains are required for B-Myb activity. In a similar manner, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of B-Myb plays an important and necessary role in B-Myb activity. Finally, we show that B-Myb interacts with and is acetylated by p300 in vivo, implicating acetylation as another means of B-Myb regulation. Our findings further demonstrate that the FGF-4 promoter provides a novel system to probe the mechanisms by which B-Myb activates transcription. In this regard, theFGF-4 promoter is stimulated as much as 35-fold by B-Myb, which is substantially above that observed with many other promoters (8Watson R.J. Robinson C. Lam E.W.F.

HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Chinese hamster ovary cells were maintained in F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa and 293T cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection with the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (31Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 50Scholtz B. Kingsley-Kallesen M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32375-32380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 14–16 h later, the cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, cell lysates were prepared and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (51Cerneus D.P. Van der Ende A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Null vectors were used to maintain the total amount of DNA transfected. To adjust for differences in transfection efficiency, all transfections were normalized with pCMVβ-galactosidase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). All transfections were performed in duplicate or triplicate with representative experiments shown. Plasmid DNA was purified by Qiagen tip-500 columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The promoter/reporter gene constructs pkFGF4–427T+E (referred to in this paper as −427T+E), pBLCAT7, and Sp1DP have been described previously (31Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Luster T.A. Johnson L.R. Nowling T.K. Lamb K.A. Philipsen S. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 57: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Promoter/reporter construct −427T was created by removal of the FGF-4 enhancer with aSacI digest and religation. −61T was created by digesting −427T with SphI and SacII and religation. The promoter/reporter gene construct −427T+E CCAATmut was generated by the QuikChange method of mutagenesis (Stratagene) using theFGF-4 promoter/reporter gene construct −427T+E. The complimentary primers (synthesized by the Eppley Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility) were used to disrupt the CCAAT box and putative MBS (mutated bases in lowercase) while creating aBamHI site (underlined): 5′-CCCCCGGCGGTGggatcCAcGCGGCCTGCGCCC-3′. Positive clones were selected by digestion with BamHI. −427T CCAATmut, which lacks the FGF-4 enhancer, was made by removal of the enhancer from −427T+E CCAATmut with a SacI digest and religation. To disrupt the TATA box and create −427T TATAmut, −427T+E was digested with KasI and BssHII. This removed a small fragment containing the wild type TATA box. Next, two oliogonucleotides containing a mutated TATA box (lowercase), (5′-GCGCCGGCagatctccCCACTGCTCCGGAGGGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCCAGCCCAGCCCTCCGGAGCAGTGGggagatctGCCG-3′), were annealed and ligated into the KasI and BssHII sites of the remaining plasmid. This created −427T TATAmut+E. The enhancer was subsequently deleted by SacI digestion and religation to create −427T TATAmut. Expression constructs for pCMV FLAG-B-Myb, pCDNA3 FLAG-B-Myb, and the B-Myb phosphorylation mutants 10mut, 8mut, 396–455, 497–3TV, and 267+283 have been described previously (22Johnson T.K. Schweppe R.E. Septer J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mutant B-Myb construct 267–455 was created by successive mutagenesis utilizing primers described previously (22Johnson T.K. Schweppe R.E. Septer J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 15mut expression construct was created by successive mutagenesis of the five additional phosphorylation sites using the 10mut construct or the previously mutated constructs as a template. Primers specific for each of the five additional phosphorylation sites are as follows (mutated bases are lowercase, restriction sites are underlined); S343A, 5′-CCCTCTACGGAGGGatccGTCGTCAGCgcCCCAGTGCAGCCCC-3′ (creates a BamHI site); S424A, 5′-CGTGTGGCCCTGgCGCCgGTCACcGAGAACAGTGCC-3′ (creates aBstEII site); T443V and T447V, 5′-CTTGTAACAGCCTCgtCCCGAAGtcggtaCCTGTCAAAACCCTCCCC-3′ (creates a KpnI site); T490V, 5′-GCCAAAAGGTGGTgGTCACCgtGCCCCTGCACAGG-3′ (creates aBstEII site). The B-Myb deletion mutants were created by polymerase chain re- action (PCR) amplification and ligation into the parent vector, pCMV5 FLAG-B-Myb. MutO was created by a two-step mega-primer method, using pCMV5 FLAG-B-Myb as the template. The mega-primer contained an in-frame splice of B-Myb sequences at 1120–1145 and 1556–1579, deleting 411 bp 5′-GTAAATTTGACCTTCCTGAAGAACCCCTGGAGAG CCCCTCACTGACATC-3′. The downstream primer hybridized to B-Myb sequence 2437–2460: 5′-CAGGAGTGGACCTTGTTCTATTAG-3′. PCR was performed with these primers, and the product of this reaction was used as a primer in the second reaction, together with the upstream primer that hybridized to B-Myb at 646–667: 5′-GGACAATGCTGTGAAGAATCAC-3′. The second PCR product and parent vector were digested with SalI andBsmI and then religated. The mutT forward primer included anEcoRI site (underlined), Kozak sequence (GCCACC), the FLAG epitope tag (bold), and B-Myb sequence 304–321: 5′-CGCGAATTCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGTTAAGGGACCATGGACCCTCTGATCGCCAAGATGCTACC-3′. The reverse primer hybridized to B-Myb at 537–554: 5′-GGTAGCATCTTGGCGATC-3′. The PCR product and parent vector were digested with EcoRI and BstEII and ligated. The mutC and mutT forward primer included B-Myb sequence 646–667: 5′-GGACAATGCTGTGAAGAATCAC-3′. The reverse primer for mutC hybridized to B-Myb at 1443–1470 and contained a stop codon and a XbaI restriction site (underlined): 5′-GCTCTAGAAATCTCCAGGGTATCCTGTTTGTTCCAGAAG-3′. The reverse primer for mutT hybridized to B-Myb at 1721–1740 and contained a stop codon and a XbaI restriction site (underlined): 5′-GCTCTAGAAATCTCCATGCCAGCCTCAGAAC-3′. The PCR products and pCMV FLAG-B-Myb were digested with PstI and XbaI, and ligated. The ΔCR mutation was created by a modified version of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward primer contained B-Myb sequences 1522–1543 fused in-frame to B-Myb sequences 1824–1847, which deletes 321 bp: 5′-CCAGTTTCTGAACTTCTGGAACAAACAGGATCTCATCATTGAGGAT GACATGAGGC-3′. The reverse primer was the complement. The PCR product was digested withDpnI to remove the template DNA. Clones were screened by digestion with SacI, which is present in the deleted portion of B-Myb. Other expression plasmids utilized have been described previously: mut1 and mut2 (13Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol.

The method for labeling, electrophoresis, excision, tryptic digestion, HPLC, and phosphoamino acid analysis of B-Myb has been described previously (22Johnson T.K. Schweppe R.E. Septer J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 55Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 10mut B-Myb tryptic phosphopeptides were generated as described previously, with the exception that the amount of protein obtained was scaled down 10-fold. Consequently, after the HPLC fractions were subjected to automated Edman degradation, there was not enough protein left to directly identify the amino acid sequence. Therefore, each cycle was counted by β-scintillation to determine which amino acid position contained the radiolabeled phosphoamino acid. In addition, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on each HPLC fraction to determine whether phosphoserine or phosphothreonine was present. The remaining phosphorylation sites were predicted by comparing the phosphoamino acid analysis data to a computer-generated tryptic digest of B-Myb listing all serines and threonines followed by a proline. This allowed for the determination of five additional potential phosphorylation sites. These sites were mutated individually and together using the 10mut as template. The resulting B-Myb phosphorylation mutant proteins were then mapped by HPLC analysis to confirm that the mutations eliminated the targeted phosphorylation sites (data not shown). Cells were frozen on liquid nitrogen and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.5). Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Clarified cell supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight with the appropriate antibody conjugated to agarose beads with rotation at 4 °C. Samples were washed 4 times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) before addition of sample buffer (20% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue). The proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE at 150 V until the dye-front was run off the gel. Proteins from the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in transfer buffer (15 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) for 1 h at 40 V, 250 mA. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 3% bovine serum albumin, blotted using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (1:3000 in TBST)(Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:2000 in TBST) (Pierce, Rockford, IL), each followed by three 5-min washes in TBST. Proteins were detected by colormetric development with 33 μl each of 50 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 50 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium in 10 ml of AP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Alternatively, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence kit (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) following the manufacturers directions and visualized using a Storm PhosphorImaging cassette and the Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The antibody for acetyl-lysine and the anti-FLAG antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Sigma, respectively. All Western blots were performed in duplicate or triplicate, with representative blots shown. Chinese hamster ovary cells cultured on coverslips were transiently transfected with B-Myb or mutant B-Myb expression plasmids by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers directions. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, neutralized by 50 mm ammonium chloride, then permeabilized with 70% ethanol. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the primary antibody (M2, 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline) and secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse 1:100) were added for 1 h each, and the cells were washed after each antibody. The coverslips were then mounted on slides using glycerol-gelatin with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) or Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Photographs were taken using a Nikon phase-contrast microscope utilizing a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. The transcription factor B-Myb is involved in the regulation of numerous genes. Although B-Myb can bind and function through a consensus MBS, there is also evidence that B-Myb can function through protein-protein interactions in the absence of a MBS (2Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Sala A. De Saitta B. Luca P. Cervellera M.N. Casella I. Lewis R.E. Watson R. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the FGF-4promoter suggested that it may contain sequences that are able to bind B-Myb. We employed HeLa cells to examine the effects of B-Myb on theFGF-4 promoter, since these cells had been used previously to examine the function of FGF-4 regulatory regions (37Dailey L. Yuan H.

https://openalex.org/W2023891037,"Macrophages exposed to receptor-recognized forms of α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) demonstrate increased DNA synthesis and cell division. In the current study, we have probed the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity in the cellular response to α2M*. Ligation of the α2M* signaling receptor by α2M*, or its receptor binding fragment, increased cPLA2 activity 2–3-fold in a concentration and time-dependent manner. This activation required a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein. Cellular binding of α2M* also induced transient translocation of cPLA2 activity to nuclei and membrane fractions. Inhibition of protein kinase C activity or chelation of Ca2+ inhibited α2M*-induced increased cPLA2 activity. Binding of α2M* to macrophages, moreover, increased phosphorylation of MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK. Incubation of macrophages with inhibitors of MEK 1/2 or p38 MAPK before stimulation with α2M* profoundly decreased phosphorylation of MAPKs, blocking cPLA2 activation. α2M*-induced increase in [3H]thymidine uptake and cell proliferation was completely abolished if activation of cPLA2 was prevented. The response of macrophages to α2M* requires transcription factors nuclear factor κB, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein as well as expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc. These studies indicate that the activation of cPLA2 plays a crucial role in α2M*-induced mitogenesis and cell proliferation. Macrophages exposed to receptor-recognized forms of α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) demonstrate increased DNA synthesis and cell division. In the current study, we have probed the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity in the cellular response to α2M*. Ligation of the α2M* signaling receptor by α2M*, or its receptor binding fragment, increased cPLA2 activity 2–3-fold in a concentration and time-dependent manner. This activation required a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein. Cellular binding of α2M* also induced transient translocation of cPLA2 activity to nuclei and membrane fractions. Inhibition of protein kinase C activity or chelation of Ca2+ inhibited α2M*-induced increased cPLA2 activity. Binding of α2M* to macrophages, moreover, increased phosphorylation of MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK. Incubation of macrophages with inhibitors of MEK 1/2 or p38 MAPK before stimulation with α2M* profoundly decreased phosphorylation of MAPKs, blocking cPLA2 activation. α2M*-induced increase in [3H]thymidine uptake and cell proliferation was completely abolished if activation of cPLA2 was prevented. The response of macrophages to α2M* requires transcription factors nuclear factor κB, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein as well as expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc.

Each α2M subunit also contains an internal thiol ester, which can be directly attacked by small nucleophiles resulting in a similar conformational change (1Wu S. Pizzo S.V. Colman R.W. Hirsh J.

These receptor-recognized forms of α2M, termed α2M*, bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) present on a variety of cells including macrophages (1Wu S. Pizzo S.V.

In 1993, we demonstrated that the binding of α2M* to macrophages activated signaling cascades characterized by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (4Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the binding to macrophages activates a pertussis toxin-insensitive phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane phosphoinositides generating both IP3 and diacylglycerol (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T.

These studies also demonstrated that α2M*-mediated signal transduction was not blocked by addition of receptor-associated protein (RAP). Because RAP blocks the binding of all known ligands to LRP, this observation suggested the presence of a second α2M* receptor on macrophages, which was termed the α2M* signaling receptor (α2MSR) (1Wu S. Pizzo S.V. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Narder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thromboses: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th Ed.

In support of the identification of a distinct α2M* receptor were several other observations. Two classes of binding sites were identified on macrophages, one of high affinity and low capacity (Kd ∼ 50 pm and ∼1600 sites/cell) and the other LRP, which demonstrated lower affinity and higher binding capacity (Kd ∼2–5 nm and ∼70,000 sites/cell) (7Howard G.C.

More recent observations, however, suggest that α2M*-mediated signal transduction requires the presence of LRP on cells (13Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, Backsai et al. (13Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have shown that α2M* binding to LRP on neuronal cells mediates signaling via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. These authors suggest that an adapter protein causes LRP to associate with this receptor, allowing α2M* to activate signal transduction. Furthermore, Herz and colleagues (14Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P.

Based on our observations with respect to activation of the p21ras-dependent MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling cascades and subsequent cell proliferation, we have proposed that α2M* functions like a growth factor (9Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.

We, therefore, have studied the effect on cPLA2 activation of ligating α2M* receptors on peritoneal macrophages. Specifically, we studied activation of PKC, MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and cPLA2; translocation to nuclei and membranes; modulation of cell division by inhibitors of MAPKs and cPLA2; activation of transcription factors NFκB and CREB; and expression of c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes.

Bromoenol lactone (BEL) and pertussis toxin were procured from Sigma. Endotoxin-free α2M*, binding site mutants of α2M*, and RAP were prepared as described previously (9Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.

Antibodies against phosphorylated MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK were purchased from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies against c-Fos, c-Myc, CREB, and NFκB proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [3H]Methylcholine with specific activity of 60–90 Ci/mol was purchased from ARC (St. Louis, MO). Silica gel G plates were from Analytical Technology (Newark, DE). Lipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Xestospongin C was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), GDPβS and GTPγS were obtained fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals, and AlF3 was from Sigma. Culture media were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals and solvents used were of the highest available grade. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from pathogen-free 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3.5 mmNaHCO3 (HHBSS). The cells were washed with HHBSS and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum and plated at a cell density of 3.5–4 × 106 cells/4.5 cm2. The monolayers were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2(5%) incubator. The monolayers were washed with HHBSS three times to remove nonadherent cells, and monolayers were incubated overnight at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing the additions listed above except that 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA replaced the serum. Macrophage monolayers adhered for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium were radiolabeled with [3H]methylcholine (2 μCi/ml) for 16–18 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The monolayers were washed three times with cold HHBSS, a volume of the buffer (300 μl) added, and monolayers (3 × 106cells/well) incubated for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with 100 pm α2M, α2M*, the 17-kDa receptor-binding fragment of α2M* (RBF), or its mutant K1370A for various periods of time. Studies were also performed with EGF (10 ng/ml) as a control. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of chilled methanol. The cells were scraped into screw cap glass tubes and lipids extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). The organic layer was evaporated to dryness under N2 at 37 °C, dissolved in a volume of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1, v/v), and processed for lipids fractionation. The choline-labeled lipids were fractionated on heat activated silica gel G plates in solvent system CHCl3:CH3OH:acetic acid:H2O (65:43:1:3, v/v/v/v) (28Misra U.K. Shackelford R.E. Florine-Casteel K.

The plates were dried, exposed to I2 vapors, and gel areas corresponding to the standard lysoPC scraped into scintillation vials and their radioactivity counted to detect [3H]lysoPC derived from cPLA2-catalyzed cleavage of [3H]methylcholine. In experiments, where the effects of RAP (1 μm/10 min) or BEL, an inhibitor of Ca2+-independent PLA2 (29Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were examined, [3H]methylcholine-labeled macrophages (3 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with these agents for the specified time before adding α2M*. Other details were as described above. Macrophages (3 × 106 cells) were labeled with [3H]methylcholine as described above. The labeled monolayers were permeabilized with saponin as described previously and pretreated with GTPγS (20 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with α2M* (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This concentration was chosen after studies to determine the maximal effect of GTPγS on cPLA2 activation by α2M* (data not shown). Experimental details for lipid isolation, fractionation, and counting were as described above. To further examine the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in α2M*-induced activation of cPLA2 activity, we employed GDPβS and AlF3. GDPβS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GDP, competitively inhibits G protein activation by GTP and GTP analogs (30Gomperts B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 591-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AlF3, on the other hand, mimics the terminal phosphate of GTP, such that the structures of the Gα-GDP-AlFn complexes resemble that of the GTP-bound form of the protein (31Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4711) Google Scholar). [3H]Methylcholine-labeled macrophages were incubated overnight as above in RPMI 1640 medium, then washed twice with HHBSS. A volume of permeabilization buffer containing saponin (20 μg/ml) was added and the cells incubated for 10 min at 25 °C (32Jones L.G. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times with HHBSS and a volume of RPMI 1640 medium added. The cells were preincubated for temperature equilibration, GDPβS (1 mm) added, and the cells incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of GTPγS (20 μm). The cells were incubated for 10 min and α2M* (100 pm) added, and incubation continued for 20 min as above. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of methanol. Other details of lipid extraction, thin layer chromatography fractionation, and determining the radioactivity in the [3H]lysoPC fraction were as described above. In experiments where the effect of AlF3 was studied on activation of macrophage cPLA2 by α2M*, AlF3 was added (20 μm) to [3H]methylcholine-labeled and washed macrophages in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of α2M* (100 pm). The cells were incubated as above for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of methanol. Other details of lipid extraction, thin layer chromatography fractionation, and determination of radioactivity in the [3H]lysoPC fraction were as described above. Macrophages (3 × 106 cells) were obtained and labeled with [3H]methylcholine as described above. Pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml) was added to the monolayers during the last 12 h of incubation (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin-treated macrophages were washed with cold HHBSS, a volume of the buffer added, and the cells preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with α2M*. Other details of lipid isolation, lipid fractionation, and counting were as described above. To understand the role of G protein-coupled PI-PLC activity on cPLA2 activation in α2M*-stimulated macrophages, we employed U73122, which is an relatively specific inhibitor of G protein-mediated PI-PLC activation and PI-PLC-linked events (33Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To [3H]methylcholine-labeled and washed macrophages in RPMI 1640 medium, U73122 (2 μm) was added, cells incubated for 10 min as above and then stimulated with α2M* (100 pm/20 min). The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of methanol. Other details for quantifying radioactivity in the [3H]lysoPC fraction were as described above. We also examined the role of IP3 generated upon hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by G protein-coupled PI-PLC in cPLA2 activation, by inhibiting its binding to IP3 receptors (IP3R) and hence release of endoplasmic reticulum sequestered Ca2+, with xestospongin C, an antagonist of IP3R (34Gafni J.

To [3H]methylcholine-labeled macrophages in RPMI 1640 medium was added xestospongin C (5 μm), and the cells were incubated for 10 min as above prior to addition of α2M* (100 pm/20 min). The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of methanol added. Other details of determining radioactivity in [3H]lysoPC fraction were as described above. Murine peritoneal macrophages harvested as above were allowed to adhere for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The monolayers were washed twice with HHBSS and a volume of above RPMI medium added, followed by the addition of [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) (9Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 497-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To the respective wells α2M* (100 pm) or PDGF (10 ng/ml) were added. In experiments where the effect of AACOCF3 (20 μm/15 min), PD98059 (50 μm/90 min), or SB 203580 (15 μm/15 min) were studied, these were added to their respective wells and cells incubated for the specified time before adding α2M* or PDGF. The cells were incubated overnight in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and washing macrophages twice first with 5% trichloroacetic acid (15 min/4 °C), and then three times with HHBSS. The monolayers were lysed with 1 n NaOH and an aliquot used for liquid scintillation counting and protein estimation (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Because increased DNA synthesis is generally associated with an increase in total cellularity, the number of macrophages before and after overnight exposure to varying concentrations of α2M* was determined. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested and allowed to adhere in six-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 h as described above. The adhered cells were carefully scraped, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and suspended in 15 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, and 0.5-ml aliquots (2 × 105 cells) were pipetted into 15-ml siliconized polypropylene tubes. To the respective tubes, a specified concentration of α2M* was added, the contents mixed gently, and the tubes incubated overnight as above.

Its mode of action involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which a nonspecific binding occurs to DNA ends and a second that involves a specific binding to negative regulatory elements involved in transcription repression. Such elements were identified in mouse mammary tumor virus and human T cell leukemia virus retroviruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate a role for Ku in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transcription. First, HIV-1 LTR activity was studied in CHO-K1 cells and in CH0-derived xrs-6 cells, which are devoid of Ku80. LTR-driven expression of a reporter gene was significantly increased in xrs-6 cells. This enhancement was suppressed after re-expression of Ku80. Second, transcription of HIV-1 was followed in U1 human cells that were depleted in Ku by using a Ku80 antisense RNA. Ku depletion led to a increase of both HIV-1 mRNA synthesis and viral production compared with the parent cells. These results demonstrate that Ku acts as a transcriptional repressor of HIV-1 expression. Finally, a putative Ku-specific binding site was identified within the negative regulatory region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, which may account for this repression of transcription.

The Ku protein, a heterodimer containing both the Ku70 and Ku80 factors, was originally identified as an autoantigen recognized by the sera of patients with autoimmune disorders (1Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and peculiar DNA structures such as nicks, gaps, and hairpins (10Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Accordingly, two different mechanisms were proposed for Ku/DNA-PKcs DNA-dependent activity. First, Ku may bind to DNA ends, thereby recruiting and subsequently activating the DNA-PKcs kinase to this site (13Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Ku was shown to adopt different DNA-dependent conformations that control the recruitment and activation of DNA-PKcs (14Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This mechanism accounts for the role of Ku/DNA-PK during the repair process of double strand breaks (for a review, see Ref. 15Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R759-R761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, Ku may recruit and activate the kinase at specific sites (4Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Putative Ku-specific binding sites were proposed in a variety of genes such as c-myc r (16Pedley J. Pettit A. Parsons P.G. Melanoma Res. 1998; 8: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the transferrin receptor (17Warriar N. Page N. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

Kuff E.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), HTLV-1 (21Okumura K. Takagi S. Sakaguchi G. Naito K. Minoura-Tada N. Kobayashi H. Mimori T. Hinuma Y.

Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the latter two cases, these sequences were suggested to be involved in the negative regulation of transcription. In particular, the direct binding of Ku to the negative regulatory element 1 (NRE1) contained in the MMTV LTR was clearly demonstrated, resulting in the repression of glucocorticoid-induced MMTV transcription (4Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting, as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays using microcircles as substrates devoid of free DNA extremities, have permitted the identification of a polypurine tract (4Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) located within NRE1 as a consensus target sequence for Ku. Accordingly, sequences with similarity to this consensus compete efficiently for Ku binding even in the presence of DNA ends, whereas sequences lacking similarity to NRE1 are not recognized by Ku in the absence of DNA ends (22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid receptor is efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs in the presence of MMTV DNA sequences containing specific binding sites for both the receptor and Ku. This sequence-specific phosphorylation leads to the specific regulation of the GR-dependent promoter (14Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J.

It has also been shown that the activation of the kinase at the specific site correlates with a Ku-mediated change in the local DNA structure (14Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

Virol. 2000; 74: 11278-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To date, the experimental data supporting such a role of Ku that would involve its nonspecific binding properties remain controversial. However, in the course of their study, Debyser and co-workers (25Baekelandt V. Claeys A. Cherepanov P., De Clercq E., De Strooper B. Nuttin B. Debyser Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11278-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) noted an enhancement of the expression of an HIV-derived vector in xrs-6-rodent cells. xrs-6 cells are characterized by their lack of a functional Ku80 protein (26Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that Ku may play a role in HIV transcription repression. To address this possibility, we investigated the capability of the HIV-1 LTR to drive the transcription of a reporter gene in cells either deficient or proficient in the Ku80 factor. We observed that the LTR-driven expression was inversely correlated to the presence of Ku. This result was confirmed in HIV-1 chronically infected U1 human cells by using an antisense strategy to repress Ku expression. A decrease in the amount of Ku80 led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription, thus demonstrating that Ku is actually involved in the transcription repression of HIV-1. Finally, we report the identification of a NRE1-related site in the HIV LTR, which may account for the Ku-mediated repression of HIV transcription. All cell culture media contained 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamax, penicillin, and streptomycin. NIH3T3 and GP+envAm 12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. GP+envAm 12 (gift of Dina Markowitz) is a packaging cell line providing the viral gag,pol, and env functions. U1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. U1 (NIH 165) is a subclone of U937 chronically infected with HIV-1 and was obtained from Dr. Thomas Folks through AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (29Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). CHO and xrs cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids. Massive HIV-1 production from U1 cells was induced by adding 10 ng/ml TNFα. Basal or induced viral production was evaluated by measuring the level of p24 antigen in culture supernatant by ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell viability was evaluated by standard MTT biotransformation assay. The Moloney murine leukemia virus-based pLNCX retroviral vector contains the retroviral LTRs and PSI sequences, the bacterial neomycin resistance gene, and a multiple cloning site downstream of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Ku80 cDNA (gift of Muriel Le Romancer), cloned in reverse orientation in pCDNA3 multicloning site, was excised byXhoI/BamHI and cloned intoXhoI/BglII previously digested pLNCX to generate the pLNCX-ASKu vector. Vector DNA was transfected into packaging cell line GP+envAm 12 by using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). After G418 selection, retroviral titers were determined on NIH3T3 cells. Supernatant titer of GP+envAm 12 cells transfected with shuttle vector was 2.105 particles/ml. Plasmid pBLCAT3-LTR was created by inserting the HIV-1 LTR in the pBLCAT3 multicloning site. HIV-1 LTR was obtained after PCR amplification from the pNL4–3 genomic clone of HIV-1 with primer oligonucleotides LTR-Pst5 (5′-CTG CAG TGG AAG GGC TAA TTT GGT CCC-3′) and LTR-Xba3 (5′-TCT AGA TGC TAG AGA TTT TCC ACA CTG-3′) followed by TA cloning in pGemT vector (Promega). PstI-XbaI fragment from pGemT-LTR was cloned into pBLCAT3 digested withPstI-XbaI. Plasmid EF1α-βgal is a gift from Corinne Nicolas-Cabanne. Plasmid pcDNA3-Ku80 contains the human Ku80 cDNA under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter and theneo gene coding for G418 resistance. On the day of infection, 5 × 105 U1 cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 2 ml of medium containing viral particles (multiplicity of infection = 0.01). At 24 h, cells were transferred into fresh medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 for selection. G418-resistant cells were analyzed 3 weeks later. 5 × 104CHO-K1 or xrs-6 cells were transiently transfected with 1.8 μg of pBLCAT3-LTR and with 0.2 μg of EF1α-βgal per well in six-well plates using Superfect transfecting reagent (Qiagen). Cells were assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase contents 48 h post-transfection by CAT and β-galactosidase ELISA kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable transfection of xrs-6 cells with pcDNA3-Ku80 was carried out with Superfect. 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm dish and transfected with 5 μg of DNA. Transfected cells were selected 3 days later with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) and grown as a polyclonal population or as independent clones. Cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and 5 × 106 cells/ml were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm NaF, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 450 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After three freeze/thaw cycles, samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein concentration in supernatants was determined using a standard Bradford assay. Total proteins were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto nylon membranes. Membranes were washed in TBS, blocked in 5% dry nonfat milk/TBS, and then incubated with 0.2 μg of anti-Ku80 antibody (Serotec) in TBS, 0.05% Tween. Blots were washed in TBS/Tween and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature. Visualization was achieved using a chemiluminescence assay (Bio-Rad). All buffers contained a complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in 3 ml of STM buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.85, 250 mmsucrose, 1.1 mm MgCl2) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 4 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet, mostly containing the unbroken nuclei, was re-suspended in 1 ml of STM buffer and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were then re-suspended in STM buffer containing 0.4 m KCl and incubated 10 min at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was collected and used as nuclear extract. Nuclear extract (10 μg) was incubated with a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-GGG CCA AGA ATC TTA GCA GTT TCG GG-3′ in binding buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.4 mNaCl, 200 μg/ml plasmid DNA) for 5 min at 4 °C. For supershift, anti-Ku80 antibody was added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed 10 min longer. Ku·DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized on a phosphorimager screen. Total RNA was extracted (Rneasy, Qiagen) from 1 million of nontreated or TNFα-induced (2 days after induction) U1 or ASKu cells. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) primers (M-MLV RT, Promega). 1 μl of the resulting cDNA was used as template for the following PCR. The PCR was performed in PerkinElmerTaq buffer II, supplemented with 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 μm concentration of each primer, 200 μm dNTP, and 1.5 units of Gold AmpliTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers used to amplify HIV-1 multispliced mRNAs were primer GH4 (5′-GAC TGG TGA GTA CGC CAA A-3′), localized immediately downstream of the 5′ LTR sequence and primer primRT5 (5′-GCT AAG GAT CCG TTC ACT AA-3′), at a 3′ position with respect to the 3′-most splice acceptor site of the full-length mRNA. The PCR conditions used to amplify multispliced HIV-1 mRNAs were: preincubation 10 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 53.4 °C, 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, followed by a final step of 10 min at 72 °C. Parallel PCR reactions were performed to amplify the mRNA of the housekeeping gene G3PDH to normalize the results obtained for HIV-1 messengers. The primers used were: forward 5′-TGA AGG TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT-3′, reverse 5′-CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC C-3′. The same conditions as above were used to amplify the G3PDH except that a temperature of 60 °C was used for the annealing step and the number of cycles was comprised between 22 and 27. The G3PDH PCR products were detected with ethidium bromide staining. HIV-1 PCR products were detected with Southern hybridization using a radiolabeled probe made of the entire HIV-1 NL43 genome. Both PCR products were quantified by densitometric analysis. The possible effect of Ku80 on the HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription was investigated by transient transfection assays in CHO-K1 and xrs-6 cells. xrs-6 cells are CHO-K1-derived cells lacking Ku80 expression (26Getts R.C.

A plasmid construct containing the CAT gene under the control of the complete HIV-1 LTR was transfected in both cell lines, and expression of the reporter gene was quantified in cells 48 h following the transfection. As presented in Fig.1, the activity of the HIV-1 LTR promoter underwent a 5-fold increase in xrs-6 Ku-negative cells compared with the expression in parent CHO-K1 cells, thus suggesting a possible role for Ku80 in the repression of the LTR promoter. To confirm that the lack of Ku80 was responsible for expression enhancement, the mutant xrs-6 cells were stably transfected with a pCDNA3 expression vector coding for the full-length human Ku80 sequence. Several G418-resistant clones were isolated and monitored for Ku80 expression by either immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Results are shown in Fig. 2. The immunoblot was performed using an antibody directed against the human Ku80 protein. Since Ku is a highly conserved protein, the detection of constitutive hamster Ku80 in CHO extracts was possible (see Fig. 2, panel A). An extract from human CEM cells was used as a control for Ku80 identification on the gel. As expected, no Ku80 was present in xrs-6 cells, whereas the protein was readily detected in CHO-K1 extracts. As seen in Fig. 2, panel A, cells from the CHO-K1 parent cell line, the polyclonal population (xk-pc), as well as from the two independent clones xk4 and xk5 expressed the human Ku80 factor. Interestingly, we also obtained the xk2 clone, which possessed a significant G418 resistance without significant expression of Ku80. This clone was used in further experiments as an experimental control.Figure 2Determination of Ku content and activity in xrs-6 cells stably transfected with Ku80 full-length cDNA. A, immunoblot analysis of 30 μg of total proteins from CHO-K1, xrs-6, and xrs-6 cells stably transfected with human Ku80 cDNA (clones xk-2, xk-4, xk-5, and polyclonal cells xk-p). 5 μg of human cells (CEM) proteins were used as a control for human Ku80 detection. Ku was revealed using an antibody raised against human Ku80. Homogenous protein transfer was assessed by Ponceau red staining. B, DNA end binding activity in CHO,xrs-6, xk-2, xk-4, xk-5 clones, and xk-p polyclonal cells. 10 or 20 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with [α-32P]dATP-labeled M1/M2 oligonucleotide probe and separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel. 10 μg of CHO-K1 nuclear extracts were further incubated with anti-Ku80 antibody to confirm the presence of Ku80 in the complex by inducing a supershift of this one.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate that the human Ku80 was functional in xrs-6 cells expressing the Ku80 full-length cDNA, EMSA was performed to investigate DNA end binding activity in selected clones. Previous studies indicated that Ku is the major DNA end binding activity in cell extracts (30Marangoni E., Le Romancer M. Foray N. Muller C. Douc-Rasy S. Vaganay S. Abdulkarim B. Barrois M. Calsou P. Bernier J. Salles B. Bourhis J. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, panel B, a shifted complex was observed with CHO-K1 extracts. The amount of complex was related to the quantity of cell extract and the involvement of Ku80 in this dependent DNA end binding shift was unequivocally confirmed, since it was possible to supershift the band using an anti-Ku80 antibody. In contrast, the shifted complex was not present in the Ku80-deficient cell line xrs-6. Furthermore, the DNA end binding activity was restored in the polyclonal cell population xk-pc and in clonal xk4 and xk5 cells that expressed Ku80 but not Ku80-deficient clone xk2, which showed no detectable Ku80 expression. Transcription from HIV-1 LTR was evaluated in xk-pc polyclonal cells and in the three independent clones xk2, xk4, and xk5 cells and compared with both parental Ku80-deficient xrs-6 and Ku80-proficient CHO-K1 cells. All cell lines were transiently transfected with an LTR-CAT construct, and CAT expression was measured 48 h post-transfection. Results from this experiment are shown on Fig.3. The CAT activity was decreased by a 2-fold factor in cells expressing human Ku80 compared with xrs-6 cells. Again, the Ku80-deficient xk-2 clone showed a different behavior with no inhibition of HIV-1 expression. Altogether these data demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT expression was inversely correlated to the amount of Ku80 present in the transfected cells, allowing us to conclude that the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity was negatively regulated by the Ku factor. Since our data demonstrated a regulation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter in rodent cells, we were interested in assessing next whether this conclusion could be extended to human cells that are a current target for HIV-1. To address that issue, we used an antisense strategy to decrease the expression of Ku80 in human U1 cells, which are chronically infected with HIV-1. This strategy was previously reported to be efficient for studying the effects of a Ku depletion in several human cell lines (30Marangoni E., Le Romancer M. Foray N. Muller C. Douc-Rasy S. Vaganay S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A retroviral expression vector coding for an antisense RNA containing the complete coding sequence of Ku80 was constructed. An amphotropic virus-packaging murine cell line, GPAm112, was transfected with this construct or with the empty vector pLNCX, and cells resistant to geneticin were selected and used as a source of recombinant virus. HIV-1 chronically infected U1 cells were transduced with the retroviral vector and selected for G418 resistance as a polyclonal cell population (U1-AsKu). The expression of Ku80 was measured by Western blotting. As shown on Fig.4, panel A, an immunoblotting assay with anti-Ku80 antibody indicated a 2-fold depletion in Ku80 content in cells expressing the Ku80 antisense compared with the parent U1 cell line, indicating that Ku80 production was efficiently impaired in the antisense expressing cells. It was not possible to obtain a stronger depletion due to loss of cell viability in deeply depleted cell population. EMSA was then performed to evaluate the DNA end binding activity in the Ku80-depleted U1-AsKu cells. As shown on Fig.4, panel B, U1-ASKu cells showed a lower DNA end binding activity compared with parent U1 cells. Hence, we conclude that the transfection of the Ku80 antisense was efficient in lowering Ku80 activity in human U1 cells. U1 cells are chronically infected cells that display a low basal viral production. Massive HIV-1 production can be induced by adding TNFα. In a first experiment, shown in Fig. 5,panel A, the basal production in U1 and U1-ASKu cells was followed over 168 h after medium change. U1 cells infected with an empty pLNCX vector were also selected and characterized for HIV-1 production as a control of an eventual effect on G418 resistance. In a second experiment shown in Fig. 5, panel B, the induction of HIV-1 production was followed over a 48-h period following TNFα addition. Results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that, in either experiment, HIV-1 production was ∼2-fold higher in U1 cells presenting a Ku80 depletion than for parental cells. The level of viral production of pLNCX control cells (U1-pLN) was also significantly lower than the one obtained for U1 depleted cells under all conditions. In parallel, the cell growth was monitored to eliminate a bias that could arise from a modification in the multiplication rate. As shown in Fig.5, panel C, the three cell populations behaved similarly with indistinguishable growth rates in all experiments. Furthermore, the Ku80 depletion already gave rise to an increase in viral production in noninduced cells (see Fig. 5, panel A), thus indicating that the increase in viral production levels in Ku80-depleted cells was not due to a modulation of the TNFα induction pathway. Finally, to determine whether the enhancement of HIV-1 expression in Ku80-depleted U1 cells was due to a stimulation of transcription, we performed a RT-PCR analysis to follow the variation of the HIV-1 mRNA amounts. Results of the experiment are shown in Fig.6. mRNAs of the homing gene G3PDH were PCR-amplified to normalize the signal obtained with HIV-1 RNAs (Fig. 6, panel A). A significant increase in the overall level of HIV-1 messengers was obtained"

In minichromosomes assembled in vitro the synergism between steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1) on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter does not require the proline-rich transactivation domain (PRD) of NF1. Here we show that similar results are obtained in yeast. In contrast, replacing the native hormone-responsive elements (HREs) by a single HRE results in a more accessible chromatin and makes the synergism with SHR dependent on the PRD of NF1. Following hormone induction, in addition to glucocorticoid receptor, the DNA binding domain of NF1 is needed and sufficient for establishing an open chromatin conformation on the wild type MMTV promoter. Thus, NF1 acts as a classical transcription factor in a relaxed chromatin context, whereas in the context of the wild type chromatin DNA binding of NF1 is sufficient to cooperate with SHRs by stabilizing an open chromatin conformation.

Regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription is achieved by combinatorial and synergistic interactions among transcription factors and co-regulators on promoter and/or enhancer regions. Several mechanisms have been claimed to mediate the functional synergism between transcription factors, including cooperative DNA binding, direct interaction between factors, simultaneous interactions with components of the general transcriptional machine or with common co-activators, as well as chromatin-mediated processes. Among the latter there are two main classes of enzymatic mechanisms, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (1Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Trends Biochem.

To analyze the contribution of these different mechanisms in a natural sequence context, we have chosen to study the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 1The abbreviations used are:MMTVmouse mammary tumor virusSHRsteroid hormone receptorNF1nuclear factor 1PRDproline-rich transactivation domainDBDDNA binding domainHREhormone-responsive elementsDHSDNase I hypersensitive siteHRhormone receptorGRglucocorticoid receptorDACdeacylcortivazolGEMSAgel electrophoretic mobility shift assay promoter as an example of a promoter induced by steroid hormones (for review, see Ref.6Beato M. Truss M. Chavez S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 784: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter is organized into positioned nucleosomes and silent in the absence of hormones, while it is rapidly activated in response to glucocorticoids or progestins (7Hager G.L. Archer T.K.

Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The promoter encompasses a composite regulatory unit of 148 bp containing five partly degenerated hormone-responsive elements (HREs) upstream of a binding site for nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and two octamer motifs. The HREs are recognized by the receptors for glucocorticoids or progestins, which are ligand-activated transcription factors. The hormone receptors (HRs) interact with the major groove of DNA as homodimers contacting a narrow sector of the double helix (9Scheidereit C. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3029-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NF1 represents a ubiquitous family of transcription factors encoded by at least four different genes, which give rise to several variants due to alternative splicing (10Kruse U. Sippel A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All variants share a conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and bind as dimers to palindromic sites, completely surrounding the DNA double helix (11Eisfeld K. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The variants differ in their C-terminal moiety, which has been shown to carry proline-rich transactivation domains (PRDs) (12Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Hormone induction in vivo leads to chromatin remodeling over the regulatory unit manifested by a DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) (15Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L.

This is accompanied by simultaneous occupancy of all thecis-acting elements on the surface of a nucleosome-like particle resulting in functional synergism between the bound factors (8Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Chalepakis G. Arnemann J. Slater E. Bruller H.J. Gross B. Beato M.

However, on either naked DNA or MMTV mononucleosomes, HRs do not cooperate with NF1 for binding to their cognate sites in the promoter (14Piña B. Brüggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 19Brüggemeier U. Rogge L. Winnacker E.L. Beato M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the two proteins do not synergize in transcription assays with free MMTV DNA as template (20Kalff M. Gross B. Beato M. Nature. 1990; 344: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As nucleosome depletion eliminates the synergism between receptors and NF1, we have suggested that chromatin is required for synergism and, thus, for efficient activation of the promoter (21Chávez S. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using MMTV minichromosomes assembled in Drosophila embryo extracts we have shown that chromatin is required for the synergistic binding of progesterone receptor B (PRB) and NF1 in a two-step process. First, PRB binds to the accessible HREs and recruits an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity, which transiently opens the chromatin and permits access of NF1 to the promoter. In turn, bound NF1 facilitates the binding of additional PR molecules (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism of activation of the MMTV promoter, we have analyzed the contribution of the PRD of NF1 to the synergism with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on the MMTV promoter inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We have chosen budding yeast because the MMTV promoter behaves in yeast essentially as in mammalian cells, provided the relevant transcription factors are artificially expressed (23Chávez S. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, contrary to metazoan cells that are rich in NF1, yeast offers the possibility to manipulate the levels of various NF1 isoforms in the absence of an endogenous homologue. Here we show that DNA binding of NF1 is required for stable hormone-dependent chromatin remodeling over the MMTV promoter. In titration experiments we show that the activity of the MMTV promoter is limited by the amount of ligand-activated GR and not by the levels of NF1. The DNA binding domain of NF1, which is devoid of significant transactivation activity, synergizes with GR in transactivation and chromatin remodeling. Similar results are obtained with MMTV minichromosomes assembled in extracts fromDrosophila embryos and transcribed in the presence of PRB and either full-length NF1 or the NF1-DBD. In contrast, on a mutant MMTV promoter displaying an open chromatin conformation the synergism between NF1 and GR depends on the transactivation domain of NF1. Thus, the mechanism of synergistic transactivation by hormone receptors and NF1 differs depending on the chromatin organization of the MMTV promoter. The yeast strain used in this study was YPH499 (a ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ1 ura3-52 lys2-801) (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth and manipulation were according to standard procedures (25Adams R. Gottschling D. Stearn T. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). p415MCTFbd consists in aBamHI-HindIII NF1-C229 fragment inserted atBamHI-HindIII of p415MET25. ptCTF2 and ptCTFbd are YEp expresion vectors for tagged (His-tag and hemagglutinin-tag) NF1-C2 and NF1-C229. NF1 open reading frames were PCR-amplified, cut with HindIII, and inserted at the HindIII site of pAAH5. Transcription activity was determined by β-galactosidase assay of permeabilized cells (30Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight in the appropriate selective medium at 30 °C, diluted to A 660: 0.1 and incubated with hormone (deacylcortivazol, DAC) or vehicle for an additional 8 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed for activity, given in β-galactosidase units. The minichromosomes assembly and the cell-free transcription reactions were performed as described previously (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For the preparation of the DNA probe the oligonucleotides 5′-cctttggcactgtgccaaag-3′ and 5′-ctttggcacagtgccaaagg-3′ were annealed, gel-purified, and end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. All binding reactions contained 5 μg of yeast protein extract prepared as described previously (31McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), 12 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 210 mm KCl, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 4.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5–1 ng of the labeled probe in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (4 h at 200 V) on 5% polyacrylamide-10% glycerol gels (acrylamide to bisacrylamide weight ratio of 37.5:1) in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. Quantification of DNA complexes was performed by a PhosphorImager. Mapping of DHS was performed by indirect end labeling as described previously (23Chávez S. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformants were grown in appropriate selective medium to mid-log phase and incubated with 1 μm DAC or vehicle for 60 min. Cells were then harvested, and spheroplasts were prepared and treated with different amounts of DNase I. After DNA extraction, DNase I-cleaved genomic DNA samples were restricted with ClaI, resolved in a 1.5% agarose gels, blotted onto Qiabrane nylon-plus membrane, and probed with a 200-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the sequence of thelacZ gene situated immediately upstream of theClaI site. Plasmid DNA cleaved by ClaI andSacI (position −108) or DraI (−198) served as an internal size marker. The restriction enzyme assays were performed essentially as described previously (32Venditti P., Di Croce L. Kauer M. Blank T. Becker P.B. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 50 units of HinfI were used instead of 200 units, and the second restriction cleavage for the HRE/MMTVΔ template was performed with PvuII. The accessibility of the NF1 binding site on the MMTV promoter in yeast is limited by the presence of a positioned nucleosome, which is also required for the synergism between GR and NF1 (21Chávez S. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Removal of the region containing the HREs, as in MMTVΔ (Fig.1 A), makes the NF1 binding site more accessible by destabilizing the positioned nucleosome (26Candau R. Chávez S. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We used this truncated MMTVΔ promoter to test whether the transcriptional response depends on the levels of NF1 in the cell. Toward this end we expressed NF1-C1 (Fig. 1 B) under the control of the MET25 promoter that is regulated by the levels of methionine. This yielded levels of active NF1-C1 that varied by a factor of 15, as determined by GEMSA (Fig.2 C). As expected, transactivation increased linearly with the level of NF1-C1 (Fig.2 A), demonstrating that the PRD is active in yeast and that, within the concentration range tested, there is no other limiting factor. A similar behavior was observed with the wild type MMTV promoter in the absence of ligand, although the absolute values were 10-fold lower and there was no detectable activation at low concentrations of NF1 (Fig. 2 B, squares,right ordinate). However, when the wild type MMTV promoter was assayed in the presence of 100 nm of the agonistic ligand DAC, the activity increased to high levels already at the lowest concentration of NF1 and did not increase further at higher NF1 concentrations (Fig. 2 B, circles, left ordinate). The synergism between GR and NF1 was around 6-fold even at concentrations of NF1 that were insufficient for significant activation of the truncated MMTVΔ or the wild type MMTV promoter in the absence of hormone (Fig. 2 D). These data suggest that GR-mediated chromatin remodeling facilitates entry of NF1 and that the affinity of NF1 for the remodeled wild type MMTV chromatin is high compared with its affinity for the nonremodeled wild type MMTV chromatin or the MMTVΔ chromatin.Figure 2Effect of NF1-C1 concentration on the MMTV promoter activity.

The synergism with GR was also lower but independent of the NF1 concentration (Fig. 2 B,triangles, left ordinate, and Fig. 2 D,shadowed bars). At higher concentrations of DAC, in the micromolar range, GR alone was already able to activate the MMTV promoter rather efficiently, and the synergism with NF1 was markedly reduced or even insignificant (data not shown). Collectively, our data confirm that the levels of activated GR are the main determinant of the degree of activation of the promoter and that NF1 helps GR only when the activated receptor is present at suboptimal concentrations (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NF1 is present in metazoan cells in several variants that all share the N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domains, whereas their C-terminal half harbors a variable PRD capable of enhancing transcription in yeast, Drosophila, and HeLa cells (12Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2946-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To directly test the role of the PRD in the synergism with GR on the MMTV promoter, we deleted the whole proline-rich region of NF1 (C319, Fig. 1 B). This deletion did not affect the amount of DNA-binding protein, as determined by GEMSA (data not shown). As expected, the deletion mutant showed an insignificant activation of the truncated MMTVΔ, compared with the 12-fold activation displayed by the wild type NF1-C1 (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the NF1-C319 mutant exhibited similar synergism with the activated GR as the wild type NF1-C1 protein (Fig. 3 B). We have observed a similar synergism with two additional NF1-C variants (C2 and C7) previously shown to transactivate differently in yeast (28Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that NF1 transactivation is dispensable for synergism with GR. In addition, because the absolute values were very similar for all NF variants and mutants (Fig. 3 B and data not shown), one must assume that the PRD of NF1 is not operative in the context of the GR-activated MMTV chromatin. The DNA sequence spanning the five HREs plays a critical role in the maintenance of well organized chromatin structure over the MMTV promoter, as deduced from the increase in NF1 activity and nuclease accessibility observed in the MMTVΔ promoter (Refs. 21Chávez S. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 26Candau R. Chávez S. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). To study the synergism between GR and NF1 in the absence of a regular chromatin organization we cloned a 15-bp consensus HRE just upstream of the NF1 site in the MMTVΔ promoter (Fig. 1 A, HRE/MMTVΔ). The activity of NF1 is the same in both MMTVΔ and HRE/MMTVΔ (compare NF1 activities in Fig. 3, A and C, without hormone), suggesting that the NF1 site remains accessible after addition of the single HRE (see below). In the HRE/MMTVΔ promoter, the PRD of NF1 is active in the presence of activated GR, as shown by the decrease in activity caused by its deletion (Fig. 3,NF1-C319). Moreover, in this mutant MMTV promoter there is 4.8-fold synergism between activated GR and NF1, and this synergism requires the PRD of NF1 (Fig. 3 C, 100 nm DAC). Thus, the lack of function of the PRD of NF1 in terms of synergism with GR on the wild type MMTV promoter does not reflect an inherent property of the protein or the lack of necessary co-activators, but must be due to the organization of the promoter. The N-terminal portion of NF1-C (exons 1–4) is sufficient for site-specific DNA recognition and protein dimerization (13Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 34Meisterernst M. Rogge L. Foeckler R. Karaghiosoff M. Winnacker E.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8191-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PRD-deficient mutant NF1-C319 contains two additional exons coding for a protein sequence that has been claimed to be involved in NF1 transactivation (28Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 2F. Prado, R. Koop, and M. Beato, unpublished data. We wondered whether just the DBD of NF1 (C229, Fig.1 B) would be sufficient for the synergism with GR on the MMTV promoter. To test this idea we expressed NF1-C229 using the methionine regulated vector. As shown in Fig.4 A, NF1-C229 does not activate the MMTV promoter in the absence of hormone. Most importantly, NF1-C229 is able to synergize rather efficiently with GR (Fig. 4, Aand B). Collectively, our results are compatible with the notion that DNA binding of NF1 to its target site on the MMTV promoter is sufficient for synergism with activated GR in a well organized chromatin context. In mammalian cells, glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter is known to generate a DHS over the region containing the HREs (8Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 16Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 35Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), but the role of NF1 in this process could not be tested due to its ubiquitous expression. To explore whether remodeling of MMTV chromatin can be achieved by activated GR alone or whether NF1 is necessary, we performed in vivo DHS assays in yeast. In the absence of NF1, ligand-activated GR did not generate a DHS over the MMTV promoter (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and5 with lanes 7 and 8). In agreement with the functional data, however, we found a hormone-induced DHS in MMTV chromatin of yeast cells expressing NF1-C2 and GR (Fig. 5, comparelanes 10 and 11 with lanes 13 and14). Therefore, NF1 is required for efficient remodeling of MMTV chromatin following hormone induction. A similar hormone-dependent change in chromatin structure was observed in cells expressing GR and NF1-C229 (Fig. 5, comparelanes 16 and 17 with lanes 19 and20). Thus, the DBD of NF1 can fulfill the same function as the natural NF1 variants in terms of cooperating with ligand-activated GR to generate a remodeled chromatin structure over the nucleosome B of the MMTV promoter. To test whether the specific requirement for synergism between NF1 and GR was also found with another receptor and under different conditions, we used the same wild type and mutant MMTV promoters along with recombinant human PRB and NF1 for transcription experimentsin vitro. To this end the corresponding templates were assembled into minichromosomes in extracts from Drosophilaembryos and transcribed in a HeLa cell nuclear extract (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the wild type MMTV promoter is organized into positioned nucleosomes (32Venditti P., Di Croce L. Kauer M. Blank T. Becker P.B. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and virtually repressed in these minichromosomes (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A,lane 1). Incubation with either PRB (lane 2) or NF1 (lane 3) resulted in very little transcription, whereas incubation with both proteins together led to very robust transcription (lane 5). In this particular experiment the synergism between PRB and NF1 was 13-fold. Recombinant NF1-DBD alone was unable to activate transcription on its own (lane 4), but in conjunction with PRBresulted in a similar transcriptional synergism as observed the intact NF1 protein (lane 6). On minichromosomes containing the HRE/MMTVΔ promoter, the core promoter was more accessible to the basal transcriptional machinery than on wild type MMTV minichromosomes (compare lanes 1 and7). PRB alone was able to activate transcription to a higher extent (compares lane 2 and 7 withlane 8), and NF1 also produced a slight increase in transcription (compare lanes 7 and 9). The two proteins did synergize on the HRE/MMTVΔ minichromosomes, although to a lesser extent than on wild type minichromosomes (synergism, 5-fold). The NF1-DBD was transcriptional inert on the HRE/MMTVΔ minichromosomes (compare lanes 7 and 10) and was also unable to synergize with PRB on these minichromosomes (compare lanes 8 and 12). Therefore, as with GR in yeast, the requirement for the PRD of NF1 is promoter-specific and correlates with the organization of the promoter in chromatin. The accessibility for PRB of the HRE/MMTVΔ minichromosomes already indicates an open chromatin conformation. To test this notion in a more direct way we measured the cleavage efficiency at a HinfI restriction site, which overlaps with the NF1 binding site and is located within the confines of nucleosome B (32Venditti P., Di Croce L. Kauer M. Blank T. Becker P.B. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). With wild type MMTV minichromosomes less than 2% of the templates were cleaved within 2 min (Fig. 6 B, lane 3), suggesting a tight chromatin structure. In contrast, with HRE/MMTVΔ minichromosomes over 30% of the templates were cleaved during the same period of time (lane 4), indicating a more relaxed chromatin organization. The kinetics of cleavage of the two templates over a period of 20 min shows that this difference is stable over time and thus likely reflects a difference in the starting chromatin organization of the templates (Fig. 6 B,inset). The MMTV promoter is activated by glucocorticoids or progestins in a process that involves a synergistic interaction between GR or PR and NF1. Based on titration experiments with wild type and mutant proteins in yeast, we have shown here that NF1 does not act like a conventional transcription factor in the context of the activated MMTV promoter. The PRD of NF1 is neither operative nor needed for synergism with GR in yeast. Following hormone induction and GR binding to the exposed HREs, binding of NF1 to its cognate site on the MMTV promoter is promoted, required, and sufficient for full activation of the GR-triggered promoter. Hence, there is a functional synergism between GR and the DBD of NF1. Similarly, on MMTV minichromosomes transcribed in vitro, PR synergizes with NF1 or its DBD, while the transactivation domain is not required. This novel kind of synergism depends on the proper organization of the promoter in chromatin, which is mediated by the region containing the natural array of five HREs. Replacing the natural HREs by a single canonical HRE disturbs the chromatin organization and makes the synergism with GR or PR dependent on the PRD of NF1. Therefore, the lack of function of the PRD in the context of the MMTV promoter is not due to the inability of this domain to synergize with GR in vitro or in yeast, nor to the absence of relevant co-activators in this organism. In mammalian cells, hormone-dependent activation of the MMTV promoter is accompanied by the appearance of a DHS over the nucleosome B, which has been interpreted as the consequence of nucleosome disruption (16Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 35Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Following glucocorticoid induction of cells carrying chromosomally integrated copies of the MMTV promoter, we find an increase in nuclease sensitivity in the vicinity of the pseudodyad axis of nucleosome B and a concomitant occupation of all the HREs and the NF1 site, as judged by genomic footprinting (8Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We interpreted these findings as indicative of an open nucleosome B conformation induced by GR binding and compatible with simultaneous binding of all transcription factors to the promoter. At that time we could not decide whether the activated receptor alone was able to induce this conformational change or whether NF1 was also needed. Our results in yeast now show that GR alone is not sufficient to induce a stable structural modification of chromatin. Rather NF1 is required for the generation of a DHS over nucleosome B. More importantly, the DBD of NF1 is sufficient for this effect. This suggests that the main function of NF1 in the context of the activated MMTV promoter is to bind to DNA and to stabilize an “open” chromatin conformation. The stabilizing effect may arise from the high affinity of NF1 for its target site on free DNA in combination with its inability to bind to this site on positioned nucleosomes containing a full complement of core histones (11Eisfeld K. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Piña B. Brüggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The nature of the open chromatin conformation stabilized by NF1 binding remains obscure, but it may include a total or partial dissociation of histone H2A/H2B dimers, as NF1 binds efficiently to MMTV promoter sequences positioned on a tetramer of histones H3 and H4 (36Spangenberg C. Eisfeld K. Stunkel W. Luger K. Flaus A. Richmonds T.J. Truss M. Beato M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, NF1 amplifies the transcriptional response of the MMTV promoter at low concentration of activated GR in vivo, likely by the same mechanism by which it reduces the amount of PR needed for full occupancy of the HREs in vitro (22Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As shown in our titration experiments, this auxillary role is accomplished with high efficiency, since very low amounts of NF1 are required to reach maximal activity. This mechanism of activation depends of the accurate chromatin organization of the MMTV promoter. Whereas, in response to the ligand the receptors can bind to well organized chromatin and thus initiate the activation of the promoter, NF1 is unable to trigger this process, because it cannot access its target site within positioned nucleosomes (11Eisfeld K. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Piña B. Brüggemeier U. Beato M. Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, NF1 can only act on promoters that have been fired by activated receptors. It cooperates with the receptors by maintaining an open chromatin structure, which is required for the entry of additional receptor molecules. The DBD of NF1 is sufficient for this structural role, which probably can only take place when the HREs and the NF1 binding sites are located within the same positioned nucleosome. Triggering by the receptors must be the rate-limiting step in the promoter activation cascade, as suggested by our observation that the levels of activated GR determines the absolute induction values. That this kind of synergism depends on correctly positioned nucleosomes is suggested by the results obtained when nucleosome positioning is disturbed, as in the case of the HRE/MMTVΔ promoter. This alteration in chromatin structure makes the NF1 site more accessible and enables NF1 to contribute to the activation of promoters via its own transactivation domain. In this situation, however, the DBD of NF1 alone is not sufficient. Although confirmation in animal cells is necessary, our results in yeast show that the precise chromatin organization over the regulatory region of MMTV allows a fine-tuning of the proviral promoter by providing a platform for factor cooperation. Two models have been proposed to explain the activation of promoters by various inducing agents, the gradual model and the binary model. The gradual model assumes the existence of multiple states of promoter activity, depending on the dose of the inducing agent and on the strength and combinations of transactivators. The stochastic binary model proposes that there are only two possible states of any promoter, “on” and “off,” and that the strength of a particular promoter is an intrinsic property of its core elements (37Walters M.C. Fiering S. Eidemiller J. Magis W. Groudine M. Martin D.I.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7125-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 38Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this model, the increase in transcription levels found with increasing amounts of activators is attributed to the recruitment of an increasing proportion of promoters from the off into the on state. The binary model has been shown to apply to the hormonal induction of the MMTV promoter in mammalian cells (39Ko M.S.H. Nakauchi H. Takahashi N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2835-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and may explain why the PRD of NF1 is not operative in the context of the wild type MMTV promoter. It has been reported that a graded response can be converted into an all-or-none binary response by either a competition of transactivators and transrepressors for the same DNA regulatory element (40Rossi F.M. Kringstein A.M. Spicher A. Guicherit O.M. Blau H.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 723-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or the introduction of a positive feedback loop (41Becskei A. Seraphin B. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Our results are compatible with the participation of both mechanisms in the activation of the MMTV promoter. On the one side, a positioned nucleosome acts as a repressor that competes with binding of the transactivator NF1. On the other, receptor-mediated NF1 binding acts a positive feedback loop for binding of additional hormone receptors molecules. Along this line, we predict that the HRE/MMTVΔ will behave in a more graded fashion. Although our mechanistic view of the induction process remains purely hypothetical, it provides a theoretical frame for exploring how the same two transcription factors acting on the same core promoter synergize by two different mechanisms depending on the DNA sequence information context.

It has been shown in the case of CF disease that the ion transport across the airway epithelia is abnormal and is characterized by decreased Cl− secretion and increased Na+absorption (7Welsh M.J. Liedtke C.M. Nature. 1986; 322: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin.

With the recognition that CFTR, a Cl− channel, is defectively trafficked to the plasma membrane of CF epithelia, a hypothesis that CFTR down-regulates ENaC function was proposed to provide an explanation for the increased Na+ absorption and decreased Cl− secretion in these epithelia (19Stutts M.J.

Subsequently, several laboratories have provided evidence for the functional interdependence and physical interactions between these two ion channels (20Chan L.N. Wang X.F. Tsang L.L. Liu C.Q.

In addition, a variety of proteins including actin and other regulatory agents have been shown to interact with ENaC and regulate its channel kinetics (26Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J.

J. 2001; 80: 2176-2186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies collectively indicated that the function of ENaC is finely regulated. The amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are diverse and differ widely in conductance and ion selectivity (2Palmer L.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bradford A.L. Fuller C.M. Senyk O. Ismailov I.I. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1632-1637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the genes coding for these diverse channels are not known. On the other hand, the most distinguishable biophysical properties of the cloned ENaC are the low channel conductance of ∼5 pS, high selectivity for sodium, and slow gating with open and closed times on the order of seconds (11Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Although these features of ENaC expressed in mammalian andXenopus oocytes were consistently reproduced by investigators using mainly the patch-clamp technique, Benos and co-workers (33Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have observed that ENaC in planar lipid bilayers exhibits three open state conductance levels of 13, 26, and 40 pS with rapid gating. They have shown that these unusual biophysical properties of ENaC could be reversed to the expected upon interactions with actin in the planar lipid bilayers, suggesting that cytoskeletal proteins also modulate ENaC function (34Jovov B. Tousson A., Ji, H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, this study firmly established that both patch clamping and planar lipid bilayer reconstitution procedures yield identical results, quelling doubts on the suitability of the latter technique in the ENaC analysis. Thus, it appears possible that ENaC can potentially exhibit diverse biophysical properties that could match the properties of other amiloride-sensitive channels whose protein sequences are still unknown. To investigate the biochemical properties of ENaC, we have established the Sf9 insect cell-baculovirus (BV) expression system to produce rENaC as a complex of α-rENaC, β-rENaC, and γ-rENaC subunits (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels with conductance levels of ∼6 pS were observed, the membranes containing ENaC also exhibited large conductance cation-selective channels of >300 pS. The results presented in this paper suggest that these large conductance channels are exclusively found in membranes containing either α-rENaC subunit alone or in membranes containing αβγ-rENaC complex. The results also indicate that amiloride acts as a flickery block to the large conductance channels in membranes containing αβγ-rENaC complex, a characteristic of its action on ENaC. Construction of recombinant α-BV, β-BV, and γ-BV carrying the α-, β-, and γ-rENaC cDNAs, respectively, and the αβγ-BV harboring all of the three rENaC subunit cDNAs was reported previously (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As controls, recombinant BVs carrying the MDR1 cDNA, breast cancer resistance protein (52Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K. Ross D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15665-15670Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) cDNA, and Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase cDNA were used. The Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 27 °C as suspension in 250-ml spinner flasks stirring at a rate of 70 rpm. For the production of rENaC, ∼30 million cells were seeded into each T-175 cm2 flask and infected with the recombinant BV. At 72 h post-infection, the cells were scraped into the medium and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed once with an ice-cold buffer containing 300 mm mannitol, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, with HCl and then resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The cell suspension was homogenized at 0 °C for 5 min in a glass Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pelleted total membrane fraction was resuspended in 10 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.4 m sucrose and was further fractionated by the discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation procedure of Yang et al. (36Yang B. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7625-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ENaC-containing fraction was identified by Western analysis and used in these studies. Single channel analysis of rENaC was performed in planar lipid bilayers by following the general procedures adapted in Dr. Rosenberg's laboratory (37Townsend C. Rosenberg R.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Planar lipid bilayers were formed at room temperature from a 20 mg/ml n-decane solution of phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (w/w/w 5:3:2) by painting over a 200-μm diameter aperture separating cis and trans bath chambers. After a stable bilayer was formed in symmetrical solutions of 50 mm sodium aspartate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 1 m NaOH, as monitored by capacitance measurements, the experimental conditions were changed to asymmetric concentrations of sodium aspartate. The concentration of sodium aspartate in thecis chamber is higher than in the trans chamber, which was indicated in the individual experiments. Some experiments were carried out in symmetrical sodium aspartate concentration. Aliquots of membrane fractions were added to the cis chamber (final membrane protein concentration is ∼5 μg/ml of buffer in thecis chamber) and mixed by a small magnetic stir bar placed in the cis chamber. The Ag/AgCl electrodes were connected to the chambers through 2 m KCl agar bridges. Generally, channels were incorporated into the lipid bilayer within 5 min and were detected as step-like increases in current. Channel currents were amplified (BC-525C; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), filtered by a low pass eight-pole Bessel Filter, digitized (Digidata 1200; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and stored on a computer hard drive. Single channel currents collected at different voltage potentials and analyzed by using pCLAMP 7.0 software (Axon Instruments). QuB-Software for Single Channel Analysis (www.qub.buffalo.edu/) of Research Foundation State University of New York was also used in the analysis and preparation of figures. A description of anti-rENaC antibodies was presented previously (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies to the human ENaC subunits were raised in rabbits against the following epitopes: α-ENaC (residues 51–76), β-ENaC (residues 614–638), and γ-ENaC (residues 626–648). The rat and human ENaC antibodies were used to probe for the presence of endogenous ENaC subunits in Sf9 cells by Western blotting (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RNA protection assay was performed according to the manufacturer-supplied protocols (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, total RNA from Sf9 cells and from Sf9 cells infected with αβγ-BV were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The antisense probes ranging up to ∼500 bases from the rat and human ENaC subunit cDNAs (subcloned into pSPORT and pBluescript SK+ plasmids) were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and hybridized with the total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). After hybridization, the mixture was digested with RNase A/T1, and the remaining RNA fragments were analyzed by autoradiography after separation on 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels. The protein content in the membrane fractions was determined by the modified Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (38Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The Sf9 culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. The phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Amiloride, N-phenylanthranilic acid, 5-nitro-(3-phenyl propylamino) benzoate, and glybenclamide were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]UTP was obtained from ICN. MAXIscript SP6/T7 kit and RPA III kits were obtained from Ambion. The other reagents were of analytical grade. Because the Sf9 insect cell-BV expression system is well known for the production of high amount of proteins in functional form (39Volkman L.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have explored this expression system to obtain rENaC. The Sf9 insect cells infected with the α-, β-, γ-, and αβγ-BVs express the ENaC subunits, which quantitatively represent ∼3% of the total membrane protein (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A significant portion of the expressed ENaC subunits is fully N-glycosylated, as expected (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because it is now recognized that ENaC is also found in nonepithelial cell lines (53Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the possibility that Sf9 cells express ENaC homolog was tested by RNA protection assays using the antisense ENaC subunit probes prepared from rat and human ENaC cDNAs. No RNase-protected RNA fragments were found in the total RNA isolated from uninfected Sf9 insect cells, suggesting that these cells do not express ENaC-like proteins under the growth conditions adapted in the laboratory. In support of this conclusion, the antibodies to rat and human ENaC subunits did not react with proteins in the control Sf9 insect cell lysates (partially reported in Ref. 35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the large scale expression of fullyN-glycosylated ENaC in Sf9 insect cells and lack of endogenous ENaC suggested that the Sf9 insect cell-BV expression system is an alternative expression system for ENaC. The membranes prepared from Sf9 cells infected with a variety of BV mentioned under “Experimental Procedures” contained a variety of cation-selective channels. Fig.1 A shows representative records of typical channels observed under sodium aspartate concentrations in trans and cis chambers of the bilayer setup (75 and 200 mm, respectively). Channels in the control membranes prepared from different batches were analyzed, and the channel activities obtained from more than 100 experiments could be grouped broadly into 7.5, 14, 22, 84, 120, and 145 pS channels based on their conductances. The open probabilities of most of these channels were >0.5; open and closed times were in the range of seconds and were not voltage-dependent as deduced from their current-voltage relationships (data not shown). Each time any channel activity was observed, the effects of amiloride were tested by adding up to a concentration of 1 mm in both cis andtrans chambers. However, none of these channels exhibited any flickering or reduced open times. Similarly, the channel activities observed in membranes containing β-ENaC or γ-ENaC were also not sensitive to amiloride (not shown). A typical ∼7.5 pS channel whose gating was unaffected by the presence of 10 μm amiloride both in cis and trans chambers is shown in Fig.1 B. These data collectively suggested that Sf9 cell membranes do not contain any endogenous amiloride-sensitive channels, although they contain large number of cation-selective channels, and few of them exhibit gating properties resembling that of the ENaC. The membrane fractions prepared from Sf9 cells infected with α-BV were reconstituted into the planar lipid bilayers that were voltage clamped to measure the single channel current transitions. A very noticeable and regularly observed phenomenon upon channel incorporation was the appearance of multiple current levels, because of the activity of as many as three to five channels after an apparently single fusion event. Fig.2 A shows a representative selection of single channel recordings obtained in 200 mmsodium aspartate in the cis chamber and 75 mmsodium aspartate in the trans chamber at several membrane voltages and their relationship in the form of current-voltage plot. Nearly all of these channels have long open and closed times, which are on the order of seconds. Under these conditions, the reversal potential, E rev, deduced from their linear current-voltage relationships (Fig. 2 B), was ∼15 mV, which is lower than the expected reversal for Na+, indicating that this channel is cation-selective. The conductance of the largest channel is ∼300 pS. A prominent feature of these channels is the existence of several conductance substates, which were observed at all holding potentials in these experiments, precluding us in estimating the conductance of these channels/substates accurately. The appearance of these conductance levels was a consistent observation from experiment to experiment, from different batches of membranes either fresh or frozen. To further characterize this channel, various channel blockers, including N-phenylanthranilic acid, 5-nitro-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoate, amiloride, benzamil, and glybenclamide, were added in both cis and transchambers up to a final concentration of 500 μm. Neither the current amplitude nor the open probabilities were changed in the presence of these compounds (data not shown), suggesting that these are unique channels. The αβγ-rENaC-containing membranes were added to the cischamber of the bilayer setup, and channel recordings were measured in the presence of 200 and 75 mm sodium aspartate in thecis and trans chambers, respectively. Fusion of membrane vesicles with the bilayer was rapid, and channels were detected within minutes after the addition of membranes into thecis chamber. These membranes characteristically contained the small channel of ∼6 pS that exhibits flickering in the presence of amiloride is shown in Fig.3 A. However, as in the case of α-rENaC containing membranes, multiple channels with large conductance were also observed in membranes containing the αβγ-rENaC complex. All of these channels exhibited long open times on the order of seconds. A prominent and consistent feature in these records was in the existence of multiple substates at all holding potentials, which were evident in Fig. 3 B. The current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 3 C indicated that the slope conductance of a large channel was ∼320 pS. The zero current potential of these channel states was ∼17 mV in the presence of 200 and 75 mm sodium aspartate gradient in thecis and trans chambers, respectively, indicating that they have a preference for cations. To test the effect of amiloride on these large conductance channels, a stock solution of this drug prepared in water was added to either acis or a trans chamber one at a time, and the behavior of the channels was monitored. It was clear from a number of experiments that the response of these large conductance channels to amiloride could be broadly grouped into the following categories. First, the activity of certain large conductance channels could not be altered by the addition of up to 1 mm amiloride to eithercis or trans chambers, a behavior similarly observed in the α-rENaC-containing membranes. Second, the addition of 1 μm amiloride brought about complete inhibition of certain large conductance channels, even though many small conductance channels remained active subsequent to the addition of amiloride. Third, the behavior of certain large conductance channels to amiloride could be characterized in the manner described below. The behavior of the large conductance channels in the αβγ-membranes at a holding potential of 30 mV is shown in Fig.4 (traces 1 and 2). At least two major channels with current amplitudes of 3.0 and 4.2 pA are identifiable, although other channels or substates could also be discerned. Within a few seconds after the addition of 1 μm amiloride to the cis chamber, the channel with 3.0 pA current amplitude was closed, as judged by the decrease in the total current amplitude at this holding potential. Interestingly, a channel with current amplitude of 1.5 pA with rapid transitions between open and closed states has appeared. The open and closed times of this new channel were on the order of milliseconds. Inclusion of an additional 1 μm amiloride in the cis chamber resulted in the complete inhibition of this flickery channel activity (not shown). However, the channel with ∼4.2 pA amplitude was not affected by amiloride. The flickery block induced by amiloride in the large conductance channels in the αβγ-ENaC containing membranes is dependent on the holding potential, which is shown in Fig.5. The conductance of the channel in this figure was ∼409 pS, and representative channel records of this channel at a holding potential of −10 mV were shown in traces 1–3 in Fig. 5. As frequently observed, various substates are also evident in these traces. Traces 4–6 in Fig. 5 show the behavior of this channel in the presence of 2 μmamiloride in the cis chamber. The addition of amiloride significantly changed the gating properties of the channel from slow gating to fast flickery nature. Upon decreasing the holding potential from −10 to −20 mV, the open probability of this flickery channel was greatly reduced (trace 7). Although not shown, the flickery block induced in these large conductance channels was dependent on the location of amiloride. For example, we have noticed that the addition of amiloride to one side of the bilayer setup, if it did not induce any flickering either at positive or negative holding potentials, did indeed induce flickering once amiloride was added to the other chamber. These data suggested that these channels contain an amiloride-binding site that is asymmetrically located. In addition, perfusion of chambers with buffers without amiloride eliminated the flickering and restored normal appearance of these channels, which suggested that amiloride binding is reversible. To study the structure of ENaC and its interactions with a variety of regulatory proteins, we have adapted the Sf9 insect cell-BV expression system, which is widely used to express receptors, channels, enzymes, and other proteins in a number of laboratories (39Volkman L.E. Science. 1995; 269: 1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9992-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), major amounts of the ENaC subunits were fully N-glycosylated and migrated with molecular masses similar to these subunits expressed inXenopus oocytes, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, andin vitro translation in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (15Rossier B.C. Canessa C.M. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that the Sf9 insect cells carry out post-translational modifications of ENaC subunits similar to the above expression systems. Because all of the three ENaC subunits are co-expressed in each Sf9 insect cell via infection with the αβγ-BV (35Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that at least some portion of the ENaC subunits could be in the form of an ENaC complex. The membranes prepared from control Sf9 cells contained several cation-selective channels with conductances ranging from ∼7.5 to 145 pS. The ∼7.5 pS channels in the control membranes have particularly posed obvious difficulties in determining whether or not the expressed ENaC is functional, because the gating properties of this channel were similar to that of the ENaC. As pointed out by Gabriel et al. (49Gabriel S.E. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

Because it is unlikely that an ideal experimental system exists for ENaC, we have attempted, as an alternative, to inhibit these endogenous channels with a variety of channel inhibitors and altered experimental conditions such as changing the salts of sodium without any success. The most intriguing observation that further complicated the analysis of ENaC activity is the detection of large conductance of >300 pS cation-selective channels in the ENaC-containing membranes. Interestingly, these large conductance channels were not observed in more than 100 planar bilayer experiments using the control membranes. Detection of multiple >300 pS conductance channels every time ENaC-containing membranes fused with bilayer suggested that they must have arisen as a consequence of the ENaC expression in Sf9 cells. Although these large conductance channels in the α-membranes were not sensitive to amiloride up to 500 μm, channels of similar nature detected in the αβγ-ENaC containing membranes were, however, sensitive. As shown in Fig. 5, the flickery block induced by amiloride was more pronounced at a higher holding potential, which was also dependent on the location of amiloride, i.e. cis or trans chamber. Removal of amiloride by perfusion relieved the block. These observations together suggested that amiloride induces reversible flickery block in these large conductance channels. Because of the presence of these large conductance channels in multiple numbers in a given experiment, we were unable clamp the bilayer beyond the reported holding potentials across the bilayer in most of these experiments. The molecular basis for the presence of large conductance channels that are amiloride-insensitive in the α-ENaC-containing membranes and amiloride-sensitive in the αβγ-ENaC membranes is not clear at present. However, the following arguments may provide a plausible explanation for these observations. It is likely that these large conductance channels are cryptic channels endogenously present in the Sf9 cells. Because the β-ENaC, γ-ENaC, P-glycoprotein (MDR1 gene product), and breast cancer resistance protein, all of which arebona fide integral membrane proteins, did not elicit the activity of these large conductance channels, it is possible that the α-subunit activates these endogenous channels. In association with the β and γ subunits, these α-subunit-activated endogenous channels, as in the αβγ-containing membranes, acquired amiloride sensitivity. On the other hand, Miller and co-workers (47Sun T. Naini A.A. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9992-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have predicted that the presence of high density channel protein in membrane vesicles would result in channel appearance in multi-channel packages. Because ENaC is produced relatively in large amounts and multiple large conductance channels were consistently observed in the ENaC-containing membranes, it is reasonable to suggest that the large conductance channel activity is due to ENaC. The unusually large conductance could be the result of aggregation of the expressed protein. However, it remained unclear at present whether the large conductance channel activity is due to normally folded or aggregated ENaC. Interestingly, structurally similar ion channels including the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir), mechanosensitive small channel of E. coli (MscL), and the ATP-gated cation channel (P2X receptor), all of which contain two-transmembrane segments (54North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), are known to exhibit channel the activity of large conductance when compared with ENaC. In particular, the MscL, a homo-hexamer, exhibits a channel activity of ∼3500 pS (55Sukharev S. Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that ENaC with a subunit composition of four to nine subunits (16Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M.

Because proteins including CFTR and actin are known to interact with ENaC (29Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P.
