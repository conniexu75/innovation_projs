https://openalex.org/W2024387238,"Extracts of monkey cells (CV-1P) synthesizing SV40 large T antigen (T) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to T or p110-114Rb, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb). While a family of p110-114Rb proteins can be detected in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates, only one member of this family, p110Rb, was found in anti-T precipitates of these extracts. Identical results were obtained with extracts of CV-1P cells which had been previously mixed in vitro with highly purified T. The p110-114Rb family is composed of two sets--p110Rb, an un- or under-phosphorylated species, and pp112-114Rb, a group of overtly phosphorylated proteins. Thus, T bound preferentially to the un- or underphosphorylated member of the family. In addition, T failed to alter the relative abundances of these species. These results suggest a model in which the growth suppression function of Rb is down modulated either by phosphorylation or T antigen binding."

https://openalex.org/W1551360735,"Crystallization conditions for hen egg white lysozyme in the presence of various ions were determined at pH 4.5 and 18 degrees C. The corresponding solubility curves show that the main effects are due to anions in the following order: SCN- greater than NO3- greater than Cl- greater than citrate2- greater than CH3COO- approximately H2PO4- greater than SO4(2-). This is in the reverse order of the lyotropic series of Hofmeister. As a consequence, SCN- precipitates and crystallizes lysozyme at low concentration, whereas sulfate is ineffective even at high concentrations. Crystals obtained with each salt were characterized by x-ray diffraction. Lysozyme thiocyanate and nitrate crystals belong to the monoclinic system, whereas all the others have a tetragonal lattice."

https://openalex.org/W2080131435,"Several physical and chemical signals from the extracellular environment are known to be transduced into changes in gene expression through multiple step pathways; however, mechanisms for triggering cellular responses to heavy metal stress have yet to be elucidated. We demonstrate here one such mechanism that employs a single heavy metal receptor protein, MerR, to directly activate transcription of the bacterial mercuric ion resistance operon. The mercuric ion-MerR complex and E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme synergistically bind to the metal responsive promoter in an unprecedented spatial relationship to form transcriptionally competent complexes. The activator binds adjacent to and overlaps with the polymerase molecule between the consensus −35 and −10 promoter regions. Our results support a model for transcriptional activation that includes both effector-induced protein-protein interactions and activator-induced alteration in DNA structure."

https://openalex.org/W2074739533,"Using complementary oligonucleotide probes, we have isolated the nuclear gene for the RNA moiety of RNAase MRP; it is present as a single copy and encodes an uncapped primary transcript of 275 nucleotides. Direct sequence analysis revealed that the 136 nucleotide RNA that copurifies with RNAase MRP represents the 3' half of the 275 nucleotide primary transcript. The 5'-flanking region of the gene has putative transcriptional control elements homologous to the promoters of RNA polymerase II-transcribed U-series snRNA genes; however, the coding region possesses a box A sequence and terminates at four T residues, both features characteristic of polymerase III-transcribed genes. A decamer sequence, 5'-CGA-CCCCUCC-3', complementary to a conserved sequence adjacent to the enzymatic cleavage site on the mitochondrial RNA substrate, is present in the RNAase MRP RNA. Isolation of a nuclear gene for the RNA component of a mitochondrial enzyme implies that nucleic acids can be transported across mitochondrial membranes."

K., Stephens, L., Hawkins, P. T., and Downes, C. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9057-9061). We now report that P2-purinergic receptor-mediated regulation of the enzyme occurs in the membrane preparation. The order of potency of a series of ATP and ADP analogs for stimulation of inositol phosphate formation, i.e. 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2MeSATP) greater than adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) greater than adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) greater than ATP greater than 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate approximately ADP greater than alpha, beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate greater than beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate, was consistent with that for the P2Y-purinergic receptor subtype. Agonist-stimulated effects were completely dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotide. Activation of phospholipase C by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) occurred with a considerable time lag. The rate of activation followed first order kinetics and was markedly increased by increasing concentrations of a P2Y receptor agonist; in contrast, the rate of activation at a fixed agonist concentration was independent of guanine nucleotide concentration. Addition of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) prior to addition of agonist and GTP, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), or GTP gamma S blocked in a concentration-dependent manner the stimulatory effect of guanine nucleotide. GDP beta S, added subsequent to preactivation of membranes with 2MeSATP and GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p had only small inhibitory effects on the rate of inositol phosphate production observed over the subsequent 10 min. In contrast, addition of GDP beta S to GTP-preactivated membranes resulted in a rapid return of enzyme activity to the basal state within 60 s. Taken together, the data are consistent with the idea that P2Y receptor activation increases the rate of exchange of GTP and GTP analogs for GDP on the relevant guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Once the active enzymic species is formed, hydrolysis of guanine nucleotide reverts the enzyme to the inactive state."

The released alditols were fractionated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on primary amine bonded phase. The structures of the major neutral oligosaccharide alditols could be established by fast atom bombardment and electron impact mass spectrometry, combined with methylation analysis, 500-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and endo-beta-galactosidase (from Bacteroides fragilis, EC 3.2.1.103) digestion (where n = 0-3): (formula; see text) Major O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides on skim milk mucins are of the Gal beta(1-3)[GlcNAc beta(1-6)] GalNAc core type 2 and exhibit linearly extended backbone chains of the poly N-acetyllactosamine type comprizing up to at least four repeating units, which are linked by the hitherto unknown sequence GlcNAc-beta(1-6) Gal rather than GlcNAc beta(1-3)Gal. A considerable portion of neutral alditols is represented by branched isomers of the linear species, which are distinguished by their content of 3,6-disubstituted galactose and their partial resistance to endo-beta-galactosidase digestion."

https://openalex.org/W1537213032,"In the rat liver homogenate, maximal protein kinase C activity was found at two calcium concentrations (1.75 and 3.5 mM). Subcellular fractionation of the liver homogenate revealed that the protein kinase C activity requiring 1.75 mM calcium was present only in the cytosolic and particulate subcellular fractions. The protein kinase C activity requiring 3.5 mM calcium concentration was mainly located in the rat liver nuclei preparation. About 19% of the liver homogenate protein kinase C activity requiring 3.5 mM calcium was present in the nuclei. Goat anti-rat brain protein kinase C antibodies revealed a single immunoreactive band at 80-82 kDa in the rat liver nuclear, particulate, or cytosolic fractions. Based on the ratio of plasma membrane marker enzyme activity determined in the nuclear preparation, the purity of the isolated nuclei was ascertained. Rat liver nuclear protein kinase C activity has been partially purified. The purification steps sequentially employed were Triton X-100 extraction of isolated nuclei, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Phenyl-Superose, and Mono Q (fast protein liquid) chromatography. The final purification step revealed, by silver nitrate staining on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two protein bands at 80 and 66 kDa, respectively. These findings provide definitive data regarding the nuclear location of protein kinase C. The nuclear location of protein kinase C may lead to an understanding of the molecular pathway involved in signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1943630073,"The glycolipids of the protozoan Leishmania major strain LRC-L119 belong to a class of glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPL) that show partial structural homology to the phosphatidylinositol-containing glycolipid membrane anchors of several eukaryotic proteins and the lipid moiety of L. major lipophosphoglycan. The GIPLs were the only glycolipids detected and were purified by octyl-Sepharose and thin layer chromatographies. Analysis of the native and dephosphorylated glycolipids (GIPLs 1–6) by gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed that the glycan moieties have between 4 and 10 saccharide residues and all contain mannose, galactose, and non-N-acetylated glucosamine. Some of the GIPLs also contain glucose (GIPL-6) and hexose monophosphate residues (GIPL 4–6). The presence of an inositol phospholipid moiety in all the GIPLs is indicated by the identification of 1 myo-inositol monophosphate residue/molecule and their susceptibility to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. However, heterogeneity in the lipid moieties is indicated by differences in the compositional analysis and the behavior of the GIPLs on the thin layer chromatography after mild alkali hydrolysis or phospholipase A2 treatment. These results demonstrate that GIPLs 1–4 contain 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol composed of saturated unbranched alkyl chains with carbon chain lengths of 18–26 and acyl chains of myristate, palmitate and stearate, whereas GIPL-5 and −6 contain lyso-alkylglycerol composed of mainly C24:0 and C26:0 alkyl chains. Analysis of the products of nitrous acid deamination demonstrates that these glycerolipids are present as alkylacylphosphatidylinositol (GIPLs 1–4) and 1-O-alkylglycerophosphoinositol (GIPL-5 and −6), respectively. GIPL-2 and −3 are labeled on the surface of living promastigotes with galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4. These GIPLs also react with three monoclonal antibodies that recognize the surface of promastigotes and amastigotes of L. major and other Leishmania spp."

https://openalex.org/W2116790979,"In order to obtain a better understanding of the neutral-to-base (N-B) transition of human serum albumin, we performed acid/base titration experiments and 500-MHz 1H NMR experiments on albumin and on a large peptic (residues 1–387) and large tryptic (residues 198–585) fragment of albumin. The acid/base titration experiments revealed that Ca2+ ions induce a downward pK shift of several histidine residues of the peptic (P46) fragment and of albumin. By contrast, Ca2+ has very little influence on the pK of histidine residues of the tryptic (T45) fragment. In albumin, the pH-dependent His C-2 proton resonances, observed with 1H NMR experiments, have been allotted the numbers 1–17. It proved possible to locate these resonances in the P46 and the T45 fragments. A correspondence was found between the number of histidines detected by the acid/base titration and by the 1H NMR experiments. The results of the experiments lead us to conclude that in domain 1 at least the histidines corresponding to the His C-2 proton resonances 1–5 play a dominant role in the N-B transition. The Cu2+-binding histidine residue 3 (resonance 8) of the albumin molecule is not involved in the N-B transition. In addition, we were able to assign His C-2 proton resonance 9 to histidine 464 of the albumin molecule. The role of the N-B transition in the transport and cellular uptake mechanisms of endogenous and exogenous compounds is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1602141111,"Vitamin A movement between rod outer segment (ROS) membranes, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), and liposomes was examined by two different methods. Equilibrium exchange of all-trans-retinol was followed by assessing the transfer of [3H]retinol from liposomes to ROS membranes as compared to a nontransferable marker, [14C]triolein. In the absence of IRBP, a rapid, spontaneous transfer of [3H] retinol to the ROS membranes occurred. In the presence of 2 microM IRBP, retinol transfer decreased by approximately one-half, whereas a similar concentration of bovine serum albumin had no effect on this spontaneous transfer. Kinetics of retinol transfer between single unilamellar vesicles were determined by the method of fluorescence energy transfer. The first order rate constant for this transfer was 0.85 s-1 at 22 degrees C at either pH 7.4 or pH 2.8. This rate was not affected by varying the concentration of acceptor vesicles 50-fold or by varying their concentration 10-fold at a constant ratio of donor-to-acceptor vesicles. The presence of IRBP as an additional acceptor did not change the rate. The transfer was temperature-dependent with an activation energy of 7.8 kcal/mol. The transfer rate appeared to be an increasing exponential function of ionic strength since high concentrations of NaCl decreased the transfer rate significantly. The transfer rate of retinol from IRBP to single unilamellar vesicles also followed first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.11 s-1 at 22 degrees C, which was approximately 8 times slower than that of transfer between vesicles. We conclude that the transfer of all-trans-retinol between liposomes and membranes can be accomplished rapidly via the aqueous phase, and that IRBP retards rather than facilitates this transfer process."
https://openalex.org/W1793488575,"Exposure of cultured hepatoma 1c1c7 cells to KCN and iodoacetate, to produce chemical anoxia, caused a rapid and sustained increase in cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration, which was associated with depletion of intracellular ATP and glutathione. These changes occurred before the loss of cell viability and were accompanied by the appearance of plasma membrane blebs. Pretreatment of the cells with the Ca2+ chelators Quin 2 or BAPTA markedly delayed both the onset of blebbing and loss of cell viability, but did not affect KCN- and iodoacetate-induced loss of ATP and glutathione. Together, these results strongly suggest that a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration plays an important role in killing of hepatoma cells by chemical anoxia.— Nicotera, P.; Thor, H.; Orrenius, S.

https://openalex.org/W1564147925,"Cyclopentenylcytosine (CPEC) is phosphorylated in L1210 cells with CPEC triphosphate as the major metabolite. Partially purified uridine-cytidine kinase catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of cyclopentenylcytosine with an apparent Km of 196 +/- 9 microM, and cyclopentenylcytosine is a competitive inhibitor of cytidine phosphorylation by this enzyme with a Ki value of 144 +/- 14 microM. Examination of the CTP synthetase activity in extracts of L1210 cells revealed a dose-dependent decrease on exposure of cells to CPEC. Synthesis of CPEC triphosphate by an enzymatic method permitted direct examination of the inhibition of partially purified CTP synthetase. CPEC triphosphate inhibited bovine CTP synthetase with a median inhibitory concentration of 6 microM, whereas CPEC mono- and diphosphates were ineffective. CTP synthetase showed a classical Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic plot of velocity and UTP concentration in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP and glutamine, but CPEC triphosphate induced sigmoidal kinetic plots. The Hill coefficient was calculated to be 3.2."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with blotting technology indicated that the tetrasaccharide is mainly associated with one of the cellulosome subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1561663199,"Abstract Full length cDNAs coding for a 14-kDa beta-galactoside binding lectin have been isolated from HL-60 cells and human placenta. Oligonucleotide probes based on a pentapeptide present in several partial sequences of homologous human lectins were used to screen a lambda GT10 HL-60 cDNA library. The HL-60 cDNA clones that were isolated were used to design a synthetic primer representing the 3'-untranslated region of the HL-60 lectin. This primer was then used to synthesize a lambda GT10 human placenta cDNA library, and restriction fragments of the HL-60 cDNA clones were used to screen the library. The cDNA clones for both HL-60 and placenta lectin had identical sequences with short 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and coded for a 135-amino acid protein which lacks a hydrophobic signal peptide sequence. Biochemical data show that, despite the presence of a possible N-linked glycosylation site, the protein is not glycosylated. Northern and Southern blot analyses indicate that the 14-kDa lectin is encoded for by a single gene. The lectin cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and biologically active protein was purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1503658815,"Abstract Human serum vitamin D binding protein (hDBP), a 58-kDa inter-alpha-globulin, is known to bind, monomeric actin (G-actin) in equimolar quantities. Using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-hDBP antibodies, hDBP, and radioiodinated actin, we developed a reliable saturation assay for actin bound to hDBP. By utilizing this assay, kinetic analysis, and ultracentrifugal sedimentation in sucrose gradients, these proteins' binding affinities (Kd = 10(-9) M) were demonstrated to be 10- to 100-fold greater than earlier estimates. At 4 degrees C, hDBP has an association rate constant of 2.2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and a rate of dissociation displaying a t1/2 of 22 h. This high affinity binding was largely unaffected by conditions favoring actin filament formation (1 mM MgCl2 and/or 50 mM KCl), by the range of pH from 6.8 to 8.6 or by temperatures from 4 to 37 degrees C. Compared with ATP-alpha-actin, a 2-fold decrease of binding affinity was observed for the nonmuscle isoactins (beta,gamma), ADP-G-alpha-actin, and N'-ethylmaleimide-modified G-alpha-actin. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 holo-sterol forms of hDBP bound actin in a manner indistinguishable from the apo-sterol hDBP. The common polymorphisms of hDBP (DBP1 slow, DBP1 fast, and DBP2) were shown to have an equal avidity for G-actin binding. Human platelet profilin competed with hDBP for binding to G-actin, but was 1000-fold less potent (Ki = 1.9 microM). When platelet profilactin was incubated with hDBP, profilin was liberated and hDBP-actin complexes formed. DNase I, which forms a triprotein complex with hDBP-G actin, did not alter the affinity of binding of actin by hDBP. The very high affinity binding observed, which was largely unaffected by the state of G-actin, pH, and ionic conditions, appears to support a constitutive role for plasma DBP in the sequestration of actin monomers, as well as actin from actin-profilin complexes, that are liberated during cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W1547198958,"Abstract Recently we have identified a mitogen-activated S6 kinase from Swiss 3T3 cells (Jeno, P., Ballou, L. M., Novak-Hofer, I., and Thomas, G. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 406-410). Here we describe the detailed purification of this enzyme from high-speed supernatants (400,000 x g) of vanadate-treated cell extracts. The enzyme is purified through six sequential steps including cation- and anion-exchange, sizing, and affinity chromatography. At each step, the enzyme behaves as one entity and, on the final step of purification, is revealed on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a single protein of Mr 70,000. As reported earlier, the overall purification factor is 3,000-fold, and the specific activity of the homogeneously purified enzyme is 0.6 mumol/min/mg of protein. However, recovery of total activity is only 0.2%. This large loss of activity appears to be due to freeze-thawing the enzyme between each step of purification. The purified kinase does not phosphorylate casein, histones 2A and 3S, or phosvitin. It has a Km for ATP of 28 microM and a broad optimum for Mg2+ between 5 and 20 mM. Mn2+ does not affect the basal level of kinase activity, and at concentrations as low as 1 mM, it completely suppresses the effect of 20 mM Mg2+ on kinase activity. The relationship of this enzyme to two other purified S6 kinases is discussed."

Chem. 259, 4136-4141) were used as probes in determining the substrate specificity of rabbit lung cytochrome P-450 isozymes of pregnant animals in both microsomes and reconstituted systems. Lung microsomal and reconstituted P-450 form 5-catalyzed lauric acid omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylase activities were inhibited by a 12-carbon terminal acetylenic fatty acid, 11-dodecynoic acid (11-DDYA), and an 18-carbon terminal acetylenic fatty acid, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA). Rabbit lung microsomal lauric acid omega-hydroxylase activity was more sensitive to inhibition by 11-DDYA than was (omega-1)-hydroxylase activity. In reconstituted systems containing purified P-450 form 5, both omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of lauric acid were inhibited in parallel when either 11-DDYA or 17-ODYA was used. These data suggest the presence of at least two P-450 isozymes in rabbit lung microsomes capable of lauric acid omega-hydroxylation. This is the first report indicating the multiplicity of lauric acid hydroxylases in lung microsomes. Lung microsomal prostaglandin omega-hydroxylation, mediated by the pregnancy-inducible P-450PG-omega (Williams, D. E., Hale, S. E., Okita, R. T., and Masters, B. S. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14600-14608) was subject to inhibition by 17-ODYA only, whereas 11-DDYA acid was not an effective inhibitor of this hydroxylase. We have recently developed a new terminal acetylenic fatty acid, 12-hydroxy-16-heptadecynoic acid (12-HHDYA), that contains a hydroxyl group at the omega-6 position. We show that 12-HHDYA possesses a high degree of selectivity for the inactivation of rabbit lung microsomal prostaglandin omega-hydroxylase activity which cannot be obtained with the long chain acetylenic inhibitor, 17-ODYA. In addition, 12-HHDYA has no effect on lauric acid omega- or omega-1-hydroxylation or on benzphetamine N-demethylation. The development of this new terminal acetylenic fatty acid inhibitor provides us with a useful tool with which to study the physiological role of prostaglandin omega-hydroxylation in the rabbit lung during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2141702575,"Complementary DNA for human eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) was transcribed in vitro and the transcripts used to direct protein synthesis in a cell-free reticulocyte translation system. The predominant translation product was 25 kDa, was bound to a m7GTP-Sepharose affinity column, and was specifically eluted with m7GTP. Both phosphorylated (P) and unphosphorylated (U) forms of eIF-4E were synthesized, and the P/U ratio increased as a function of incubation time in the reticulocyte lysate system. Both forms were quantitatively retained on m7GTP-Sepharose. When translation reactions were resolved on sucrose density gradients, the 35S-labeled eIF-4E sedimented predominantly at 3-4 S. However, in the presence of edeine or guanylyl imidodiphosphate, both of which cause accumulation of 48 S initiation complexes, eIF-4E was detected in the 48 S region. In the presence of sparsomycin, used to accumulate 80 S initiation complexes, no eIF-4E was observed in the 80 S region. No change in the eIF-4E distribution was caused by m7GTP. These results are consistent with a model whereby eIF-4E is transferred to the 43 S initiation complex together with mRNA and is released from the initiation complex when the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins."
https://openalex.org/W1508825013,"Abstract gamma-Glutamylcysteine and bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase appear to function in the halobacteria in a fashion analogous to GSH and glutathione reductase in other cells. Bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase (GCR), a NADPH-dependent dimer of Mr 122,000 recently purified to homogeneity from Halobacterium halobium (Sundquist, A.R., and Fahey, R.C. (1988) J. Bacteriol., 170, 3459-3467), was found to be highly specific for bis-gamma-glutamylcystine and to be present in cell extract at a level sufficient to maintain gamma-glutamylcysteine predominantly in its thiol form [( thiol]/[disulfide] approximately 50). Bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase is similar to glutathione reductase in many respects; GCR demonstrated a FAD:subunit stoichiometry of 1, inhibition by heavy metal ions, and a pH optimum near neutrality. However, GCR exhibited no activity with GSSG and was most active at salt levels exceeding 2 M. A turnover number of 1,700 mumol min-1 mumol-1 FAD and apparent Km values of 0.8 mM for bis-gamma-glutamylcystine and 0.29 mM for NADPH were determined for GCR. The effect of salt on the autoxidation rates of gamma-glutamylcysteine, GSH, and Cys was also studied. In the absence of added salt, Cys oxidized more rapidly than gamma-glutamylcysteine, which in turn oxidized more rapidly than GSH. The presence of 4.3 M chloride (K+ and Na+) significantly slowed the autoxidation of all three thiols. The rate of autoxidation of gamma-glutamylcysteine in 4.3 M chloride proved slower than that of GSH in the absence of added chloride. Thus, gamma-glutamylcysteine is at least as stable under halophilic conditions as GSH is under nonhalophilic conditions, explaining why halobacteria utilize gamma-glutamylcysteine rather than GSH."

https://openalex.org/W1536065758,"Abstract The activity of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase in liver microsomes, measured using endogenous microsomal PE as a substrate, was elevated 2-fold in the choline-deficient state. However, methyltransferase activity assayed in the presence of a saturating concentration of phosphatidyl-N-mono-methylethanolamine or microsomal PE was unchanged by choline deficiency. Accompanying the increase in methyltransferase activity in liver homogenates and microsomes were increased PE concentrations and an increased PE to phosphatidylcholine ratio. The concentration of other phospholipids was unchanged. Immunoblot analysis of choline-deficient and choline-supplemented rat liver microsomes using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PE N-methyltransferase antibody revealed that the amount of enzyme protein was unaltered. The regulation of methyltransferase by PE levels was also investigated in cultured hepatocytes obtained from choline-deficient rat livers. Supplementation of deficient hepatocytes with 200 microM methionine resulted in a 50% reduction in cellular PE levels over a 12-h period. PE N-methyltransferase activity assayed with endogenous PE was also reduced by 50%, but phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine-dependent activity was unchanged. A 4-h supplementation with choline did not affect PE levels or methyltransferase activity. Either methionine or choline supplementation resulted in net synthesis of cellular phosphatidylcholine. Immunoblotting of membranes from methionine-supplemented hepatocytes revealed no change in enzyme protein, a further indication that enzyme mass was constitutive, and activity was regulated by the concentration of PE."
https://openalex.org/W1598118899,"Removing extracellular Na+ (Na+o) evoked a large increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ((Ca2+)i in human skin fibroblasts. Decreasing (Na+)o from 120 to 14 mM caused the half-maximal peak increase in (Ca2+)i. Removing Na+o strongly stimulated /sup 45/Ca2+ efflux and decreased total cell Ca2+ by about 40%. Bradykinin caused changes in (Ca2+)i, total Ca2+, and /sup 45/Ca2+ fluxes similar to those evoked by removing Na+o. Prior stimulation of the cells with bradykinin prevented Na+o removal from increasing (Ca2+)i and vice versa. Na+o removal rapidly increased (/sup 3/H)inositol polyphosphate production. Loading the cells with Na+ had no effect on the increase in /sup 45/Ca2+ efflux produced by Na+o removal. Therefore, decreasing (Na+)o probably stimulates a receptor(s) which is sensitive to extracellular, not intracellular, Na+. Removing Na+o also mobilized intracellular Ca2+ in smooth muscle and endothelial cells cultured from human umbilical and dog coronary arteries, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1514533038,"The sulfoconjugation of tyrosyl residues is a widespread post-translational modification of biologically active peptides and proteins. In this paper we describe the characterization of a rat liver tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase that is capable of catalyzing the transfer of a sulfate moiety from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the synthetic polymer, poly-(Glu6,Ala3,Tyr1) (EAY; Mr 47,000) using a simple filter paper assay. Following sucrose density gradient centrifugation and comparison with known subcellular marker enzyme activities, rat liver tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity was shown to have a distribution similar to the Golgi enzyme, galactosyltransferase. Using the enriched Golgi preparation, rat liver tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase displayed a pH optimum of 6.7 and required the presence of 20 mM Mn2+ for maximal activity. Co2+ (20 mM) was able to produce 26% of the maximal stimulation observed with Mn2+, whereas other metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Co2+, were not effective in stimulating tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity. Whereas tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity was observed in the native membrane-bound state, EAY sulfation was maximally enhanced 3-fold when assayed in the presence of Lubrol Px. Under the optimal conditions for assaying the sulfation of EAY by a rat liver enriched Golgi fraction, significant degradation of the sulfate donor, PAPS, was observed. The addition of both NaF and 5'-AMP to the incubation mixture was found to effectively prevent PAPS degradation and increase the amount of product formed in the assay by 10-fold. Using the optimized conditions for the sulfation of EAY by rat liver tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, membrane-bound sulfotransferase activity was also observed in the crude microsomal pellets of a variety of rat tissues, including lung, pituitary, and cerebellum, as well as in livers from different species."
https://openalex.org/W1592393619,"The role of intracellular pH in stimulus-secretion coupling was investigated in cultured bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. NH4Cl (1-25 mM) did not affect basal catecholamine or ATP release but markedly inhibited nicotine- or high K+-induced release by up to 60%. The inhibition had a rapid onset (less than 1 min) and was maximal at about 5 mM NH4Cl. The effect of NH4Cl was largely sustained over 20 min and was reversed upon NH4Cl removal. Sodium propionate did not affect secretion but partially reversed the inhibition by NH4Cl in a concentration-dependent manner. Methylamine (10 mM) produced a similar, but slower, inhibition than NH4Cl. Monensin (1-10 microM) inhibited catecholamine secretion by 30-60%, and its effect was reduced in the presence of NH4Cl. Using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Fura-2, we found that the increase of [Ca2+]i following stimulation was not altered by concentrations of NH4Cl which inhibited secretion maximally. Measurement of cytosolic pH (pHi) with the fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis-carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) revealed an alkalinization by NH4Cl (2.5-25 mM) of 0.1-0.23 pH units and acidification by sodium propionate (10-20 mM) of 0.2-0.25 pH units, with intermediate combined effects. Monensin (1 microM) caused a cytosolic acidification of 0.26 pH units. All pHi changes were partly recovered in 15 min. Fluorescence quenching measurements using the weakly basic fluorescent probe acridine orange indicated the accumulation of the probe into acidic compartments, presumably the chromaffin granules, which was strongly reduced by both NH4Cl and monensin. From these findings we conclude that the pH of the chromaffin granule modulates secretion by affecting some step in the secretory process unrelated to the rise in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1510625354,"Abstract High efficiency nuclear protein extracts were prepared from uninduced and recombinant interferon (IFN-alpha 2-primed Sendai virus-induced HeLa S3 cells and analyzed for DNA binding proteins specific for the human interferon-beta regulatory element (IRE). Analysis of protein-DNA interactions by a gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay resolved three complexes (designated A, B, and C) specific for the IRE probe (-79 to -36) in uninduced and induced cells. Competition studies using greater than a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragments representing different IFN-beta promoter sequences localized the DNA binding domain to the region -79 to -64 (P1 probe), a region previously shown to be essential for virus-inducible gene expression. Other adjacent IFN-beta segments including the negative regulatory element (-65 to -30) as well as the SV40 enhancer, c-fos serum-responsive element, and IFN-alpha 1 promoter fragment (-131 to -71) were unable to compete for the IRE binding protein. The 16-base pair enhancer core (P1 probe) specifically bound similar amounts of protein from uninduced and induced extracts; a synthetic tetrahexamer, AAGTGA, competed efficiently for the binding to the P1 region. Competition studies indicated that adjacent upstream IFN-beta DNA sequences -94 to -78 (P5) also contained a sequence motif capable of binding the P1 protein. In vitro transcription of the IFN-beta template in the HeLa nuclear extracts was partially inhibited when increasing amounts of competitor IRE fragment were added to the reaction. These results demonstrate that multiple DNA sequence motifs within the IFN-beta regulatory element interact to bind transcription regulatory proteins which are present in normal and virus-infected HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1657550065,"Abstract Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by coordinate regulation of endogenous synthesis and exogenous uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol by low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. In the lymphocyte, limiting the availability of exogenous cholesterol is known to increase the rate of endogenous sterol biosynthesis. However, the effect of cholesterol deprivation on the expression and regulation of the LDL receptor gene has not been delineated in lymphocytes. Here, LDL receptor mRNA was detected in freshly isolated human peripheral mononuclear cells. LDL receptor mRNA levels increased by 3-fold during a one-h in vitro culture in lipoprotein-deficient medium and by 6-fold during a 2-h incubation. Actinomycin D blocked the synthesis of LDL receptor mRNA in these cultures. However, neither cycloheximide nor LDL or oxygenated sterols suppressed the increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels observed after a 2-h incubation. The increase in LDL receptor mRNA was maintained for 24 h of culture in the absence of LDL. Ongoing gene transcription and not mRNA stabilization accounted for this expression. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide completely prevented the sustained increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels measured after 24 h. Low concentrations of LDL (5 micrograms of cholesterol/ml) and oxygenated sterols also suppressed the level of LDL receptor mRNA measured after a 24-h incubation. These data show that the initial upregulation of LDL receptor gene expression is independent of protein synthesis and not suppressed by either LDL or oxygenated sterols. In contrast, the continued transcription necessary for the maintenance of steady-state levels of LDL receptor mRNA requires synthesis of new protein and is regulated by LDL and oxygenated sterols."
https://openalex.org/W1605458808,Abstract A gel mobility shift assay was used to examine nuclear extracts of muscle and nonmuscle cell lines for a factor or factors that interact with the functional promoter segment of both the human cardiac and skeletal alpha-actin genes. A single major band of altered mobility was seen with nuclear extracts from C2 myoblasts and myotubes and L8 myoblasts and myotubes as well as several non-muscle cell lines. Competition experiments with nuclear extracts from both muscle and non-muscle cells localized the region of binding to a 10-base pair sequence of the cardiac alpha-actin gene containing the functional CArG box promoter domain. Similar results and binding site specificities were obtained with a DNA fragment from the human skeletal alpha-actin promoter. The CArG box binding factor was shown to be distinct from a CAAT box binding factor. A molecular weight of 67 kDa for the CArG box binding factor was determined by photoaffinity labeling of the complex and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protease treatment resulted in a smaller fragment that still bound the cardiac alpha-actin promoter fragment and may represent a structurally distinct DNA-binding domain. We discuss how muscle-specific expression of the sarcomeric alpha-actin genes might be achieved with a ubiquitous transcription factor.
https://openalex.org/W1555867986,"We detected platelet-activating substance in gastrointestinal areas, which was confirmed to be platelet-activating factor (PAF) on the basis of the following findings: 1) it comigrated with authentic PAF on thin-layer chromatography; 2) it did not aggregate PAF-desensitized platelets; and 3) its activity was completely antagonized by the receptor antagonists CV3988 and L-652,731. The level of PAF was determined with a bioassay method based on the release of [3H]serotonin from washed rabbit platelets. In the normal rat stomach, the level of PAF was high in the antrum (940 +/- 200 nmol PAF/mol phosphorus of original phospholipids), especially in the antral mucosa (1801 +/- 426 nmol/mol phosphorus of original phospholipids). The stomach PAF level was significantly altered by water immersion stress. Stress for a period of 1 h was associated with a decrease in the antral PAF level to 39 +/- 7% of that of untreated controls. This low PAF level persisted during stress. On the other hand, in the corpus, stress for periods of 1 and 3 h was associated with decreases in the PAF content, and further stress (7 h) resulted in restoration of the PAF level to normal. Furthermore, 7 h of stress was associated with distinct hemorrhagic lesions, which were prevented by CV3988 infused i.v. before the stress. This is the first report of an association between a decrease of the endogenous PAF level in animal tissues and tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1607808580,"Abstract The tendency toward extremely high variability among relaxins derived from purportedly closely related species has come to an abrupt end with the discovery of quasi-porcine relaxin in the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and the Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni). An aqueous abstract of the corpora lutea of the two baleen whales contained significant amounts of relaxin-like activity as determined by a mouse bioassay and by cross-reactivity with anti-pig relaxin antibodies. The activity could be isolated and purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis revealed that both whale relaxins differed from each other by about 3 residues, whereas the relaxin of B. edeni differed at only one position from that of pig relaxin. The similarity appears to include even the chain length heterogeneity observed at the C-terminal end of the B chain in porcine relaxin which is produced by a peculiar mode of connecting peptide removal from the pro-hormone. This finding may well represent one of the better documented challenges to the current paradigm of molecular evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1505430080,"We have observed changes in the chromatin structure of a human histone gene promoter that may be functionally related to variations in transcription during the cell cycle. A detailed analysis of the chromatin structure of a cell cycle-dependent human H4 histone gene and its flanking sequences was performed using DNase I, S1 nuclease, and restriction endonucleases. This gene was previously shown to have a DNase I-and S1-sensitive site for which the boundaries varied with the cell cycle, and we have now precisely mapped these modifications. During S phase, the entire coding region of this gene and the 5′-flanking region up to approximately −600 base pairs are sensitive to both DNase I and S1, while during mitosis/G1, accessibility to these enzymes is greatly decreased in regions from −250 to −600 base pairs and downstream of +100 base pairs. DNase I- and S1-hypersensitive sites in the proximal promoter region (which contains two sites of protein-DNA interaction as well as sequence elements necessary for the correct initiation of transcription) are present throughout the cell cycle, as is an additional site sensitive to both DNase I and S1, located at −700 to −800 base pairs. Restriction enzyme analysis confirmed the general openness of the promoter region and relative insensitivity of the 3′-flanking region, while salt wash experiments indicated several discrete sites in the promoter that are candidates for regulatory interactions. The chromatin structure of the proximal promoter region of this H4 gene is different during early S phase when it is maximally transcribed, as indicated by the ability of a high salt wash to render this region inaccessible to the restriction enzyme MspI only at this time of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1662579637,"The origin of replication of plasmid pT181 is nicked by the plasmid-encoded RepC protein. The free 3'-hydroxyl end at the nick is presumably used as primer for leading strand DNA synthesis. In vitro replication of pT181 was found to generate single-stranded DNA in addition to the supercoiled, double-stranded DNA. The single-stranded DNA was circular and corresponded to the pT181 leading strand. Recombinant plasmids were constructed that contain two pT181 origins of replication in either direct or inverted orientation. In vitro replication of the plasmid carrying two origins in direct orientation was shown to generate circular, single-stranded DNA that corresponded to initiation of replication at one origin sequence and termination at the other origin. These results demonstrate that the origin of pT181 leading strand DNA replication also serves as the site for termination of replication. Interestingly, the presence of two origins in inverted orientation resulted in initiation of replication at one origin and stalling of the replisome at the other origin. These results suggest that RepC can reinitiate replication at the second origin by nicking partially replicated, relaxed DNA. These data are consistent with the replication of pT181 by a rolling circle mechanism and indicate that single-stranded DNA is an intermediate in pT181 replication."
https://openalex.org/W1803924298,"We labeled mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, synchronized in G0 or S phase, from [3H]cytidine or [3H]deoxycytidine and measured the flow of isotope into and through deoxycytidine nucleotide pools, including the two deoxyliponucleotides dCDP choline and dCDP ethanolamine. Compared to G0 cells, S phase cells had much larger pools with a 20-40-fold faster turnover. The dCTP pool of S phase cells during steady state conditions attained a 6-fold higher specific activity than the pool of G0 cells when labeled from cytidine but a 10-fold lower specific activity when labeled from deoxycytidine. The dCTP pool of G0 cells showed a slow but measurable turnover indicating a limited amount of de novo synthesis also in resting cells. The labeling pattern of dCTP and deoxyliponucleotides of G0 cells was compatible with a simple precursor-product relationship. In S phase cells, however, dCDP choline had a 4-6 times higher specific activity during steady state conditions than dCTP and dCMP when the cells were labeled with [3H]deoxycytidine. We suggest that 3T3 cells contain two distinct intracellular dCTP pools, one labeled preferentially from cytidine and used for DNA replication, the other labeled from deoxycytidine and used for deoxyliponucleotide synthesis. We speculate that the latter pool during S phase may be temporarily sequestered in the cell's membrane fraction before equilibration with the much larger dCTP pool originating in S phase cells from the reduction of CDP."
https://openalex.org/W1554703552,"The stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) by chemoattractants triggers a rapid rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration(s) ([Ca2+]i), which quickly returns to base line, suggesting a role for calcium removal in the homeostasis of activated PMNs. To investigate cytosolic calcium homeostasis, PMNs were treated with a fluoroprobe and ionomycin to induce a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. The cells were then stimulated, and attenuation of the fluorescence signal was measured as an indication of calcium loss from the cytosol. The formyl peptide chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, but not the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate, induced a dose-dependent decrease in [Ca2+]i in ionomycin-pretreated cells. However, the decline in [Ca2+]i caused by PMA was sustained and occurred following a lag time, whereas the response to fMLP was immediate, lasted approximately 2 min, and then was followed by a return of [Ca2+]i to its initial level. The restoration of [Ca2+]i required extracellular calcium. Varying the ionomycin concentration allowed studies at different initial [Ca2+]i, which in untreated PMNs was approximately 135 nM. In contrast to fMLP, PMA did not lower calcium at concentrations below 200 nM. The decline in [Ca2+]i induced by fMLP, but not PMA, was blocked by pertussis toxin. In contrast, the decrease in [Ca2+]i caused by PMA and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, but not fMLP, was inhibited by the protein kinase C antagonists staurosporine, H-7, and sphingosine. These results suggest that formyl peptide chemoattractants transiently stimulate an activity which lowers [Ca2+]i to normal intracellular levels. Activation of this process appears to be independent of protein kinase C. An additional cytosolic calcium lowering activity, dependent on protein kinase C, operates at [Ca2+]i above 200 nM. Thus, activated PMNs can use at least two processes for attentuation of elevated cytosolic calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1501957496,"Certain structural characteristics, in particular the type of oligosaccharide chains associated with the rat liver somatogenic (GH) receptors, were studied in different isolated organelles involved in receptor biosynthesis, maturation, and binding, with the use of ligand-affinity cross-linking, incubation with various oligosaccharide chain-cleaving enzymes, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In an endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fraction, a somatogenic receptor with Mr 33,000, after correction for bound ligand (assuming a 1:1 binding ratio of ligand to receptor) was found to contain N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide chain(s). In an intermediate density fraction, enriched in cis-Golgi, a major receptor of Mr 43,000 was found to contain N-linked complex type of oligosaccharide chains. In a low density membrane fraction, containing trans-Golgi complex membranes and endocytic vesicles, three receptors of Mr 95,000, 55,000, and 43,000 were found. These three receptors contain N-linked complex-type oligosaccharide chains. Neuraminidase treatment resulted in a decrease of the Mr 95,000 and 43,000 receptors to Mr 81,000 and 39,000, respectively. Two specific somatogenic receptors of Mr 95,000 and 43,000 containing N-linked complex type of oligosaccharides were found in an isolated plasma membrane-enriched fraction. When isolated hepatocytes were analyzed, the Mr 95,000 receptor was found to be the major labeled species. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (first dimension nonreducing and the second dimension reducing conditions), showed that the Mr 43,000 receptor is contained within the Mr 95,000 receptor. The data suggest that the Mr 33,000 receptor found in endoplasmic reticulum constitutes a precursor to the Mr 43,000 receptor and that the Mr 43,000 receptor is complexed with an unknown subunit during transport through the Golgi complex to form an Mr 95,000 receptor present on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1563346641,"Heterogeneity of cytosolic pH was studied with compounds that distribute between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix in fundamentally different ways, i.e., according to the extent of ionization or according to the function of H+-coupled transport systems. Results show that the average cytosolic pH is considerably more alkaline than the region to which mitochondria are exposed. Because mitochondria are localized predominantly in the basal region, the results are consistent with a transcellular pH gradient within the cytosol of proximal tubule cells. Experiments analyzing the effects of inhibiting efflux of HCO3- at the basal surface and Na+-H+ exchange at the apical surface support the interpretation that the function of these systems contributes to the transcellular pH gradient. The existence of a heterogeneity in pH within the cytosol has important implications concerning the function and regulation of numerous cell processes."
https://openalex.org/W1524346895,"Abstract Analogues of human glycophorins have been identified in many species, including mouse. In murine erythroleukemia cells three mature glycophorins (gp-2, gp-3, 34K) and four putative precursors (21K, 23K, 26K, and 27K) are expressed. Pulse-chase labeling experiments suggest that 21K and 23K are the precursors of the gp-3 doublet of proteins 29K and 30K. Precursor-product relationships were not found for 26K, 27K, 34K, and gp-2. Two experimental approaches, i.e. cell-free translation and subcellular distribution, have identified processing anomalies in the glycophorins. First, signal sequences, if present, are apparently not cleaved upon translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; second, the 26K and 27K putative precursors are inefficiently translocated. The majority accumulates in the cytosol or associates with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane without acquiring protection against V8 protease. Only a minority (approximately 10%) is properly translocated."
https://openalex.org/W1670478304,"Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase is the only DNA polymerase that is strongly inhibited in the presence of ATP. We have labeled calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase with [32P]ATP in order to identify its binding site in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The specificity of ATP cross-linking to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase is shown by the competitive inhibition of the overall cross-linking reaction by deoxynucleoside triphosphates, as well as the ATP analogs Ap4A and Ap5A. Tryptic peptide mapping of [32P]ATP-labeled enzyme revealed a peptide fraction that contained the majority of cross-linked ATP. The properties, chromatographic characteristics, amino acid composition, and sequence analysis of this peptide fraction were identical with those found associated with dTTP cross-linked terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase peptide (Pandey, V. N., and Modak, M. J. (1988a). J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3744–3751). The involvement of the same 2 cysteine residues in the cross-linking of both nucleotides further confirmed the unity of the ATP and dTTP binding domain that contains residues 224–237 in the primary amino acid sequence of calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase."
