https://openalex.org/W2068313794,Students' ratings of their instructors in undergraduate classes in calculus were correlated with class performance on a common final examination. Ratings on several instructional factors were highly related to class performance even though they appeared to be independent of the students' own grades.
https://openalex.org/W2065657236,"A number of features have been identified as absorption lines of hydrogen cyanide in infrared spectra of stratospheric absorption obtained from a high-altitude aircraft. Column amounts of stratospheric hydrogen cyanide have been derived from spectra recorded on eight flights. The average vertical column amount above 12 kilometers is 7.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(14) molecules per square centimeter, corresponding to an average mixing ratio of 170 parts per trillion by volume."
https://openalex.org/W1997677061,"Results of the first year of data collection by the SAM (Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement) II satellite system are presented. Almost 10,000 profiles of stratospheric aerosol extinction in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are used to construct plots of weekly averaged aerosol extinction versus altitude and time and stratospheric optical depth versus time. Corresponding temperature fields are presented. These data show striking similarities in the aerosol behavior for corresponding seasons. Wintertime polar stratospheric clouds that are strongly correlated with temperature are documented. They are much more prevalent in the Antarctic stratosphere during the cold austral winter and increase the stratospheric optical depths by as much as an order of magnitude for a period of about 2 months. These clouds might represent a sink for stratospheric water vapor and must be considered in the radiative budget for this region and time."
https://openalex.org/W1975330869,"On 7 June 1972 the third , Jovian satellite Ganymede occulted the eighth-magnitude star SAO 186800. Successful photoelectric observations obtained at Lembang, Java (Indonesia), and Kavalur, India, show nonabrupt immersions and emersions, indicating the presence of an atmosphere whose surface pressure is greater than about 10(-3) millibar. By fitting the two occultation durations as chords to a model disk, the diameter is found to be 5270 (+30, - approximately 200) kilometers, the major error contribution arising from the uncertain atmospheric thickness below the occultation layer. The derived mean density is 2.0 (-0.03, + approximately 0.2) grams per cubic centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2049048228,The evolution of asteroidal orbits initially near the Kirkwood Gap at the 1:2 commensurability with Jupiter's period provides a mechanism for the production of meteorites from the asteroid belt without excessive velocity change. The resulting yield (âˆ¼ 109 grams per year) and the orbital elements of Earth-crossing objects are in agreement with observational data on meteorites.

https://openalex.org/W2060190504,"The abundance of samarium-152 in the Santa Clara iron meteorite is found to be 108 x 10(7) atoms per gram. This quantity, if attributed to fission of a superheavy element with atomic number 107 to 109, limits the amount of superheavy elements in the early solar system to 1.7 x 10(-5) times the abundance of uranium-238. For element 110, the limit is 3.4 x 10(-5)."
