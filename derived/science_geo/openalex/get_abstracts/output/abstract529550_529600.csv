https://openalex.org/W1738827650,"Robots have transformed many industries, most notably manufacturing, and have the power to deliver tremendous benefits to society, such as in search and rescue, disaster response, health care and transportation. They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot 'think outside the box' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot's prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury."

https://openalex.org/W2136912209,"Decadal variability is a notable feature of the Atlantic Ocean and the climate of the regions it influences. Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall, European summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes and variations in global temperatures. It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content. However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source. Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres--the intergyre region. These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures, but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States."

Here we analyze whether a keystone-like pattern can be observed in the relationship between transnational corporations and marine ecosystems globally. We show how thirteen corporations control 11-16% of the global marine catch (9-13 million tons) and 19-40% of the largest and most valuable stocks, including species that play important roles in their respective ecosystem. They dominate all segments of seafood production, operate through an extensive global network of subsidiaries and are profoundly involved in fisheries and aquaculture decision-making. Based on our findings, we define these companies as keystone actors of the Anthropocene. The phenomenon of keystone actors represents an increasingly important feature of the human-dominated world. Sustainable leadership by keystone actors could result in cascading effects throughout the entire seafood industry and enable a critical transition towards improved management of marine living resources and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1935909404,"Unique isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) have previously been identified as the causative agent of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimp. AHPND is characterized by massive sloughing of tubule epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas (HP), proposed to be induced by soluble toxins released from VPAHPND that colonize the shrimp stomach. Since these toxins (produced in broth culture) have been reported to cause AHPND pathology in reverse gavage bioassays with shrimp, we used ammonium sulfate precipitation to prepare protein fractions from broth cultures of VPAHPND isolates for screening by reverse gavage assays. The dialyzed 60% ammonium sulfate fraction caused high mortality within 24-48 hours post-administration, and histological analysis of the moribund shrimp showed typical massive sloughing of hepatopancreatic tubule epithelial cells characteristic of AHPND. Analysis of the active fraction by SDS-PAGE revealed two major bands at marker levels of approximately 16 kDa (ToxA) and 50 kDa (ToxB). Mass spectrometry analysis followed by MASCOT analysis revealed that both proteins had similarity to hypothetical proteins of V. parahaemolyticus M0605 (contig034 GenBank accession no. JALL01000066.1) and similarity to known binary insecticidal toxins called 'Photorhabdus insect related' proteins A and B (Pir-A and Pir-B), respectively, produced by the symbiotic, nematode bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. In in vivo tests, it was shown that recombinant ToxA and ToxB were both required in a dose dependent manner to cause AHPND pathology, indicating further similarity to Pir-A and -B. A single-step PCR method was designed for detection of the ToxA gene and was validated using 104 bacterial isolates consisting of 51 VPAHPND isolates, 34 non-AHPND VP isolates and 19 other isolates of bacteria commonly found in shrimp ponds (including other species of Vibrio and Photobacterium). The results showed 100% specificity and sensitivity for detection of VPAHPND isolates in the test set."
https://openalex.org/W1948389504,"Membership in important social groups can promote a positive identity. We propose and test an identity resource model in which personal self-esteem is boosted by membership in additional important social groups. Belonging to multiple important group memberships predicts personal self-esteem in children (Study 1a), older adults (Study 1b), and former residents of a homeless shelter (Study 1c). Study 2 shows that the effects of multiple important group memberships on personal self-esteem are not reducible to number of interpersonal ties. Studies 3a and 3b provide longitudinal evidence that multiple important group memberships predict personal self-esteem over time. Studies 4 and 5 show that collective self-esteem mediates this effect, suggesting that membership in multiple important groups boosts personal self-esteem because people take pride in, and derive meaning from, important group memberships. Discussion focuses on when and why important group memberships act as a social resource that fuels personal self-esteem."
https://openalex.org/W1606575263,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β accumulation, with soluble oligomers (Aβo) being the most synaptotoxic. However, the multivalent and unstable nature of Aβo limits molecular characterization and hinders research reproducibility. Here, we characterized multiple Aβo forms throughout the life span of various AD mice and in post-mortem human brain. Aβo exists in several populations, where prion protein (PrPC)-interacting Aβo is a high molecular weight Aβ assembly present in multiple mice and humans with AD. Levels of PrPC-interacting Aβo match closely with mouse memory and are equal or superior to other Aβ measures in predicting behavioral impairment. However, Aβo metrics vary considerably between mouse strains. Deleting PrPC expression in mice with relatively low PrPC-interacting Aβo (Tg2576) results in partial rescue of cognitive performance as opposed to complete recovery in animals with a high percentage of PrPC-interacting Aβo (APP/PSEN1). These findings highlight the relative contributions and interplay of Aβo forms in AD. Background: Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are key in Alzheimer disease (AD) but are diverse and poorly characterized. Results: Multiple Aβ forms were measured across the life span of AD model mice and human AD brain. Conclusion: Aβ species interacting with prion protein were tightly linked to behavioral impairment. Significance: An Aβ oligomer subset with defined biochemical properties is present in multiple AD-relevant samples."

https://openalex.org/W1613387898,"Nosema ceranae causes a widespread disease that reduces honey bee health but is only thought to infect adult honey bees, not larvae, a critical life stage. We reared honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae in vitro and provide the first demonstration that N. ceranae can infect larvae and decrease subsequent adult longevity. We exposed three-day-old larvae to a single dose of 40,000 (40K), 10,000 (10K), zero (control), or 40K autoclaved (control) N. ceranae spores in larval food. Spores developed intracellularly in midgut cells at the pre-pupal stage (8 days after egg hatching) of 41% of bees exposed as larvae. We counted the number of N. ceranae spores in dissected bee midguts of pre-pupae and, in a separate group, upon adult death. Pre-pupae exposed to the 10K or 40K spore treatments as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Adults exposed as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Larval spore exposure decreased longevity: a 40K treatment decreased the age by which 75% of adult bees died by 28%. Unexpectedly, the low dose (10K) led to significantly greater infection (1.3 fold more spores and 1.5 fold more infected bees) than the high dose (40K) upon adult death. Differential immune activation may be involved if the higher dose triggered a stronger larval immune response that resulted in fewer adult spores but imposed a cost, reducing lifespan. The impact of N. ceranae on honey bee larval development and the larvae of naturally infected colonies therefore deserve further study."
https://openalex.org/W1585740519,"We report a widespread foodborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium parvum in England and Scotland in May 2012. Cases were more common in female adults, and had no history of foreign travel. Over 300 excess cases were identified during the period of the outbreak. Speciation and microbiological typing revealed the outbreak strain to be C. parvum gp60 subtype IIaA15G2R1.Hypothesis generation questionnaires were administered and an unmatched case control study was undertaken to test the hypotheses raised. Cases and controls were interviewed by telephone. Controls were selected using sequential digit dialling. Information was gathered on demographics, foods consumed and retailers where foods were purchased.Seventy-four laboratory confirmed cases and 74 controls were included in analyses. Infection was found to be strongly associated with the consumption of pre-cut mixed salad leaves sold by a single retailer. This is the largest documented outbreak of cryptosporidiosis attributed to a food vehicle."
https://openalex.org/W2418806968,"SLC4A11 has been proposed to be an electrogenic membrane transporter, permeable to Na+, H+ (OH−), bicarbonate, borate, and NH4+. Recent studies indicate, however, that neither bicarbonate or borate is a substrate. Here, we examined potential NH4+, Na+, and H+ contributions to electrogenic ion transport through SLC4A11 stably expressed in Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient PS120 fibroblasts. Inward currents observed during exposure to NH4Cl were determined by the [NH3]o, not [NH4+]o, and current amplitudes varied with the [H+] gradient. These currents were relatively unaffected by removal of Na+, K+, or Cl− from the bath but could be reduced by inclusion of NH4Cl in the pipette solution. Bath pH changes alone did not generate significant currents through SLC4A11, except immediately following exposure to NH4Cl. Reversal potential shifts in response to changing [NH3]o and pHo suggested an NH3/H+-coupled transport mode for SLC4A11. Proton flux through SLC4A11 in the absence of ammonia was relatively small, suggesting that ammonia transport is of more physiological relevance. Methylammonia produced currents similar to NH3 but with reduced amplitude. Estimated stoichiometry of SLC4A11 transport was 1:2 (NH3/H+). NH3-dependent currents were insensitive to 10 μm ethyl-isopropyl amiloride or 100 μm 4,4′- diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. We propose that SLC4A11 is an NH3/2H+ co-transporter exhibiting unique characteristics.

Although SLC4A11 is classified as a member of the SLC4 (solute-linked co-transporter 4) family of bicarbonate transporters, it shares rather low (14–20%) homology with other family members. Phylogenetic analysis of SLC4A11 indicates a separate branch of early evolutionary divergence in the SLC4 family, suggesting a divergent function (9Ogando D.G. Jalimarada S.S. Zhang W. Vithana E.N.

Despite high physiological significance of SLC4A11, its transport characteristics remain unclear. Initial studies suggested that SLC4A11 is an electrogenic 2Na+-OH− (or borate) co-transporter (10Park M. Li Q. Shcheynikov N. Zeng W. Muallem S.

Zeuthen T. Beitz E. Aquaporins. Springer, Berlin2009: 327-358Google Scholar), and a single-point mutation in the aromatic/arginine region (ar/R) can induce ammonia permeability in the ammonia-impermeable water channel AQP1 (15Beitz E. Wu B. Holm L.M. Schultz J.E. Zeuthen T. Point mutations in the aromatic/arginine region in aquaporin 1 allow passage of urea, glycerol, ammonia, and protons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that SLC4A11 may also exhibit ammonia permeability similar to AQPs. To test this hypothesis, we generated two Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)-deficient Chinese hamster PS120 fibroblast cell lines stably expressing high or low levels of SLC4A11. Employing whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that NH4Cl generated significant EIPA- and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-insensitive currents in SLC4A11-expressing PS120 cells. These currents were sensitive to [NH3] and [H+] gradients but were relatively unaffected by Na+, K+, or Cl− at physiological pH. The displayed current-voltage relations are consistent with an electrogenic NH3- and H+-coupled co-transport model. Human SLC4A11-HA-tagged or empty vector (EV) were stably transfected into NHE-deficient PS120 Chinese hamster CCL39 fibroblast cell line as described previously (9Ogando D.G. Jalimarada S.S. Zhang W.

The SLC4A11 (NP_001167561.1) cDNA was subcloned into a plasmid containing a neor gene for Geneticin G418 selection and a C-terminal HA tag (13Vilas G.L. Loganathan S.K. Liu J. Riau A.K. Young J.D.

PS120 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco®, catalog no. 21063, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco®, catalog no. 10082, Life Technologies), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.25 μ/ml fungizone), and 1 mg/ml Geneticin® G418 (catalog no. 10131, Life Technologies). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 water-jacketed incubator. Culture medium was changed every other day. SLC4A11- or EV- PS120 cells were grown on 6-well plates for 3 days before protein extraction. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, scrapped off from the wells, and sonicated in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid-sodium salt, 2% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the 280-nm absorbance assay with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Protein (15 μg/well) in Protein Loading Buffer Blue (2×) (National Diagnostics, catalog no. EC-886, Atlanta, GA) was resolved on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and wet-transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (25 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with primary antibodies in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: 1) rabbit polyclonal anti-SLC4A11 (1:1000; 16B12, Covance); 2) mouse monoclonal anti-HA (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); or 3) mouse monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (1:5000; DM1A, Novus Biologicals). Next, membranes were probed with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody, 1:5000, catalog no. A8924 (Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody, 1:5000, catalogue no. A0545 (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound secondary antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Supersignal West Pico, Pierce). Band densities and background were quantified using UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.1 (Silk Scientific). Intracellular pH measurements were performed as described previously (9Ogando D.G. Jalimarada S.S. Zhang W. Vithana E.N. Bonanno J.A. SLC4A11 is an EIPA-sensitive Na+-permeable pHi regulator.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2013; 305: C716-C727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, PS120 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm diameter glass coverslips (Neuvitro Corp., El Monte, CA) for 2–3 days. Before each experiment, cells were incubated with 10 μm pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′7′-bis(carboxyethy)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in Ringer's solution for 30 min at room temperature and washed in dye-free Ringer's solution for another 30 min. The Ringer's solution contained 143.5 mm Na+, 4 mm K+, 0.6 mm Mg2+, 1.4 mm Ca2+, 118 mm Cl−, 1 mm HPO42−, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm gluconate−, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.5. Na+-free Ringer's solution contains 143.5 mm NMDG+ instead of Na+. All of the experimental solutions were equilibrated with air and adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1 n NaOH at 37 °C. Osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 295–300 mosm with sucrose. Coverslips with subconfluent cells were mounted into a perfusion chamber. The chamber was then placed on a stage warmer (37 °C) of an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE200, Nikon, Japan). Solutions were kept at 37 °C in a warming box, and the flow of the perfusate (∼0.5 ml/min) was achieved by gravity. Cells were imaged with an oil immersion objective (×40; Nikon). BCECF fluorescence was excited alternately at 495 ± 10 and 440 ± 10 nm, and the emitted light was collected through a bandpass filter (520–550 nm). Fluorescence ratios (495 nm/440 nm) were obtained at 1 Hz and converted into pHi using the high K+/nigericin calibration approach (16Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Intracellular pH measurements in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells utilizing spectroscopic probes generated in situ.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). SLC4A11- and EV-PS120 cells were cultured on 25-mm glass coverslips as described above to ∼10–20% confluence. High expression Col4 SlC4A11-PS120 cells were used in all electrophysiology experiments. Whole-cell currents were amplified using an EPC7 amplifier controlled by pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in the episodic mode. The holding potential was set to −60 mV unless otherwise indicated. The currents were filtered at 3 kHz and sampled at 1 kHz. Each episode lasted 2 s and included a 100-ms voltage ramp from −100 to +100 mV. Series resistance compensation was set at 50%. CLAMPFIT 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for data analysis. Only recordings obtained with a series resistance of less than 10 megaohms were analyzed. Background currents were subtracted when analyzing current amplitude and consequent current density data. No background current subtraction was done when the reversal potential values were determined. The liquid junction potential was subtracted before reporting reversal potential values. An agar salt bridge was used to connect reference electrode and the bath to minimize possible Ag/AgCl reference electrode potential changes during solution exchanges. Complete solution exchange required about 10–15 s in the recording chamber used for electrophysiological experiments (22–23 °C). The compositions of extracellular (E) and pipette (intracellular; I) solutions are listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, respectively. Extracellular solutions were adjusted to desired pH (pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5) with 1 n HCl, 1 n NaOH, or 1 m NMDG base solution (for Na+-free E5). Intracellular solution pH was adjusted with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane base to pH 7.2. Osmolality of all solutions was adjusted to 300–310 mosm with mannitol. 10 mm NH4Cl, methylammonium, tetraethylammonium, or 5 mm (NH4)2SO4 salt was added fresh at the day of the experiment. The (NH4)2SO4 salt was used instead of NH4Cl for Cl−-free E6 solution. Equal 0.17 mm NH3, pH 6.5, pH 7.5, and pH 8.5 E2 solutions were made by equal molar substitution of NMDG-Cl in base E2 solution by 98.5 mm, 10 mm, and 1.16 mm NH4Cl, respectively. Solution E8 was used to make 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mm NH4Cl extracellular solutions by equal molar substitution of NMDG-Cl with NH4Cl.TABLE 1Composition of extracellular solutionsE1E2E4 (0 K+)E5 (0 Na+, 0 K+)E6 (0 Cl−, 0 K+)E8mmmmmmNaCl143.545143.580NMDG-Cl98.5143.5100K2HPO41KCl3Calcium gluconate1.41.41.41.41.41.4MgCl21.221.221.221.221.221.22HEPES101010101010Glucose5.15.15.15.15.15.1NaMeSO3143.5 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Composition of intracellular solutionsI1I1-NH4I2mmmmmmCsMeSO3125125145CaCl255CsCl10MgCl2222.2HEPES103010EGTA10100.5NH4Cl10pH7.27.27.2 Open table in a new tab Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

Throughout, data are presented as mean ± S.E., in which significance level is indicated as follows: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). Previously, using BCECF pHi measurements, we observed increased Na+ and NH4+ permeability and higher capacity to recover from acid loads in SLC4A11-expressing HEK293 or PS120 cells (9Ogando D.G. Jalimarada S.S. Zhang W. Vithana E.N. Bonanno J.A. SLC4A11 is an EIPA-sensitive Na+-permeable pHi regulator.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2013; 305: C716-C727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further clarify the underlying mechanisms, we generated two stably transfected PS120 cell lines (Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient), high expression colony 4 (Col4) and low expression colony 12 (Col12). We determined, by Western blot, that Col4 expressed 1.34 times more SLC4A11 than Col12 (anti-HA; Fig. 1A), whereas no endogenous SLC4A11 can be detected in EV-PS120 cells (anti-SLC4A11; Fig. 1A). Employing these two colonies of SLC4A11-PS120 cells, we examined the pHi response to extracellular 10 mm NH4Cl, relative to EV. Fig. 1B shows that NH4Cl application caused a rapid pHi rise in both SLC4A11-PS120 and EV-PS120 (labeled a) due to NH3 gas diffusion and intracellular production of NH4+ and OH− (17Boron W.F. De Weer P. Intracellular pH transients in squid giant axons caused by CO2, NH3, and metabolic inhibitors.J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In phase b, pHi plateaued in EV-PS120 cells (−0.01 ± 0.02 ΔpH/Δmin), whereas a significant acidification occurred in SLC4A11-PS120 cells. The acidification rate (ΔpH/Δmin) was 1.57 times higher in Col4 (−0.11 ± 0.02, n = 3) than in Col12 cells (−0.07 ± 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 1C). Removing NH4Cl (phase c) caused a prominent acidification: ΔpHi −0.68 ± 0.10 in Col4 (n = 3) and 1.55 times less ΔpHi −0.44 ± 0.03 in Col12 (n = 3), whereas essentially no acidification occurred (−0.08 ± 0.04, n = 5) in EV-PS120 cells (Fig. 1D). Phase b acidification is generally attributed to a finite permeability to NH4+, and consequent phase c acidification is a H+ loading effect from the finite NH4+ permeability in phase b (17Boron W.F. De Weer P. Intracellular pH transients in squid giant axons caused by CO2, NH3, and metabolic inhibitors.J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The extents of acidification during phases b and c were both positively associated with the SLC4A11 expression level (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, we reasoned that SLC4A11 expression increased the apparent NH4+ permeability in PS120 cells. This permeability could be solo NH4+ transport or co-transport of NH3-H+ (14Litman T. Søgaard R. Zeuthen T. Beitz E. Aquaporins. Springer, Berlin2009: 327-358Google Scholar), but it cannot be differentiated by BCECF pHi measurements. A previous study provided evidence that SLC4A11 may function as an electrogenic transporter in SLC4A11-HEK293 cells (10Park M. Li Q. Shcheynikov N. Zeng W. Muallem S. NaBC1 is a ubiquitous electrogenic Na+-coupled borate transporter essential for cellular boron homeostasis and cell growth and proliferation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next used the whole-cell patch clamp approach to determine whether the apparent NH4+ (or NH3-H+) permeability creates charge movements by applying 10 mm eNH4Cl to SLC4A11-PS120 Col4 cells. NH4Cl solutions were adjusted to three different extracellular pH levels (7.5, 6.5, and 8.5) to vary the proportion of NH3 to NH4+. No currents were observed in EV-PS120 during any of these NH4Cl exposures (Fig. 2A, top). In contrast, in SLC4A11-PS120 shown in Fig. 2A (bottom), pH 7.5 eNH4Cl application caused inward currents of −6.18 ± 1.09 pA/pF, (n = 7), whereas pH 6.5 eNH4Cl induced significantly smaller inward currents (−0.22 ± 0.19 pA/pF, n = 4), and pH 8.5 eNH4Cl elicited markedly larger inward currents (−18.43 ± 3.43 pA/pF, n = 4. Fig. 2B shows a summary bar graph of current density for EV- and SLC4A11-PS120 cells. In Fig. 2C, we plotted the current density against [NH3]o (left), [H+]o (middle), and [NH4+]o (right), respectively. The eNH4Cl-dependent current density varied directly with [NH3]o but inversely with [H+]o or [NH4+]o. From pH 6.5 to 8.5, the 84-fold increase in current density was concomitant with a 75-fold increase in [NH3]o; conversely, there was essentially no change (17% decrease) in [NH4+]o and a 100-fold decrease in [H+]o. These results suggest that NH3 is the actual transported species and that the [NH3] gradient contributes to the driving force in SLC4A11 transport. To further test this hypothesis, we adjusted the NH4Cl concentration to achieve equal [NH3]o = 0.17 mm in the three different pH solutions. This required 98.5 mm NH4Cl in the pH 6.5 E2 solution, 10 mm NH4Cl in pH 7.5 E2, and 1.16 mm NH4Cl in pH8.5 E2, calculated from NH4+ pKa = 9.25 (equal molar substitution with NMDG-Cl). Fig. 3A shows a sample trace of current recording, and Fig. 3B shows the summary bar graph of current density. In this series, with [NH3] being equal (0.17 mm), we observed similar amplitude in current density under pH 6.5 and 8.5 compared with pH 7.5. This result strongly supports the notion that [NH3]o rather than [NH4+]o drives the inward currents through SLC4A11. Interestingly, further analysis of current density revealed small differences between each pH condition (n = 3; repeated ANOVA, p = 0.001). It appears that [H+] gradients or extracellular pH affects SLC4A11 activity, whereas the inward current density is primarily determined by [NH3]o. Given that NH3 is an uncharged molecule, we next tested whether K+, Cl−, or Na+ is the charge carrier of the eNH4Cl-dependent currents. Refer to Table 2 for solution composition. Removal of K+ (E1 K+ versus E4 K+-free) had no effect on eNH4Cl-dependent currents at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 (Fig. 4A; factorial ANOVA, p = 0.716). Similarly, removal of extracellular Cl− (5 mm (NH4)2SO4 was added in both Cl−-free E6 and Cl−-rich E4 solutions for comparison) did not affect the eNH4Cl-dependent current at pH 7.5 (independent t test, p = 0.65; Fig. 4B). Removal of Na+ (E4 Na+-rich versus E5 Na+-free) did not significantly affect eNH4Cl-dependent currents at pH 6.5 or 7.5 (Fig. 4C; factorial ANOVA Na+, p = 0.108; Na+/pH interaction, p = 0.058), but interestingly, the absence of Na+ enhanced eNH4Cl-dependent inward currents by 38% at pH 8.5 (Fig. 4, C and D). At pH 8.5, eNH4Cl-dependent current density in 143.5 mm Na+ E4 was −18.43 ± 3.43 pA/pF (n = 4), whereas it was −29.71 ± 4.62 pA/pF (n = 6) in Na+-free E5 (independent t test, p = 0.115; Fig. 4C). In summary, it is unlikely that K+, Cl−, or Na+ carries the eNH4Cl-dependent currents. However, there is some interaction with Na+ at high pHo. In Fig. 2A (bottom trace, solid arrow) and Fig. 4D (open arrow), we observed inward current induced by a bath pH decrease (8.5 → 7.5) after a pH 8.5 NH4Cl pulse, suggesting that SLC4A11 can provide H+ conductance. Fig. 3 shows that [H+]o affects SLC4A11 inward current density and kinetics in the presence of NH3. Fig. 5A (and Figs. 2A and 4D), however, shows that simple bath pH changes do not induce noticeable current. These data suggest that H+ current is only measurable when there is NH3 present. In Fig. 2A, a pH 8.5 wash after pH 8.5 NH4Cl pulse induced an outward current (labeled with a star). We reasoned that this outward current is the efflux of NH3 coupled to H+ resulting from outward NH3 and H+ gradient during wash. To validate, we applied a pH 8.5 wash following a pH 7.5 NH4Cl pulse, creating a greater outward [H+] gradient than a pH 7.5 wash. Fig. 5B shows smaller but measureable outward current (relative to the initial baseline) during this pH 8.5 wash, supporting the notion of NH3-coupled H+ efflux. In contrast, no outward current is observed during a pH 7.5 wash after pH 7.5 eNH4Cl pulse, indicating that an outward H+ gradient is needed. Fig. 5C (right trace) shows that later in the same cell, a pH 8.5 eNH4Cl pulse was followed by a pH 8.5 wash. The outward current (point c) during the wash is consistent with outward gradients of both [NH3] and [H+]. Interestingly, a return to pH 7.5 bath produced a significant inward current (point e), consistent with an increased [H+] inward gradient. These data show that significant H+ current through SLC4A11 can occur after an NH4Cl pulse. To provide further insight into this potential NH3-H+ co-transport model, we examined the reversal potentials at key points in Fig. 5C. The liquid junction potential was estimated to be 8.9 mV in this E4-I1 solution pairing and was subtracted from raw Erev values before analysis. Fig. 5D (a) shows the I-V relation at point a in Fig. 5C. The Erev was −4.16 ± 1.47 mV (n = 10), inconsistent with solo NH4+ conductance, which will otherwise result in large positive Erev (14Litman T. Søgaard R. Zeuthen T. Beitz E. Aquaporins. Springer, Berlin2009: 327-358Google Scholar). Furthermore, we analyzed Erev at time points b, c, d, and e (during and after pH 8.5 NH4Cl pulse). Fig. 5D (b), during pH 8.5 NH4Cl, Erev was −21.56 ± 1.98 mV (n = 4) at the inward current peak. Ten seconds into the pH 8.5 wash (point c), Erev shifted to −66.24 ± 2.03 mV (n = 4). Assuming that [H+]o, [H+]i, and [NH3]i changed very little from b to c in this short time frame, the decreasing [NH3]o should result in a left shift of Erev to a more negative value and result in outward current. Indeed, we observed a negative shift in Erev and NH3-H+ outward currents, representing efflux of NH3-H+ following NH3 and H+ outward gradient. Returning to pH 7.5 bath, Erev shifted from −66.37 ± 2.23 mV (n = 4, point d) to −37.60 ± 5.30 mV (n = 4, point e). This Erev rightward shift was induced by increased [H+]inward gradient and resulted in inward currents. In summary, these data suggest that [NH3] and [H+] changes synergistically affect current direction and apparent Erev in SLC4A11-PS120 cells, supporting the hypothesis that NH3 and H+ are transported in a coupled manner. Fig. 1B suggests that the resting pHi in SLC4A11-transfected cells is lower than EV. Analysis of data from more cells (Fig. 6A) shows that the resting pHi was significantly lower in SLC4A11-PS120 Col4 (pHi 6.98 ± 0.08, n = 20) relative to EV-PS120 (pHi 7.32 ± 0.08, n = 23), suggesting that SLC4A11 provides some H+ permeability in the absence of NH3, where a negative membrane potential could drive H+ influx, as proposed in a recent report (12Kao L. Azimov R. Abuladze N. Newman D. Kurtz I. Human SLC4A11-C functions as a DIDS-stimulatable H+(OH−) permeation pathway: partial correction of R109H mutant transport.Am. J. Physiol.

Nevertheless, increased H+ permeability is evident in SLC4A11-transfected cells during the acid recovery following NH4Cl pulses in previous reports (9Ogando D.G. Jalimarada S.S. Zhang W. Vithana E.N.

Our analyses of fractionalized inventorships demonstrate that women's rate of patenting has increased from 2.7% of total patenting activity to 10.8% over the nearly 40-year period. Our results show that, in every technological area, female patenting is proportionally more likely to occur in academic institutions than in corporate or government environments. However, women's patents have a lower technological impact than that of men, and that gap is wider in the case of academic patents. We also provide evidence that patents to which women--and in particular academic women--contributed are associated with a higher number of International Patent Classification (IPC) codes and co-inventors than men. The policy implications of these disparities and academic setting advantages are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1857148454,"Efficient vaccine delivery to mucosal tissues including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues is essential for the development of mucosal vaccine. We previously reported that claudin-4 was highly expressed on the epithelium of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and thus claudin-4-targeting using C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) effectively delivered fused antigen to NALT and consequently induced antigen-specific immune responses. In this study, we applied the C-CPE-based vaccine delivery system to develop a nasal pneumococcal vaccine. We fused C-CPE with pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), an important antigen for the induction of protective immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, (PspA-C-CPE). PspA-C-CPE binds to claudin-4 and thus efficiently attaches to NALT epithelium, including antigen-sampling M cells. Nasal immunization with PspA-C-CPE induced PspA-specific IgG in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as IgA in the nasal wash and BALF. These immune responses were sufficient to protect against pneumococcal infection. These results suggest that C-CPE is an efficient vaccine delivery system for the development of nasal vaccines against pneumococcal infection."

Policies required that those affiliated with the institution post appropriate content, represent the unit appropriately, and moderate conversations with coworkers and external agencies.

A recent meta-analysis reported 35% (796/2,296) of antimalarial drug samples from 21 Sub-Saharan African countries, purchased from outlets predominantly using convenience sampling, failed chemical content analysis. We used three sampling strategies to purchase artemisinin-containing antimalarials (ACAs) in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria, and compared the resulting quality estimates. Methods ACAs were purchased using three sampling approaches - convenience, mystery clients and overt, within a defined area and sampling frame in Enugu metropolis. The active pharmaceutical ingredients were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by mass spectrometry at three independent laboratories. Results were expressed as percentage of APIs stated on the packaging and used to categorise each sample as acceptable quality, substandard, degraded, or falsified. Results Content analysis of 3024 samples purchased from 421 outlets using convenience (n=200), mystery (n=1,919) and overt (n=905) approaches, showed overall 90.8% ACAs to be of acceptable quality, 6.8% substandard, 1.3% degraded and 1.2% falsified. Convenience sampling yielded a significantly higher prevalence of poor quality ACAs, but was not evident by the mystery and overt sampling strategies both of which yielded results that were comparable between each other. Artesunate (n=135; 4 falsified) and dihydroartemisinin (n=14) monotherapy tablets, not recommended by WHO, were also identified. Conclusion Randomised sampling identified fewer falsified ACAs than previously reported by convenience approaches. Our findings emphasise the need for specific consideration to be given to sampling frame and sampling approach if representative information on drug quality is to be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2155899276,"About 25% of European livestock intake is based on permanent and sown grasslands. To fulfill rising demand for animal products, an intensification of livestock production may lead to an increased consumption of crop and compound feeds. In order to preserve an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture, a more forage based livestock alimentation may be an advantage. However, besides management, grassland productivity is highly vulnerable to climate (i.e., temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration), and spatial information about European grassland productivity in response to climate change is scarce. The process-based vegetation model ORCHIDEE-GM, containing an explicit representation of grassland management (i.e., herbage mowing and grazing), is used here to estimate changes in potential productivity and potential grass-fed ruminant livestock density across European grasslands over the period 1961-2010. Here ""potential grass-fed ruminant livestock density"" denotes the maximum density of livestock that can be supported by grassland productivity in each 25 km × 25 km grid cell. In reality, livestock density could be higher than potential (e.g., if additional feed is supplied to animals) or lower (e.g., in response to economic factors, pedo-climatic and biotic conditions ignored by the model, or policy decisions that can for instance reduce livestock numbers). When compared to agricultural statistics (Eurostat and FAOstat), ORCHIDEE-GM gave a good reproduction of the regional gradients of annual grassland productivity and ruminant livestock density. The model however tends to systematically overestimate the absolute values of productivity in most regions, suggesting that most grid cells remain below their potential grassland productivity due to possible nutrient and biotic limitations on plant growth. When ORCHIDEE-GM was run for the period 1961-2010 with variable climate and rising CO2, an increase of potential annual production (over 3%) per decade was found: 97% of this increase was attributed to the rise in CO2, -3% to climate trends and 15% to trends in nitrogen fertilization and deposition. When compared with statistical data, ORCHIDEE-GM captures well the observed phase of climate-driven interannual variability in grassland production well, whereas the magnitude of the interannual variability in modeled productivity is larger than the statistical data. Regional grass-fed livestock numbers can be reproduced by ORCHIDEE-GM based on its simple assumptions and parameterization about productivity being the only limiting factor to define the sustainable number of animals per unit area. Causes for regional model-data misfits are discussed, including uncertainties in farming practices (e.g., nitrogen fertilizer application, and mowing and grazing intensity) and in ruminant diet composition, as well as uncertainties in the statistical data and in model parameter values."
https://openalex.org/W1483409400,"Objectives Maternal obesity has multiple associated risks and requires substantial intervention. This research evaluated the implementation of maternal obesity care pathways from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Study Design A simultaneous mixed methods model with data integration was used. Three component studies were given equal priority. 1: Semi-structured qualitative interviews explored obese pregnant women’s experiences of being on the pathways. 2: A quantitative and qualitative postal survey explored healthcare professionals’ experiences of delivering the pathways. 3: A case note audit quantitatively assessed pathway compliance. Data were integrated using following a thread and convergence coding matrix methods to search for agreement and disagreement between studies. Results Study 1: Four themes were identified: women’s overall (positive and negative) views of the pathways; knowledge and understanding of the pathways; views on clinical and weight management advice and support; and views on the information leaflet. Key results included positive views of receiving additional clinical care, negative experiences of risk communication, and weight management support was considered a priority. Study 2: Healthcare professionals felt the pathways were worthwhile, facilitated good practice, and increased confidence. Training was consistently identified as being required. Healthcare professionals predominantly focussed on women’s response to sensitive obesity communication. Study 3: There was good compliance with antenatal clinical interventions. However, there was poor compliance with public health and postnatal interventions. There were some strong areas of agreement between component studies which can inform future development of the pathways. However, disagreement between studies included a lack of shared priorities between healthcare professionals and women, different perspectives on communication issues, and different perspectives on women’s prioritisation of weight management. Conclusion The differences between healthcare professionals’ and women’s priorities and perspectives are important factors to consider when developing care pathways. Shared perspectives could help facilitate more effective implementation of the pathway interventions that have poor compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2340380105,"Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer) is one of the most important pathogens in ducks. The bacteria causes acute or chronic septicemia characterized by fibrinous pericarditis and meningitis. The R. anatipestifer genome encodes multiple iron/hemin-uptake systems that facilitate adaptation to iron-limited host environments. These systems include several TonB-dependent transporters and three TonB proteins responsible for energy transduction. These three tonB genes are present in all the R. anatipestifer genomes sequenced so far. Two of these genes are contained within the exbB-exbD-tonB1 and exbB-exbD-exbD-tonB2 operons. The third, tonB3, forms a monocistronic transcription unit. The inability to recover derivatives deleted for this gene suggests its product is essential for R. anatipestifer growth. Here, we show that deletion of tonB1 had no effect on hemin uptake of R. anatipestifer, though disruption of tonB2 strongly decreases hemin uptake, and disruption of both tonB1 and tonB2 abolishes the transport of exogenously added hemin. The ability of R. anatipestifer to grow on iron-depleted medium is decreased by tonB2 but not tonB1 disruption. When expressed in an E. coli model strain, the TonB1 complex, TonB2 complex, and TonB3 protein from R. anatipestifer cannot energize heterologous hemin transporters. Further, only the TonB1 complex can energize a R. anatipestifer hemin transporter when co-expressed in an E. coli model strain."

We have also found that the overexpression of PLA/AT-3 in mammalian cells results in specific disappearance of peroxisomes. However, its molecular mechanism remained unclear. In the present study, we first established a HEK293 cell line, which stably expresses a fluorescent peroxisome marker protein (DsRed2-Peroxi) and expresses PLA/AT-3 in a tetracycline-dependent manner. The treatment with tetracycline, as expected, caused disappearance of peroxisomes within 24 h, as revealed by diffuse signals of DsRed2-Peroxi and a remarkable decrease in a peroxisomal membrane protein, PMP70. A time-dependent decrease in ether-type lipid levels was also seen. Because the activation of LC3, a marker of autophagy, was not observed, the involvement of autophagy was unlikely. Among various peroxins responsible for peroxisome biogenesis, Pex19p functions as a chaperone protein for the transportation of peroxisomal membrane proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that PLA/AT-3 binds to Pex19p through its N-terminal proline-rich and C-terminal hydrophobic domains.

Peroxisomes are single membrane-surrounded organelles present in virtually all eukaryotic cells and are involved in a wide variety of metabolic events, including scavenging of peroxides and reactive oxygen species, the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids, and the biosynthesis of all ether-type lipid precursors (1Purdue P.E.

The physiological importance of peroxisomes has been confirmed by the analysis of a number of inherited diseases exhibiting peroxisome dysfunctions (6Weller S. Gould S.J. Valle D.

Peroxins, encoded by the PEX genes, are a series of proteins responsible for the biogenesis of peroxisomes, and their defects lead to the dysfunction of peroxisomes. So far, 31 peroxins have been reported, and they are involved in the generation and division of peroxisomes as well as the import of peroxisomal proteins (4Smith J.J. Aitchison J.D.

As a machinery of peroxisome biogenesis, it is well known that nascent peroxisomal matrix proteins are transported into peroxisomes with the aid of several peroxins, which recognize peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs), 2The abbreviations used are: PTSperoxisome targeting signalADHAPSalkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthaseDOXdoxycyclineEGFPenhanced green fluorescence proteinESIelectrospray ionizationHRASLSHRAS-like suppressorMADAGmonoalkyldiacylglycerolNLSnuclear localization signalPCphosphatidylcholinePLAphospholipase APLA/ATphospholipase A/acyltransferasePMPperoxisomal membrane proteinPNSpostnuclear supernatantERendoplasmic reticulum.

Peroxisome membrane proteins: multiple trafficking routes and multiple functions?.Biochem. J. 2013; 451: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it is poorly understood how peroxisome membrane structure is formed and how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are transported into peroxisomes. In addition, because peroxisomes lack the phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes necessary for the formation of peroxisome membrane structure, phospholipids must be trafficked and supplied to peroxisomes from other organelles, such as the ER. Pex3p, Pex16p, and Pex19p have been identified as peroxins indispensable for peroxisome membrane assembly and PMP transport, and the cells deficient in these proteins are devoid of peroxisome structure itself (8Fujiki Y. Yagita Y. Matsuzaki T. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders: Molecular basis for impaired peroxisomal membrane assembly: in metabolic functions and biogenesis of peroxisomes in health and disease.Biochim.

Pex19p is predominantly localized to cytoplasm and binds to various PMPs, whereas Pex3p and Pex16p are associated with peroxisomal membrane and function as the membrane-anchoring site for Pex19p·PMP complexes and as the receptor for Pex3p·Pex19p complex, respectively (10Fujiki Y.

The abundance of peroxisomes is remarkably affected by the nutritional environment and specific conditions (11Nordgren M. Wang B. Apanasets O. Fransen M. Peroxisome degradation in mammals: mechanisms of action, recent advances, and perspectives.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For example, peroxisomes can be induced and proliferated in yeast cultured in methanol as a sole carbon source and in rodents treated with peroxisome proliferators. Increased peroxisomes are rapidly decreased and degraded by altering the environment or by withdrawing peroxisome proliferators (12Iwata J. Ezaki J. Komatsu M. Yokota S. Ueno T. Tanida I. Chiba T.

These results indicate that peroxisome levels are reciprocally regulated by the balance between their biogenesis and degradation. Recently, it has been reported that the selective autophagy of peroxisomes, pexophagy, contributes to the maintenance of quality and quantity of peroxisomes (11Nordgren M. Wang B. Apanasets O.

Unexpectedly, we found that the overexpression of PLA/AT-3 (HRASLS3, H-rev107, or AdPLA) or PLA/AT-2 (HRASLS2) in mammalian cells results in the disappearance of peroxisome membrane structure and the dysfunction of peroxisomes, as revealed by a remarkable decrease in the intracellular levels of ether-type lipids (27Uyama T.

The disappearance of peroxisomes was dependent on the enzyme activity of PLA/AT-3 because the mutant devoid of enzyme activity failed to affect peroxisome functions (27Uyama T. Ichi I. Kono N.

Because the phenotypes appearing in cells by the overexpression of PLA/AT-3 or -2 were similar to those in Pex3p-, Pex16p-, or Pex19p-deficient cells, we presumed that the negative regulation of peroxisomes by these PLA/AT proteins is mediated by these peroxins. In this study, we show that PLA/AT-3 is a novel Pex19p-binding protein and suppresses the binding of Pex19p to PMPs. The enzyme activity of PLA/AT-3 was unrelated to its binding to Pex19p but was required to suppress the interaction of Pex19p with PMPs. These results suggest the presence of a novel regulatory mechanism for peroxisome biogenesis through the interaction between Pex19p and PLA/AT-3. 1,2-[1-14C]Dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

All constructs were sequenced in both directions using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Invitrogen). HEK293, HEK293T, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Expression vectors or siRNAs were introduced into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer's instructions, respectively. The final concentration of siRNA was 20 nm. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were used for RT-PCR, PLA1/2 assay, and metabolic labeling with [14C]hexadecanol. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR vector, expressing tetracycline repressor, by the use of Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were selected in the medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Clonal cell lines were isolated by colony lifting and maintained in the blasticidin-containing medium.

Clonal cell lines were isolated by colony lifting and maintained in the medium containing Geneticin and blasticidin. One of the obtained clones, named DsRed2-PTS1 cell, was transfected with pcDNA5/TO vector, expressing FL-PLA/AT-3, by the use of Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were selected in the medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 600 μg/ml Geneticin, and 6 μg/ml blasticidin. Clonal cell lines were isolated by colony lifting and maintained in the medium containing hygromycin, Geneticin, and blasticidin. One of the obtained cell lines was named FL-PLA/AT-3-Tet-on and used throughout this study. To measure PLA1/2 activity, the harvested cells were suspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated three times each for 3 s. The cell homogenates (30 μg of protein) were incubated with 200 μm 1,2-[1-14C]dipalmitoyl-PC (45,000 cpm) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 320 μl of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 5 mm 3(2)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the lower fraction was spotted on a silica gel thin layer plate (10-cm height) and developed at 4 °C for 25 min in chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). The distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified using a BAS1500 bioimaging analyzer (FUJIX Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For Western blotting unrelated to the immunoprecipitation assay, cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer by being passed through a 25-gauge syringe (for COS-7 cells) or a 27-gauge syringe (for HEK293 cells) (27Uyama T.

The resultant postnuclear supernatant (PNS) fractions were then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosol (supernatant fractions) from cellular organelles (particulate fractions). For the immunoprecipitation assay, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as cell lysate. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the aid of anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose or antibody-conjugated Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer A) and then incubated with primary antibodies in buffer A at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies in buffer A at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were finally treated with an ECL Plus kit and visualized with the aid of a LAS1000plus lumino-imaging analyzer (FUJIX Ltd.). Total RNAs were isolated from cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit. cDNAs were prepared from total RNAs using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit and subjected to PCR amplification by Ex Taq DNA polymerase. The primers used are shown in supplemental Table 2. The PCR conditions used were as follows: denaturation at 96 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s (24 cycles for GAPDH, 28 cycles for others). Cells were grown at 37 °C to 80% confluence in a 6-well plate containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were labeled with [1-14C]hexadecanol (1.6 μCi) for 18 h.

Studies investigating the onset of individual organ injury such as the liver, kidneys and brain during the evolution of acute liver failure, are lacking. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding strands of RNA that are released into the circulation following tissue injury. In this study, we have characterised the release of both global microRNA and specific microRNA species into the plasma using a porcine model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. Pigs were induced to acute liver failure with oral acetaminophen over 19h±2h and death occurred 13h±3h thereafter. Global microRNA concentrations increased 4h prior to acute liver failure in plasma (P<0.0001) but not in isolated exosomes, and were associated with increasing plasma levels of the damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, genomic DNA (P<0.0001). MiR122 increased around the time of onset of acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing international normalised ratio (P<0.0001). MiR192 increased 8h after acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing creatinine (P<0.0001). The increase in miR124-1 occurred concurrent with the pre-terminal increase in intracranial pressure (P<0.0001) and was associated with decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (P<0.002). Conclusions MicroRNAs were released passively into the circulation in response to acetaminophen-induced cellular damage. A significant increase in global microRNA was detectable prior to significant increases in miR122, miR192 and miR124-1, which were associated with clinical evidence of liver, kidney and brain injury respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1528432578,"Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies. A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady. Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields. This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects, with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets. Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries, apparent superluminal motions, and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies. Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. A bright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 ± 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 ± 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots--as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging."

https://openalex.org/W1508023946,"Unlike p53, which is mutated at a high rate in human cancers, its homologue p73 is not mutated but is often overexpressed, suggesting a possible context-dependent role in growth promotion. Previously, we have shown that co-expression of TAp73 with the proto-oncogene c-Jun can augment cellular growth and potentiate transactivation of activator protein (AP)-1 target genes such as cyclin D1. Here, we provide further mechanistic insights into the cooperative activity between these two transcription factors. Our data show that TAp73-mediated AP-1 target gene transactivation relies on c-Jun dimerization and requires the canonical AP-1 sites on target gene promoters. Interestingly, only selected members of the Fos family of proteins such as c-Fos and Fra1 were found to cooperate with TAp73 in a c-Jun-dependent manner to transactivate AP-1 target promoters. Inducible expression of TAp73 led to the recruitment of these Fos family members to the AP-1 target promoters on which TAp73 was found to be bound near the AP-1 site. Consistent with the binding of TAp73 and AP-1 members on the target promoters in a c-Jun-dependent manner, TAp73 was observed to physically interact with c-Jun specifically at the chromatin via its carboxyl-terminal region. Furthermore, co-expression of c-Fos or Fra1 was able to cooperate with TAp73 in potentiating cellular growth, similarly to c-Jun. These data together suggest that TAp73 plays a vital role in activation of AP-1 target genes via direct binding to c-Jun at the target promoters, leading to enhanced loading of other AP-1 family members, thereby leading to cellular growth."
https://openalex.org/W417940768,"Effective conservation management for climate adaptation rests on understanding the factors driving species' vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner so as to direct on-ground action. However, there have been only few attempts to map the spatial distribution of the factors driving vulnerability to climate change. Here we conduct a species-level assessment of climate change vulnerability for a sample of Australia's threatened species and map the distribution of species affected by each factor driving climate change vulnerability across the continent. Almost half of the threatened species assessed were considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change: amphibians being the most vulnerable group, followed by plants, reptiles, mammals and birds. Species with more restricted distributions were more likely to show high climate change vulnerability than widespread species. The main factors driving climate change vulnerability were low genetic variation, dependence on a particular disturbance regime and reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat. The geographic distribution of the species impacted by each driver varies markedly across the continent, for example species impacted by low genetic variation are prevalent across the human-dominated south-east of the country, while reliance on particular moisture regimes is prevalent across northern Australia. Our results show that actions to address climate adaptation will need to be spatially appropriate, and that in some regions a complex suite of factors driving climate change vulnerability will need to be addressed. Taxonomic and geographic variation in the factors driving climate change vulnerability highlights an urgent need for a spatial prioritisation of climate adaptation actions for threatened species."
https://openalex.org/W905349152,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts in early childhood and has a comprehensive impact on psychosocial activity and education as well as general health across the lifespan. Despite its prevalence, the current diagnostic criteria for ADHD are debated. Saccadic eye movements are easy to quantify and may be a quantitative biomarker for a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ADHD. The goal of this study was to examine whether children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities during a visually guided pro-saccadic eye-movement and to clarify the neurophysiological mechanisms associated with their behavioral impairments. Thirty-seven children with ADHD (aged 5-11 years) and 88 typically developing (TD) children (aged 5-11 years) were asked to perform a simple saccadic eye-movement task in which step and gap conditions were randomly interleaved. We evaluated the gap effect, which is the difference in the reaction time between the two conditions. Children with ADHD had a significantly longer reaction time than TD children (p < 0.01) and the gap effect was markedly attenuated (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the measurement of saccadic eye movements may provide a novel method for evaluating the behavioral symptoms and clinical features of ADHD, and that the gap effect is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of ADHD in early childhood."

In particular, hemp-lime composite shows low shrinkage and high thermal and acoustic insulating properties. However, this material also shows a great ability to absorb water, an aspect that can turn out to be negative for the long-term durability of the building. For this reason, the hygric properties of hemp-based composites need to be studied to ensure the correct use of this material in construction and repair works. The water absorption, drying and transpirability of hemp composites made with aerial (in the form of dry powder and putty) and hydraulic limes were investigated here and related to the microbial growth induced by the water movements within the material. Results show that hemp-natural hydraulic lime mixes exhibit the highest transpirability and drying rate, the lowest water absorption by immersion and capillary uptake and the least intense microbial attack and chromatic change. A microscopical study of the hemp shives also related their great ability to absorb water to the near-irreversible swelling of their structure under dry-wet conditions."

Morphological, X-ray and 3D-CT scan skull-cap evaluation revealed that the main orifice was produced by scraping, obtained by clockwise rotary motion of a right-handed surgeon facing the patient, while the partial trephination was carried out by using a stone point as a drilling tool. In both cases, bone regrowth is indicative of the individual's prolonged postoperative survival and his near-complete recovery. The right femur shows a poorly healed mid-shaft fracture presumably induced by a high energy injury, and a resulting chronic osteomyelitis, affecting both femurs by hematogenous spread of the infection. Our observations on the visual and radiological features of skull and femur lesions, along with evidence on the timing of experimental bone regrowth vs. healing of lower limb fractures associated to long-term bone infections now suggest that this young man underwent a double skull trephination in order to alleviate his extremely painful condition induced by chronic osteomyelitis, which is thought to have been the cause of death."

https://openalex.org/W407295511,"Melanins are ubiquitous and biologically important pigments, yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate their synthesis and biochemical composition are not fully understood. Here we present a study that supports a role for serotonin in melanin synthesis in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. We characterize the tryptophan hydroxylase (tph) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, and demonstrate by RNA interference that tph is essential for melanin production in the pigment cups of the planarian photoreceptors. We exploit this phenotype to investigate the biological function of pigment cups using a quantitative light-avoidance behavioral assay. Planarians lacking eye pigment remain phototactic, indicating that eye pigmentation is not essential for light avoidance in S. mediterranea, though it improves the efficiency of the photophobic response. Finally, we show that the eye pigmentation defect observed in tph knockdown animals can be rescued by injection of either the product of TPH, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), or serotonin. Together, these results highlight a role for serotonin in melanogenesis, perhaps as a regulatory signal or as a pigment substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first example of this relationship to be reported outside of mammalian systems."
https://openalex.org/W412145560,"Background Th1 cells play an essential role in immune protection against tuberculosis. Th17 cells might be involved with immune pathology in active human tuberculosis (TB). The balance between Th1 and Th17 cells in patients with cavitary tuberculosis needs to be clarified which might help understanding the immunological basis of pathologic pathogenesis in TB. Method Initially treated pulmonary TB (PTB) patients with or without cavities were recruited before chemotherapy. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), PPD, or ESAT-6 antigens, and assayed supernatant IFN-γ and IL-17 by ELISA after 24 or 72 hours incubation, respectively. Cells were also stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-γ or IL-17 and the proportion of stained cells was measured by flow cytometry. Results We found wide variation of IFN-γ response in active PTB patients, but less subject-to-subject variation of IL-17 was observed as we previously reported. There were no significant differences in IFN-γ and IL-17 between cavitary and non-cavitary PTB; however, we found decreased IFN-γ secretion in severe cavitary PTB compared to mild lesion non-cavitary PTB (p < 0.05). We also found a decrease in the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in the blood of severe cavitary PTB patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions IL-17 seemed to have no association with the formation of cavities in active PTB from the study of PBMC. Impaired IFN-γ without IL-17 enhancement occurs in peripheral blood during severe cavitary PTB. Our results demonstrate that M. tuberculosis antigen-specific Th1 response is decreased when PTB lesions develop to severe cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2140790747,"Distant populations of animals may share their non-breeding grounds or migrate to distinct areas, and this may have important consequences for population differentiation and dynamics. Small burrow-nesting seabirds provide a suitable case study, as they are often restricted to safe breeding sites on islands, resulting in a patchy breeding distribution. For example, Thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri have two major breeding colonies more than 8,000 km apart, on the Falkland Islands in the south-western Atlantic and in the Kerguelen Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. We used geolocators and stable isotopes to compare at-sea movements and trophic levels of these two populations during their non-breeding season, and applied ecological niche models to compare environmental conditions in the habitat. Over three winters, birds breeding in the Atlantic showed a high consistency in their migration routes. Most individuals migrated more than 3000 km eastwards, while very few remained over the Patagonian Shelf. In contrast, all Indian Ocean birds migrated westwards, resulting in an overlapping nonbreeding area in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Geolocators and isotopic signature of feathers indicated that prions from the Falklands moulted at slightly higher latitudes than those from Kerguelen Islands. All birds fed on low trophic level prey, most probably crustaceans. The phenology differed notably between the two populations. Falkland birds returned to the Patagonian Shelf after 2-3 months, while Kerguelen birds remained in the nonbreeding area for seven months, before returning to nesting grounds highly synchronously and at high speed. Habitat models identified sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration as important environmental parameters. In summary, we show that even though the two very distant populations migrate to roughly the same area to moult, they have distinct wintering strategies: They had significantly different realized niches and timing which may contribute to spatial niche partitioning."

Resistance to rifampicin was detected using the GeneXpert system and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. MTBC isolates obtained with the BACTEC MGIT 960 system were tested for susceptibility to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Overall, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was found to be 9 cases. Of these, 67% (6 patients) of confirmed MDR-TB cases had no past history of TB treatment and 33% (3 patients) were previously treated cases. Extensively drug-resistant TB was not found. Molecular typing of the MDR-TB strains revealed recent transmission patterns of imported MDR strains.The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reliable for the detection of rifampicin resistant MTBC strains directly from sputum samples of patients undergoing first-line treatment for two months, being more trustworthy than the simple presence of acid-fast bacilli in the smear. Its implementation is technically simple, does not require specialized laboratory infrastructures and is suitable for resource-limited settings when a regular source of electricity and maintenance is available as well as financial and operation sustainability is guaranteed by the health authorities. A high prevalence of MDR-TB among patients at risk of MDR-TB after two months of first-line treatment was found, in support of the WHO recommendations for its use in the management of this risk group."
https://openalex.org/W1532706899,"Neuronal networks can generate complex patterns of activity that depend on membrane properties of individual neurons as well as on functional synapses. To decipher the impact of synaptic properties and connectivity on neuronal network behavior, we investigate the responses of neuronal ensembles from small (5–30 cells in a restricted sphere) and large (acute hippocampal slice) networks to single electrical stimulation: in both cases, a single stimulus generated a synchronous long-lasting bursting activity. While an initial spike triggered a reverberating network activity that lasted 2–5 seconds for small networks, we found here that it lasted only up to 300 milliseconds in slices. To explain this phenomena present at different scales, we generalize the depression-facilitation model and extracted the network time constants. The model predicts that the reverberation time has a bell shaped relation with the synaptic density, revealing that the bursting time cannot exceed a maximum value. Furthermore, before reaching its maximum, the reverberation time increases sub-linearly with the synaptic density of the network. We conclude that synaptic dynamics and connectivity shape the mean burst duration, a property present at various scales of the networks. Thus bursting reverberation is a property of sufficiently connected neural networks, and can be generated by collective depression and facilitation of underlying functional synapses."
https://openalex.org/W362944349,"Areca nut (AN) is a popular carcinogen used by about 0.6-1.2 billion people worldwide. Although AN contains apoptosis-inducing ingredients, we previously demonstrated that both AN extract (ANE) and its 30-100 kDa fraction (ANE 30-100K) predominantly induce autophagic cell death in both normal and malignant cells. In this study, we further explored the action mechanism of ANE 30-100K-induced autophagy (AIA) in Jurkat T lymphocytes and carcinoma cell lines including OECM-1 (mouth), CE81T/VGH (esophagus), SCC25 (tongue), and SCC-15 (tongue). The results showed that chemical- and small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) resulted in the attenuation of AIA in Jurkat T but not in OECM-1 cells. Knockdown of Atg5 and Beclin 1 expressions ameliorated AIA in OECM-1/CE81T/VGH/Jurkat T and OECM-1/SCC25/SCC-15, respectively. Furthermore, ANE 30-100K could activate caspase-3 after inhibition of Beclin 1 expression in OECM-1/SCC25/SCC15 cells. Meanwhile, AMPK was demonstrated to be the upstream activator of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) in Jurkat T cells, and inhibition of MEK attenuated AIA in Jurkat T/OECM-1/CE81T/VGH cells. Finally, we also found that multiple myeloma RPMI8226, lymphoma U937, and SCC15 cells survived from long-term non-cytotoxic ANE 30-100K treatment exhibited stronger resistance against serum deprivation through upregulated autophagy. Collectively, our studies indicate that Beclin-1 and Atg5 but not AMPK are commonly required for AIA, and MEK/ERK pathway is involved in AIA. Meanwhile, it is also suggested that long-term AN usage might increase the resistance of survived tumor cells against serum-limited conditions."
https://openalex.org/W365187474,"A new specimen of an enigmatic hupehsuchian genus is reported. The genus was first recognized by Robert L. Carroll and Zhi-ming Dong in 1991, who refrained from naming it because of the poor quality of the only specimen known at the time. After more than two decades, we finally report a second specimen of this genus, which remained unprepared until recently. The new specimen preserves most of the skeleton except the skull, allowing us to erect a new genus and species, Eretmorhipis carrolldongi. The new species shares many characters with Parahupehsuchus longus, including the strange axial skeleton that forms a bony body tube. However, the body tube is short in the new species, being limited to the pectoral region. The vertebral count and limb morphology considerably differ between the new species and P. longus. The forelimb of E. carrolldongi is markedly larger than its hind limb as in Hupehsuchus nanchangensis but unlike in P. longus. The new species is unique among hupehsuchians in a list of features. It has manual and pedal digits that spread radially, forming manus and pes that are almost as wide as long. The third-layer elements of the dermal armor are unusually large, spanning four vertebral segments, yet there are substantial gaps among them. With the addition of the unique paddle, it is now clear that Hupehsuchia had diverse forelimb morphologies spanning from paddles to flippers, unlike ichthyopterygians that were taxonomically more diverse yet only had flippers."
https://openalex.org/W1034920215,"GTPases perform a wide range of functions, ranging from protein synthesis to cell signaling. Of all known GTPases, only eight are conserved across all three domains of life. YchF is one of these eight universally conserved GTPases; however, its cellular function and enzymatic properties are poorly understood. YchF differs from the classical GTPases in that it has a higher affinity for ATP than for GTP and is a functional ATPase. As a hydrophobic amino acid-substituted ATPase, YchF does not possess the canonical catalytic Gln required for nucleotide hydrolysis. To elucidate the catalytic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by YchF, we have taken a two-pronged approach combining classical biochemical and in silico techniques. The use of molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to complement our biochemical findings with information about the structural dynamics of YchF. We have thereby identified the highly conserved His-114 as critical for the ATPase activity of YchF from Escherichia coli. His-114 is located in a flexible loop of the G-domain, which undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational changes. The use of a catalytic His is also observed in the hydrophobic amino acid-substituted GTPase RbgA and is an identifier of the translational GTPase family.

GTPases are essential to all living organisms; are present in all kingdoms of life; and perform critical cell functions, including protein synthesis, intracellular signaling, cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and differentiation (1Bourne H.R.

The mechanisms employed by these GTPases to catalyze GTP hydrolysis can differ significantly, but typically rely on a conserved catalytic residue found immediately downstream of the conserved G3 motif (DXXG), a sequence motif present in all GTPases that is responsible for magnesium/γ-phosphate coordination (1Bourne H.R.

In the model GTPase Ras, a conserved glutamine residue that aligns a catalytic water molecule for an in-line attack on the γ-phosphate of GTP is found in this position (5Sprang S.R.

This catalytic Gln is replaced with His in the translation factor superfamily (including EF-Tu, EF-G, and IF2), Thr in Rap, and Arg in Ffh (7Sprang S.R. G proteins, effectors and GAPs: structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the hydrophobic amino acid-substituted (HAS) class of GTPases, the catalytic Gln is substituted with a hydrophobic amino acid (e.g. Ile or Leu) (8Mishra R. Gara S.K. Mishra S. Prakash B.

Members of this class include HflX, EH, Era, EngA, EngB, MnmE, NogI, FeoB, Rsr1, Rb25, and YchF, as well as the circularly permuted GTPases YqeH and RbgA (YlqF) (8Mishra R. Gara S.K. Mishra S. Prakash B. Analysis of GTPases carrying hydrophobic amino acid substitutions in lieu of the catalytic glutamine: implications for GTP hydrolysis.Proteins. 2005; 59: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to understand the mechanistic details of how these proteins catalyze nucleotide hydrolysis, how the activity is regulated, and the consequences on cellular functions. Despite recent work focusing on the HAS-GTPase family, the catalytic mechanisms for most of the known HAS-GTPases remain poorly understood. Examining other members of this GTPase family will shed light on the catalytic strategies employed.TABLE 1Structural alignment of the G3 motif of nine HAS-GTPases and RasProteinPDB IDG3 motif (DXXG)YchFDIAGLFeoB3LX5DLPGLRbgA (YlqF)1PUJDTPGIMnmE2GJ8DTAGLEra3IEUDTPGIYqeH3H2YDTPGIHflX2QTHDTVGFEH2QPTDTPGIYsxC (EngB)1PUIDVPGYRas1WQ1DTAGQ Open table in a new tab Although categorized as a HAS-GTPase due to its conserved Leu immediately following the G3 motif, YchF also contains an altered specificity motif. In YchF, the canonical (N/T)KXD sequence (G4 motif), which normally provides specificity for guanine nucleotides, is changed to NXXE (9Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Chu S.Y. Toedt J. Eisenstein E.

Due to its initial characterization as a GTPase, only one x-ray crystallography structure of YchF bound to an adenine nucleotide is available, that of the human homolog OLA1 in complex with AMPPCP (10Koller-Eichhorn R. Marquardt T. Gail R. Wittinghofer A. Kostrewa D. Kutay U. Kambach C. Human OLA1 defines an ATPase subfamily in the Obg family of GTP-binding proteins.J. Biol.

Unfortunately, these x-ray crystallography structures do not provide structural information for critical regions of the protein, including both switch regions and a flexible loop located in the G-domain. Furthermore, mutational analyses have revealed that two residues, Asn-13 and Lys-78 (E. coli numbering), play important roles in the potassium dependence of ATP hydrolysis, but amino acid residues essential for ATP hydrolysis have yet to be identified (12Tomar S.K. Kumar P. Prakash B. Deciphering the catalytic machinery in a universally conserved ribosome binding ATPase YchF.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 408: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the current structural and biochemical information on YchF is insufficient to devise a reliable mechanism for ATP hydrolysis by YchF. All chemicals were obtained from VWR International, Sigma-Aldrich, or Invitrogen unless indicated otherwise. DH5α cells were purchased from New England Biolabs, and BL21(DE3) competent cells were purchased from Novagen. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Fermentas, radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and nucleotides and fluorescent nucleotide analogs were purchased from Invitrogen. All buffers were filtered through Whatman 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. All YchF protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt and Entrez Gene databases. Multiple-sequence alignments (data not shown) were performed using ClustalW2 provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into pET28a containing the full-length E. coli sequence coding for N-terminal His6-tagged YchF (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange method. Ala, Lys, Arg, or Phe was introduced at position 114 to substitute for the native His. Forward primers (H114A, 5′-GACAACATCATTGCCGTTTCGGGCAA-3′; H114K, 5′-GACAACATCATTAAAGTTTCCGGAAAAGTTAACCCGGC-3′; H114F, 5′-GACAACATCATTTTCGTTTCCGGAAAAGTTAACCCGGC-3′; H114R, 5′-GACAACATCATTCGCGTTTCCGGAAAAGTTAACCCGGC-3′; H102Q, 5′-CCGTGAAACCGAAGCGATTGGTCAGGTTGTTCGCTGC-3′; and L76Q, 5′-GATATTGCCGGCCAGGTAAAAGGC-3′, where mutations are indicated in boldface, restriction sites are in italics, and newly introduced restriction sites are underlined) and reverse primers (reverse complements of forward primers) were obtained from Invitrogen. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing (GENEWIZ). The resulting plasmids were each transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for YchF overexpression. Overexpression and protein purifications were carried out as described previously (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer with a cuvette of 1-mm path length. WT YchF and variants were dialyzed overnight in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to reduce the sodium ion concentration to <15 mm. The dialyzed samples were diluted with phosphate buffer to a final concentration of 1.5 μm YchF and then equilibrated to 20 °C before measuring. All samples were subjected to 10 successive scans (320 to 190 nm) with a digital integration time of 1 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. The obtained spectra were averaged and corrected for the phosphate buffer spectrum. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada) with a 3 × 3 mm quartz cuvette (Starna Cells, Inc., Atascadero, CA). YchF from E. coli (E. coli YchF) contains a single Trp residue located in its C-terminal domain whose fluorescence decreases upon nucleotide binding (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). YchF (1 μm) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, and 7 mm MgCl2) was titrated with the respective adenine nucleotides and excited at 280 nm with a slit width of 1 nm. Fluorescence emission was monitored from 295 to 400 nm at a 1-nm step size with an emission slit width of 5 nm. Following the addition of nucleotide, the solution was equilibrated for 1 min prior to excitation. Equilibration was not performed when ATP was added due to the intrinsic ATPase activity of YchF. The fluorescence of Buffer A with nucleotides was subtracted from all nucleotide-binding experiments, and fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was determined by plotting the change in fluorescence at 337 nm as a function of the nucleotide concentration. Each data set was fit with a hyperbolic function (Equation 1) using TableCurve software (Jandel Scientific Software) and Prism (GraphPad Software). F=F0+(ΔFmax×[nt])/(KD+[nt])(Eq. 1) Here, F represents the fluorescence at 337 nm, [nt] is the nucleotide concentration, F0 is the initial fluorescence, and ΔFmax is the amplitude of the signal change. Final KD values and their S.D. values were calculated from at least three independent experiments. The multiple-turnover ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) activities of WT YchF and YchF variants were measured at 20 °C in Buffer A (unless indicated otherwise) by following the liberation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP (200 dpm/pmol). To convert any ADP present, the ATP-containing solutions were charged by incubation with 0.25 μg/μl pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate for 15 min at room temperature and then for 15 min at 37 °C. The intrinsic ATPase activities of WT YchF and variants were determined as described (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using reactions containing 5 μm YchF and 125 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Thin-layer chromatography was used to separate 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP, followed by visualization using a Typhoon Trio scanner (GE Healthcare). The relative amount of 32Pi formed was determined using ImageJ (29Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (35237) Google Scholar). Ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity was determined under these conditions in the presence of 6 μm ribosomes (70S) purified from E. coli MRE600 cells (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pH-dependent ATPase assays were performed similarly to the intrinsic ATPase assays with Buffer A used at pH 7–9. Experiments at pH <7 were performed in MES-containing buffer. Results were corrected for the background hydrolysis of ATP at 20 °C, and ATPase assays were performed at least in triplicate to determine S.D. values. Michaelis-Menten analyses of the ribosome-dependent ATPase activities of YchF(H114A) and YchF(H114R) were performed similarly to the method described previously (11Becker M. Gzyl K.E. Altamirano A.M. Vuong A. Urban K. Wieden H.J. The 70S ribosome modulates the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli YchF.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 1288-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at 37 °C using purified 70S ribosomes and the respective YchF variant (1 μm). All rapid kinetics measurements were performed using a KinTek SF-2004 stopped-flow apparatus at 20 °C. N-ethylanthraniloyl (mant)-nucleotides were excited via FRET from the single Trp (λex = 280 nm) present in E. coli YchF and measured after passing through LG-400-F cutoff filters (Newport Corp., Irvine, CA). For dissociation experiments, 20 μm mant-nucleotide and 2 μm YchF were preincubated in Buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C. Pyruvate kinase (0.25 μg/μl final concentration) and phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mm final concentration) were added to the mixture when mant-ATP was used. To observe dissociation, 25 μl of YchF·mant-ATP/mant-ADP (1 μm after mixing) was rapidly mixed with 25 μl of ATP/ADP (100 μm after mixing). Due to the excess of unlabeled nucleotide present, only the dissociation of the mant-labeled nucleotide contributed to the observed fluorescence change, and rebinding of mant-nucleotide was negligible. Each time course was fit with a one- or two-exponential function (Equations 2 and 3, respectively), F=F∞+A×exp(−kapp×t)(Eq. 2) F=F∞+A1×exp(−kapp1×t)+A2×exp(−kapp2×t)(Eq. 3) where F is the mant fluorescence at time t, F∞ is the final fluorescence, and A is the respective amplitude of the observed fluorescence change. The characteristic apparent rate constants (kapp, kapp1, and kapp2) correspond to the respective nucleotide dissociation constants (koff, koff1, and koff2). Calculations were performed using TableCurve and Prism. For association experiments, 25 μl of 2 μm YchF in Buffer A was rapidly mixed with 25 μl of increasing concentrations of mant-nucleotide (1–10 μm mant-ADP or 4–40 μm mant-ATP). Similar to the nucleotide dissociation experiments, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase were added to solutions containing mant-ATP, and the mixtures were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Each time course was fitted to a function containing one (mant-ADP, Equation 2), two (mant-ATP, Equation 3), or three (mant-ATP, Equation 4) exponentials. F=F∞+A1×exp(−kapp1×t)+A2×exp(−kapp2×t)+A3×exp(−kapp3×t)(Eq. 4) The corresponding apparent rate constants for association were kapp1, kapp2, and kapp3. The bimolecular association rate constant (k1) was determined from the slope of the linear concentration dependence of kapp1. The initial model for E. coli YchF was obtained by constructing a homology model using the SWISS-MODEL server (30Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace: a web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6033) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae YchF as a template (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1JAL) (31Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL: an automated protein homology-modeling server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar). The conformation of Switch I (residues 28–41, which are missing in the 1JAL structure) was modeled based on the structure of Switch I in Thermus thermophilus YchF bound to GDP (PDB ID 2DBY). To model the adenine nucleotide bound to E. coli YchF, we used the conformation of AMPPCP bound to the human homolog of YchF, OLA1 (PDB ID 2OHF). Transformation of the AMPPCP to ATP and ADP was done manually. To position the magnesium ion associated with the bound nucleotide, we aligned the nucleotide with crystal structures of EF-Tu bound to either GDP or GMPPNP (PDB ID 1EFC and 1EFT, respectively). Hydrogen atoms were added to all models using psfgen in the NAMD software package, and His side chains were protonated at the ϵ-nitrogen only (32Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13176) Google Scholar). Initial models were minimized and then placed in a water box extending at least 10 Å from the protein in all directions. Water molecules present in the template crystal structures were included in this box, and all other waters were added at random using the Solvate package in NAMD (32Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13176) Google Scholar). Relaxation of the solvated system was achieved by minimizing the positions of water molecules, followed by minimization of the protein/ligand atoms in two iterative rounds (10,000 steps each). Sodium ions were then added in random positions by the Autoionize package in VMD to neutralize the total charge of the system, followed by a final minimization of all components of the system. YchF·ATP·Mg2+ and YchF·ADP·Mg2+ had total charges of −17 and −16; therefore, 17 and 16 sodium ions were added, respectively. The system was considered to be minimized when no change in energy was observed for at least 1000 steps (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). Minimizations, subsequent equilibrations, and equilibrium MD simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions using the NAMD software package (32Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13176) Google Scholar). Minimized models were initially equilibrated at 300 and 350 K for 150 ps at constant pressure (1 atm). Production-phase simulations were started using velocities from the 300 K equilibration and coordinates from the 350 K equilibration. Simulations were performed over 50 ns at 300 K with a step size of 0.5 fs using the CHARMM22 parameters for proteins and CHARMM27 parameters for nucleic acids as implemented in the NAMD package (32Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput.

MD simulations were performed in an NPT ensemble in which the pressure was maintained at 1 atm with a Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston, and the temperature was controlled using Langevin dynamics. All simulations were performed in the NAMD software package, and visualization was carried out in VMD (32Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L.

VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). Snapshots of each MD simulation were saved every 0.5 ps, and trajectories were fitted with the software Carma to remove any rotations of the protein complex or translation of the center of mass (35Glykos N.M.

https://openalex.org/W1923262067,"The Strandveld mediterranean-ecosystem of the west coast of South Africa supports floristically diverse vegetation growing on mostly nutrient-poor aeolian sands and extending from the Atlantic Ocean tens of kilometers inland. The cold Benguela current upwelling interacts with warm onshore southerly winds in summer causing coastal fogs in this region. We hypothesized that fog and other forms of occult precipitation contribute moisture and nutrients to the vegetation. We measured occult precipitation over one year along a transect running inland in the direction of the prevailing wind and compared the nutrient concentrations with those in rainwater. Occult deposition rates of P, N, K, Mg, Ca, Na, Al and Fe all decreased with distance from the ocean. Furthermore, ratios of cations to Na were similar to those of seawater, suggesting a marine origin for these. In contrast, N and P ratios in occult precipitation were higher than in seawater. We speculate that this is due to marine foam contributing to occult precipitation. Nutrient loss in leaf litter from dominant shrub species was measured to indicate nutrient demand. We estimated that occult precipitation could meet the demand of the dominant shrubby species for annual N, P, K and Ca. Of these species, those with small leaves intercepted more moisture and nutrients than those with larger leaves and could take up foliar deposits of glycine, NO3(-), NH4(+) and Li (as tracer for K) through leaf surfaces. We conclude that occult deposition together with rainfall deposition are potentially important nutrient and moisture sources for the Strandveld vegetation that contribute to this vegetation being floristically distinct from neighbouring nutrient-poor Fynbos vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2137999877,"Ebola is an emerging infectious disease caused by a deadly virus belonging to the family Filoviridae, genus Ebolavirus. Based on their geographical distribution, Ebolavirus has been classified into total five species so far, mainly Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston. It is important to be able to differentiate the Ebolavirus species as they significantly differ in pathogenicity and more than one species can be present in an area. We have developed a one-step step-down RT-PCR detecting all five Ebolavirus species with high sensitivity (1 copy of Ebolavirus DNA, 10 copies of RNA and 320 copies of RNA spiked in 1 ml whole blood). The primers and FRET-probes we designed enabled us to differentiate five Ebolavirus species by distinct Tm (Zaire: flat peaks between 53.0°C and 56.9°C; Sudan: 51.6°C; Reston: flat peaks between 47.5°C and 54.9°C; Tai Forest: 52.8°C; Bundibugyo: dual peaks at 48.9°C and 53.5°C), and by different amplicon sizes (Zaire 255 bp, Sudan 211 bp, Reston 192 bp, Taï Forest 166 bp, Bundibugyo 146 bp). This one-size-fit-all assay enables the rapid detection and discrimination of the five Ebolavirus species in a single reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1558725216,"Variations in tobacco-related cancers, incidence and prevalence reflect differences in tobacco consumption in addition to genetic factors. Besides, genes related to lung cancer risk could be related to smoking behavior. Polymorphisms altering DNA repair capacity may lead to synergistic effects with tobacco carcinogen-induced lung cancer risk. Common problems in genetic association studies, such as presence of gene-by-environment (G x E) correlation in the population, may reduce the validity of these designs. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the independence assumption for selected SNPs and smoking behaviour in a cohort of 320 healthy Spanish smokers. We found an association between the wild type alleles of XRCC3 Thr241Met or KLC3 Lys751Gln and greater smoking intensity (OR = 12.98, 95% CI = 2.86-58.82 and OR=16.90, 95% CI=2.09-142.8; respectively). Although preliminary, the results of our study provide evidence that genetic variations in DNA-repair genes may influence both smoking habits and the development of lung cancer. Population-specific G x E studies should be carried out when genetic and environmental factors interact to cause the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1505148497,"Septic shock, the most severe complication associated with sepsis, is manifested by tissue hypoperfusion due, in part, to cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction. In many cases, the splanchnic circulation becomes vasoplegic. The celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CSMG) sympathetic neurons provide the main autonomic input to these vessels. We used the cecal ligation puncture (CLP) model, which closely mimics the hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances observed in septic patients, to examine the properties and modulation of Ca2+ channels by G protein-coupled receptors in acutely dissociated rat CSMG neurons. Voltage-clamp studies 48 hr post-sepsis revealed that the Ca2+ current density in CMSG neurons from septic rats was significantly lower than those isolated from sham control rats. This reduction coincided with a significant increase in membrane surface area and a negligible increase in Ca2+ current amplitude. Possible explanations for these findings include either cell swelling or neurite outgrowth enhancement of CSMG neurons from septic rats. Additionally, a significant rightward shift of the concentration-response relationship for the norepinephrine (NE)-mediated Ca2+ current inhibition was observed in CSMG neurons from septic rats. Testing for the presence of opioid receptor subtypes in CSMG neurons, showed that mu opioid receptors were present in ~70% of CSMG, while NOP opioid receptors were found in all CSMG neurons tested. The pharmacological profile for both opioid receptor subtypes was not significantly affected by sepsis. Further, the Ca2+ current modulation by propionate, an agonist for the free fatty acid receptors GPR41 and GPR43, was not altered by sepsis. Overall, our findings suggest that CSMG function is affected by sepsis via changes in cell size and α2-adrenergic receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1910968471,"The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) has been shown to alter endosomal sorting, diverting cargo destined for the recycling pathway into the lysosomal pathway. Here we investigated whether GA also affects the sorting of cargo into the retrograde pathway from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. As a model cargo we used the bacterial toxin Shiga toxin, which exploits the retrograde pathway as an entry route to the cytosol. Indeed, GA treatment of HEp-2 cells strongly increased the Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus. The enhanced Golgi transport was not due to increased endocytic uptake of the toxin or perturbed recycling, suggesting that GA selectively enhances endosomal sorting into the retrograde pathway. Moreover, GA activated p38 and both inhibitors of p38 or its substrate MK2 partially counteracted the GA-induced increase in Shiga toxin transport. Thus, our data suggest that GA-induced p38 and MK2 activation participate in the increased Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W403197924,"The debate on the causal association between vitamin D status, measured as serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and various health outcomes warrants investigation in large-scale health surveys. Measuring the 25(OH)D concentration for each participant is not always feasible, because of the logistics of blood collection and the costs of vitamin D testing. To address this problem, past research has used predicted 25(OH)D concentration, based on multivariable linear regression, as a proxy for unmeasured vitamin D status. We restate this approach in a mathematical framework, to deduce its possible pitfalls. Monte Carlo simulation and real data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–06 are used to confirm the deductions. The results indicate that variables that are used in the prediction model (for 25[OH]D concentration) but not in the model for the health outcome (called instrumental variables), play an essential role in the identification of an effect. Such variables should be unrelated to the health outcome other than through vitamin D; otherwise the estimate of interest will be biased. The approach of predicted 25(OH)D concentration derived from multivariable linear regression may be valid. However, careful verification that the instrumental variables are unrelated to the health outcome is required."
