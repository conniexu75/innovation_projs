https://openalex.org/W2153180469,"The pathway causing CD4 T-cell death in HIV-infected hosts remains poorly understood although apoptosis has been proposed as a key mechanism. We now show that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis accounts for the death of only a small fraction of CD4 T cells corresponding to those that are both activated and productively infected. The remaining over 95% of quiescent lymphoid CD4 T cells die by caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis triggered by abortive viral infection. Pyroptosis corresponds to an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death in which cytoplasmic contents and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, are released. This death pathway thus links the two signature events in HIV infection-CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation-and creates a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells release inflammatory signals that attract more cells to die. This cycle can be broken by caspase 1 inhibitors shown to be safe in humans, raising the possibility of a new class of 'anti-AIDS' therapeutics targeting the host rather than the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2153412875,"The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics fails to explain dark matter and why matter survived annihilation with antimatter following the Big Bang. Extensions to the SM, such as weak-scale Supersymmetry, may explain one or both of these phenomena by positing the existence of new particles and interactions that are asymmetric under time-reversal (T). These theories nearly always predict a small, yet potentially measurable ($10^{-27}$-$10^{-30}$ $e$ cm) electron electric dipole moment (EDM, $d_e$), which is an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin ($\vec{S}$). The EDM is also asymmetric under T. Using the polar molecule thorium monoxide (ThO), we measure $d_e = (-2.1 \pm 3.7_\mathrm{stat} \pm 2.5_\mathrm{syst})\times 10^{-29}$ $e$ cm. This corresponds to an upper limit of $|d_e| < 8.7\times 10^{-29}$ $e$ cm with 90 percent confidence, an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the previous best limits. Our result constrains T-violating physics at the TeV energy scale."

https://openalex.org/W2132186171,"The understanding of the origin of superconductivity in cuprates has been hindered by the apparent diversity of intertwining electronic orders in these materials. We combined resonant x-ray scattering (REXS), scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to observe a charge order that appears consistently in surface and bulk, and in momentum and real space within one cuprate family, Bi2201. The observed wave vectors rule out simple antinodal nesting in the single-particle limit but match well with a phenomenological model of a many-body instability of the Fermi arcs. Combined with earlier observations of electronic order in other cuprate families, these findings suggest the existence of a generic charge-ordered state in underdoped cuprates and uncover its intimate connection to the pseudogap regime."
https://openalex.org/W2095316269,"Besides superconductivity, copper-oxide high temperature superconductors are susceptible to other types of ordering. We use scanning tunneling microscopy and resonant elastic x-ray scattering measurements to establish the formation of charge ordering in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Depending on the hole concentration, the charge ordering in this system occurs with the same period as those found in Y-based or La-based cuprates, and displays the analogous competition with superconductivity. These results indicate the similarity of charge organization competing with superconductivity across different families of cuprates. We observe this charge ordering to leave a distinct electron-hole asymmetric signature (and a broad resonance centered at +20 meV) in spectroscopic measurements, thereby indicating that it is likely related to the organization of holes in a doped Mott insulator."
https://openalex.org/W2079716935,"The progressive depletion of quiescent “bystander” CD4 T cells, which are nonpermissive to HIV infection, is a principal driver of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These cells undergo abortive infection characterized by the cytosolic accumulation of incomplete HIV reverse transcripts. These viral DNAs are sensed by an unidentified host sensor that triggers an innate immune response, leading to caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Using unbiased proteomic and targeted biochemical approaches, as well as two independent methods of lentiviral short hairpin RNA–mediated gene knockdown in primary CD4 T cells, we identify interferon-γ–inducible protein 16 (IFI16) as a host DNA sensor required for CD4 T cell death due to abortive HIV infection. These findings provide insights into a key host pathway that plays a central role in CD4 T cell depletion during disease progression to AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2017389387,"Most fungi and bacteria degrade plant cell walls by secreting free, complementary enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose; however, some bacteria use large enzymatic assemblies called cellulosomes, which recruit complementary enzymes to protein scaffolds. The thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii uses an intermediate strategy, secreting many free cellulases that contain multiple catalytic domains. One of these, CelA, comprises a glycoside hydrolase family 9 and a family 48 catalytic domain, as well as three type III cellulose-binding modules. In the saccharification of a common cellulose standard, Avicel, CelA outperforms mixtures of commercially relevant exo- and endoglucanases. From transmission electron microscopy studies of cellulose after incubation with CelA, we report morphological features that suggest that CelA not only exploits the common surface ablation mechanism driven by general cellulase processivity, but also excavates extensive cavities into the surface of the substrate. These results suggest that nature's repertoire of cellulose digestion paradigms remain only partially discovered and understood."

This quantity, called the Berry's phase, is associated with the topological properties of the parameter space and has been observed in materials such as graphene and bismuth. Murakawa et al. (p. 1490 ) observe a Berry's phase equal to π in the material BiTeI in which the phenomenon is predicted to be a consequence of a very strong coupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom realized through the so-called Rashba effect."

https://openalex.org/W1969281046,"Dogs offer unique opportunities to study correlations between morphology and behavior because skull shapes and body shape are so diverse among breeds. Several studies have shown relationships between canine cephalic index (CI: the ratio of skull width to skull length) and neural architecture. Data on the CI of adult, show-quality dogs (six males and six females) were sourced in Australia along with existing data on the breeds' height, bodyweight and related to data on 36 behavioral traits of companion dogs (n = 8,301) of various common breeds (n = 49) collected internationally using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Stepwise backward elimination regressions revealed that, across the breeds, 33 behavioral traits all but one of which are undesirable in companion animals correlated with either height alone (n = 14), bodyweight alone (n = 5), CI alone (n = 3), bodyweight-and-skull shape combined (n = 2), height-and-skull shape combined (n = 3) or height-and-bodyweight combined (n = 6). For example, breed average height showed strongly significant inverse relationships (p<0.001) with mounting persons or objects, touch sensitivity, urination when left alone, dog-directed fear, separation-related problems, non-social fear, defecation when left alone, owner-directed aggression, begging for food, urine marking and attachment/attention-seeking, while bodyweight showed strongly significant inverse relationships (p<0.001) with excitability and being reported as hyperactive. Apart from trainability, all regression coefficients with height were negative indicating that, across the breeds, behavior becomes more problematic as height decreases. Allogrooming increased strongly (p<0.001) with CI and inversely with height. CI alone showed a strong significant positive relationship with self-grooming (p<0.001) but a negative relationship with chasing (p = 0.020). The current study demonstrates how aspects of CI (and therefore brain shape), bodyweight and height co-vary with behavior. The biological basis for, and significance of, these associations remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2017524553,"Interactions between the germ line and the soma help optimize reproductive success. We discovered a phenomenon linking reproductive status to longevity: In both hermaphroditic and gonochoristic Caenorhabditis, mating leads to female shrinking and death, compressing postreproductive life span. Male sperm induces germline- and DAF-9/DAF-12-dependent shrinking, osmotic stress susceptibility, and subsequent life-span decrease, whereas seminal fluid induces DAF-16-dependent life-span decrease and fat loss. Our study provides insight into the communication between males and the female germ line and soma to regulate reproduction and longevity, revealing a high-reproduction, low-life-span state induced by mating. Postmating somatic collapse may be an example of the sexually antagonistic influence that males in many species exert on female behavior to maximize their own reproductive success."

https://openalex.org/W1976424119,"Access via Vibration Molecular beam studies over the past decade have elucidated many subtle quantum mechanical factors governing the influence of vibrational excitation on the outcome of elementary chemical reactions. However, these studies have generally had to focus on reagents that can be easily made to vibrate by direct absorption in the infrared (IR). Wang et al. (p. 1499 ) show that a variation on stimulated Raman pumping can efficiently excite the IR-inactive stretch vibration in the diatomic molecule, hydrogen deuteride (HD). As a result, they can probe the influence of that vibration on the outcome of the HD + F reaction. Through a combined spectroscopic and theoretical investigation, they uncover Feshbach resonances along the reaction coordinate that are only accessible through vibrational preexcitation."
https://openalex.org/W2036709151,"Cellular mitochondrial content is governed by the competing processes of organelle biogenesis and degradation. It is proposed that these programs are tightly regulated to ensure that the cell maintains sufficient organelles to meet its biosynthetic, energetic, and other homeostatic requirements. We recently reported that GCN5L1, a putative nutrient-sensing regulator, controls mitochondrial removal by autophagy. Here we show that genetic deletion of GCN5L1 has a direct positive effect on the expression and activity of Transcriptional Factor EB (TFEB), which acts as a master regulator of autophagy. Surprisingly, the induction of TFEB-mediated autophagy pathways does not diminish cellular mitochondrial content, as its activity is countered by induction of the mitochondrial biogenesis transcriptional co-activator PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Concurrent induction of the TFEB and PGC-1α pathways results in an increased mitochondrial turnover rate in GCN5L1(-/-) cells. Finally, we show that genetic knockdown of either TFEB or PGC-1α leads to a corresponding decrease in the expression of the other gene, indicating that these proteins act coordinately, and in opposition, to maintain cellular mitochondrial content in response to the modulation of nutrient-sensing signatures."

Yu et al. (p. 1518 ) found that in mice, the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex CRL4 is essential for oocyte survival within primordial follicles and for development after fertilization. CRL4 binds to and activates an adaptor protein that mediates ubiquitination, but if any component is deleted, the genes required for oocyte maintenance and early embryo development are silenced and the female mice become infertile."
https://openalex.org/W2159781436,"The global distribution of cooperatively breeding birds is highly uneven, with hotspots in Australasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The ecological drivers of this distribution remain enigmatic yet could yield insights into the evolution and persistence of cooperative breeding. We report that the global distributions of avian obligate brood parasites and cooperatively breeding passerines are tightly correlated and that the uneven phylogenetic distribution of cooperative breeding is associated with the uneven targeting of hosts by brood parasites. With a long-term field study, we show that brood parasites can acquire superior care for their young by targeting cooperative breeders. Conversely, host defenses against brood parasites are strengthened by helpers at the nest. Reciprocally selected interactions between brood parasites and cooperative breeders may therefore explain the close association between these two breeding systems."
https://openalex.org/W2117515483,"Most hereditary periodic fever syndromes are mediated by deregulated IL-1β secretion. The generation of mature IL-1β requires two signals: one that induces synthesis of inflammasome components and substrates and a second that activates inflammasomes. The mechanisms that mediate autoinflammation in mevalonate kinase deficiency, a periodic fever disease characterized by a block in isoprenoid biosynthesis, are poorly understood. In studying the effects of isoprenoid shortage on IL-1 β generation, we identified a new inflammasome activation signal that originates from defects in autophagy. We find that hypersecretion of IL-1β and IL-18 requires reactive oxygen species and is associated with an oxidized redox status of monocytes but not lymphocytes. IL-1β hypersecretion by monocytes involves decreased mitochondrial stability, release of mitochondrial content into the cytosol and attenuated autophagosomal degradation. Defective autophagy, as established by ATG7 knockdown, results in prolonged cytosolic retention of damaged mitochondria and increased IL-1β secretion. Finally, activation of autophagy in healthy but not mevalonate kinase deficiency patient cells reduces IL-1β secretion. Together, these results indicate that defective autophagy can prime monocytes for mitochondria-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby contributing to hypersecretion of IL-1β in mevalonate kinase deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2033638267,"Finding a suitable cell source for endothelial cells (ECs) for cardiovascular regeneration is a challenging issue for regenerative medicine. In this paper, we describe a novel mechanism regulating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiation into ECs, with a particular focus on miRNAs and their targets. We first established a protocol using collagen IV and VEGF to drive the functional differentiation of iPSCs into ECs and compared the miRNA signature of differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Among the miRNAs overrepresented in differentiated cells, we focused on microRNA-21 (miR-21) and studied its role in iPSC differentiation. Overexpression of miR-21 in predifferentiated iPSCs induced EC marker up-regulation and in vitro and in vivo capillary formation; accordingly, inhibition of miR-21 produced the opposite effects. Importantly, miR-21 overexpression increased TGF-β2 mRNA and secreted protein level, consistent with the strong up-regulation of TGF-β2 during iPSC differentiation. Indeed, treatment of iPSCs with TGFβ-2 induced EC marker expression and in vitro tube formation. Inhibition of SMAD3, a downstream effector of TGFβ-2, strongly decreased VE-cadherin expression. Furthermore, TGFβ-2 neutralization and knockdown inhibited miR-21-induced EC marker expression. Finally, we confirmed the PTEN/Akt pathway as a direct target of miR-21, and we showed that PTEN knockdown is required for miR-21-mediated endothelial differentiation. In conclusion, we elucidated a novel signaling pathway that promotes the differentiation of iPSC into functional ECs suitable for regenerative medicine applications."
https://openalex.org/W1983824186,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDKs 1-4) negatively regulate activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by reversible phosphorylation. PDK isoforms are up-regulated in obesity, diabetes, heart failure, and cancer and are potential therapeutic targets for these important human diseases. Here, we employed a structure-guided design to convert a known Hsp90 inhibitor to a series of highly specific PDK inhibitors, based on structural conservation in the ATP-binding pocket. The key step involved the substitution of a carbonyl group in the parent compound with a sulfonyl in the PDK inhibitors. The final compound of this series, 2-[(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl]isoindoline-4,6-diol, designated PS10, inhibits all four PDK isoforms with IC50 = 0.8 μM for PDK2. The administration of PS10 (70 mg/kg) to diet-induced obese mice significantly augments pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity with reduced phosphorylation in different tissues. Prolonged PS10 treatments result in improved glucose tolerance and notably lessened hepatic steatosis in the mouse model. The results support the pharmacological approach of targeting PDK to control both glucose and fat levels in obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2152451121,"Background Apart from triggering host immune responses, macrophages also act as a major reservoir for mycobacteria. For better survival, mycobacteria have evolved various mechanisms to modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, and manipulation of micro-RNA (miRNA) expression has been considered as an important one. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we found that miR-146a expression was significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mycobacteria-infected macrophages. It could obviously reduce the induction of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and chemokine MCP-1 by targeting interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6), two key elements involved in the TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway cascades. Consistent with the anti-inflammation effect, a higher bacterial burden was seen in miR-146a mimics-treated macrophages. Conclusion/Significance Here, we demonstrated that mycobacteria-induced miR-146a could modulate inflammatory response by targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6 and facilitate mycobacteria replication in macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2018994427,"We explore the large spatial variation in the relationship between population density and burned area, using continental-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based on 13 years of satellite-derived burned area maps from the global fire emissions database (GFED) and the human population density from the gridded population of the world (GPW 2005). Significant relationships are observed over 51.5% of the global land area, and the area affected varies from continent to continent: population density has a significant impact on fire over most of Asia and Africa but is important in explaining fire over < 22% of Europe and Australia. Increasing population density is associated with both increased and decreased in fire. The nature of the relationship depends on land-use: increasing population density is associated with increased burned are in rangelands but with decreased burned area in croplands. Overall, the relationship between population density and burned area is non-monotonic: burned area initially increases with population density and then decreases when population density exceeds a threshold. These thresholds vary regionally. Our study contributes to improved understanding of how human activities relate to burned area, and should contribute to a better estimate of atmospheric emissions from biomass burning."

Down-regulation of E6 and E7 expression may be responsible for the positive clinical outcomes observed with IFN treatment, but the molecular basis has not been well determined. As miRNAs play an important role in HPV induced cervical carcinogenesis, we hypothesize that IFN-β can regulate the expressions of specific miRNAs in cervical cancer cells, and that these miRNAs can mediate E6 and E7 expression, thus modulate their oncogenic potential. In this study, we found that miR-129-5p to be a candidate IFN-β inducible miRNA. MiR-129-5p levels gradually decrease with the development of cervical intraepithelial lesions. Manipulation of miR-129-5p expression in Hela cells modulates HPV-18 E6 and E7 viral gene expression. Exogenous miR-129-5p inhibits cell proliferation in Hela cells, promotes apoptosis and blocks cell cycle progression in Hela cells. SP1 is a direct target of miR-129-5p in Hela cells.

Thus, p21 expression needs to be tightly controlled. In this study, we found that Rbm24, an RNA-binding protein and a target gene of the p53 protein, can regulate p21 expression via mRNA stability. Specifically, we showed that Rbm24 is induced by DNA damage and Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. We also found that p53 protein binds to and activates the promoter of the Rbm24 gene. Moreover, we found that overexpression of Rbm24 increases, whereas knockdown of Rbm24 decreases, p21 mRNA and protein expression. In addition, we demonstrated that overexpression of Rbm24 enhances the half-life of p21 transcript. Consistent with this, we provided evidence that Rbm24 binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of p21 transcript and an AU/U-rich element in the p21 3'-UTR is necessary for Rbm24 to increase p21 expression. Finally, we showed that the RNA recognition motif in Rbm24 is required for binding to p21 transcript and subsequently for inducing p21 expression. Altogether, we uncovered that Rbm24 is a novel player in the p53 pathway, which may be explored to restore proper cell cycle control in p53-deficient tumors via p21."

The catalytic α-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase αβγ complex occurs in four isoforms (α1–α4) that are non-uniformly expressed in a tissue- and development-dependent manner (1Shull G.E. Greeb J.

AHC generally has earlier onset than RDP and is characterized by transient episodes of hemiplegia often shifting from one side of the body to the other. Although AHC and RDP present as distinct entities, there are clearly overlapping clinical features such as dystonia with a bulbar preference. AHC and RDP may be part of a phenotypical continuum of one disease, with AHC at the severe end of the spectrum and RDP at the mild end (5Rosewich H. Thiele H. Ohlenbusch A. Maschke U. Altmüller J.

Mutation of the α2-isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase expressed in glial cells of the CNS causes familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2), a severe subtype of migraine with aura and temporary hemiparesis (7De Fusco M.

The clinical spectrum caused by mutations in α2 and α3 isoforms includes other paroxysmal manifestations such as episodes of abnormal ocular movements and various types of seizures as well as neurodevelopmental delay and in some families the phenotypes overlap (5Rosewich H.

Little is known about the actual neuropathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the development of these disorders. For FHM2 it has been suggested that an impaired clearance of extracellular K+ produces a wide cortical depolarization (10Somjen G.G.

Although changes to [Na+]i and/or [K+]i might be expected for complete-loss-of-function mutants, it is not clear whether and to what extent such changes in ionic concentrations would occur for mutants with residual function and whether a change of Na+ affinity influences the ionic concentrations to the same extent as a change in the maximal pumping rate. rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 alternating hemiplegia of childhood ligand concentration giving half-maximal effect. The crystal structures of the Na+,K+-ATPase have revealed a strategic location of the C terminus, docking in between transmembrane helices both in the K+-bound E2 form (15Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P.

It is, therefore, intriguing that two neurological disease mutations of the Na+,K+-ATPase have been reported in which the C terminus is extended, in one case by a single tyrosine residue (“+Y” mutation) in a patient with RDP (13Blanco-Arias P.

Here we have functionally characterized and compared these and other neurological disease mutants as well as a mutant where the C terminus only is extended by the smaller alanine. At the cellular level we have addressed the question to what extent these mutations cause a change of [Na+]i and [K+]i. By taking advantage of the different properties of a series of mutant Na+,K+ pumps, we have been able to analyze the contributions of change of Na+ affinity, maximal catalytic turnover rate, and expression level to observed changes of [Na+]i and [K+]i.

The presence of the correct mutation was confirmed also by sequencing genomic DNA from the isolated stable cell lines. Because of the lack of activity of mutant α2+28, which precluded isolation of a stable cell line, this mutant as well as the corresponding α2 wild type was expressed transiently in the presence of siRNA to knock down the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase of the cells as previously described (24Beuschlein F.

Ouabain was included in the media used for ATPase and phosphorylation measurements to eliminate the contribution of the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase as detailed in the figure legends. Expression of α2 wild type and mutant was detected by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE using rabbit polyclonal α2 isoform-specific antibody (07–674 Millipore/Upstate, 1:2000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. To determine the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ in intact cells expressing mutants or wild type, uptake of the K+ congener 86Rb+ was measured in the presence of various concentrations of extracellular K+ (27Clausen T.

Cells were grown to confluence in culture medium containing 5 μm ouabain and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in serum- and K+-free medium (Na+ concentration 154 mm), to which had been added 86Rb+ (0.5 μCi/ml) with 0.5, 1, 3, 5, or 10 mm KCl and 5 μm ouabain (to inhibit the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase) or 10 mm ouabain (to inhibit all Na+,K+-ATPase). 86Rb+ uptake was terminated by washing the cells with an ice-cold solution containing 300 mm sucrose, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.18 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). After incubation in 0.2 m NaOH for 2 h at 4 °C, the cells were scraped off, and the amount of 86Rb+ in the suspension was determined by liquid scintillation counting. K+/congener uptake was calculated by multiplying the relative 86Rb+ uptake per mg protein by the K+ concentration in the uptake medium (27Clausen T. Everts M.E. Kjeldsen K.

To determine [Na+]i and [K+]i, cells were grown to confluence in culture medium containing 154 mm Na+ and 5.4 mm K+ as well as 5 μm ouabain.

[Na+]i and [K+]i were calculated by relating nmol of Na+ or K+/mg of total protein to μl of cell volume/mg of total protein determined by hematocrit centrifugation; trypsinized cells were washed and transferred to microcapillary tubes (75 × 0.575 mm) and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g.

The number of independent determinations (different days or different plasma membrane harvests/clonal isolates) is indicated by n in tables. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc.) for nonlinear regression (12Rodacker V. Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B.

The Na+, K+, ATP, and vanadate concentration dependences were fitted either by a single Hill function or by a function consisting of two Hill components (when both an activation phase and an inhibition phase were present).

However, no stable colonies appeared upon selection in growth media containing ouabain even though three different expression vectors (pcDNA3.1+, pCMV6-XL5, and pMT2) were tried, and the transfection was carried out several times. Because sustained growth of the transformed COS cells in the presence of ouabain, inhibiting the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase, depends on the enzyme activity of exogenous, expressed enzyme, we concluded that the α2+28 mutant is either not expressed or is non-functional. This was further examined in transient expression studies where the endogenous COS cell Na+,K+-ATPase was knocked down using a combination of ouabain and siRNA (24Beuschlein F. Boulkroun S. Osswald A. Wieland T. Nielsen H.N. Lichtenauer U.D. Penton D. Schack V.R. Amar L. Fischer E. Walther A. Tauber P. Schwarzmayr T. Diener S. Graf E. Allolio B. Samson-Couterie B. Benecke A. Quinkler M.

The Western blot of the isolated plasma membrane fraction shown in Fig. 2A indicates that the α2+28 mutant was well expressed to a level even higher than that of wild type α2, irrespective of whether the pCMV6-XL5 or pMT2 vector was used (compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 2). In the wild type Na+,K+-ATPase, phosphorylation from ATP occurs upon binding of three Na+ ions to the cytoplasmically facing sites of the E1 form (see Fig. 1). Fig. 2B shows enzymatic studies carried out on the isolated plasma membrane fraction. Despite the high protein expression level, 32P phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was negligible in the α2+28 mutant relative to wild type α2. Hence, at 100 mm Na+ as well as 300 mm Na+, the phosphorylation level of α2+28 was similar to the background represented by the D371N mutant, in which the phosphorylate-able aspartate has been replaced. The incompetence of α2+28 with respect to phosphorylation and, thus, ATP utilization explains why"

It has been suggested that metabolism-derived reactive oxygen species perturb the β-cell transcriptional machinery. Less is known about altered mitochondrial function in this condition. We used INS-1 832/13 cells cultured for 48 h in 2.8 mm glucose (low-G), 16.7 mm glucose (high-G), or 2.8 mm glucose plus 13.9 mm pyruvate (high-P) to identify metabolic perturbations. High-G cells showed decreased responsiveness, relative to low-G cells, with respect to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, plasma membrane depolarization, and insulin secretion, when stimulated acutely with 16.7 mm glucose or 10 mm pyruvate. In contrast, high-P cells were functionally unimpaired, eliminating chronic provision of saturating mitochondrial substrate as a cause of glucotoxicity. Although cellular insulin content was depleted in high-G cells, relative to low-G and high-P cells, cellular functions were largely recovered following a further 24-h culture in low-G medium. After 2 h at 2.8 mm glucose, high-G cells did not retain increased levels of glycolytic or TCA cycle intermediates but nevertheless displayed increased glycolysis, increased respiration, and an increased mitochondrial proton leak relative to low-G and high-P cells. This notwithstanding, titration of low-G cells with low protonophore concentrations, monitoring respiration and insulin secretion in parallel, showed that the perturbed insulin secretion of high-G cells could not be accounted for by increased proton leak. The present study supports the idea that glucose-induced disturbances of stimulus-secretion coupling by extramitochondrial metabolism upstream of pyruvate, rather than exhaustion from metabolic overload, underlie glucotoxicity in insulin-producing cells.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) 2The abbreviations used are: T2Dtype 2 diabetesANOVAanalysis of varianceFCCPcarbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretionPMPIplasma membrane potential indicatorROSreactive oxygen speciesTMRMtetramethylrhodamine methyl esterUCPuncoupling protein. has become one of the most rapidly increasing diseases of our time. An astounding 439 million people are projected to suffer from the disease by 2030 (1Shaw J.E. Sicree R.A. Zimmet P.Z. Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030.Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2010; 87: 4-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5012) Google Scholar). T2D is caused by the combined insult of impaired insulin secretion and resistance to the actions of the hormone (2Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Obesity-related derangements in metabolic regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This notwithstanding, it is also clear that as long as the pancreatic insulin-producing β-cells secrete sufficient amounts of the hormone, glucose homeostasis will remain under control (3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Diabetes mellitus and the beta cell. The last ten years.Cell. 2012; 148: 1160-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To understand why T2D develops, the processes leading to impaired insulin secretion need to be resolved. type 2 diabetes analysis of variance carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone glucose-stimulated insulin secretion plasma membrane potential indicator reactive oxygen species tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester uncoupling protein. The pancreatic β-cell is specialized to sense a rise in the ambient glucose level and promptly responds by releasing insulin. When glucose levels rise, uptake of the hexose is increased, and the increased pyruvate supply to the mitochondria stimulates ATP synthesis (4Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Mitochondrial signals drive insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 353: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting increase of the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio is the primary trigger of insulin release, causing closure of plasma membrane-embedded KATP channels (5Ashcroft F.M. Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J. Glucose induces closure of single potassium channels in isolated rat pancreatic beta-cells.Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). This initiates oscillatory plasma membrane depolarization, triggering calcium entry (6Komatsu M. Aizawa T. Takasu N. Yamada T. Glucose raises cytosolic free calcium in the rat pancreatic islets.Horm. Metab. Res. 1989; 21: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and exocytosis of insulin granules (3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Diabetes mellitus and the beta cell. The last ten years.Cell. 2012; 148: 1160-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In addition, an amplifying pathway sustains the secretion of insulin, which otherwise would taper off (7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Evidence that glucose can control insulin release independently from its action on ATP-sensitive K+ channels in mouse B cells.J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This pathway is less well characterized but seems to largely depend on mitochondrial metabolism, as does the triggering pathway (4Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Mitochondrial signals drive insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 353: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the events leading to T2D, glucose levels progressively rise until the diagnostic level of 7 mm is surpassed and frank diabetes is a fact. The pancreatic β-cells will therefore be exposed to elevated glucose levels for a prolonged time. Under such circumstances, the very same molecule that is the trigger of insulin secretion under normal conditions fails to sufficiently induce insulin release when applied acutely (8Leahy J.L. Cooper H.E. Deal D.A. Weir G.C. Chronic hyperglycemia is associated with impaired glucose influence on insulin secretion. A study in normal rats using chronic in vivo glucose infusions.J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This perturbation is referred to as glucotoxicity. There is a body of work describing mechanisms underlying the long term toxic effects of glucose on pancreatic β-cells (9Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Glucose toxicity in beta-cells. Type 2 diabetes, good radicals gone bad, and the glutathione connection.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 10Jonas J.C. Bensellam M. Duprez J. Elouil H. Guiot Y. Pascal S.M. Glucose regulation of islet stress responses and beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2009; 11: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Clearly, the lack of response depends on both the concentration of glucose and the duration of β-cell exposure. In fact, exceeding a certain time and concentration threshold may lead to irreversible damage of β-cells, which may undergo apoptosis (9Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Glucose toxicity in beta-cells. Type 2 diabetes, good radicals gone bad, and the glutathione connection.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 10Jonas J.C. Bensellam M. Duprez J. Elouil H. Guiot Y. Pascal S.M. Glucose regulation of islet stress responses and beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2009; 11: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This can probably be attributed to the intracellular formation of toxic compounds, which likely emanate from cellular metabolism, against which the β-cell defense will eventually fail. Although not definitively proven, glucose-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pancreatic β-cells has been suggested to be the culprit in glucotoxicity (9Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Glucose toxicity in beta-cells. Type 2 diabetes, good radicals gone bad, and the glutathione connection.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). If this view is accepted, there is a plethora of cellular processes that may be harmed by ROS. This includes effects on gene expression (11Jonas J.C. Laybutt D.R. Steil G.M. Trivedi N. Pertusa J.G. Van de Casteele M. Weir G.C. Henquin J.C. High glucose stimulates early response gene c-Myc expression in rat pancreatic beta cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35375-35381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), protein synthesis (12Elouil H. Bensellam M. Guiot Y. Vander Mierde D. Pascal S.M. Schuit F.C. Jonas J.C. Acute nutrient regulation of the unfolded protein response and integrated stress response in cultured rat pancreatic islets.Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and β-cell replication and viability. Although the role of ROS in β-cell glucotoxicity has been widely accepted (9Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Glucose toxicity in beta-cells. Type 2 diabetes, good radicals gone bad, and the glutathione connection.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), little is known about mitochondrial function in this pathological situation. This is surprising given the critical role of mitochondria in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling (4Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Mitochondrial signals drive insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 353: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the formation of ROS. Some years ago, it was suggested that the presence of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) contributes to impaired stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic β-cells, by blunting the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio (13Zhang C.Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.B. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Uncoupling protein-2 negatively regulates insulin secretion and is a major link between obesity, beta cell dysfunction, and type 2 diabetes.Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and hence restricting insulin secretion. Subsequently, it proved difficult to confirm the initial findings in properly back-crossed UCP2 knock-out mice (14Pi J. Bai Y. Daniel K.W. Liu D. Lyght O. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Corkey B.E. Collins S. Persistent oxidative stress due to absence of uncoupling protein 2 associated with impaired pancreatic beta-cell function.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the functional role of UCP2 in pancreatic β-cells has been challenged (15Collins S. Pi J. Yehuda-Shnaidman E. Uncoupling and reactive oxygen species (ROS). A double-edged sword for beta-cell function? “Moderation in all things.”.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 26: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been found that glucose-induced hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio are impaired in human islets in T2D (16Anello M. Lupi R. Spampinato D. Piro S. Masini M. Boggi U. Del Prato S. Rabuazzo A.M. Purrello F. Marchetti P. Functional and morphological alterations of mitochondria in pancreatic beta cells from type 2 diabetic patients.Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Given this knowledge gap, we decided to characterize the bioenergetic changes and metabolite profiles in an experimentally induced glucotoxic condition in INS-1 832/13 cells, a clonal cell line with widespread use as a model for pancreatic β-cells (17Krus U. Kotova O. Spégel P. Hallgard E. Sharoyko V.V. Vedin A. Moritz T. Sugden M.C. Koeck T. Mulder H. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 controls mitochondrial metabolism and insulin secretion in INS-1 832/13 clonal beta-cells.Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We observed perturbed insulin secretion, despite enhanced glycolysis and increased respiration in the glucotoxic insulin-producing cells. The responsiveness of both the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) hyperpolarization and plasma membrane potential (Δψp) depolarization to glucose was dampened, while the inner mitochondrial membrane proton leak was increased. Whereas glucotoxic INS-1 832/13 cells lost responsiveness to both glucose and pyruvate, chronic exposure to a comparable concentration of pyruvate did not provoke a fuel-induced toxic condition. Thus, early alterations in glycolytic metabolism, rather than excess substrate supply, account for the glucose-specific toxic metabolic effect on clonal insulin-producing cells. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Clonal INS-1 832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 11.1 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. For all experiments, cells were seeded in appropriate plates and maintained in culture medium for 24 h. Then cells were cultured for 48 h in medium containing 2.8 mm glucose (low-G cells), 16.7 mm glucose (high-G cells), or 2.8 mm glucose + 13.9 mm sodium pyruvate (high-P cells). Prior to measurements, cells were incubated for 2 h in the indicated buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose. For clarification, the experimental design is shown in Fig. 1. Medium was directly collected after the 48-h culture at different glucose and pyruvate concentrations to determine the total amount of insulin secreted. The insulin content was determined after extraction of cells in 95:5 (v:v) ethanol:hydrochloric acid solution. Prior to the 1-h secretion assay, cells were maintained for 2 h in secretion assay buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose, 114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 25.5 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% BSA at pH 7.2. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with either 2.8 mm glucose, 16.7 mm glucose, or 10 mm sodium pyruvate for 1 h. Insulin was determined with the Coat-a-Count radioimmunoassay kit (DPC, Los Angeles, CA). An individual vial from the FLIPR® membrane potential assay kit, explorer format component A (catalog no. R-8042; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) containing a proprietary plasma membrane potential indicator that we have named “PMPI” was reconstituted in 10 ml of distilled water and frozen in 1-ml aliquots (PMPI stock). Cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine coated Nunc Lab-TekTM 8-well chambers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) and cultured as described above. Prior to monitoring Δψp, cells were incubated for 2 h in 400 μl of buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose, 135 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. To monitor changes in Δψp, cells were loaded with 2 μl/400 μl PMPI stock for 10 min. The 8-well chamber was inserted into a temperature (37 °C) and CO2 (5%)-controlled incubation chamber on the stage of an inverted confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Whole field PMPI fluorescence (514-nm excitation, 530-nm long pass emission) was monitored with a 40× air objective in real time. Fluorescence was collected from a monolayer of ∼200 cells. The data were corrected for background and normalized to values following addition of oligomycin, when the KATP channels would be predicted to be fully activated. For Δψm measurements, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Invitrogen). TMRM was present in the medium throughout the experiment. Under these conditions (“quench mode”) (18Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. Mitochondrial membrane potential and glutamate excitotoxicity in cultured cerebellar granule cells.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreased whole cell fluorescence corresponds to mitochondrial hyperpolarization. TMRM fluorescence (543-nm excitation, 585-nm long pass emission) was recorded. The data were background-corrected and normalized to values following oligomycin addition. Cells were grown in XF24 24-well plates (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) as described previously (19Malmgren S. Nicholls D.G. Taneera J. Bacos K. Koeck T. Tamaddon A. Wibom R. Groop L. Ling C. Mulder H. Sharoyko V.V. Tight coupling between glucose and mitochondrial metabolism in clonal beta-cells is required for robust insulin secretion.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32395-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Measurements of oxygen consumption rates were performed with the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer XF24 (Seahorse Bioscience) as previously published (19Malmgren S. Nicholls D.G. Taneera J. Bacos K. Koeck T. Tamaddon A. Wibom R. Groop L. Ling C. Mulder H. Sharoyko V.V.

Chem. 2009; 284: 32395-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 2 h of preincubation in 2.8 mm glucose, respiration was measured in low glucose (2.8 mm) for 30 min, following which 16.7 mm glucose or 10 mm pyruvate were added. After a further 60 min, oligomycin (4 μg/ml) was added to estimate the proportion of respiration driving ATP synthesis or proton leak. After a further 30 min, 4 μm carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to determine maximal respiratory capacity. Finally, after a further 10 min, 1 μm rotenone was added to allow estimation of nonmitochondrial respiration. Respiration of low-G, high-G, and high-P cells was monitored as above in 2.8 mm glucose, followed by addition of secretagogue (16.7 mm glucose or 10 mm pyruvate, together with 0, 12.5, 50, 100, or 150 nm FCCP (note that the medium contains 1 mg albumin/ml)). After 60 min, oligomycin (4 μg/ml) was added to estimate mitochondrial ATP turnover and proton leak. The supernatant from the run was sampled to determine insulin release by radioimmunoassay as described above. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates as described above. Prior to assay, cells were maintained for 2 h in secretion assay buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose. Glucose utilization was determined by determining release of [3H]H2O, using liquid scintillation spectrometry as previously described (19Malmgren S. Nicholls D.G. Taneera J. Bacos K. Koeck T. Tamaddon A. Wibom R. Groop L. Ling C. Mulder H. Sharoyko V.V. Tight coupling between glucose and mitochondrial metabolism in clonal beta-cells is required for robust insulin secretion.J. Biol.

Chem. 2013; 288: 11973-11987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Profiling of intracellular metabolites was performed under conditions paralleling the respiration and membrane potential measurements, as previously described in detail (21Spégel P. Malmgren S. Sharoyko V.V. Newsholme P. Koeck T. Mulder H. Metabolomic analyses reveal profound differences in glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism in glucose-responsive and -unresponsive clonal beta-cell lines.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To confirm uptake and metabolism of nutrients under the experimental conditions, selected metabolites were profiled at 17, 21, 41, and 45 h after starting the culture of low-G, high-G, and high-P cells. Metabolism was rapidly quenched using methanol at −80 °C. Metabolites were then extracted, derivatized, and analyzed by GC/MS. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. or means ± S.E.M. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test, or when indicated, by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's or Bonferroni's post hoc test, when more than two groups were compared. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Nutrient uptake experiments were compared with ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test. The total insulin released into the medium was determined during a 48-h incubation under three conditions: 2.8 mm glucose (low-G), 16.7 mm glucose (high-G), and 2.8 mm glucose plus 13.9 mm pyruvate (high-P). A 48-h exposure of INS-1 832/13 cells to 16.7 mm glucose in the culture medium (high-G) led to an accumulated release of 1015 ± 86 ng insulin/mg protein (Fig. 2A and Table 1). This was only a slight increase over the basal release (742 ± 118 ng insulin/mg protein) from cells cultured in 2.8 mm glucose medium (low-G) under the same time. This modest increase contrasted with the near 14-fold enhancement of insulin secretion seen when low-G cells were acutely exposed to 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h (Fig. 2C and Table 1). This suggests that GSIS eventually fails in prolonged culture in high glucose medium, whereas basal release in low glucose may continue. Moreover, high-G cells showed greatly diminished basal and GSIS when tested 2 h after transfer to secretion assay buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 2C and Table 1), again confirming previous results (17Krus U. Kotova O. Spégel P. Hallgard E. Sharoyko V.V. Vedin A. Moritz T. Sugden M.C. Koeck T. Mulder H. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 controls mitochondrial metabolism and insulin secretion in INS-1 832/13 clonal beta-cells.Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GSIS relative to stimulated secretion in the low-G control was reduced to 3.9-fold. However, basal insulin release in 2.8 mm glucose was also reduced (Fig. 2C), and thus, relative to the high-G control, 16.7 mm glucose actually elicited a ∼13.1-fold enhancement of insulin release. High-G cells therefore appeared to retain the mechanisms for basal and GSIS, but the amount of insulin secreted was less.TABLE 1Effects of glucose and pyruvate concentrations in the culture medium on accumulated insulin, insulin content, and release in INS-1 831/13 cellsCulture conditionAccumulated insulinInsulin contentInsulin releaseWith 2.8 mm glucoseWith 16.7 mm glucoseWith 10 mm pyruvateng/mg proteinng/mg proteinng/mg protein/h2.8 mm glucose for 48 h742.1 ± 58.9533.2 ± 140.94.5 ± 0.662.5 ± 13.971.1 ± 29.516.7 mm glucose for 48 h1015.0 ± 42.8115.4 ± 53.31.4 ± 0.518.7 ± 5.914.6 ± 5.72.8 mm glucose + 13.9 mm pyruvate for 48 h1832.7 ± 369.1456.7 ± 171.03.5 ± 0.767.6 ± 13.275.4 ± 17.8 Open table in a new tab To investigate possible reasons for these differences, the total insulin content of the cells was determined at the end of the 48-h culture. The insulin content of high-G cells was reduced by 79% relative to the low-G controls (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Thus, one hypothesis for the diminished GSIS would be that high glucose causes a depletion of secretory vesicle numbers and/or insulin content. One advantage of INS-1 832/13 cells is that they possess the plasma membrane monocarboxylate carrier and can thus utilize exogenous pyruvate as an efficient substrate and secretagogue (22Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. Overexpression of monocarboxylate transporter and lactate dehydrogenase alters insulin secretory responses to pyruvate and lactate in beta cells.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). If the diminished insulin secretion from the high-G cells was due to prolonged high substrate availability, it would be predicted that low glucose supplemented with pyruvate, which creates similar bioenergetic conditions to high glucose (23Goehring I. Gerencser A.A. Schmidt S. Brand M.D. Mulder H. Nicholls D.G. Plasma membrane potential oscillations in insulin secreting INS-1 832/13 cells do not require glycolysis and are not initiated by fluctuations in mitochondrial bioenergetics.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 15706-15717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), would reproduce the defective secretion seen in high-G cells. However, after a 48-h culture in the presence of the combination of 2.8 mm glucose and 13.9 mm pyruvate (high-P) followed by 2 h in low glucose buffer, GSIS was as robust as from the low-G cultured cells (Fig. 2C and Table 1), so the hypothesis of “bioenergetic overload” was not supported. An alternative hypothesis is that glycolysis fails during the high-G culture and does not recover during the 2-h preincubation prior to the assay, rendering the addition of glucose for the GSIS assay ineffective. We shall deal with glycolytic activity and mitochondrial function later, but here it would be predicted that direct addition of pyruvate for the GSIS (or rather “pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion, PSIS”) assay would bypass such a block and support secretion. However, although pyruvate was an effective secretagogue for both low-G and high-P cells, it was as ineffective as glucose as a secretagogue for the high-G cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, the hypothesis of a glycolytic block is not consistent with these results. Pyruvate does, however, greatly enhance the release of insulin during the 48-h culture (Fig. 2A and Table 1) and interestingly totally prevents the depletion of the cellular insulin content seen in high-G (Fig. 2B and Table 1), which is consistent with an insulin granule “pool size” hypothesis. To confirm that high-G conditions did not inhibit glycolysis during the subsequent GSIS assay, the activity of glycolysis was estimated from the rate of [3H]OH produced from [5-3H]glucose. One molecule of [3H]OH is formed when 2-phosphoglycerate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by enolase. Both basal and glucose-stimulated glycolytic rates were actually elevated for high-G (but not high-P) cultured cells when compared with low-G cells (Fig. 3A), eliminating the hypothesis that a failure of glycolysis might underlie the decreased GSIS from these cells. Another possible explanation for perturbed GSIS in high-G cells is enhanced lactate production, although β-cells do not normally express lactate dehydrogenase (24Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R.

We recently described a role for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in ccRCC as an autocrine-signaling molecule with elevated expression in tumor tissues and in the circulation of patients that has potent tumor cell survival effects. MIF is a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in a variety of diseases and cancers and is the target of both small molecule and antibody-based therapies currently in clinical trials. Recent work by others has described D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) as a functional homologue of MIF with a similar genomic structure and expression patterns. Thus, we sought to determine a role for DDT in renal cancer. We find that DDT expression mirrors MIF expression in ccRCC tumor sections with high correlation and that, mechanistically, DDT is a novel hypoxia-inducible gene and direct target of HIF1α and HIF2α. Functionally, DDT and MIF demonstrate a significant overlap in controlling cell survival, tumor formation, and tumor and endothelial cell migration. However, DDT inhibition consistently displayed more severe effects on most phenotypes. Accordingly, although dual inhibition of DDT and MIF demonstrated additive effects in vitro, DDT plays a dominant role in tumor growth in vivo. Together, our findings identify DDT as a functionally redundant but more potent cytokine to MIF in cancer and suggest that current attempts to inhibit MIF signaling may fail because of DDT compensation.

The vast majority (∼75%) of renal cancers is classified as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) because of their vacuolated appearance on histological sections that results from dissolution of vast lipid and cholesterol deposits (2Drabkin H.A.

Campbell S.C. Escudier B. Renal cell carcinoma.Lancet. 2009; 373: 1119-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The VHL protein is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is critical for targeting the α subunits of the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) by priming them for proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions (6Kaelin Jr., W.G. The von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein. O2 sensing and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, the HIFα subunits are not degraded, translocate to the nucleus, dimerize with the constitutive HIF1β subunit (also known as the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator or ARNT), and transactivate a myriad of genes controlling multiple cell functions, such as angiogenesis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and survival (7Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factors in physiology and medicine.Cell. 2012; 148: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). In ccRCC, impaired VHL function ablates the proteolytic regulation of HIFα subunits, leading to the constitutive activation of hypoxia pathways. The central roles of HIF1 and HIF2 in numerous pathways responsible for tumorigenesis are well established, and, as a result, HIF and HIF target genes have emerged as potential therapeutic targets in a variety of cancers, including ccRCC (8Rankin E.B.

The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a 115-amino acid, secreted cytokine that is normally involved in inflammation but has been implicated in a number of pathologies, including autoimmunity, obesity, and cancer (10Bach J.P. Rinn B. Meyer B. Dodel R. Bacher M. Role of MIF in inflammation and tumorigenesis.Oncology. 2008; 75: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). MIF is regulated by hypoxia and is a direct transcriptional target of HIF1α (11Baugh J.A. Gantier M. Li L. Byrne A. Buckley A. Donnelly S.C.

MIF binds to its cell surface receptor CD74, but signaling additionally requires the recruitment of coreceptors such as CD44 or CXCR2 and CXCR4 (13Shi X. Leng L. Wang T. Wang W. Du X. Li J.

MIF is a noncognate ligand of CXC chemokine receptors in inflammatory and atherogenic cell recruitment.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). MIF is directly associated with the growth of several types of carcinomas, and anti-MIF therapy with immunoglobulins and antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to have antitumorigenic effects (15Chesney J.

Inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor decreases proliferation and cytokine expression in bladder cancer cells.BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Prior studies from our laboratory demonstrated MIF to be a protumorigenic signaling molecule that functions in an autocrine fashion to promote ccRCC tumor growth (17Du W. Wright B.M. Li X. Finke J. Rini B.I. Zhou M. He H. Lal P. Welford S.M. Tumor-derived macrophage migration inhibitory factor promotes an autocrine loop that enhances renal cell carcinoma.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We observed the expression of MIF in the vast majority of ccRCC tumor samples and found MIF to be elevated in the blood plasma of patients with renal tumors compared with healthy controls. Thus, our studies identified MIF as a potential therapeutic target in ccRCC. A recent study demonstrated that D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) is a functional homologue of MIF (18Merk M. Zierow S. Leng L. Das R. Du X. Schulte W. Fan J. Lue H. Chen Y. Xiong H. Chagnon F. Bernhagen J. Lolis E. Mor G. Lesur O. Bucala R.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: E577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). DDT shares 34% amino acid identity with MIF and is located within 0.1 kb of MIF in both mouse and human genomes. DDT has also been shown to bind to the MIF receptor CD74 (18Merk M. Zierow S. Leng L. Das R. Du X. Schulte W. Fan J. Lue H. Chen Y. Xiong H. Chagnon F. Bernhagen J. Lolis E. Mor G. Lesur O. Bucala R.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: E577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), although extensive studies on other receptors for DDT have yet to be reported. DDT and MIF have similar structural and enzymatic properties. Both DDT and MIF show a remarkable similarity in tertiary structure, and both have tautomerase activity (18Merk M. Zierow S. Leng L. Das R. Du X. Schulte W. Fan J. Lue H. Chen Y. Xiong H. Chagnon F. Bernhagen J. Lolis E. Mor G. Lesur O. Bucala R.

Cooperative regulation of non-small cell lung carcinoma angiogenic potential by macrophage migration inhibitory factor and its homolog, D-dopachrome tautomerase.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that DDT functionally cooperates with, and compensates for, MIF in regulating the angiogenic potential of non-small cell lung carcinoma by the additive induction of CXCL8 and VEGF expression and secretion. Although the protumorigenic function of MIF in ccRCC has recently been established by our group, the role of DDT in ccRCC remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of the only known structural and functional homolog of MIF in ccRCC to determine whether DDT functions cooperatively with MIF in survival signaling. Our results indicate that DDT is a protumorigenic signaling molecule that promotes renal cell carcinoma. We find that DDT expression is controlled by the VHL/HIF axis, leading to overexpression in ccRCC tumors, and that there is a functional overlap between DDT and MIF in ccRCC signaling and tumor growth and in promoting the migration of both tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells. Strikingly, the inhibition of DDT appears to have more dramatic effects than MIF inhibition. With the observation that DDT and MIF demonstrate functional redundancy, our data demonstrate that targeting approaches that can neutralize both DDT and MIF have a greater potential for benefit. rMIF was obtained from ProSpec (East Brunswick, NJ). D-luciferin was obtained from Biosynth International, Inc. (Staad, Switzerland). A stock solution of concentration 12.5 mg/ml was prepared in 1× PBS. The RCC4 and 786-O ccRCC cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. HUVECs were provided by Dr. Qing Wang (Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic). The ccRCC cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). HUVECs were maintained in MCDB 105 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and supplemented with 10% FBS and bovine brain extracts (Lonza). All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. shRNAs were from Open Biosystems (Thermo Scientific): shDDT-1, TRCN0000178842; shDDT-2, TRCN0000377557; and shMIF, TRCN0000056818. Tumor tissue microarrays comprising 38 ccRCC tumor sections were created as described previously (14Bernhagen J. Krohn R. Lue H. Gregory J.L. Zernecke A. Koenen R.R. Dewor M. Georgiev I. Schober A.

MIF is a noncognate ligand of CXC chemokine receptors in inflammatory and atherogenic cell recruitment.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Microarrays were stained with an anti-MIF antibody (catalog no. sc-20121, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-DDT antibody (catalog no. sc-86406, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution with no antigen retrieval and biotin/avidin amplification following standard procedures. Tumor xenograft sections were stained similarly. CD31 antibody (catalog no. sc-1506) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Quantification of vessels was performed on 10 random high power fields (20×) of 2–3 tumors/group. Colony survival assays of RCC4 and 786-O cells were performed after knockdown of DDT, MIF, and MIF/DDT expression with shRNA constructs versus a control construct (shGFP). 300–1000 cells/6-cm plate were plated and stained after 14 days with 0.1% crystal violet and quantified. All assays were done at least three times with individual samples in triplicate. Cell proliferation assays of RCC4 and 786-O cells were performed after knockdown of DDT, MIF, and MIF/DDT expression with shRNA constructs versus a control construct (shGFP). Assays were performed by plating 20,000 cells in 12-well plates, trypsinizing, quantifying after 3–4 days, and diluting back to starting densities for subsequent time points. All assays were done at least three times with individual samples in triplicate. qRT-PCR was performed using standard procedures and normalized to β-actin. Primer sequences are available upon request. ChIP was performed as described previously on RCC4VHL cells treated with 0.5% oxygen for 24 h (20Krieg A.J. Rankin E.B. Chan D. Razorenova O. Fernandez S.

The antibodies used were anti-MIF (1:2500, catalog no. sc-20121, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DDT (1:2500, catalog no. sc-86406, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HIF1α (1:5000, catalog no.

DDT-, MIF-, and DDT/MIF-depleted RCC4 cells grown to a confluent monolayer in 6-well plates were wounded horizontally and vertically with a 200-μl standard pipette tip. shGFP knockdown RCC4 cells were used as controls. The growth medium was then aspirated, and wells were washed twice with 1× PBS to remove cell debris. Six fields of cell-free wounds for each cell type were recorded at ×100 magnification immediately after the scratch and at the indicated time points. To quantify the migration of cells, the images were analyzed by TScratch software (17Du W. Wright B.M. Li X. Finke J. Rini B.I. Zhou M. He H. Lal P. Welford S.M. Tumor-derived macrophage migration inhibitory factor promotes an autocrine loop that enhances renal cell carcinoma.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presented images are representatives of triplicate experiments with a similar outcome. In endothelial cell migration assays with rMIF, rMIF was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. In endothelial cell migration assays with conditioned medium, endothelial cell growth medium was conditioned overnight with DDT, MIF, DDT/MIF, and GFP knockdown RCC4 cells. DDT-, MIF-, and DDT/MIF-deficient RCC4 cells were seeded in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). GFP knockdown RCC4 cells were used as controls. Images were acquired at multiple positions within each chamber every 10 min for 24 h. Time-lapse data were analyzed with an automated two-dimensional cell tracking program in Metamorph 7.7.7.0 (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA). Assays were performed twice with individual samples in triplicate. At least 27 cells were tracked for each cell line per assay. Six- to eight-week-old athymic BALB/c nude mice were obtained from an in-house colony. Subcutaneous mouse tumor assays were performed with DDT-depleted 786-O cells. shGFP knockdown 786-O cells were used as controls. 1 × 106 786-O cells in 100 μl of saline were injected subcutaneously in the flanks of nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored and measured twice weekly with calipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula V = 1/2 L × W2. Orthotopic renal tumor implantation was performed with DDT-, MIF-, and DDT/MIF-depleted luciferase-expressing 786-O cells. shGFP knockdown luciferase-expressing 786-O cells were used as controls. 1 × 105 786-O cells were injected into the subcapsular space of the left kidneys of nude mice. Nude mice were anesthetized, and a 1-cm incision was made into the left flank through which the kidney was accessed. A 5-μl mixture of 1 × 105 786-O cells and basement membrane mixture (Matrigel, BD Biosciences) was injected below the renal capsule using a Hamilton syringe and a 23-gauge needle. The needle was held in place until the Matrigel solidified, and the incisions were closed up with sutures. Tumor growth was assessed twice weekly by in vivo bioluminescence imaging using the IVISTM system (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA). Animals were anesthetized and injected with 200 μl of D-luciferin. Signal intensity was quantified as the sum of all detected photon counts within a region of interest using the LivingImageTM software package. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6.01. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were performed to determine significance. p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. To determine the expression levels of DDT in ccRCC tumor samples, we stained multitumor tissue microarrays consisting of multiple (2Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M.

Renal cell carcinoma.Lancet. 2009; 373: 1119-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) sections of 38 pathologically confirmed clear cell tumors with a DDT-specific antibody. The stained tumors were scored as one of four categories: negative, low, moderate, or high staining (numerically scored as 0–3). Averages scores were computed for staining of each sample. Examples of the three types of positive DDT staining are shown in Fig. 1A. The majority of the tumor samples showed positive DDT staining (36 of 38, 95%). 21% of the samples (8 of 38) demonstrated high staining, 45% demonstrated moderate staining (17 of 38), and only 5% were negative (2 of 38) (Fig. 1B). Associated “normal” sections for some tumors also existed on the array and generally displayed staining in the low range of the scale. We stained a serial tissue microarray slide with a MIF-specific antibody and scored the staining levels similarly. Similar results were observed: positive staining in 97% (37 of 38), high staining in 26% (10 of 38), moderate staining in 50% (19 of 38), and negative staining in 3% (1 of 38). Consistent with the roles as secreted factors and signaling through a receptor-mediated mechanism, DDT and MIF staining showed a prominent localization to the cell membrane (Fig. 1A). In tumors expressing high levels of DDT and MIF, both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining are also evident, suggesting potential intracellular roles as well. To assess whether DDT and MIF demonstrate a correlation in staining, the staining results were quantified (low = 1, moderate = 2, high = 3), multiple sections of the same tumors were averaged, and Spearman's correlation coefficient ρ was used to measure the association between DDT and MIF expression on the arrays. A positive correlation (R2 = 0.3686; p = 0.0001) was observed (Fig. 1C). Similar results were also observed when we queried the Oncomine database and found a correlated expression of DDT and MIF mRNA in the Yusenko and Beroukhim data sets (Fig. 1, D and 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that DDT is highly expressed in the majority of ccRCC tumors and that the expression levels of DDT correlate with MIF expression. To determine the mechanism of regulation of DDT in ccRCC, we assessed the dependence of DDT transcriptional expression on VHL status and on hypoxia in vitro. The expression levels of DDT were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in the VHL-deficient ccRCC cell line RCC4 and compared with RCC4 cells that have reconstituted VHL expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a significant decrease in expression of DDT upon reconstitution of VHL, suggesting that DDT, like MIF, is regulated by the VHL/HIF pathway and overexpressed because of the loss of VHL. There was more than a 4-fold decrease in MIF expression and more than a 3-fold decrease in DDT. As expected, on Western blot analyses, there was a concomitant decrease in the expression levels of HIF1α and DDT upon reconstitution of VHL in RCC4 cells and of HIF2α and DDT in the 786-O VHL-deficient ccRCC line, which do not express HIF1α (Fig. 2B). We next tested the hypoxic induction of DDT expression in RCC4VHL cells. Like the canonical HIF target GLUT1, both DDT and MIF demonstrated significant hypoxia inducibility after 24-h exposure to 0.5% oxygen. Similar to the RCC4 and RCC4VHL comparison, hypoxic treatment of RCC4VHL cells led to a 3- to 5-fold transcriptional induction of DDT and MIF (Fig. 2C). To test the effects of hypoxia in a non-ccRCC cell type, 293T cells were treated with either 2% or 0.5% O2 and compared with cells in normoxia (21% O2) on Western blot analyses for DDT expression. DDT demonstrated an oxygen-dependent increase in expression in concordance with HIF1α stabilization (Fig. 2D). Although HIF1α appears to be maximally stabilized at 2%, it is known that asparagine hydroxylation by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) continues to antagonize HIF1α until more severe hypoxia is achieved and HIF1 activity reaches a maximum (near 0.5% O2) (21Lisy K. Peet D.J. Turn me on. Regulating HIF transcriptional activity.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Finally, to determine whether DDT is a HIF1α- or HIF2α-dependent gene, we employed shRNA to HIF1α and HIF2α and determined the effects on DDT expression in RCC4 cells. With shRNAs that demonstrated an efficient knockdown of HIF1α and HIF2α (Fig. 2E), we observed that the expression of DDT is regulated by both HIF1α and HIF2α. In contrast, GLUT4 proved to be more dependent on HIF1α, whereas VEGF is more dependent HIF2α, in agreement with published findings (22Carroll V.A. Ashcroft M. Role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α versus HIF-2α in the regulation of HIF target genes in response to hypoxia, insulin-like growth factor-I, or loss of von Hippel-Lindau function. Implications for targeting the HIF pathway.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6264-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To determine whether DDT is a direct target of HIF, we then assessed whether HIF1α or HIF2α can associate with the DDT promoter under hypoxia by ChIP. As shown in Fig. 3A, the proximal DDT promoter contains at least three putative HREs (hypoxia response elements) by computational analysis (MatInspector). We designed primers to an upstream region as a negative control and surrounding the three HREs (HRE1 and 2 together and HRE3). Following ChIP on RCC4VHL cells exposed to either 21 or 0.5% O2 for 24 h, we found that HIF1α- and HIF2α-specific antibodies could pull down protein-DNA complexes that include HRE3 but not HRE1 and 2 (Fig. 3, B–D). Hypoxia induced a 2.5-fold enrichment of the HRE3 region of the DDT promoter compared with normoxia and to control IgG pull-down for both HIF1α of HIF2α. Collectively, the results imply that DDT is regulated by the VHL/HIF pathway and is a HIF1α and HIF2α direct target gene. To assess the functional significance of DDT in ccRCC, DDT expression was stably inhibited by two independent shRNAs in RCC4 cells via lentivirus-mediated transduction, and functional assays were performed. Upon knockdown, cells displayed significant decrease in DDT expression compared with shGFP control cells, as verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). When progrowth signaling was assessed, DDT-deficient cells showed decreased ERK phosphorylation and a concurrent increase in p27, the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4A), much like what we have found previously for MIF knockdown (17Du W.

We then assessed the growth characteristics of ccRCC cells that lack DDT expression by proliferation assays and by clonogenic survival assays. DDT knockdown reduced monolayer cell proliferation by roughly 50% (Fig. 4B) and clonogenic survival by 70–85% (C). The reduction in colonies occurred in both the number as well as the sizes of the colonies. Interestingly, the reduced cell and colony numbers occurred in the absence of induction of cell death, as measured by trypan blue staining and flow cytometry (data not shown).

The deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that function in the nervous system are beginning to be defined, but the mechanisms that control DUB activity in vivo are understood poorly. We found previously that the DUB USP-46 deubiquitinates the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate receptor GLR-1 and prevents its degradation in the lysosome. The WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins WDR20 and WDR48/UAF1 have been shown to bind to USP46 and stimulate its catalytic activity in other systems. Here we identify the C. elegans homologs of these WDR proteins and show that C. elegans WDR-20 and WDR-48 can bind and stimulate USP-46 catalytic activity in vitro. Overexpression of these activator proteins in vivo increases the abundance of GLR-1 in the ventral nerve cord, and this effect is further enhanced by coexpression of USP-46. Biochemical characterization indicates that this increase in GLR-1 abundance correlates with decreased levels of ubiquitin-GLR-1 conjugates, suggesting that WDR-20, WDR-48, and USP-46 function together to deubiquitinate and stabilize GLR-1 in neurons. Overexpression of WDR-20 and WDR-48 results in alterations in locomotion behavior consistent with increased glutamatergic signaling, and this effect is blocked in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants. Conversely, wdr-20 and wdr-48 loss-of-function mutants exhibit changes in locomotion behavior that are consistent with decreased glutamatergic signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2065806246,"Successful vaccinia virus (VACV) replication in the host requires expression of viral proteins that interfere with host immunity, such as antagonists of the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Two such VACV proteins are A46 and A52. A46 interacts with the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1R (TIR) domain of Toll-like receptors and intracellular adaptors such as MAL (MyD88 adapter-like), TRAM (TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule), TRIF, and MyD88, whereas A52 binds to the downstream signaling components TRAF6 and IRAK2. Here, we characterize A46 biochemically, determine by microscale thermophoresis binding constants for the interaction of A46 with the TIR domains of MyD88 and MAL, and present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of A46 residues 87-229. Full-length A46 behaves as a tetramer; variants lacking the N-terminal 80 residues are dimeric. Nevertheless, both bind to the Toll-like receptor domains of MAL and MyD88 with KD values in the low μm range. Like A52, A46 also shows a Bcl-2-like fold but with biologically relevant differences from that of A52. Thus, A46 uses helices α4 and α6 to dimerize, compared with the α1-α6 face used by A52 and other Bcl-2 like VACV proteins. Furthermore, the loop between A46 helices α4-α5 is flexible and shorter than in A52; there is also evidence for an intramolecular disulfide bridge between consecutive cysteine residues. We used molecular docking to propose how A46 interacts with the BB loop of the TRAM TIR domain. Comparisons of A46 and A52 exemplify how subtle changes in viral proteins with the same fold lead to crucial differences in biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987757996,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading human pathogen producing a diverse array of infections from simple pharyngitis (""strep throat"") to invasive conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. The surface-anchored GAS M1 protein is a classical virulence factor that promotes phagocyte resistance and exaggerated inflammation by binding host fibrinogen (Fg) to form supramolecular networks. In this study, we used a virulent WT M1T1 GAS strain and its isogenic M1-deficient mutant to examine the role of M1-Fg binding in a proximal step in GAS infection-interaction with the pharyngeal epithelium. Expression of the M1 protein reduced GAS adherence to human pharyngeal keratinocytes by 2-fold, and this difference was increased to 4-fold in the presence of Fg. In stationary phase, surface M1 protein cleavage by the GAS cysteine protease SpeB eliminated Fg binding and relieved its inhibitory effect on GAS pharyngeal cell adherence. In a mouse model of GAS colonization of nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, M1 protein expression was associated with an average 6-fold decreased GAS recovery in isogenic strain competition assays. Thus, GAS M1 protein-Fg binding reduces GAS pharyngeal cell adherence and colonization in a fashion that is counterbalanced by SpeB. Inactivation of SpeB during the shift to invasive GAS disease allows M1-Fg binding, increasing pathogen phagocyte resistance and proinflammatory activities."

These proteins, which are characterized by a globular domain and a collagen-like domain, play key roles in host adhesion, host immune defense evasion, and biofilm formation. In this work, we demonstrate that the Scl2.3 protein is expressed on the surface of invasive M3-type strain MGAS315 of Streptococcus pyogenes. We report the crystal structure of Scl2.3 globular domain, the first of any Scl. This structure shows a novel fold among collagen trimerization domains of either bacterial or human origin. Despite there being low sequence identity, we observed that Scl2.3 globular domain structurally resembles the gp41 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1, an essential subunit for viral fusion to human T cells. We combined crystallographic data with modeling and molecular dynamics techniques to gather information on the entire lollipop-like Scl2.3 structure. Molecular dynamics data evidence a high flexibility of Scl2.3 with remarkable interdomain motions that are likely instrumental to the protein biological function in mediating adhesive or immune-modulatory functions in host-pathogen interactions. Altogether, our results provide molecular tools for the understanding of Scl-mediated streptococcal pathogenesis and important structural insights for the future design of small molecular inhibitors of streptococcal invasion."

Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified a missense mutation in Rev7/Mad2l2 (Rev7(C70R)) and confirmed that the mutation is the cause of the defects in repro22 mice through transgenic rescue with normal Rev7. Rev7/Mad2l2 encodes a subunit of DNA polymerase ζ (Polζ), 1 of 10 translesion DNA synthesis polymerases known in mammals. The mutant REV7 did not interact with REV3, the catalytic subunit of Polζ. Rev7(C70R/C70R) cells showed decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and arrest in S phase with extensive γH2AX foci in nuclei that indicated accumulation of DNA damage after treatment with the genotoxic agent mitomycin C. The Rev7(C70R) mutation does not affect the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. These results demonstrated that Rev7 is essential in resolving the replication stalls caused by DNA damage during S phase. We concluded that Rev7 is required for primordial germ cell proliferation and embryonic viability and development through the translesion DNA synthesis activity of Polζ preserving DNA integrity during cell proliferation, which is required in highly proliferating embryonic cells."

The per-capita carbon emissions indicator is an important measure of the regional carbon emissions situation. This study used the LMDI factor decomposition model-panel co-integration test two-step method to analyze the factors that affect per-capita carbon emissions. The main results are as follows. (1) During 1997, Eastern China, Central China, and Western China ranked first, second, and third in the per-capita carbon emissions, while in 2009 the pecking order changed to Eastern China, Western China, and Central China. (2) According to the LMDI decomposition results, the key driver boosting the per-capita carbon emissions in the three economic regions of China between 1997 and 2009 was economic development, and the energy efficiency was much greater than the energy structure after considering their effect on restraining increased per-capita carbon emissions. (3) Based on the decomposition, the factors that affected per-capita carbon emissions in the panel co-integration test showed that Central China had the best energy structure elasticity in its regional per-capita carbon emissions.

https://openalex.org/W2009684953,"Vessel abnormalities are among the most important features in malignant glioma. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is of major importance for vascular integrity. Upon cytokine challenge, VE-cadherin structural modifications have been described including tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage. The goal of this study was to examine whether these events occurred in human glioma vessels. We demonstrated that VE-cadherin is highly expressed in human glioma tissue and tyrosine phosphorylated at site Y685, a site previously found phosphorylated upon VEGF challenge, via Src activation. In vitro experiments showed that VEGF-induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation, preceded the cleavage of its extracellular adhesive domain (sVE, 90 kDa). Interestingly, metalloproteases (MMPs) secreted by glioma cell lines were responsible for sVE release. Because VEGF and MMPs are important components of tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that VE-cadherin proteolysis might occur in human brain tumors. Analysis of glioma patient sera prior treatment confirmed the presence of sVE in bloodstream. Furthermore, sVE levels studied in a cohort of 53 glioma patients were significantly predictive of the overall survival at three years (HR 0.13 [0.04; 0.40] p≤0.001), irrespective to histopathological grade of tumors. Altogether, these results suggest that VE-cadherin structural modifications should be examined as candidate biomarkers of tumor vessel abnormalities, with promising applications in oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2150787881,"The Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) strain, which emerged in Europe in 2006, had an unusually high ability to cause foetal infection in pregnant ruminants. Other serotypes of BTV had already been present in Europe for more than a decade, but transplacental transmission of these strains had never been demonstrated. To determine whether transplacental transmission is a unique feature of BTV-8 we compared the incidence and pathological consequences of transplacental transmission of BTV-8 to that of BTV-1. Nine pregnant ewes were infected with either BTV-8 or BTV-1. The BTV strains used for the infection were field strains isolated on embryonated chicken eggs and passaged twice on mammalian cells. Blood samples were taken to monitor the viraemia in the ewes. Four weeks after the infection, the foetuses were examined for pathological changes and for the presence of BTV. BTV-8 could be demonstrated in 12 foetuses (43%) from 5 ewes (56%). %). BTV-1 was detected in 14 foetuses (82%) from 6 ewes (67%). Pathological changes were mainly found in the central nervous system. In the BTV-8 group, lympho-histiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and slight vacuolation of the neuropil were found. BTV-1 infection induced a severe necrotizing encephalopathy and severe meningitis, with macroscopic hydranencephaly or porencephaly in 8 foetuses. In our experimental setting, using low passaged virus strains, BTV-1 was able to induce transplacental transmission to a higher incidence compared to BTV-8, causing more severe pathology."

This study is also the first report of transcriptional co-regulation existing between two subunits of the multisubunit enzyme complex, GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT), involved in the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis in eukaryotes. Using mutational analysis, we show that the accessory subunits, GPI2 and GPI19, of GPI-GnT exhibit opposite effects on ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling (which determines hyphal morphogenesis). This is because the two subunits negatively regulate one another; GPI19 mutants show up-regulation of GPI2, whereas GPI2 mutants show up-regulation of GPI19. Two different models were examined as follows. First, the two GPI-GnT subunits independently interact with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling. Second, the two subunits mutually regulate one another and thereby regulate sterol levels and Ras signaling. Analysis of double mutants of these subunits indicates that GPI19 controls ergosterol biosynthesis through ERG11 levels, whereas GPI2 determines the filamentation by cross-talk with Ras1 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1966077257,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprise a powerful tool for mapping genes of complex traits. However, an inflation of the test statistic can occur because of population substructure or cryptic relatedness, which could cause spurious associations. If information on a large number of genetic markers is available, adjusting the analysis results by using the method of genomic control (GC) is possible. GC was originally proposed to correct the Cochran-Armitage additive trend test. For non-additive models, correction has been shown to depend on allele frequencies. Therefore, usage of GC is limited to situations where allele frequencies of null markers and candidate markers are matched. In this work, we extended the capabilities of the GC method for non-additive models, which allows us to use null markers with arbitrary allele frequencies for GC. Analytical expressions for the inflation of a test statistic describing its dependency on allele frequency and several population parameters were obtained for recessive, dominant, and over-dominant models of inheritance. We proposed a method to estimate these required population parameters. Furthermore, we suggested a GC method based on approximation of the correction coefficient by a polynomial of allele frequency and described procedures to correct the genotypic (two degrees of freedom) test for cases when the model of inheritance is unknown. Statistical properties of the described methods were investigated using simulated and real data. We demonstrated that all considered methods were effective in controlling type 1 error in the presence of genetic substructure. The proposed GC methods can be applied to statistical tests for GWAS with various models of inheritance. All methods developed and tested in this work were implemented using R language as a part of the GenABEL package."

For a better understanding of primordial protein evolution, we synthesized an artificial protein on the basis of an evolutionary hypothesis, segment-based elongation starting from an autonomously foldable short peptide. A 10-residue protein, chignolin, the smallest foldable polypeptide ever reported, was used as a structural support to facilitate higher structural organization and gain-of-function in the development of an artificial protein. Repetitive cycles of segment elongation and subsequent phage display selection successfully produced a 25-residue protein, termed AF.2A1, with nanomolar affinity against the Fc region of immunoglobulin G. AF.2A1 shows exquisite molecular recognition ability such that it can distinguish conformational differences of the same molecule. The structure determined by NMR measurements demonstrated that AF.2A1 forms a globular protein-like conformation with the chignolin-derived β-hairpin and a tryptophan-mediated hydrophobic core. Using sequence analysis and a mutation study, we discovered that the structural organization and gain-of-function emerged from the vicinity of the chignolin segment, revealing that the structural support served as the core in both structural and functional development. Here, we propose an evolutionary model for primordial proteins in which a foldable segment serves as the evolving core to facilitate structural and functional evolution. This study provides insights into primordial protein evolution and also presents a novel methodology for designing small sized proteins useful for industrial and pharmaceutical applications."

Using affinity precipitation to monitor GEF activity, we found that GEF-H1 was activated in glomeruli isolated from rats with PHN. Complement C5b-9 also induced parallel activation of GEF-H1 and RhoA in cultured GEC. In GEC in which GEF-H1 was knocked down, both basal and complement-induced RhoA activity was reduced. On the other hand, GEF-H1 knockdown augmented complement-mediated cytolysis, suggesting a role for GEF-H1 and RhoA in protecting GEC from cell death.

The glomerulus is the filtration unit of the kidney where the first step of urine formation occurs. It filters water and small solutes, such as waste products, while retaining large proteins essential for body function, such as albumin. When this barrier function is impaired, protein leakage into the urine (proteinuria) occurs. Proteinuria is not only a marker of glomerular injury but also a prognostic predictor in that heavier proteinuria correlates with a higher risk of kidney failure.

Turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Although this fact reflects the complex context-specific modes of Rho activation, the mechanisms of GEF regulation remain poorly characterized (12.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go. Turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). GEF-H1 (ArhGEF2, also referred to as Lfc in mice) is a GEF that has been implicated in both RhoA and Rac activation induced by various stimuli in epithelia, including renal tubular cells (13.Terry S.J. Zihni C. Elbediwy A. Vitiello E. Leefa Chong San I.V. Balda M.S. Matter K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It was initially described as an exchange factor for RhoA and Rac, although its role as a Rho exchange factor is much better characterized (15.Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H.

Previous studies have shown an important role of GEF-H1 in the regulation of paracellular permeability in epithelial and endothelial cells (14.Benais-Pont G. Punn A. Flores-Maldonado C. Eckert J.

GEF-H1 was also shown to mediate RhoA and Rho kinase activation upon Ca2+ removal, leading to the disassembly of the apical junctional complexes (18.Samarin S.N. Ivanov A.I. Flatau G. Parkos C.A. Nusrat A. Rho/Rho-associated kinase-II signaling mediates disassembly of epithelial apical junctions.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3429-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In tubular epithelial cells, GEF-H1 is also stimulated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and mediates RhoA activation and increased paracellular permeability (19.Kakiashvili E. Speight P. Waheed F.

GEF-H1 may thus play a pathological role in the disruption of junctional complexes and epithelial cell barrier. We have previously reported that complement activates RhoA in GEC in vitro and in vivo (20.Zhang H. Cybulsky A.V. Aoudjit L. Zhu J. Li H. Lamarche-Vane N. Takano T.

Salant D.J. Anti-Fx1A produces complement-dependent cytotoxicity of glomerular epithelial cells.Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 43-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, a subclone of GEC that grows on plastic was cultured in K1 medium (50% DMEM, 50% Ham/F-12, 10% Nu Serum, hormone supplements), and experiments were carried out between passages 10 and 70. Hormone supplements gave the final concentrations of insulin (5 μg/ml), prostaglandin E1 (25 ng/ml), triiodothyronine (0.325 ng/ml), Na2SeO3 (1.73 ng/ml), apotransferrin (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (18.12 ng/ml). GEC were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 μg/35-mm plate of plasmids (GFP-GEF-H1-WT or GFP-GEF-H1-T678A) and a 1:2 ratio of the plasmid and Lipofectamine 2000). Conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte culture and characteristics have been described (27.Mundel P. Kriz W. Cell culture of podocytes.Exp. Nephrol. 1996; 4: 263-266PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Shankland S.J. Pippin J.W. Reiser J. Mundel P. Podocytes in culture. Past, present, and future.Kidney Int. 2007; 72: 26-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, undifferentiated mouse podocytes were cultured at 33 °C in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 units of IFN-γ/ml. Complement stimulation of GEC was described previously (25.Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Complement C5b-9 activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 in glomerular epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F739-F749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Quigg R.J. Cybulsky A.V. Jacobs J.B. Salant D.J. Anti-Fx1A produces complement-dependent cytotoxicity of glomerular epithelial cells.Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 43-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, GEC were incubated with anti-GEC antiserum or sheep anti-Fx1A antiserum (5% v/v) for 40 min at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C with normal human serum (NS) to assemble C5b-9 or with decomplemented, heat-inactivated serum (HIS; 56 °C, 1 h) for control for the indicated times. The concentration of NS was 2.5% unless specified otherwise. The anti-GEC antiserum also cross-reacts to mouse podocytes and was used to stimulate mouse podocytes with complement. In some experiments, antibody-sensitized GEC were incubated with C8-deficient serum (C8D; 1.5% (v/v)) with or without reconstitution with purified C8 (2 μg/ml in undiluted serum). PHN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g, Charles River Canada, Saint-Constant, Canada) by a single intravenous injection of sheep anti-Fx1A antiserum (400 μl/rat) as described previously (29.Takano T. Cybulsky A.V. Cupples W.A. Ajikobi D.O. Papillon J. Aoudjit L. Inhibition of cyclooxygenases reduces complement-induced glomerular epithelial cell injury and proteinuria in passive Heymann nephritis.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fourteen days postinjection, urine was collected in metabolic cages overnight, and urine protein was quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Rats were then sacrificed, and glomeruli were collected by differential sieving (30.Takano T. Cybulsky A.V. Complement C5b-9-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism in glomerular epithelial cells. Role of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2.Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2091-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All studies were approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee. Cultured GEC or isolated glomeruli were washed once and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet). After insoluble components were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), protein concentration was determined using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with either 5% BSA or skim milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were then detected by ECL. X-ray films were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using the ImageJ software. The following antibody dilutions were used: rabbit anti-GEF-H1 (1:1000), mouse anti-tubulin (1:100,000), mouse anti-RhoA (1:1000), mouse anti-pERK (1:2000), mouse anti-ERK1/2 (1:2000), mouse anti-p-MLC (1:1000), anti-mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000). GST-G17A-RhoA, a mutant with high affinity for activated GEFs, was described previously (31.García-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Analysis of activated GAPs and GEFs in cell lysates.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described previously (32.Waheed F. Speight P. Dan Q. Garcia-Mata R. Szaszi K. Affinity precipitation of active Rho-GEFs using a GST-tagged mutant Rho protein (GST-RhoA(G17A)) from epithelial cell lysates.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; (10.3791/3932)Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, treated cells or glomeruli were lysed in lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein (200–900 μg) were incubated with purified GST-G17A-RhoA (15–20 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads and protein were washed three times with lysis buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and imunoblotting. X-ray films were scanned, and band intensities were quantified by ImageJ. Active GEF-H1 was normalized to total GEF-H1. GEC were plated on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp, Ashland, MA) and transfected with 0.5 μg of FRET Raichu1298x probe (pCFP-RBD-pYFP). FRET measurement was carried out 48 h after the transfection following overnight serum starvation using an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus). After incubation with anti-GEC antiserum at room temperature for 40 min, cells were placed in the microscope chamber. The medium containing the antiserum was removed, and the medium prewarmed at 37 °C was added. After a baseline image was obtained, prewarmed medium containing NS or HIS (for control) was added to the cells to reach a final concentration of 2.5% (v/v), and images were acquired at the indicated times. The biosensors using CFP and YFP as the donor and acceptor, respectively, were excited at a wavelength of 440 nm, and images were taken for CFP and YFP. Corrected FRET (cFRET) intensity was calculated at each pixel using Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the following formula: (raw FRET − background)/(CFP − background). cFRET was converted to pseudocolor pixel-to-pixel. The optical filters used for the dual emission imaging were as follows: an XF1071 (440AF21) excitation filter, an XF2034 (455DRLP) dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (XF3075 (480AF30) for CFP and XF3079 (535AF26) for YFP/FRET). Procedures were carried out at room temperature. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 3% BSA in PBS for 20 min. α-Tubulin was stained with mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:4000) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were captured using an AxioObserver-100 microscope (Zeiss). For the subcellular localization study of GEF-H1, images of the cells transfected with GFP-GEF-H1 were analyzed by ImageJ in a blinded manner. A line was drawn from the nuclear membrane to the plasma membrane, and the average GFP fluorescence intensity of the first 5 pixels (perinuclear) was divided by the average of the last 5 pixels (periphery), and the ratio was used as a marker of perinuclear accumulation. Three measurements were averaged per cell, and at least 10 cells were quantified per condition per experiment. Experiments were repeated three times. Cross-sectional areas of a cell (cell size) were quantified by the ImageJ software by tracing the cell contour manually. RhoA activity was determined using the RhoA G-LISA activation assay in the colorimetric format (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, treated cells were lysed on ice, cleared by centrifugation, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prior to the assay, lysates were thawed, and protein concentration was adjusted to 2 μg/μl. Equal amounts of lysates were added to the Rho-GTP affinity plate and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washes, each well was incubated with anti-RhoA antibody for 45 min and then with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 45 min. After washes, buffer containing a substrate was added, and the absorbance at 490 nm was quantified using a microplate spectrophotometer (ELx808IU, BioTek Instruments). The input lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting to ensure that the same amounts of total RhoA were contained in the lysates. Lentiviral particles were produced according to the manufacturer's protocol (Addgene). Briefly, low passage HEK293T cells were transfected with pLKO.1-TRC plasmid (control) or GEF-H1 shRNA plasmid, the packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the envelope plasmid pMDG.2 at a ratio of 4:3:1 with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. The medium was replaced with fresh medium 18 h after transfection, and viral particles contained in the media were collected twice at 24-h intervals. Infection of the target cells with lentiviral particles was used at a multiplicity of infection of 5. GEC-pl cells were exposed to lentivirus encoding GEF-H1 shRNA for 24 h in cell culture medium. Parallel infection with pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector was used as control. All experiments were performed at 48 h after the virus induction was started. Complement-induced cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase release as described previously (33.Aoudjit L. Stanciu M. Li H. Lemay S. Takano T. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase protects glomerular epithelial cells from complement-mediated cell injury.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F765-F774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specific release of lactate dehydrogenase was calculated using the formula, (NS − HIS)/(100 − HIS) × 100, where NS and HIS represent the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase release with NS and HIS, respectively. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The t statistic was used to determine significant difference between two groups. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant difference in multiple measurements among groups. We reported previously that RhoA is activated in the glomerulus from rats with PHN (20.Zhang H. Cybulsky A.V. Aoudjit L. Zhu J. Li H. Lamarche-Vane N. Takano T. Role of Rho-GTPases in complement-mediated glomerular epithelial cell injury.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F148-F156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In PHN, antibody targeted at GEC triggers the assembly of complement C5b-9 on the cell surface, and this leads to GEC injury, morphological changes, and proteinuria (20.Zhang H. Cybulsky A.V. Aoudjit L. Zhu J. Li H. Lamarche-Vane N. Takano T. Role of Rho-GTPases in complement-mediated glomerular epithelial cell injury.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F148-F156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To address the mechanisms involved in RhoA activation, we studied whether the Rho exchange factor GEF-H1 is activated in PHN. Active GEF-H1 in glomeruli was detected using affinity precipitation with GST-G17A-RhoA. The G17A mutant of RhoA represents a nucleotide-free form of RhoA that has a high affinity to active GEFs, and therefore the amount of a particular GEF binding to GST-G17A-RhoA reflects the amount of activated form of the GEF (31.García-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Elle"
https://openalex.org/W1968535358,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin/hemolysin (VCC) is an amphipathic 65-kDa β-pore-forming toxin with a C-terminal β-prism lectin domain. Because deletion or point mutation of the lectin domain seriously compromises hemolytic activity, it is thought that carbohydrate-dependent interactions play a critical role in membrane targeting of VCC. To delineate the contributions of the cytolysin and lectin domains in pore formation, we used wild-type VCC, 50-kDa VCC (VCC(50)) without the lectin domain, and mutant VCC(D617A) with no carbohydrate-binding activity. VCC and its two variants with no carbohydrate-binding activity moved to the erythrocyte stroma with apparent association constants on the order of 10(7) M(-1). However, loss of the lectin domain severely reduced the efficiency of self-association of the VCC monomer with the β-barrel heptamer in the synthetic lipid bilayer from ∼83 to 27%. Notably, inactivation of the carbohydrate-binding activity by the D617A mutation marginally reduced oligomerization to ∼77%. Oligomerization of VCC(50) was temperature-insensitive; by contrast, VCC self-assembly increased with increasing temperature, suggesting that the process is driven by entropy and opposed by enthalpy. Asialofetuin, the β1-galactosyl-terminated glycoprotein inhibitor of VCC-induced hemolysis, promoted oligomerization of 65-kDa VCC to a species that resembled the membrane-inserted heptamer in stoichiometry and morphology but had reduced global amphipathicity. In conclusion, we propose (i) that the β-prism lectin domain facilitated toxin assembly by producing entropy during relocation in the heptamer and (ii) that glycoconjugates inhibited VCC by promoting its assembly to a water-soluble, less amphipathic oligomer variant with reduced ability to penetrate the bilayer."

https://openalex.org/W2069942074,"We deal here with the issue of complex network evolution. The analysis of topological evolution of complex networks plays a crucial role in predicting their future. While an impressive amount of work has been done on the issue, very little attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of how information theory quantifiers can be applied to characterize networks evolution. With the objective of dynamically capture the topological changes of a network's evolution, we propose a model able to quantify and reproduce several characteristics of a given network, by using the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence in combination with the mean degree and the clustering coefficient. To support our hypothesis, we test the model by copying the evolution of well-known models and real systems. The results show that the methodology was able to mimic the test-networks. By using this copycat model, the user is able to analyze the networks behavior over time, and also to conjecture about the main drivers of its evolution, also providing a framework to predict its evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2024699605,"Background Because the characteristics of blast waves in water are different from those in air and because kinetic energy is liberated by a pressure wave at the water-air interface, thoracic injuries from mine blasts in shoals may be serious. The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of cardiopulmonary injury caused by mine blasts in shoals. Methods To study the characteristics of cardiopulmonary injury, 56 animals were divided randomly into three experimental groups (12 animals in the sham group, 22 animals in the land group and 22 animals in the shoal group). To examine the biomechanics of injury, 20 animals were divided randomly into the land group and the shoal group. In the experimental model, the water surface was at the level of the rabbit's xiphoid process, and paper electric detonators (600 mg RDX) were used to simulate mines. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were conducted, and arterial blood gases, serum levels of cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase-MB and other physiologic parameters were measured over a 12-hour period after detonation. Pressures in the thorax and abdomen and the acceleration of the thorax were measured. Conclusion The results indicate that severe cardiopulmonary injury and dysfunction occur following exposure to mine blasts in shoals. Therefore, the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary injury may result from shear waves that produce strain at the water-air interface. Another mechanism of injury includes the propagation of the shock wave from the planta to the thorax, which causes a much higher peak overpressure in the abdomen than in the thorax; as a result, the abdominal organs and diaphragm are thrust into the thorax, damaging the lungs and heart."
