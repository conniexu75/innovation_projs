https://openalex.org/W2153118028,"Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10−8, including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research."
https://openalex.org/W1992910467,"In the mammalian cerebral cortex the diversity of interneuronal subtypes underlies a division of labour subserving distinct modes of inhibitory control1,2,3,4,5,6,7. A unique mode of inhibitory control may be provided by inhibitory neurons that specifically suppress the firing of other inhibitory neurons. Such disinhibition could lead to the selective amplification of local processing and serve the important computational functions of gating and gain modulation8,9. Although several interneuron populations are known to target other interneurons to varying degrees10,11,12,13,14,15, little is known about interneurons specializing in disinhibition and their in vivo function. Here we show that a class of interneurons that express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory control in multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by reinforcement signals. By combining optogenetic activation with single-cell recordings, we examined the functional role of VIP interneurons in awake mice, and investigated the underlying circuit mechanisms in vitro in auditory and medial prefrontal cortices. We identified a basic disinhibitory circuit module in which activation of VIP interneurons transiently suppresses primarily somatostatin- and a fraction of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that specialize in the control of the input and output of principal cells, respectively3,6,16,17. During the performance of an auditory discrimination task, reinforcement signals (reward and punishment) strongly and uniformly activated VIP neurons in auditory cortex, and in turn VIP recruitment increased the gain of a functional subpopulation of principal neurons. These results reveal a specific cell type and microcircuit underlying disinhibitory control in cortex and demonstrate that it is activated under specific behavioural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2163969089,"Triglycerides are transported in plasma by specific triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; in epidemiological studies, increased triglyceride levels correlate with higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P < 5 × 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2074627137,"Amines at typical atmospheric concentrations of a only few molecules per trillion air molecules combine with sulphuric acid to form highly stable aerosol particles at rates similar to those observed in the lower atmosphere. Amines emitted into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources are thought to enhance nucleation from trace atmospheric vapours, stimulate particle formation and influence the development and properties of clouds. Direct evidence for this under atmospheric conditions has been lacking; however, this study, using the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN, demonstrates that amines at atmospherically relevant concentrations can sufficiently increase nucleation rates to be able to account for the particle formation rates observed in the atmospheric environment. Nucleation of aerosol particles from trace atmospheric vapours is thought to provide up to half of global cloud condensation nuclei1. Aerosols can cause a net cooling of climate by scattering sunlight and by leading to smaller but more numerous cloud droplets, which makes clouds brighter and extends their lifetimes2. Atmospheric aerosols derived from human activities are thought to have compensated for a large fraction of the warming caused by greenhouse gases2. However, despite its importance for climate, atmospheric nucleation is poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that sulphuric acid and ammonia cannot explain particle formation rates observed in the lower atmosphere3. It is thought that amines may enhance nucleation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, but until now there has been no direct evidence for amine ternary nucleation under atmospheric conditions. Here we use the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN and find that dimethylamine above three parts per trillion by volume can enhance particle formation rates more than 1,000-fold compared with ammonia, sufficient to account for the particle formation rates observed in the atmosphere. Molecular analysis of the clusters reveals that the faster nucleation is explained by a base-stabilization mechanism involving acid–amine pairs, which strongly decrease evaporation. The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high stability of sulphuric acid–dimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low overall formation rates. Our experimental measurements are well reproduced by a dynamical model based on quantum chemical calculations of binding energies of molecular clusters, without any fitted parameters. These results show that, in regions of the atmosphere near amine sources, both amines and sulphur dioxide should be considered when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on particle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2042662796,"The influence of motor activity on sensory processing is crucial for perception and motor execution. However, the underlying circuits are not known. To unravel the circuit by which activity in the primary vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) modulates sensory processing in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), we used optogenetics to examine the long-range inputs from vM1 to the various neuronal elements in S1. We found that S1-projecting vM1 pyramidal neurons strongly recruited vasointestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, a subset of serotonin receptor-expressing interneurons. These VIP interneurons preferentially inhibited somatostatin-expressing interneurons, neurons that target the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells. Consistent with this vM1-mediated disinhibitory circuit, the activity of VIP interneurons in vivo increased and that of somatostatin interneurons decreased during whisking. These changes in firing rates during whisking depended on vM1 activity. Our results suggest previously unknown circuitry by which inputs from motor cortex influence sensory processing in sensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2057102103,"Kathy Sivils and colleagues report results of a large-scale association study of Sjögren's syndrome, a common autoimmune disease. They confirm strong associations with the HLA region and establish genome-wide significant associations at several non-HLA loci implicated in both innate and adaptive immunity. Sjögren's syndrome is a common autoimmune disease (affecting ∼0.7% of European Americans) that typically presents as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Here we report results of a large-scale association study of Sjögren's syndrome. In addition to strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21 (Pmeta = 7.65 × 10−114), we establish associations with IRF5-TNPO3 (Pmeta = 2.73 × 10−19), STAT4 (Pmeta = 6.80 × 10−15), IL12A (Pmeta = 1.17 × 10−10), FAM167A-BLK (Pmeta = 4.97 × 10−10), DDX6-CXCR5 (Pmeta = 1.10 × 10−8) and TNIP1 (Pmeta = 3.30 × 10−8). We also observed suggestive associations (Pmeta < 5 × 10−5) with variants in 29 other regions, including TNFAIP3, PTTG1, PRDM1, DGKQ, FCGR2A, IRAK1BP1, ITSN2 and PHIP, among others. These results highlight the importance of genes that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity in Sjögren's syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1973725190,"Stem-cell niches in mammalian tissues are often heterogeneous and compartmentalized; however, whether distinct niche locations determine different stem-cell fates remains unclear. To test this hypothesis, here we use the mouse hair follicle niche and combine intravital microscopy with genetic lineage tracing to re-visit the same stem-cell lineages, from their exact place of origin, throughout regeneration in live mice. Using this method, we show directly that the position of a stem cell within the hair follicle niche can predict whether it is likely to remain uncommitted, generate precursors or commit to a differentiated fate. Furthermore, using laser ablation we demonstrate that hair follicle stem cells are dispensable for regeneration, and that epithelial cells, which do not normally participate in hair growth, re-populate the lost stem-cell compartment and sustain hair regeneration. This study provides a general model for niche-induced fate determination in adult tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2139347614,"Cellular stress results in the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules that promote inflammatory responses. Here Ping Wang and colleagues show that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is a DAMP that is released into the circulation in response to hemorrhagic shock and sepsis. It promotes proinflammatory cytokine release by binding to the TLR4-MD2 complex. Blockade of CIRP reduces inflammation, organ injury and mortality in animal models of hemorrhage and sepsis, suggesting that CIRP may be targeted therapeutically in these conditions. A systemic inflammatory response is observed in patients undergoing hemorrhagic shock and sepsis. Here we report increased levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in the blood of individuals admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with hemorrhagic shock. In animal models of hemorrhage and sepsis, CIRP is upregulated in the heart and liver and released into the circulation. In macrophages under hypoxic stress, CIRP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol and is released. Recombinant CIRP stimulates the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and HMGB1 from macrophages and induces inflammatory responses and causes tissue injury when injected in vivo. Hemorrhage-induced TNF-α and HMGB1 release and lethality were reduced in CIRP-deficient mice. Blockade of CIRP using antisera to CIRP attenuated inflammatory cytokine release and mortality after hemorrhage and sepsis. The activity of extracellular CIRP is mediated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that CIRP binds to the TLR4-MD2 complex, as well as to TLR4 and MD2 individually. In particular, human CIRP amino acid residues 106–125 bind to MD2 with high affinity. Thus, CIRP is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that promotes inflammatory responses in shock and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2004284432,"The K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2 is responsible for maintaining low Cl(-) concentration in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), which is essential for postsynaptic inhibition through GABA(A) and glycine receptors. Although no CNS disorders have been associated with KCC2 mutations, loss of activity of this transporter has emerged as a key mechanism underlying several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, motor spasticity, stress, anxiety, schizophrenia, morphine-induced hyperalgesia and chronic pain. Recent reports indicate that enhancing KCC2 activity may be the favored therapeutic strategy to restore inhibition and normal function in pathological conditions involving impaired Cl(-) transport. We designed an assay for high-throughput screening that led to the identification of KCC2 activators that reduce intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl(-)]i). Optimization of a first-in-class arylmethylidine family of compounds resulted in a KCC2-selective analog (CLP257) that lowers [Cl(-)]i. CLP257 restored impaired Cl(-) transport in neurons with diminished KCC2 activity. The compound rescued KCC2 plasma membrane expression, renormalized stimulus-evoked responses in spinal nociceptive pathways sensitized after nerve injury and alleviated hypersensitivity in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Oral efficacy for analgesia equivalent to that of pregabalin but without motor impairment was achievable with a CLP257 prodrug. These results validate KCC2 as a druggable target for CNS diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2138657570,"ABCA1, ABCA7, and ABCA4 are members of the ABCA subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters that share extensive sequence and structural similarity. Mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier disease characterized by defective cholesterol homeostasis and high density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency. Mutations in ABCA4 are responsible for Stargardt disease, a degenerative disorder associated with severe loss in central vision. Although cell-based studies have implicated ABCA proteins in lipid transport, the substrates and direction of transport have not been firmly established. We have purified and reconstituted ABCA1, ABCA7, and ABCA4 into liposomes for fluorescent-lipid transport studies. ABCA1 actively exported or flipped phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin from the cytoplasmic to the exocytoplasmic leaflet of membranes, whereas ABCA7 preferentially exported phosphatidylserine. In contrast, ABCA4 transported phosphatidylethanolamine in the reverse direction. The same phospholipids stimulated the ATPase activity of these ABCA transporters. The transport and ATPase activities of ABCA1 and ABCA4 were reduced by 25% in the presence of 20% cholesterol. Nine ABCA1 Tangier mutants and the corresponding ABCA4 Stargardt mutants showed significantly reduced phospholipid transport activity and subcellular mislocalization. These studies provide the first direct evidence for ABCA1 and ABCA7 functioning as phospholipid transporters and suggest that this activity is an essential step in the loading of apoA-1 with phospholipids for HDL formation."

https://openalex.org/W2020231706,"Genome sequencing can identify individuals in the general population who harbor rare coding variants in genes for Mendelian disorders and who may consequently have increased disease risk. Previous studies of rare variants in phenotypically extreme individuals display ascertainment bias and may demonstrate inflated effect-size estimates. We sequenced seven genes for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in well-phenotyped population samples (n = 4,003). We filtered rare variants according to two prediction criteria for disease-causing mutations: reported previously in MODY or satisfying stringent de novo thresholds (rare, conserved and protein damaging). Approximately 1.5% and 0.5% of randomly selected individuals from the Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, respectively, carry variants from these two classes. However, the vast majority of carriers remain euglycemic through middle age. Accurate estimates of variant effect sizes from population-based sequencing are needed to avoid falsely predicting a substantial fraction of individuals as being at risk for MODY or other Mendelian diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1986171309,"Forebrain circuits rely upon a relatively small but remarkably diverse population of GABAergic interneurons to bind and entrain large principal cell assemblies for network synchronization and rhythmogenesis. Despite the high degree of heterogeneity across cortical interneurons, members of a given subtype typically exhibit homogeneous developmental origins, neuromodulatory response profiles, morphological characteristics, neurochemical signatures and electrical features. Here we report a surprising divergence among hippocampal oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) projecting interneurons that have hitherto been considered a homogeneous cell population. Combined immunocytochemical, anatomical and electrophysiological interrogation of Htr3a-GFP and Nkx2-1-cre:RCE mice revealed that O-LM cells parse into a caudal ganglionic eminence-derived subpopulation expressing 5-HT(3A) receptors (5-HT(3A)Rs) and a medial ganglionic eminence-derived subpopulation lacking 5-HT(3A)Rs. These two cohorts differentially participate in network oscillations, with 5-HT(3A)R-containing O-LM cell recruitment dictated by serotonergic tone. Thus, members of a seemingly uniform interneuron population can exhibit unique circuit functions and neuromodulatory properties dictated by disparate developmental origins."
https://openalex.org/W1993551950,"Adipogenesis is tightly regulated by altering gene expression, and TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in regulating lipogenesis. MicroRNAs are strong post-transcriptional regulators of cell differentiation. In our previous work, we found high expression of miR-181a in a fat-rich pig breed. Using bioinformatic analysis, miR-181a was identified as a potential regulator of TNF-α. Here, we validated TNF-α as the target of miR-181a by a dual luciferase assay. In response to adipogenesis, a mimic or inhibitor was used to overexpress or reduce miR-181a expression in porcine pre-adipocytes, which were then induced into mature adipocytes. Overexpression of miR-181a accelerated accumulation of lipid droplets, increased the amount of triglycerides, and repressed TNF-α protein expression, while the inhibitor had the opposite effect. At the same time, TNF-alpha rescued the increased lipogenesis by miR181a mimics. Additionally, miR-181a suppression decreased the expression of fatty synthesis associated genes PDE3B (phosphodiesterase 3B), LPL (lipoprotein lipase), PPARγ (proliferator-activated receptor-γ), GLUT1 (glucose transporter), GLUT4, adiponectin and FASN (fatty acid synthase), as well as key lipolytic genes HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) and ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our study provides the first evidence of the role of miR-181a in adipocyte differentiation by regulation of TNF-α, which may became a new therapeutic target for anti-obesity drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2008880132,"In most eukaryotic cells microtubules undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation of α-tubulin on lysine 40, a widespread modification restricted to a subset of microtubules that turns over slowly. This subset of stable microtubules accumulates in cell protrusions and regulates cell polarization, migration and invasion. However, mechanisms restricting acetylation to these microtubules are unknown. Here we report that clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) control microtubule acetylation through a direct interaction of the α-tubulin acetyltransferase αTAT1 (refs 8, 9) with the clathrin adaptor AP2. We observe that about one-third of growing microtubule ends contact and pause at CCPs and that loss of CCPs decreases lysine 40 acetylation levels. We show that αTAT1 localizes to CCPs through a direct interaction with AP2 that is required for microtubule acetylation. In migrating cells, the polarized orientation of acetylated microtubules correlates with CCP accumulation at the leading edge, and interaction of αTAT1 with AP2 is required for directional migration. We conclude that microtubules contacting CCPs become acetylated by αTAT1. In migrating cells, this mechanism ensures the acetylation of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge, thus promoting directional cell locomotion and chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2026840718,"The origin and functional importance of noise in mammalian cones is poorly understood. Here, the authors find that channel noise and fluctuations in cGMP dominate cone noise, that adaptation in cones affects signal and noise differently, and that cones generate less noise than previously thought. These results help reconcile cone noise and behavioral sensitivity. Noise in the responses of cone photoreceptors sets a fundamental limit on visual sensitivity, yet the origin of noise in mammalian cones and its relation to behavioral sensitivity are poorly understood. Our work here on primate cones improves understanding of these issues in three ways. First, we found that cone noise was not dominated by spontaneous photopigment activation or by quantal fluctuations in photon absorption, but was instead dominated by other sources, namely channel noise and fluctuations in cyclic GMP. Second, adaptation in cones, unlike that in rods, affected signal and noise differently. This difference helps to explain why thresholds for rod- and cone-mediated signals have different dependencies on background light level. Third, past estimates of noise in mammalian cones are too high to explain behavioral sensitivity. Our measurements indicate a lower level of cone noise and therefore help to reconcile physiological and behavioral estimates of cone noise and sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2125546594,"Bone turnover in vivo is regulated by mechanical forces such as shear stress originating from interstitial oscillatory fluid flow (OFF), and bone cells in vitro respond to mechanical loading. However, the mechanisms by which bone cells sense mechanical forces, resulting in increased mineral deposition, are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the primary cilium in mechanosensing by osteoblasts. MLO-A5 murine osteoblasts were cultured in monolayer and subjected to two different OFF regimens: 5 short (2 h daily) bouts of OFF followed by morphological analysis of primary cilia; or exposure to chloral hydrate to damage or remove primary cilia and 2 short bouts (2 h on consecutive days) of OFF. Primary cilia were shorter and there were fewer cilia per cell after exposure to periods of OFF compared with static controls. Damage or removal of primary cilia inhibited OFF-induced PGE2 release into the medium and mineral deposition, assayed by Alizarin red staining. We conclude that primary cilia are important mediators of OFF-induced mineral deposition, which has relevance for the design of bone tissue engineering strategies and may inform clinical treatments of bone disorders causes by load-deficiency.—Delaine-Smith, R.

https://openalex.org/W2160631413,"Plants are exposed to continuous changes in light quality and quantity that challenge the performance of the photosynthetic apparatus and have evolved a series of mechanisms to face this challenge. In this work, we have studied state transitions, the process that redistributes the excitation pressure between photosystems I and II (PSI/PSII) by the reversible association of LHCII, the major antenna complex of higher plants, with either one of them upon phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. By combining biochemical analysis and electron microscopy, we have studied the effect of state transitions on the composition and organization of photosystem II in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two LHCII trimers (called trimers M and S) are part of the PSII supercomplex, whereas up to two more are loosely associated with PSII in state 1 in higher plants (called “extra” trimers). Here, we show that the LHCII from the extra pool migrates to PSI in state 2, thus leaving the PSII supercomplex and the semicrystalline PSII arrays intact. In state 2, not only is the mobile LHCII phosphorylated, but also the LHCII in the PSII supercomplexes. This demonstrates that PSII phosphorylation is not sufficient for disconnecting LHCII trimers S and M from PSII and for their migration to PSI.

https://openalex.org/W2033865882,"Thrombin is a potent platelet agonist that activates platelets and other cells of the cardiovascular system by cleaving its G-protein-coupled receptors, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), PAR4, or both. We now show that cleaving PAR1 and PAR4 with α-thrombin induces heterodimer formation. PAR1-PAR4 heterodimers were not detected when unstimulated; however, when the cells were stimulated with 10 nm α-thrombin, we were able to detect a strong interaction between PAR1 and PAR4 by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. In contrast, activating the receptors without cleavage using PAR1 and PAR4 agonist peptides (TFLLRN and AYPGKF, respectively) did not enhance heterodimer formation. Preventing PAR1 or PAR4 cleavage with point mutations or hirugen also prevented the induction of heterodimers. To further characterize the PAR1-PAR4 interactions, we mapped the heterodimer interface by introducing point mutations in transmembrane helix 4 of PAR1 or PAR4 that prevented heterodimer formation. Finally, we show that mutations in PAR1 or PAR4 at the heterodimer interface prevented PAR1-assisted cleavage of PAR4. These data demonstrate that PAR1 and PAR4 require allosteric changes induced via receptor cleavage by α-thrombin to mediate heterodimer formation, and we have determined the PAR1-PAR4 heterodimer interface. Our findings show that PAR1 and PAR4 have dynamic interactions on the cell surface that should be taken into account when developing and characterizing PAR antagonists."

Recent investigations revealed that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA), resulting in steroid-resistant neutrophilic airway inflammation. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and anti-apoptosis functions. However, its role in NEA is still unclear. Here, we explore the role of HO-1 in a mouse model of NEA. HO-1 inducer hemin or HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin IX was injected intraperitoneally into ovalbumin-challenged DO11.10 mice. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered into mice to knock down HO-1 expression. The results show that induction of HO-1 by hemin attenuated airway inflammation and decreased neutrophil infiltration in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and was accompanied by a lower proportion of Th17 cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen. More importantly, induction of HO-1 down-regulated Th17-related transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) expression and decreased IL-17A levels, all of which correlated with a decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) level and inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. Consistently, the above events could be reversed by tin protoporphyrin IX. Also, HO-1 siRNA transfection abolished the effect of hemin induced HO-1 in vivo. Meanwhile, the hemin treatment promoted the level of Foxp3 expression and enhanced the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Collectively, our findings indicate that HO-1 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse model of NEA via inhibition of the p-STAT3-RORγt pathway, regulating kinetics of RORγt and Foxp3 expression, thus providing a possible novel therapeutic target in asthmatic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2102534628,"Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human CD4--a key receptor for HIV--and blocks HIV-1 infection. However, HIV-1 strains with mutations resulting in loss of an N-linked glycan from the V5 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 are resistant to ibalizumab. Previous structural analysis suggests that this glycan fills a void between the gp120 V5 loop and the ibalizumab light chain, perhaps causing steric hindrance that disrupts viral entry. If this void contributes to HIV-1 resistance to ibalizumab, we reasoned that 'refilling' it by engineering an N-linked glycan into the ibalizumab light chain at a position spatially proximal to gp120 V5 may restore susceptibility to ibalizumab. Indeed, one such ibalizumab variant neutralized 100% of 118 diverse HIV-1 strains tested in vitro, including 10 strains resistant to parental ibalizumab. These findings demonstrate that the strategic placement of a glycan in the variable region of a monoclonal antibody can substantially enhance its activity."

Therefore, we compared IP3R expression and function between mesenteric arteries of normotensive and hypertensive animals. Levels of IP3R transcript and protein were significantly increased in mesenteric arteries of hypertensive animals, and pharmacological inhibition of the IP3R revealed a higher contribution of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release to vascular contraction in these arteries. Subsequently, we established cultured aortic VSM A7r5 cells as a cellular model that replicates IP3R up-regulation during hypertension by depolarizing the VSM cell membrane. IP3R up-regulation requires Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, followed by activation of the calcineurin-NFAT axis, resulting in IP3R transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2010337329,"Continued proliferation of human cells requires maintenance of telomere length, usually accomplished by telomerase. Telomerase is recruited to chromosome ends by interaction with a patch of amino acids (the TEL patch, for TPP1 glutamate (E) and leucine (L)-rich patch) on the surface of telomere protein TPP1. In previous studies, interruption of this interaction by mutation prevented telomere extension in HeLa cells, but the cell culture continued to grow. We now show that the telomerase inhibitor BIBR1532 acts together with TEL patch mutations to inhibit the growth of HeLa cell lines and that apoptosis is a prominent mechanism of death of these cells. Survivor cells take over the population beginning around 40 days in culture. These cells no longer express the TEL patch mutant TPP1, apparently because of silencing of the expression cassette, a survival mechanism that would not be available to cancer cells. These results provide hope that inhibiting the binding of telomerase to the TEL patch of TPP1, perhaps together with a modest inhibition of the telomerase enzyme, could comprise an effective anticancer therapy for the ∼90% of human tumors that are telomerase-positive."
https://openalex.org/W2046943467,"As part of our studies on the biological functions of polyamines, we have used a mutant of Escherichia coli that lacks all the genes for polyamine biosynthesis for a global transcriptional analysis on the effect of added polyamines. The most striking early response to the polyamine addition is the increased expression of the genes for the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system (GDAR) that is important for the survival of the bacteria when passing through the acid environment of the stomach. Not only were the two genes for glutamate decarboxylases (gadA and gadB) and the gene for glutamate-γ-aminobutyrate antiporter (gadC) induced by the polyamine addition, but the various genes involved in the regulation of this system were also induced. We confirmed the importance of polyamines for the induction of the GDAR system by direct measurement of glutamate decarboxylase activity and acid survival. The effect of deletions of the regulatory genes on the GDAR system and the effects of overproduction of two of these genes were also studied. Strikingly, overproduction of the alternative σ factor rpoS and of the regulatory gene gadE resulted in very high levels of glutamate decarboxylase and almost complete protection against acid stress even in the absence of any polyamines. Thus, these data show that a major function of polyamines in E. coli is protection against acid stress by increasing the synthesis of glutamate decarboxylase, presumably by increasing the levels of the rpoS and gadE regulators. As part of our studies on the biological functions of polyamines, we have used a mutant of Escherichia coli that lacks all the genes for polyamine biosynthesis for a global transcriptional analysis on the effect of added polyamines. The most striking early response to the polyamine addition is the increased expression of the genes for the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system (GDAR) that is important for the survival of the bacteria when passing through the acid environment of the stomach. Not only were the two genes for glutamate decarboxylases (gadA and gadB) and the gene for glutamate-γ-aminobutyrate antiporter (gadC) induced by the polyamine addition, but the various genes involved in the regulation of this system were also induced. We confirmed the importance of polyamines for the induction of the GDAR system by direct measurement of glutamate decarboxylase activity and acid survival. The effect of deletions of the regulatory genes on the GDAR system and the effects of overproduction of two of these genes were also studied. Strikingly, overproduction of the alternative σ factor rpoS and of the regulatory gene gadE resulted in very high levels of glutamate decarboxylase and almost complete protection against acid stress even in the absence of any polyamines. Thus, these data show that a major function of polyamines in E. coli is protection against acid stress by increasing the synthesis of glutamate decarboxylase, presumably by increasing the levels of the rpoS and gadE regulators. Polyamines (such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are abundantly present in essentially all organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans, and have been associated with such biological processes as nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis and structure and cell growth and differentiation (1Tabor C.W.

As part of our effort to study the biological functions of the polyamines, we have carried out a microarray analysis to find which genes are induced by the addition of polyamines to a polyamine-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli. Most strikingly, we found that five of the seven genes that showed the largest induction soon after polyamine addition are involved in the E. coli acid response system; three are specifically involved in the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) 3The abbreviations used are: GDARglutamate-dependent acid resistanceARacid response. system. The induction of the GDAR system is of particular importance because it is necessary for the survival of various pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria (such as E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, and Lactococcus lactis) when exposed to the acids present in the stomach (7Castanie-Cornet M.P.

The mechanism of the acid resistance involves the decarboxylation of glutamate by two glutamic acid decarboxylases (encoded by gadA and gadB) and export of the resultant γ-aminobutyric acid by the antiporter gadC, which causes the loss of intracellular protons (7Castanie-Cornet M.P.

Stimulated by our microarray data on the effect of polyamines on the transcription of the genes in the GDAR pathway, we proceeded to study the involvement of polyamines on the various components of this pathway. For these studies, we used our strain that contained deletion mutations in all nine of the genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis 4The deleted genes are as follows: speA, arginine decarboxylase; speB, agmatine ureohydrolase; speC, ornithine decarboxylase; speD, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; speE, spermidine synthase; speF, inducible ornithine decarboxylase; cadA, inducible lysine decarboxylase; ldcC, lysine decarboxylase; and adiA, inducible arginine decarboxylase. and that contained no polyamines when grown on a purified medium (28Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Polyamines are not required for aerobic growth of Escherichia coli: preparation of a strain with deletions in all of the genes for polyamine biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 5549-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We feel that the use of this strain with multiple mutations is important because we have found that strains (often used in the literature) that only have a few of these mutations still contain small amounts of polyamines. Surprisingly, despite the lack of any intracellular polyamines, this strain can still grow indefinitely in a purified medium, albeit at 30–40% of the normal growth rate. We have made an important additional mutation in this strain, as we found that our strain had an amber mutation in the rpoS gene; this amber mutation in codon 33 has been reported as being present in high frequency in many E. coli strains (29Atlung T. Nielsen H.V. Hansen F.G. Characterisation of the allelic variation in the rpoS gene in thirteen K12 and six other non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains.Mol. Genet.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37139-37146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because RpoS is known to be important in various stress response systems, we have converted the rpoS amber mutation in our strain to rpoS (wild type) for use in the current experiments. The E. coli strains and plasmids and their source are listed in Table 1. Strain HT776 was modified to convert the amber mutation (TAG) that we found in position 33 of the Rpos protein of HT776 to the wild type CAG sequence. To effect this modification, we converted rpoSamb to rpoSWT by P1 transduction with a strain (ΔcycC/JW2720-1) that contains rpoSWT and the nearby ΔcysC, selecting for a transductant (HT838-11) requiring cysteine and containing the rpoSWT sequence (CAG). The ΔcysC was then removed by another P1 transduction with a strain containing the wild type cysC gene to make strain HT839 used in this paper. In this strain, the sequence of the rpoS wild type gene was determined by amplification of rpoS from genomic DNA followed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotypeSource or Ref.StrainsHT765Δ(speAspeB) Δ(speCglc) Δ(speDspeE) ΔcadA ΔspeF ΔldcC::kan thr-1 proA2 rpoSamb28Chattopadhyay M.K.

Incubations were at 37 °C in air. For strains containing plasmids, the appropriate antibiotic was added as follows: 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol for strains containing the pACYC or pArpoS plasmids or 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin for the strain containing the pQEgadE plasmid. E. coli polyamine mutant (HT839) cultures were inoculated from an LB plate in triplicate in amine-free M9 medium. The cultures were deprived of amines by growing them overnight in amine-free medium. Then the cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.2 and grown until the A600 reached 0.5–0.6. Each culture was divided into two parts. To one part a mixture of putrescine and spermidine was added to a final concentration of 100 μm; the other part was left untreated and used as a control. The amine-supplemented cultures were harvested 20, 40, and 60 min after amine addition. Total RNA from each sample was isolated as described previously (36Chattopadhyay M.K. Chen W. Tabor H. Escherichia coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase: phylogeny and effect on regulation of gene expression.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2013; 338: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each RNA isolation, 109–1010 cells were resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer (100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and RNA was isolated according to the protocol described in the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The mRNAs were enriched from total RNA by removing the 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs using the MICROBExpress method and kit (Ambion/Invitrogen, part number AM1905). The quantity and quality of RNA were evaluated by A260/A280 assays and by RNA capillary electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and used for microarray analysis at the NIDDK genomic core facility by Dr. Weiping Chen and Dr. Keembiyehetty Chithra. Enriched mRNA (40 ng/reaction) was reverse-transcribed and amplified using an Ovation WTA pico-V2 Kit (part number 3302, NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5 μg of cDNA was fragmented and biotinylated and then hybridized for 18 h to E. coli GeneChip arrays (Genome 2.0 array; Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA; n = 3 each for each sample). After washing and staining with an Affymetrix kit (catalog no. FS450; HWS kit), the GeneChips were scanned using an Affymetrix 3000G scanner and GCOS software. Analysis of variance was performed, and p values were calculated using Partek Pro-software (Partek, St. Louis) and plotted in negative log scale on the y axis against the Affimetrix signal ratios for each probe set on the x axis. Up- and down-regulated genes were selected based on p values of <0.05 and fold change of more than +2 or −2. E. coli cultures were inoculated from LB plates into M9 medium without amines and grown overnight to deplete intracellular amines. The cultures were further diluted in M9 medium with and without different supplements as indicated and grown for 20–24 h to full growth. The cultures were harvested and resuspended in Vogel Bonner medium (pH 7.0 with 0.4% glucose) at a cell density of 1 × 1010 cells/ml and used for acid survival assays as described by Castanie-Cornet et al. (7Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A. Smith D. Elliott J.F. Foster J.W. Control of acid resistance in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after some modifications. For assay of cell survival in acid, each culture was diluted 1:100 in Vogel Bonner medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C) with 0.4% glucose adjusted to pH 2.5 with the same supplements. At the indicated times, an aliquot of each culture was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, spread on LB plates, and incubated at 37 °C overnight to determine cell survival. Glutamate decarboxylase was measured by direct measurement of decarboxylation of l-glutamic acid. Cell extracts were prepared by suspending the harvested cells in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce), 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and 20 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma), pH 7.4, incubating the cell suspension at room temperature for 10 min, and subjecting the suspension to one cycle of freezing and thawing. The suspension was then centrifuged (13,000 × g), and the protein content of the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). Enzyme assay buffer contained 50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, pH 4.6. For each assay, 4–10 μg of protein was mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 10 mm l-glutamic acid containing 10 μCi/ml of l-[U-14C]glutamic acid (260 mCi/mmol, catalog no. NEC 290, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 125 μl in a 1.5-ml locked microcentrifuge tube. Liberated CO2 after the decarboxylation reaction was trapped in a small filter paper containing a saturated solution of Ba(OH)2 that had been placed on the cap of the microcentrifuge tube. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with intermittent shaking and terminated by addition of 125 μl of 6 n HCl to inactivate the enzyme and was incubated further for 30 min to release dissolved CO2. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (LS6500, Beckman Instruments, Indianapolis, IN), and enzyme activity was expressed in micromoles of CO2 released per mg of protein/h. Polyamine mutants were inoculated from LB plates into M9 medium plus 0.4% glucose with proline and threonine as above and grown overnight without amines to deplete intracellular amines. The cultures were then diluted in the absence or presence of different amines (100 μm each) and grown for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.9% NaCl to a density of 1 × 1010 cells/ml. Intracellular cAMP was measured (10 μl of the cell suspension/assay) using the direct cyclic AMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following the manufacturer's protocol (catalog no. ADI-900-066, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). Cells were grown as above, and cultures were harvested at the indicated times for protein extraction. The same samples used for in vitro glutamic acid decarboxylase assays were used for Western blotting and immunodetection using the ECL Prime Western blotting kit (GE Healthcare). Anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GadA) primary antibody was raised commercially against GadA peptides (peptide 1, INDELYLDGNARQNLAT; peptide 2, CLKYLSDHPKLQGIAQQNSFKHT; 21st Century Biochemicals, Marlboro, MA) and confirmed by comparing cell extracts from gadA+/gadB+ and ΔgadA/ΔgadB strains by Western blotting. Although the antibody was raised against GadA peptides, because of very high sequence identity in the two decarboxylases (more than 95%), the primary antibody recognizes both GadA and GadB proteins. The high titer GadA/B antibody was affinity-purified and used in Western blot analysis (1:25,000 dilution) containing 1 μg of protein extract/lane. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) was used at 1:20,000 dilution. For immunodetection of RpoS, cell extract containing 5 μg of protein/lane was used. Anti-RpoS mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog no. ab81737, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used after 1:10,000 dilutions, and secondary antibody (anti-mouse, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, GE Healthcare) was used at 1:20,000 dilutions. For these studies we used the E. coli mutant, as we described previously (28Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Polyamines are not required for aerobic growth of Escherichia coli: preparation of a strain with deletions in all of the genes for polyamine biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 5549-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), that has deletions in all nine of the genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis and modified as described under “Experimental Procedures” to have a wild type sequence in the rpoS gene. This polyamine mutant does not contain any detectable amines when grown in purified medium (minimum detection limit less than 0.02 nmol/mg cells). In the absence of amines, this polyamine mutant grows at 30–40% of the growth rate obtained with an amine-supplemented culture. We have used this strain for global transcriptome analysis to identify genes responsive to polyamine addition at very early time points (20, 40, and 60 min after polyamine addition); at these times there is no increase in the overall growth rate, as measured by optical density, due to the polyamine addition. As shown in the volcano plot (Fig. 1), within 60 min after polyamine addition 54 genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold, and 15 genes were up-regulated more than 3-fold; 94 genes were down-regulated more than 2-fold. The entire data set for the microarray study on the effect of polyamine addition has been deposited with a GEO accession number GSE49918. Most striking was the finding that of the seven genes most induced (6.9- to 3.5-fold) after polyamine addition, five were genes known to be involved in the GDAR and other acid- resistance pathways (as indicated by line spacing in Table 2). In Table 2, we have also listed other genes that are known to be involved in the acid response pathway in E. coli; all of these were also induced by the polyamine addition but to a lesser degree.

However, the extent to which ambient environmental conditions can be inferred from the elemental signatures within the vertebrae of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, rays) has not been evaluated. To assess the relationship between water and vertebral elemental composition, we conducted two laboratory studies using round stingrays, Urobatis halleri, as a model species. First, we examined the effects of temperature (16°, 18°, 24°C) on vertebral elemental incorporation (Li/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca). Second, we tested the relationship between water and subsequent vertebral elemental composition by manipulating dissolved barium concentrations (1x, 3x, 6x). We also evaluated the influence of natural variation in growth rate on elemental incorporation for both experiments. Finally, we examined the accuracy of classifying individuals to known environmental histories (temperature and barium treatments) using vertebral elemental composition. Temperature had strong, negative effects on the uptake of magnesium (DMg) and barium (DBa) and positively influenced manganese (DMn) incorporation. Temperature-dependent responses were not observed for lithium and strontium. Vertebral Ba/Ca was positively correlated with ambient Ba/Ca. Partition coefficients (DBa) revealed increased discrimination of barium in response to increased dissolved barium concentrations. There were no significant relationships between elemental incorporation and somatic growth or vertebral precipitation rates for any elements except Zn. Relationships between somatic growth rate and DZn were, however, inconsistent and inconclusive. Variation in the vertebral elemental signatures of U. halleri reliably distinguished individual rays from each treatment based on temperature (85%) and Ba exposure (96%) history. These results support the assumption that vertebral elemental composition reflects the environmental conditions during deposition and validates the use of vertebral elemental signatures as natural markers in an elasmobranch. Vertebral elemental analysis is a promising tool for the study of elasmobranch population structure, movement, and habitat use."

Despite the fact that more than 60 putative OBP-encoding genes have been identified in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, the crystal structures of only six of them are known. It is therefore clear that OBP structure determination constitutes the bottleneck for structure-based approaches to mosquito repellent/attractant discovery. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of an A. gambiae ""Plus-C"" group OBP (AgamOBP48), which exhibits the second highest expression levels in female antennae. This structure represents the first example of a three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer in dipteran species. A combined binding site is formed at the dimer interface by equal contribution of each monomer. Structural comparisons with the monomeric AgamOBP47 revealed that the major structural difference between the two Plus-C proteins localizes in their N- and C-terminal regions, and their concerted conformational change may account for monomer-swapped dimer conversion and furthermore the formation of novel binding pockets. Using a combination of gel filtration chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation, we demonstrate the AgamOBP48 dimerization in solution. Eventually, molecular modeling calculations were used to predict the binding mode of the most potent synthetic ligand of AgamOBP48 known so far, discovered by ligand- and structure-based virtual screening. The structure-aided identification of multiple OBP binders represents a powerful tool to be employed in the effort to control transmission of the vector-borne diseases."

Protection against force-induced cell death may be mediated by filamin A (FLNa), an actin-binding protein that regulates β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion. We examined the affect of filamin expression on collagen distribution and cell death in the periodontal ligament, a force-loaded tissue. Conditional deletion of FLNa in fibroblasts was associated with 2-fold increase of acellular areas in periodontal ligament and 7-fold higher proportions of apoptotic cells. In cultured fibroblasts with FLNa knockdown, we examined the affect of supraphysiological forces (1 pN/μm(2) cell area; applied through the β1 integrin) on recruitment of talin and vinculin to focal adhesions and on apoptosis. Compared with the wild type, FLNa-knockdown cells exhibited 3-fold increases in floating cells after overnight force application and a 2-fold increase in cell detachment. Force induced time-dependent reductions (P<0.05) in the numbers of activated β1 integrin-, talin-, and vinculin-stained adhesions in FLNa-knockdown compared with those in wild-type cells. We conclude that FLNa protects against apoptosis in force-loaded cells, and this protection is mediated by enhanced formation and maturation of matrix adhesions."

https://openalex.org/W2170630405,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a thrombotic complication of heparin therapy mediated by antibodies to complexes between platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin or cellular glycosaminoglycans. However, only a fraction of patients with anti-PF4-heparin antibodies develop HIT, implying that only a subset of these antibodies is pathogenic. The basis for the pathogenic potential of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies remains unclear. To elucidate the intrinsic PF4-binding properties of HIT-like monoclonal antibody (KKO) versus non-pathogenic antibody (RTO) at the single-molecule level, we utilized optical trap-based force spectroscopy to measure the strength and probability of binding of surface-attached antibodies with oligomeric PF4 to simulate interactions on cells. To mimic the effect of heparin in bringing PF4 complexes into proximity, we chemically cross-linked PF4 tetramers using glutaraldehyde. Analysis of the force histograms revealed that KKO-PF4 interactions had ∼10-fold faster on-rates than RTO-PF4, and apparent equilibrium dissociation constants differed ∼10-fold with similar force-free off-rates (k(off) = 0.0031 and 0.0029 s(-1)). Qualitatively similar results were obtained for KKO and RTO interacting with PF4-heparin complexes. In contrast to WT PF4, KKO and RTO showed lower and similar binding probabilities to cross-linked PF4(K50E), which forms few if any oligomers. Thus, formation of stable PF4 polymers results in much stronger interactions with the pathogenic antibody without a significant effect on the binding of the non-pathogenic antibody. These results suggest a fundamental difference in the antigen-binding mechanisms between model pathogenic and non-pathogenic anti-PF4 antibodies that might underlie their distinct pathophysiological behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2073018978,"Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate numerous physiological processes and are therapeutic targets for a wide range of clinical indications. Elucidating the structural differences between their closed and open states may help in designing improved drugs that bias receptors toward the desired conformational state. We recently showed that two new hyperekplexia mutations, Q226E and V280M, induced spontaneous activity in α1 glycine receptors. Gln-226, located near the top of transmembrane (TM) 1, is closely apposed to Arg-271 at the top of TM2 in the neighboring subunit. Using mutant cycle analysis, we inferred that Q226E induces activation via an enhanced electrostatic attraction to Arg-271. This would tilt the top of TM2 toward TM1 and hence away from the pore axis to open the channel. We also concluded that the increased side chain volume of V280M, in the TM2-TM3 loop, exerts a steric repulsion against Ile-225 at the top of TM1 in the neighboring subunit. We infer that this steric repulsion would tilt the top of TM3 radially outwards against the stationary TM1 and thus provide space for TM2 to relax away from the pore axis to create an open channel. Because the transmembrane domain movements inferred from this functional analysis are consistent with the structural differences evident in the x-ray atomic structures of closed and open state bacterial pLGICs, we propyose that the model of pLGIC activation as outlined here may be broadly applicable across the eukaryotic pLGIC receptor family."

The crystal structure of NtdA shows that NtdA shares the common aspartate aminotransferase fold (Type 1) with residues from both monomers forming the active site. The crystal structures of NtdA alone, co-crystallized with the product α-D-kanosamine 6-phosphate, and incubated with the amine donor glutamate reveal three key structures in the mechanistic pathway of NtdA. The structure of NtdA alone reveals the internal aldimine form of NtdA with the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate covalently attached to Lys-247. The addition of glutamate results in formation of pyridoxamine phosphate. Co-crystallization with kanosamine 6-phosphate results in the formation of the external aldimine. Only α-D-kanosamine 6-phosphate is observed in the active site of NtdA, not the β-anomer. A comparison of the structure and sequence of NtdA with other sugar aminotransferases enables us to propose that the VIβ family of aminotransferases should be divided into subfamilies based on the catalytic lysine motif."

It was found that sErbB3 suppresses ligand-induced activation of ErbB receptors, PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk pathways most effectively; sErbB2 scarcely suppresses ligand-induced signaling, and sErbB4 suppresses receptor activation at ∼10% efficiency of sErbB3.

GT198 protein has been shown as a steroid hormone receptor coregulator and also as a crucial factor in DNA repair. In this study, using GT198 as a marker for microdissection, we find that ovarian tumor stromal cells harboring GT198 mutations are present in various types of ovarian cancer including high and low grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, and granulosa cell carcinomas and in precursor lesions such as inclusion cysts. The mutant stromal cells consist of a luteinized theca cell lineage at various differentiation stages including CD133(+), CD44(+), and CD34(+) cells, although the vast majority of them are differentiated overexpressing steroidogenic enzyme CYP17, a theca cell-specific marker. In addition, wild type GT198 suppresses whereas mutant GT198 protein stimulates CYP17 expression. The chromatin-bound GT198 on the human CYP17 promoter is decreased by overexpressing mutant GT198 protein, implicating the loss of wild type suppression in mutant cells.

Two experiments are presented in which participants read mini-dialogues while their Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) are being measured. In both experiments, violating the dependency between questions and answers was found to lead to an increase in the amplitude of the P600 component.

Our study is one of few investigating language processing in conversation, be it that our participants were ‘eavesdroppers’ instead of real interactants.

Stable knockdown of endogenous NELF-B has the opposite effects on an exogenous gene. The GR ligand-binding domain suffices for these biological responses. ChIP assays reveal that NELF-B diminishes GR recruitment to promoter regions of two endogenous genes. Using a new competition assay, NELF-A and NELF-B are each shown to act independently as competitive decelerators at two steps after the site of GR action and before or at the site of reporter gene activity. A common motif in each NELF was identified that is required for full activity of both NELF-A and NELF-B.

However, using microRNA's differential expression (tumour versus normal) to determine these signatures may lead to inaccurate predictions and low interpretability because of the noisy nature of miRNA expression data. We present a method for the selection of biologically active microRNAs using gene expression data and microRNA-to-gene interaction network. Our method is based on a linear regression with an elastic net regularization. Our simulations show that, with our method, the active miRNAs can be detected with high accuracy and our approach is robust to high levels of noise and missing information. Furthermore, our results on real datasets for glioblastoma and prostate cancer are confirmed by microRNA expression measurements. Our method leads to the selection of potentially functionally important microRNAs. The associations of some of our identified miRNAs with cancer mechanisms are already confirmed in other studies (hypoxia related hsa-mir-210 and apoptosis-related hsa-mir-296-5p). We have also identified additional miRNAs that were not previously studied in the context of cancer but are coherently predicted as active by our method and may warrant further investigation.

Indeed, with the use of a modified quantitative AluI PCR assay, we demonstrated that the elevation of cellular dNTP concentrations accelerated DNA gap repair in macrophages at HIV-1 proviral DNA integration sites. Finally, we found that human monocytes, which are resistant to HIV-1 infection, exhibited severely restricted gap repair capacity due not only to the very low levels of dNTPs detected but also to the significantly reduced expression of Pol β.

Mitogenic activity of snake venom lectins.Cell Tissue Kinet. 1986; 19: 557-566PubMed Google Scholar), the proviral dsDNA is transported into the nucleus and integrated into host chromosomal DNA. The integration process is catalyzed by a virally encoded integrase that carries out two enzymatic reactions: 3′-end processing and strand transfer (3Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Activities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integration protein in vitro: specific cleavage and integration of HIV DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The 3′-end processing reaction of integrase results in the cleavage of two nucleotides from both 3′-ends of the proviral DNA to expose 3′-OH groups. The free 3′-OH groups are then oriented through the mechanism of strand transfer to allow nucleophilic attack on chromosomal DNA. This covalently links only one of the two viral DNA strands to the host DNA and creates a single-stranded gap between the two DNA species, as well as 5′-end mismatched flaps of viral DNA (4Fujiwara T.

It is thought that 5′-end joining is completed by cellular enzymes specifically found in the base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair pathways (5Espeseth A.S. Fishel R. Hazuda D.

The base excision repair pathway is required for efficient lentivirus integration.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17862Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BER involves three sequential enzymatic reactions. First, host cell DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerase β (Pol β) or δ, use cellular dNTPs to fill in the single-stranded gap. Next, the 5′-end mismatched flap is cleaved by host nucleases, such as FEN1 (flap endonuclease 1). The resulting DNA fragments are then joined together by one of the two host cell ligases, I or III (6Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. Repair of gaps in retroviral DNA integration intermediates.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that recombinant BER proteins can repair a synthetic viral/host DNA gapped substrate in vitro (6Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. Repair of gaps in retroviral DNA integration intermediates.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that cells with knocked down Pol β have lower viral DNA integration efficiency (7Yoder K.E. Espeseth A. Wang X.H. Fang Q. Russo M.T. Lloyd R.S. Hazuda D. Sobol R.W. Fishel R. The base excision repair pathway is required for efficient lentivirus integration.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17862Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both reverse transcription and 5′-end DNA gap repair steps require cellular dNTPs. However, this metabolite can vary greatly between cell types (8Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K.

We reported previously that the dNTP levels in terminally differentiated human primary macrophages are extremely low, with concentrations ranging from 20 to 60 nm (9Kennedy E.M. Gavegnano C.

This concentration is ∼200 times lower than the dNTP concentrations found in activated/dividing CD4+ T cells (5 μm) (8Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K. Reynolds H.M. Merriam A.R. Lee K.Y.

In addition, our laboratory and others have reported that cellular SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1), a dNTP triphosphohydrolase, contributes to the low dNTP levels found in macrophages and other myeloid lineage cells (10Goldstone D.C.

Importantly, the dNTP discrepancy between macrophages and active CD4+ T cells has been extensively studied with regard to the effect that the cellular concentration has on the efficiency of HIV-1 reverse transcription (9Kennedy E.M.

The kinetics of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcription are slower in primary human macrophages than in a lymphoid cell line.Virology. 1994; 200: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HIV-1 and other lentiviruses uniquely complete reverse transcription at low dNTP concentrations, which are found in non-dividing cell types. A number of factors promote this unique ability of lentiviruses. First, HIV-1 RT has a very tight binding affinity for dNTPs compared with other oncoretrovirus RTs (16Operario D.J. Reynolds H.M. Kim B. Comparison of DNA polymerase activities between recombinant feline immunodeficiency and leukemia virus reverse transcriptases.Virology. 2005; 335: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), allowing HIV-1 RT to complete reverse transcription in environments with low substrate availability (8Diamond T.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51545-51553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports have shown that HIV-2 and several simian immunodeficiency viruses can enhance reverse transcription by elevating the cellular dNTP concentrations in macrophages. This is accomplished through the action of Vpx (viral protein X) which targets SAMHD1, a host protein, for proteasomal degradation. This in turn leads to an increase in cellular dNTP levels. We and several groups have reported that treatment of macrophages, dendritic cells, and resting CD4+ T cells with virus-like particles expressing Vpx enhances HIV-1 infection (10Goldstone D.C.

The impact of molecular manipulation in residue 114 of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase on dNTP substrate binding and viral replication.Virology. 2012; 422: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that cellular dNTP concentrations also influence DNA gap repair during viral DNA integration into the host genome. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 DNA gap repair in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) was greatly reduced compared with CD4+ T cells and that this difference was due to the reduced repair capability of enzymes expressed in macrophages and the low cellular dNTP concentration in this cell type. Indeed, HIV-1 5′-end gap repair remained incomplete at integration sites in macrophages, but the amount of fully repaired integration sites was increased when cellular dNTP levels were elevated. This supports our hypothesis that cellular dNTP availability influences the process of HIV-1 integration in addition to the process of reverse transcription. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats from multiple donors (New York Blood Center) through density gradient centrifugation. Cells were further column-purified using anti-CD14 microbeads (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were differentiated to macrophages for 7 days and supplemented with 100 units/ml GM-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) containing heat-inactivated 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). CD4+ T cells were isolated from buffy coats using anti-CD4 microbeads (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). CD4+ T cells were activated with 6 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (J-Oils Mills, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) (20Clapham P.R. McKnight A. Cell surface receptors, virus entry and tropism of primate lentiviruses.J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1809-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and 20 units/ml IL-2 (Miltenyi Biotec). The pD3HIV-GFP vector expresses enhanced GFP and all of the HIV-1 NL4-3 proteins except for Nef and Env. The vector was pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein as described previously (14Jamburuthugoda V.K. Santos-Velazquez J.M. Skasko M. Operario D.J. Purohit V. Chugh P. Szymanski E.A. Wedekind J.E. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Reduced dNTP binding affinity of 3TC-resistant M184I HIV-1 reverse transcriptase variants responsible for viral infection failure in macrophage.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9206-9216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A viral vector was made by transfection of 293FT cells (Invitrogen) with pD3HIV-GFP and pVSV-G as described previously (19Van Cor-Hosmer S.K. Daddacha W. Kelly Z. Tsurumi A. Kennedy E.M. Kim B. The impact of molecular manipulation in residue 114 of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase on dNTP substrate binding and viral replication.Virology. 2012; 422: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed after 24 h, and the medium was collected at 72 h. The medium containing the vector was treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts from monocytes, macrophages, naïve, and activated CD4+ T cells were prepared from multiple donors as described previously (21Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14280-14288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) and then resuspended in hypotonic buffer before Dounce homogenization. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 3300 × g for 15 min. The pellet containing the cell nuclei was then mixed with high salt buffer (1.6 m KCl) and incubated on ice. Extracts were centrifuged at 22,065 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, dialyzed overnight, and saved as nuclear extracts at −80 °C. Nuclear extracts were normalized to total protein concentration as measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides previously published (6Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. Repair of gaps in retroviral DNA integration intermediates.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), primer Key35 (5′-ATTCGAGCTATCCTTGCGCG-3′), primer Key31 (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTA-3′), template Key36 (5′-TAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGGCCCCGCGCAAGGATAGCTCGAAT-3′), and a new primer for 3′-end labeling (Key36+dC, 5′-CTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGGCCCCGCGCAAGGATAGCTCGAAT-3′) were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (22Goldschmidt V. Marquet R. Primer unblocking by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs).Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1687-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Key35 was 5′-end-labeled with γ-32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. Gapped substrate i (see Fig. 1A) was constructed with primers at the following concentrations: Key35, 800 nm; Key31, 2.4 μm; and Key36, 1.6 μm (6Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. Repair of gaps in retroviral DNA integration intermediates.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To 3′-end label Key31, the primer was first annealed to Key36+dC, incubated with recombinant RT and α-32P-labeled dC for 30 min at 37 °C, and then run on a Tris-free Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad). The purified primer-template was then annealed to Key35. The substrate was constructed with 3′-end-labeled Key31 (2.4 μm), Key36+dC (1.6 μm), and Key35 (800 nm). Gap repair reactions (20 μl) contained 20 nm substrate i or ii (see Fig. 1A) and 75 μm (dT)20, 2 mm ATP, dNTPs (60 nm, 2.5 μm, or 250 μm) and reaction buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 μl of diluted nuclear extract from multiple donors at an initial concentration of 0.4 or 2 μg/μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min. Reactions were terminated using 40 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) and 99% formamide and immediately denatured by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. To monitor for higher molecular weight repair products, 4 μl of the 30-μl final reaction was separated by 14% urea-PAGE (SequaGel, National Diagnostics). Data were captured by PhosphorImager analysis (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantitated using Quantity One software. Importantly, the repair activities analyzed by the quantitation of the final repair products throughout this study were reproducibly linear to both the amounts of the extracts (supplemental Fig. S1) used and the incubation time (supplemental Fig. 2) as illustrated in the legends of the supplemental figures. Nuclear extracts from MDMs and CD4+ T cells from two donors were depleted as described previously (21Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14280-14288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of nuclear extract (normalized to 4 μg/μl) was added to 10 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) along with 3 μl of anti-Pol β (Abcam) or anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Reactions were agitated overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and analyzed by Western blotting to monitor the completeness of depletion prior to testing these extracts in the repair reactions. Anti-α-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin, and anti-Pol β antibodies were used for Western blotting. Nuclear extracts were prepared from two donors as described above and normalized by the Bradford assay for total protein. Samples were mixed with SDS and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature the proteins. The lysate was then subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Primary and secondary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Gels were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate, Thermo Scientific) and imaged using a Bio-Rad molecular imager. As shown in Fig. 6, macrophages from three donors were transduced with pD3HIV-GFP for 24 h. The cells were washed, incubated for a consecutive 24 h, and then treated with 5 μm nevirapine and 1 μm raltegravir for 6 h. After the 6-h treatments (“day 0”), 1 million macrophages were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and scraped. Cells were then centrifuged at low speed for 5 min and resuspended in 200 μl of Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were monitored for GFP expression using a C6 flow cytometer (Accuri). The remaining cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Wizards SV genomic purification system, Promega). Following this day 0 analysis, 1 mm deoxynucleosides (dNs) or medium was added to the cells, which were analyzed by flow cytometry 24, 48, 72 or 96 h after dN treatment. The medium was changed at 48 h, and both inhibitors and the dNs were replaced. Percent transduction was determined using FlowJo software (version 8.8.5, Tree Star Inc.). The remaining cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. The genomic extracts were also monitored for integrated proviral DNA by AluI PCR as described previously (23Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. A quantitative assay for HIV DNA integration in vivo.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Briefly, pHR-CMV-GFP was transduced and stably integrated into 293FT cells, and genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (23Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. A quantitative assay for HIV DNA integration in vivo.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). 293FT genomic preparations containing the integrated pHR-CMV-GFP genome were diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, and 1:24 with genomic extract from non-transduced 293FT cells. These extracts were then assayed for the amount of late RT DNA products using the following primers: late forward primer for the pHR vector, 5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT-3′; late RT reverse primer, 5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAGC-3′; and late RT probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-CAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′. The amount of signal from each dilution was compared with the signal from a known amount of diluted pD3HIV-GFP with the only variation in primers used for D3 being the late RT reverse primer (5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGATC-3′). The diluted and quantified 293FT extract was then used as a standard to measure the amount of integrated proviral DNA using the following primers: AluI forward primer, 5′-AACTAGGGAACCCACTGCTTAAG-3′; AluI reverse primer, 5′-TGCTGGGATTACAGGCGTGAG-3′; and AluI probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-ACACTACTTGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTT-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′. We first compared the DNA gap repair capability of human primary MDMs and activated CD4+ T cells by employing an in vitro assay that can directly monitor the three enzymatic steps to complete 5′-end gap repair: DNA synthesis to fill the ssDNA gap, 5′-end mismatch flap removal, and DNA ligation. This assay utilizes nuclear extracts prepared from cells (24Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. DNA-dependent transcription of adenovirus genes in a soluble whole-cell extract.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and synthetic HIV-1 DNA gap repair substrates. As shown in Fig. 1A, the gap substrate consists of two primers: a 20-mer upstream primer (blue) and a 27-mer primer that encodes the 5′-end sequence of the viral 5′-LTR (red) for substrate i. These two primers were annealed to a 50-mer DNA template, creating a four-nucleotide single-stranded gap region with a 5′-end single nucleotide mismatch flap (6Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. Repair of gaps in retroviral DNA integration intermediates.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The 20-mer and 28-mer primers in substrate ii were labeled with γ-32P at the 5′-end of the upstream primer (Fig. 1A, *) (25Albright A.V. Erickson-Viitanen S. O'Connor M. Frank I. Rayner M.M. González-Scarano F. Efavirenz is a potent nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV type 1 replication in microglia in vitro.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1527-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Gap filling by cellular DNA polymerases with substrate i generated a four-nucleotide extension of the upstream primer (Fig. 1A, gray). This was followed by mismatch flap removal and ligation between the 24-mer extended upstream primer and the processed 26-mer downstream primer, which in turn generated a 50-mer repair product. To verify the absence of the strand displacement activity in the assay, which can also generate the same 50-mer product simply by extending the labeled upstream primer, we constructed a similar gap substrate with a γ-32P-3′-end-labeled downstream primer by incorporating a single radioactive dGTP to form the 51-mer template (substrate ii in Fig. 1, A and D). Next, we prepared nuclear extracts from human primary macrophages and activated CD4+ T cells and normalized each extract to 2 μg/μl total protein. To compare the DNA gap repair capability, we incubated each extract with substrate i for 30 min at 37 °C at saturating dNTP concentrations (250 μm). The reactions were then quenched with 20 mm EDTA and analyzed by 14% urea-PAGE to monitor the amount of repair. As shown in Fig. 1B, nuclear extracts from both macrophages (lane 2) and activated CD4+ T cells (lane 3) extended the 20-mer upstream primer (blue), generating products with sizes between 21 and 24 nucleotides (gray lines).

Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway.To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM.A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM.We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2088425341,"In aerobically growing cells, in which reactive oxygen species are produced, the guanine base is oxidized to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, which can pair with adenine as well as cytosine. This mispairing causes alterations in gene expression, and cells possess mechanisms to prevent such outcomes. In Escherichia coli, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine-related phenotypic suppression of lacZ amber is enhanced by mutations in genes related to the prevention of abnormal protein synthesis under oxidative stress. A genome-wide search for the genes responsible, followed by DNA sequence determination, revealed that specific amino acid changes in guanylate kinase and in the β and β' subunits of RNA polymerase cause elevated levels of phenotypic suppression, specifically under aerobic conditions. The involvement of the DnaB, DnaN, and MsbA proteins, which are involved in DNA replication and in preserving the membrane structure, was also noted. Interactions of these proteins with each other and also with other molecules may be important for preventing errors in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3123496987,"Objective To explore the feasibility and implementation efficiency of Nutritional Report Cards(NRCs) in helping children make healthier food choices at school. Methods Pilot testing was conducted in a rural New York school district (K-12). Over a five-week period, 27 parents received a weekly e-mail containing a NRC listing how many meal components (fruits, vegetables, starches, milk), snacks, and a-la-carte foods their child selected. We analyzed choices of students in the NRC group vs. the control group, both prior to and during the intervention period. Point-of-sale system data for a-la-carte items was analyzed using Generalized Least Squares regressions with clustered standard errors. Results NRCs encouraged more home conversations about nutrition and more awareness of food selections. Despite the small sample, the NRC was associated with reduced selection of some items, such as the percentage of those selecting cookies which decreased from 14.3 to 6.5 percent. Additionally, despite requiring new keys on the check-out registers to generate the NRC, checkout times increased by only 0.16 seconds per transaction, and compiling and sending the NRCs required a total weekly investment of 30 minutes of staff time. Conclusions This test of concept suggests that NRCs are a feasible and inexpensive tool to guide children towards healthier choices."
https://openalex.org/W2082684756,"The cytochrome P450 is the major enzyme involved in drug metabolism. Single CYP genotypes and metabolic phenotypes have been widely studied, but no combination analysis has been conducted in the context of specific populations and geographical areas. This study is the first to systematically analyze the combined genotypes and functional combinations of 400 samples of major CYP genes--CYP2E1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in four geographical areas of mainland China. 167 different genotype combinations were identified, of which 25 had a greater than 1% frequency in the Chinese Han population. In addition, phenotypes of the four genes for each sample were in line with the predictions of previous studies of the four geographical areas. On the basis of the genotype classification, we were able to produce a systemic functional combinations analysis for the population. 25 of the combinations detected had at least two non-wild phenotypes and four showed a frequency above 1%. A bioinformatics analysis of the relationship between particular drugs and multi-genes was conducted. This is the first systematic study to analyze genotype combinations and functional combinations across whole Chinese population and could make a significant contribution in the field of personalized medicine and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2077764373,"T cell commitment and αβ/γδ lineage specification in the thymus involves interactions between many different genes. Characterization of these interactions thus requires a multiparameter analysis of individual thymocytes. We developed two efficient single-cell methods: (i) the quantitative evaluation of the co-expression levels of nine different genes, with a plating efficiency of 99-100% and a detection limit of 2 mRNA molecules/cell; and (ii) single-cell differentiation cultures, in the presence of OP9 cells transfected with the thymus Notch1 ligand DeltaL4. We show that during T cell commitment, Gata3 has a fundamental, dose-dependent role in maintaining Notch1 expression, with thymocytes becoming T-cell-committed when they co-express Notch1, Gata3 and Bc11b. Of the transcription factor expression patterns studied here, only that of Bcl11b was suggestive of a role in Pu1 down-regulation. Individual thymocytes became αβ/γδ lineage-committed at very different stages (from the TN2a stage onwards). However, 20% of TN3 cells are not αβ/γδ-lineage committed and TN4 cells comprise two main subpopulations with different degrees of maturity. The existence of a correlation between differentiation potential and expression of the pre-TCR showed that 83% of αβ-committed cells do not express the pre-TCR and revealed a major stochastic component in αβ-lineage specification."
https://openalex.org/W2157987462,"A 27-aa peptide (P27) was previously shown to decrease the accumulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the supernatant of chronically infected cells; however, the mechanism was not understood. Here, we show that P27 prevents virus accumulation by inducing macropinocytosis (MPC). Treatment of HIV-1- and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells with 2-10 μM P27 caused cell membrane ruffling and uptake of virus and polymerized forms of the peptide into large vacuoles. As demonstrated by electron microscopy, activation of MPC did not require virus or cells infected with virus, as P27 initiated its own uptake in the absence of virus. Inhibitors of MPC, Cytochalasin D and amiloride, decreased P27-mediated uptake of soluble dextran and inhibited P27-induced virus uptake by >60%, which provides further evidence that P27 induces MPC. In CD4(+) HeLa cells, HIV-1 infection was enhanced by P27 up to 4-fold, and P27 increased infection at concentrations as low as 20 nM. The 5-aa C-terminal domain of P27 was necessary for virus uptake and may be responsible for the polymerization of P27 into fibrils. These forms of P27 may play a key role in triggering MPC, making this peptide a useful tool for studying virus uptake and infection, as well as MPC of other macromolecules."
