https://openalex.org/W2745888331,"Enthusiasm for using Twitter as a source of data in the social sciences extends to measuring the impact of research with Twitter data being a key component in the new altmetrics approach. In this paper, we examine tweets containing links to research articles in the field of dentistry to assess the extent to which tweeting about scientific papers signifies engagement with, attention to, or consumption of scientific literature. The main goal is to better comprehend the role Twitter plays in scholarly communication and the potential value of tweet counts as traces of broader engagement with scientific literature. In particular, the pattern of tweeting to the top ten most tweeted scientific dental articles and of tweeting by accounts is examined. The ideal that tweeting about scholarly articles represents curating and informing about state-of-the-art appears not to be realized in practice. We see much presumably human tweeting almost entirely mechanical and devoid of original thought, no evidence of conversation, tweets generated by monomania, duplicate tweeting from many accounts under centralized professional management and tweets generated by bots. Some accounts exemplify the ideal, but they represent less than 10% of tweets. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from twitter data is swamped by the mechanical nature of the bulk of tweeting behavior. In light of these results, we discuss the compatibility of Twitter with the research enterprise as well as some of the financial incentives behind these patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2749818146,"Assessing the accuracy of predictive models is critical because predictive models have been increasingly used across various disciplines and predictive accuracy determines the quality of resultant predictions. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and the coefficient of determination (r2) are among the most widely used measures for assessing predictive models for numerical data, although they are argued to be biased, insufficient and misleading. In this study, geometrical graphs were used to illustrate what were used in the calculation of r and r2 and simulations were used to demonstrate the behaviour of r and r2 and to compare three accuracy measures under various scenarios. Relevant confusions about r and r2, has been clarified. The calculation of r and r2 is not based on the differences between the predicted and observed values. The existing error measures suffer various limitations and are unable to tell the accuracy. Variance explained by predictive models based on cross-validation (VEcv) is free of these limitations and is a reliable accuracy measure. Legates and McCabe's efficiency (E1) is also an alternative accuracy measure. The r and r2 do not measure the accuracy and are incorrect accuracy measures. The existing error measures suffer limitations. VEcv and E1 are recommended for assessing the accuracy. The applications of these accuracy measures would encourage accuracy-improved predictive models to be developed to generate predictions for evidence-informed decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2747396160,"For targets that are homogenously expressed, such as CD19 on cells of the B lymphocyte lineage, immunotherapies can be highly effective. Targeting CD19 with blinatumomab, a CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody construct (BiTE®), or with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) has shown great promise for treating certain CD19-positive hematological malignancies. In contrast, solid tumors with heterogeneous expression of the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) may present a challenge for targeted therapies. To prevent escape of TAA-negative cancer cells, immunotherapies with a local bystander effect would be beneficial. As a model to investigate BiTE®-mediated bystander killing in the solid tumor setting, we used epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a target. We measured lysis of EGFR-negative populations in vitro and in vivo when co-cultured with EGFR-positive cells, human T cells and an EGFR/CD3 BiTE® antibody construct. Bystander EGFR-negative cells were efficiently lysed by BiTE®-activated T cells only when proximal to EGFR-positive cells. Our mechanistic analysis suggests that cytokines released by BiTE®-activated T-cells induced upregulation of ICAM-1 and FAS on EGFR-negative bystander cells, contributing to T cell-induced bystander cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2750514864,"Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume is associated with coronary plaque burden and adverse events. We aimed to determine, whether CT-derived EAT attenuation in addition to EAT volume distinguishes patients with and without myocardial infarction.In 94 patients with confirmed or suspected coronary artery disease (aged 66.9±14.7years, 61%male) undergoing cardiac CT imaging as part of clinical workup, EAT volume was retrospectively quantified from non-contrast cardiac CT by delineation of the pericardium in axial images. Mean attenuation of all pixels from EAT volume was calculated. Patients with type-I myocardial infarction (n = 28) had higher EAT volume (132.9 ± 111.9ml vs. 109.7 ± 94.6ml, p = 0.07) and CT-attenuation (-86.8 ± 5.8HU vs. -89.0 ± 3.7HU, p = 0.03) than patients without type-I myocardial infarction, while EAT volume and attenuation were only modestly inversely correlated (r = -0.24, p = 0.02). EAT volume increased per standard deviation of age (18.2 [6.2-30.2] ml, p = 0.003), BMI (29.3 [18.4-40.2] ml, p<0.0001), and with presence of diabetes (44.5 [16.7-72.3] ml, p = 0.0002), while attenuation was higher in patients with lipid-lowering therapy (2.34 [0.08-4.61] HU, p = 0.04). In a model containing volume and attenuation, both measures of EAT were independently associated with the occurrence of type-I myocardial infarction (OR [95% CI]: 1.79 [1.10-2.94], p = 0.02 for volume, 2.04 [1.18-3.53], p = 0.01 for attenuation). Effect sizes remained stable for EAT attenuation after adjustment for risk factors (1.44 [0.77-2.68], p = 0.26 for volume; 1.93 [1.11-3.39], p = 0.02 for attenuation).CT-derived EAT attenuation, in addition to volume, distinguishes patients with vs. without myocardial infarction and is increased in patients with lipid-lowering therapy. Our results suggest that assessment of EAT attenuation could render complementary information to EAT volume regarding coronary risk burden."
https://openalex.org/W2746404597,"Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is an analysis tool for identifying and preventing flaws or defects in products during the design and process planning stage, preventing the repeated occurrence of problems, reducing the effects of these problems, enhancing product quality and reliability, saving costs, and improving competitiveness. However, FMEA can only analyze one influence factor according to its priority, rendering this method ineffective for systems containing multiple FMs whose effects are simultaneous or interact with one another. Accordingly, when FMEA fails to identify the influence factors and the factors being influenced, the most crucial problems may be placed in lower priority or remain unresolved. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) facilitates the determination of cause and effect factors; by identifying the causal factors that should be prioritized, prompt and effective solutions to core problems can be derived, thereby enhancing performance. Using the photovoltaic cell manufacturing industry in China as the research target, the present study combined FMEA with DEMATEL to amend the flaws of FMEA and enhance its effectiveness. First, FMEA was used to identify items requiring improvement. Then, DEMATEL was employed to examine the interactive effects and causal relationships of these items. Finally, the solutions to the problems were prioritized. The proposed method effectively combined the advantages of FMEA and DEMATEL to facilitate the identification of core problems and prioritization of solutions in the Chinese photovoltaic cell industry."
https://openalex.org/W2749243663,"Background Management of inpatients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires increasing resources. We aimed to identify factors associated with hospital readmissions among individuals with IBD. Materials & methods We collected data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database 2013. We identified individuals with index hospitalizations for IBD. Patient-specific factors, comorbidities and hospitalization characteristics were extracted for the index hospitalization. We performed logistic regression modeling to create adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day hospital readmission. Subgroup analysis was performed based on disease type and performance of surgery. Results We analyzed a total of 55,942 index hospital discharges; 3037 patients (7.0%) were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. Increasing patient age (> 65: OR: 0.45; 95% CI 0.39–0.53) was associated with a decreased risk of readmission, while a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (OR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.00–1.18) and male sex (OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.07–1.25) were associated with an increased risk of readmission. The comorbidities of smoking (OR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.00–1.19), anxiety (OR: 1.17; 95% CI 1.01–1.36) and opioid dependence (OR: 1.40; 95% CI 1.06–1.86) were associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission. Individual hospitalization characteristics and disease complications were significantly associated with readmission. Performance of a surgery during the index admission was associated with a decreased risk of readmission (OR: 0.57; 95% CI 0.33–0.96). Conclusion Analyzing data from a US publicly available all-payer inpatient healthcare database, we identified patient and hospitalization risk factors associated with 30-day readmission. Identifying patients at high risk for readmission may allow for interventions during or after the index hospitalization to decrease this risk."

Comparatively less effort has been aimed at providing a general prevalence estimate of discrimination using a nationally representative sample. The current study is intended to offer such an estimate using a large sample of American respondents (N = 14,793) while also exploring perceptions regarding why respondents felt they were discriminated against. The results provide a broad estimate of self-reported discrimination experiences—an event that was only reported by about one-quarter of all sample members—across racial and ethnic categories."
https://openalex.org/W2750266383,"Many Filipinos experience poverty and poor employment opportunities. In order to alleviate poverty and provide sufficient resources for their families, numerous mothers leave the Philippines to become domestic workers. The present study aimed to build a model of family resilience for transnational families. A total of 33 participants consisting of Filipino transnational families, domestic workers, and key informants participated in a series of focus group discussions and interviews. A new model of resilience among transnational families of Filipina domestic helpers was created using a constructivist grounded theory approach. The model highlighted how temporal and spatial elements are embedded in collective migration experiences. Family narratives begin with the sacrifice of separation, where mothers leave their families for a chance to solve economic problems. To successfully adapt to their separation, the families undergo five relational processes. First, families communicate across space using technology to bridge relational distance. Second, families restructure across space through role sharing and the validation of each other's efforts in their family roles. Third, families rebuild ties through temporary family reunification that bridge physical and relational distance. Fourth, families have the collective goal of permanent family reunification by ending migration to become complete again. Fifth, they strive to commit to their families by prioritizing them instead of succumbing to difficulties. Family resilience for transnational migrants is a collectivistic process, negotiated by each family member."
https://openalex.org/W2748232499,"The precise assembly of defined DNA sequences into plasmids is an essential task in bioscience research. While a number of molecular cloning techniques have been developed, many methods require specialized expensive reagents or laborious experimental procedure. Not surprisingly, conventional cloning techniques based on restriction digestion and ligation are still commonly used in routine DNA cloning. Here, we describe a simple, fast, and economical cloning method based on RecA- and RecET-independent in vivo recombination of DNA fragments with overlapping ends using E. coli. All DNA fragments were prepared by a 2-consecutive PCR procedure with Q5 DNA polymerase and used directly for transformation resulting in 95% cloning accuracy and zero background from parental template plasmids. Quantitative relationships were established between cloning efficiency and three factors–the length of overlapping nucleotides, the number of DNA fragments, and the size of target plasmids–which can provide general guidance for selecting in vivo cloning parameters. The method may be used to accurately assemble up to 5 DNA fragments with 25 nt overlapping ends into relatively small plasmids, and 3 DNA fragments into plasmids up to 16 kb in size. The whole cloning procedure may be completed within 2 days by a researcher with little training in cloning. The combination of high accuracy and zero background eliminates the need for screening a large number of colonies. The method requires no enzymes other than Q5 DNA polymerase, has no sequence restriction, is highly reliable, and represents one of the simplest, fastest, and cheapest cloning techniques available. Our method is particularly suitable for common cloning tasks in the lab where the primary goal is to quickly generate a plasmid with a pre-defined sequence at low costs."
https://openalex.org/W2894732762,"Purpose The prevalence of gastroesophagel reflux disease (GERD) has steadily increased. However, the association between GERD itself and the risk of pneumonia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between GERD and long-term risk of pneumonia and to identify the major risk factors for pneumonia in GERD patients. Methods Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients who were newly diagnosed with GERD and treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2010. Two groups comprising 15,715 GERD cases and 15,715 non-GERD matched controls were generated using propensity score matching, thereby making the differences in basic demographics, concomitant medication use, and comorbidities between the two groups inconsiderable. Results Cumulative incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the patients with GERD than that in the non-GERD matched controls, with an adjusted HR of 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31–1.67; P < 0.001) within 6-year follow-ups. Multivariate stratified analyses revealed similar results in many subgroups, with a highest risk in individuals younger than 40 years of age (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.48–3.19). Crucially, patients with GERD using PPIs longer than 4 months were at a significantly increased risk of pneumonia than those who did not use PPIs or took PPIs less than 4 months. Conclusions GERD was significantly associated with long-term risk of pneumonia, especially in GERD with PPI use longer than 4 months or in the young population. Further prospective longitudinal studies should be conducted for validation and implementing clinical practice guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2745383468,"A modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain capable of overexpressing the estA gene, an encoding gene for a membrane-bound esterase, was constructed and its rhamnolipid (RML) production was studied. Fermentations using wild-type (WT) and modified P. aeruginosa strains were conducted until exhaustion of glycerol in Medium Salt Production, using two different C/N ratios. At a C/N of 83.2, the modified strain produced up to 3.9 times more RMLs than the WT, yielding a maximum concentration of 14.62 g/L RML when measured by HPLC and 22 g/L by the orcinol assay. Cell-free supernatant from the modified strain reduced surface tension to 29.4 mN/m and had a CMC of 240 mg/L and CMD of 56.05. This is the first report on the construction of an estA-based recombinant strain for RML production."
https://openalex.org/W2746670893,"Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI enables non-invasive, quantitative measurements of tissue perfusion, and has a broad range of applications including brain functional imaging. However, ASL suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting image resolution. Acquisitions using 3D readouts are optimal for background-suppression of static signals, but can be SAR intensive and typically suffer from through-plane blurring. In this study, we investigated the use of accelerated 3D readouts to obtain whole-brain, high-SNR ASL perfusion maps and reduce SAR deposition. Parallel imaging was implemented along the partition-encoding direction in a pseudo-continuous ASL sequence with background-suppression and 3D RARE Stack-Of-Spirals readout, and its performance was evaluated in three small cohorts. First, both non-accelerated and two-fold accelerated single-shot versions of the sequence were evaluated in healthy volunteers during a motor-photic task, and the performance was compared in terms of temporal SNR, GM-WM contrast, and statistical significance of the detected activation. Secondly, single-shot 1D-accelerated imaging was compared to a two-shot accelerated version to assess benefits of SNR and spatial resolution for applications in which temporal resolution is not paramount. Third, the efficacy of this approach in clinical populations was assessed by applying the single-shot 1D-accelerated version to a larger cohort of elderly volunteers. Accelerated data demonstrated the ability to detect functional activation at the subject level, including cerebellar activity, without loss in the perfusion signal temporal stability and the statistical power of the activations. The use of acceleration also resulted in increased GM-WM contrast, likely due to reduced through-plane partial volume effects, that were further attenuated with the use of two-shot readouts. In a clinical cohort, image quality remained excellent, and expected effects of age and sex on cerebral blood flow could be detected. The sequence is freely available upon request for academic use and could benefit a broad range of cognitive and clinical neuroscience research."
https://openalex.org/W2748922239,"In the mammalian organ of Corti (OC), the stereocilia on the apical surface of hair cells (HCs) are uniformly organized in a neural to abneural axis (or medial-laterally). This organization is regulated by planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. Mutations of PCP genes, such as Vangl2, Dvl1/2, Celsr1, and Fzd3/6, affect the formation of HC orientation to varying degrees. Prickle1 is a PCP signaling gene that belongs to the prickle / espinas / testin family. Prickle1 protein is shown to be asymmetrically localized in the HCs of the OC, and this asymmetric localization is associated with loss of PCP in Smurf mutants, implying that Prickle1 is involved in HC PCP development in the OC. A follow-up study found no PCP polarity defects after loss of Prickle1 (Prickle1-/-) in the cochlea. We show here strong Prickle1 mRNA expression in the spiral ganglion by in situ hybridization and β-Gal staining, and weak expression in the OC by β-Gal staining. Consistent with this limited expression in the OC, cochlear HC PCP is unaffected in either Prickle1C251X/C251X mice or Prickle1f/f; Pax2-cre conditional null mice. Meanwhile, type II afferents of apical spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) innervating outer hair cells (OHC) have unusual neurite growth. In addition, afferents from the apex show unusual collaterals in the cochlear nuclei that overlap with basal turn afferents. Our findings argue against the role of Prickle1 in regulating hair cell polarity in the cochlea. Instead, Prickle1 regulates the polarity-related growth of distal and central processes of apical SGNs."
https://openalex.org/W2746971316,"Human cardiac myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells (hCM) have invigorated interest in genetic disease mechanisms and cardiac safety testing; however, the technology to fully assess electrophysiological function in an assay that is amenable to high throughput screening has lagged. We describe a fully contactless system using optical pacing with an infrared (IR) laser and multi-site high fidelity fluorescence imaging to assess multiple electrophysiological parameters from hCM monolayers in a standard 96-well plate. Simultaneous multi-site action potentials (FluoVolt) or Ca2+ transients (Fluo4-AM) were measured, from which high resolution maps of conduction velocity and action potential duration (APD) were obtained in a single well. Energy thresholds for optical pacing were determined for cell plating density, laser spot size, pulse width, and wavelength and found to be within ranges reported previously for reliable pacing. Action potentials measured using FluoVolt and a microelectrode exhibited the same morphology and rate of depolarization. Importantly, we show that this can be achieved accurately with minimal damage to hCM due to optical pacing or fluorescence excitation. Finally, using this assay we demonstrate that hCM exhibit reproducible changes in repolarization and impulse conduction velocity for Flecainide and Quinidine, two well described reference compounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate a high fidelity electrophysiological screening assay that incorporates optical pacing with IR light to control beating rate of hCM monolayers."
https://openalex.org/W2747938726,"RD1-based Interferon-γ Release Assays (IGRAs) cannot distinguish latent from active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Conversely, a positive response to heparin-binding haemagglutinin (HBHA)-based IGRAs, among TB-infected subjects, correlates with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) containment and low risk of TB progression. The aim of this study was to characterize HBHA-immune responses in HIV-infected and uninfected subjects with active TB or latent TB infection (LTBI).49 subjects were prospectively enrolled: 22 HIV-uninfected (13 TB, 9 LTBI) and 27 HIV-infected (12 HIV-TB, 15 HIV-LTBI). Whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with HBHA and RD1 antigens. Interferon (IFN)γ release was evaluated by ELISA whereas cytokine profile [IFNγ, tumor necrosis (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)2] and phenotype (CD45RA, CCR7) by flow cytometry.Among LTBI individuals, HBHA stimulation induced IFNγ release in all the HIV-uninfected, while, only 4/15 HIV-infected responded. Within the active TB, only 5/13 HIV-uninfected and 1/12 HIV-TB patients responded. Interestingly, by cytometry we showed that CD4+ T-cells response to HBHA was significantly impaired in the HIV-infected subjects with TB or LTBI compared to the HIV-uninfected subjects. The phenotype of HBHA-specific CD4 T-cells showed a predominantly central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) phenotype without differences among the groups. Differently, HBHA-specific CD8+ T-cells, showed mainly a CM and naïve phenotype in LTBI group while TB, HIV-LTBI and HIV-TB groups were characterized by EM or terminally differentiated phenotypes. Interestingly, differently than what observed for RD1, the cytokine profile of HBHA-specific T-cells evaluated by cytometry showed that the CD4+ T-cells were mostly monofunctional. Conversely, CD8-specific T-cells were mostly monofunctional for both HBHA and RD1 stimulations.These results characterize the impact of HIV infection in CD4- and CD8-specific response to HBHA in both LTBI and TB patients. HIV infection impairs the CD4 response to HBHA and likely this may lead to an impairment of TB control."
https://openalex.org/W2748962985,"Objective Requiring only 10–15 minutes to complete, the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA-B) has high clinical utility as a brief measure of functional capacity. This study aimed to validate the UPSA-B in adults living with HIV/AIDS (HIV+), and identify whether the UPSA-B can be used as an indicator of functional dependence in this population. Method One hundred and three HIV+ adults and 91 HIV- adults completed a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical battery, including a self-report measure of functional status (IADL Dependence vs. IADL Independence), an objective measure of functional capacity (UPSA-B), and a self-report measure of mood states including a subscale related to cognitive difficulties (Profile of Mood States [POMS]-Confusion/Bewilderment subscale). Results HIV+ participants had significantly lower UPSA-B scores than their HIV- counterparts (p = 0.02), although this fell to a trend (p = 0.08) when including covariates. Among the HIV+ group, higher UPSA-B scores were related to better neuropsychological ability, but unrelated to self-reported functional independence. Conversely, UPSA-B scores were unrelated to participant-reported cognitive difficulties on the POMS Confusion/Bewilderment subscale. An ROC curve was generated to determine the optimal UPSA-B value for discriminating between normal neuropsychological functioning versus neuropsychological impairment, with results indicating an optimal cutoff of 79. The UPSA-B identified HIV+ persons with cognitive impairment with 70.9% accuracy. Conclusions The UPSA-B was able to differentiate neuropsychological impairment from no impairment among HIV+ participants and holds promise as a clinical screening tool in this population. However, indicators of functional disability among adults living with HIV is still not well understood and is likely multifactorial in nature. These data highlight the complex interplay between objective functional capacity, neurocognitive ability, subjective cognitive symptoms, and functional dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2745994394,"To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9±10.0 years) with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7±15.6 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions.DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3±47.7mm3 vs. 153.0±47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3±6.7mm2 vs. 27.4±7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32±0.22 vs. 1.22±0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged.OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and ganglionopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2745556448,"There is an intricate interaction between iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) physiology in diatoms. However, strategies to cope with low Cu are largely unknown. This study unveils the comprehensive restructuring of the photosynthetic apparatus in the diatom Thalassiosira oceanica (CCMP1003) in response to low Cu, at the physiological and proteomic level. The restructuring results in a shift from light harvesting for photochemistry—and ultimately for carbon fixation—to photoprotection, reducing carbon fixation and oxygen evolution. The observed decreases in the physiological parameters Fv/Fm, carbon fixation, and oxygen evolution, concomitant with increases in the antennae absorption cross section (σPSII), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the conversion factor (φe:C/ηPSII) are in agreement with well documented cellular responses to low Fe. However, the underlying proteomic changes due to low Cu are very different from those elicited by low Fe. Low Cu induces a significant four-fold reduction in the Cu-containing photosynthetic electron carrier plastocyanin. The decrease in plastocyanin causes a bottleneck within the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC), ultimately leading to substantial stoichiometric changes. Namely, 2-fold reduction in both cytochrome b6f complex (cytb6f) and photosystem II (PSII), no change in the Fe-rich PSI and a 40- and 2-fold increase in proteins potentially involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ferredoxin and ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase, respectively). Furthermore, we identify 48 light harvesting complex (LHC) proteins in the publicly available genome of T. oceanica and provide proteomic evidence for 33 of these. The change in the LHC composition within the antennae in response to low Cu underlines the shift from photochemistry to photoprotection in T. oceanica (CCMP1003). Interestingly, we also reveal very significant intra-specific strain differences. Another strain of T. oceanica (CCMP 1005) requires significantly higher Cu concentrations to sustain both its maximal and minimal growth rate compared to CCMP 1003. Under low Cu, CCMP 1005 decreases its growth rate, cell size, Chla and total protein per cell. We argue that the reduction in protein per cell is the main strategy to decrease its cellular Cu requirement, as none of the other parameters tested are affected. Differences between the two strains, as well as differences between the well documented responses to low Fe and those presented here in response to low Cu are discussed."

We included patients who were ≥40 years old that had undergone RHA and RKA. For each T2DM patient, we selected a year-, gender-, age- and Charlson Comorbidity Index-matched non-diabetic patient.We identified 44,055 and 39,938 patients who underwent RHA (12.72% with T2DM) and RKA (15.01% with T2DM). We matched 4,700 and 5,394 couples with RHA and RKA, respectively. Any IHPC was more frequent among patients with T2DM than among non-T2DM patients (19% vs. 15.64% in the RHA cohort and 12.94% vs. 11.09% in the RKA cohort, respectively). For patients who underwent RHA, postoperative infection (4.51% vs. 2.94%, p<0.001), acute post-hemorrhagic anemia (9.53% vs. 7.70%, p<0.001), mean LOHS and IHM were significantly higher in patients with T2DM. Among RKA patients, the incidence of acute posthemorrhagic anemia (7.21% vs. 5.62%; p = 0.001) and urinary tract infection (1.13% vs. 0.72%; p = 0.029) was significantly higher in patients with diabetes. Older age, obesity, infection due to internal joint prosthesis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, mild liver disease and renal disease and emergency room admission were significantly associated with a higher risk of IHPC in T2DM patients. IHPC decreased over time only in T2DM patients who underwent RHA (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.98).Patients with T2DM who underwent RHA and RKA procedures had more IHPC after controlling for the effects of possible confounders. LOHS and IHM were also higher among RHA patients with diabetes. Older age, comorbidity, obesity and emergency room admission were strong predictors of IHPC in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2748711607,"We learn language from our social environment. In general, the more sources we have, the less informative each of them is, and the less weight we should assign it. If this is the case, people who interact with fewer others should be more susceptible to the influence of each of their interlocutors. This paper tests whether indeed people who interact with fewer other people have more malleable phonological representations. Using a perceptual learning paradigm, this paper shows that individuals who regularly interact with fewer others are more likely to change their boundary between /d/ and /t/ following exposure to an atypical speaker. It further shows that the effect of number of interlocutors is not due to differences in ability to learn the speaker’s speech patterns, but specific to likelihood of generalizing the learned pattern. These results have implications for both language learning and language change, as they suggest that individuals with smaller social networks might play an important role in propagating linguistic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2746522122,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase, is essentially and transiently expressed in the developing nervous system. Here we examined the functional role of the ALK gene in glioblastomas (GBMs). In clinical samples of GBMs, high ALK expression without gene rearrangements or mutations was frequently observed in perivascular lesions, in contrast to the relatively low expression in the perinecrotic areas, which was positively correlated with N-myc and phosphorylated (p) Stat3 scores and Ki-67 labeling indices. ALK immunoreactivity was also found to be associated with neovascular features including vascular co-option and vascular mimicry. In astrocytoma cell lines, cells stably overexpressing full-length ALK showed an increase in expression of pStat3 and pAkt proteins, as well as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) mRNAs, in contrast to cells with knockdown of endogenous ALK which showed decreased expression of these molecules. Transfection of the constitutively active form of Stat3 induced an increase in HIF-1α promoter activity, and the overexpression of HIF-1α in turn resulted in enhancement of VEGF-A promoter activity. In addition, cells with overexpression or knockdown of ALK also showed a tendency toward increased and decreased proliferation, respectively, through changes in expression of pAkt and pStat3. Finally, ALK promoter was significantly activated by transfection of Sox4 and N-myc, which are known to contribute to neuronal properties. These findings therefore suggest that N-myc/Sox4-mediated ALK signaling cascades containing Stat3, Akt, HIF-1α, and VEGF-A confer multiple advantages to tumor growth through alterations in neovascularization and cell proliferation in GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2746892610,"Introduction Birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) is a strategy to promote timely use of skilled maternal and neonatal care during childbirth. According to World Health Organization, BPCR should be a key component of focused antenatal care. Dakshina Kannada, a coastal district of Karnataka state, is categorized as a high-performing district (institutional delivery rate >25%) under the National Rural Health Mission. However, a substantial proportion of women in the district experience complications during pregnancy (58.3%), childbirth (45.7%), and postnatal (17.4%) period. There is a paucity of data on BPCR practice and the factors associated with it in the district. Exploring this would be of great use in the evidence-based fine-tuning of ongoing maternal and child health interventions. Objective To assess BPCR practice and the factors associated with it among the beneficiaries of two rural Primary Health Centers (PHCs) of Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 217 pregnant (>28 weeks of gestation) and recently delivered (in the last 6 months) women in two randomly selected PHCs from June -September 2013. Exit interviews were conducted using a pre-designed semi-structured interview schedule. Information regarding socio-demographic profile, obstetric variables, and knowledge of key danger signs was collected. BPCR included information on five key components: identified the place of delivery, saved money to pay for expenses, mode of transport identified, identified a birth companion, and arranged a blood donor if the need arises. In this study, a woman who recalled at least two key danger signs in each of the three phases, i.e., pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum (total six) was considered as knowledgeable on key danger signs. Optimal BPCR practice was defined as following at least three out of five key components of BPCR. Outcome measures Proportion, Odds ratio, and adjusted Odds ratio (adj OR) for optimal BPCR practice. Results A total of 184 women completed the exit interview (mean age: 26.9±3.9 years). Optimal BPCR practice was observed in 79.3% (95% CI: 73.5–85.2%) of the women. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that age >26 years (adj OR = 2.97; 95%CI: 1.15–7.7), economic status of above poverty line (adj OR = 4.3; 95%CI: 1.12–16.5), awareness of minimum two key danger signs in each of the three phases, i.e., pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum (adj OR = 3.98; 95%CI: 1.4–11.1), preference to private health sector for antenatal care/delivery (adj OR = 2.9; 95%CI: 1.1–8.01), and woman’s discussion about the BPCR with her family members (adj OR = 3.4; 95%CI: 1.1–10.4) as the significant factors associated with optimal BPCR practice. Conclusion In this study population, BPCR practice was better than other studies reported from India. Healthcare workers at the grassroots should be encouraged to involve women’s family members while explaining BPCR and key danger signs with a special emphasis on young (<26 years) and economically poor women. Ensuring a reinforcing discussion between woman and her family members may further enhance the BPCR practice."
https://openalex.org/W2747909214,"Currently available genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) utilize calmodulins (CaMs) or troponin C from metazoa such as mammals, birds, and teleosts, as calcium-binding domains. The amino acid sequences of the metazoan calcium-binding domains are highly conserved, which may limit the range of the GECI key parameters and cause undesired interactions with the intracellular environment in mammalian cells. Here we have used fungi, evolutionary distinct organisms, to derive CaM and its binding partner domains and design new GECI with improved properties. We applied iterative rounds of molecular evolution to develop FGCaMP, a novel green calcium indicator. It includes the circularly permuted version of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sandwiched between the fungal CaM and a fragment of CaM-dependent kinase. FGCaMP is an excitation-ratiometric indicator that has a positive and an inverted fluorescence response to calcium ions when excited at 488 and 405 nm, respectively. Compared with the GCaMP6s indicator in vitro, FGCaMP has a similar brightness at 488 nm excitation, 7-fold higher brightness at 405 nm excitation, and 1.3-fold faster calcium ion dissociation kinetics. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated variants of FGCaMP with improved binding affinity to calcium ions and increased the magnitude of FGCaMP fluorescence response to low calcium ion concentrations. Using FGCaMP, we have successfully visualized calcium transients in cultured mammalian cells. In contrast to the limited mobility of GCaMP6s and G-GECO1.2 indicators, FGCaMP exhibits practically 100% molecular mobility at physiological concentrations of calcium ion in mammalian cells, as determined by photobleaching experiments with fluorescence recovery. We have successfully monitored the calcium dynamics during spontaneous activity of neuronal cultures using FGCaMP and utilized whole-cell patch clamp recordings to further characterize its behavior in neurons. Finally, we used FGCaMP in vivo to perform structural and functional imaging of zebrafish using wide-field, confocal, and light-sheet microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2748016511,"Background Mothers are frequently the first to observe the onset of jaundice in their newborn infants before the decision to seek treatment. However, simple-to-use tools that could facilitate early detection of jaundice and assist mothers to seek professional care, especially after hospital discharge, are rare. This study therefore, set out to evaluate the performance of a -two-color icterometer (Bilistrip™) as a possible screening tool for detecting significant jaundice by mothers or care-givers in the first week of life. Methods Prior to discharge, mothers in a maternity hospital were trained to use the Bilistrip™ on the blanched skin of their baby’s nose to ascertain absence (Light Yellow) or presence (Dark Yellow) of significant jaundice. Their babies had transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements independently, along with total serum bilirubin (TSB) if indicated. The reliability of Bilistrip™ as a screening test for significant jaundice was determined at different TcB and TSB thresholds. The predictive performance of Bilistrip™ was also evaluated with multivariable logistic regression. Results Some 2492 mother-infant pairs were enrolled over 15 months, of which 347 (13.9%) chose Dark Yellow. The mean TcB for Dark Yellow (10mg/dL) was significantly higher (p<0.001) than for Light Yellow (6.1mg/dL). Bilistrip™ showed increasing sensitivity (47.0% - 92.6%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (91.4% - 99.9%) for selected TcB thresholds (≥10mg/dL, ≥12mg/dL, ≥15mg/dL, and ≥17mg/dL). Among neonates with TSB measurements (n = 124), Bilistrip™ was associated also with increasing sensitivity (86.8% - 100%) and NPV (62.5% - 100%). The sensitivity and NPV for detecting neonates requiring phototherapy were 95.8% respectively. Only one of the 24 neonates who required phototherapy was missed by the Bilistrip™. Conclusions Bilistrip™ is a potential decision-making tool for empowering mothers to detect neonates with clinically significant jaundice that may require close monitoring or treatment, and neonates not requiring treatment for jaundice in the first week of life."
https://openalex.org/W2750367525,"The northwestern Gulf of Mexico shelf experiences one of the largest seasonal hypoxic zones in the western hemisphere. Hypoxia (dissolved oxygen, DO ≤ 2.0 mg·L-1) is most severe from May to August during the height of the Gulf shrimp fishery, but its effects on the fishery are not well known. Prior studies indicate that hypoxia alters the spatial dynamics of shrimp and other species through habitat loss and aggregation in nearby oxygenated refuge habitats. We hypothesized that hypoxia-induced changes in the distribution of shrimp also alter the spatial dynamics of the Gulf shrimp fleet. We integrated data on the geographic distribution of shrimp tows and bottom DO to evaluate the effects of hypoxia on spatial patterns in shrimping effort. Our analyses indicate that shrimping effort declines in low DO waters on both the Texas and Louisiana shelf, but that considerable effort still occurs in low DO waters off Louisiana, likely because riverine nutrients fuel both benthic production and low bottom DO in the same general regions. The response of the shrimp fleet to hypoxia on the Louisiana shelf was complex with shifts in effort inshore, offshore, westward, and eastward of the hypoxic zone, as well as to an oxygenated area between two hypoxia regimes associated with the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya River outflows. In contrast, effort on the Texas shelf mostly shifted offshore in response to low DO but also shifted inshore in some years. Spatial patterns in total shrimping effort were driven primarily by the number of shrimp tows, consistent with aggregation of the fleet outside of hypoxic waters, though tow duration also declined in low DO waters. Overall, our results demonstrate that hypoxia alters the spatial dynamics of the Gulf shrimp fishery with potential consequences for harvest interactions and the economic condition of the fishery."
https://openalex.org/W2750472899,"Background The role of oxidative stress in schizophrenia has been demonstrated, particularly in subjects with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). In such patients, the decreased levels of antioxidants in conjunction with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the brain exposes the neurons to a higher risk of damage. Methods and findings We evaluated the association of deletion polymorphisms of two genes of the antioxidant Glutathione S-Transferase family, GSTT1 and GSTM1, with susceptibility to TRS. A total of 54 TRS patients (mean age 38.7 years) and 78 healthy control subjects (mean age 39.0 years) were enrolled in this study. The subjects were matched by sex, age, and smoking and alcohol consumption habits. In the case group, the frequencies of GSTT1-null and GSTM1-null genotypes were 24.1 and 51.9%, respectively, whereas for the control group, the frequencies were 12.8 and 46.2%, respectively. Analysis performed with respect to the risk of developing TRS associated with the GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion polymorphisms, resulted in odds ratio (OR) values of 2.1 and 1.2, respectively. However, the association was not found to be significant (p = 0.1229 and p = 0.5916, respectively). The analysis performed with respect to the combined genotypes of GSTT1 and GSTM1 revealed that the double-null genotype confers a 4.6-fold increased risk of developing TRS (p = 0.0412). Conclusion The results of the present study indicate that a combination of GST deficiencies may play a role in enhanced susceptibility to TRS, and the present genotype of one of these genes may buffer the deficiency caused by the lack (null genotype) of the other. The results suggest that combined deletion polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 can have implications in the prediction of the clinical course of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2749162843,"Central-place foragers need to explore their immediate habitat in order to reach food. We let colonies of the individually foraging desert ant Cataglyphis niger search for a food reward in a maze. We did so for three tests per day over two successive days and an additional test after a time interval of 4–20 days (seven tests in total). We examined whether the colonies reached the food reward faster, consumed more food and changed the number of workers searching over time, within and between days. Colonies’ food-discovery time shortened within and between days, indicating that some workers learnt and became more efficient in moving through the maze. Such workers, however, also forgot and deteriorated in their food-discovery time, leveling off back to initial performance after about two weeks. We used mazes of increasing complexity levels, differing in the potential number of wrong turns. The number of workers searching increased with colony size. Food-discovery time also increased with colony size in complex mazes but not in simple ones, perhaps due to the more frequent interactions among workers in large colonies having to move through narrow routes. Finally, the motivation to solve the maze was probably not only the food reward, because food consumption did not change over time."
https://openalex.org/W2748322720,"Objectives 
To describe the process of adapting an intervention integrating occupational safety and health (OSH) and health promotion for manufacturing worksites in India and the challenges faced in implementing it; and explore how globalization trends may influence the implementation of these integrated approaches in India and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).


Methods 
This study—conducted in 22 manufacturing worksites in Mumbai, India—adapted and implemented an evidence-based intervention tested in the U.S. that integrated OSH and tobacco control. The systematic adaptation process included formative research and pilot testing, to ensure that the tested intervention was tailored to the local setting. We used qualitative methods and process evaluation to assess the extent to which this intervention was implemented, and to explore barriers to implementation.


Results 
While participating worksites agreed to implement this intervention, not all components of the adapted intervention were implemented fully in the 10 worksites assigned to the intervention condition. We found that the OSH infrastructure in India focused predominantly on regulatory compliance, medical screening (secondary prevention) and the treatment of injuries. We observed generally low levels of leadership support and commitment to OSH, evidenced by minimal management participation in the intervention, reluctance to discuss OSH issues with the study team or workers, and little receptivity to recommendations resulting from the industrial hygienist’s reports.


Conclusion 
India presents one example of a LMIC with a rising burden of non-communicable diseases and intensified exposures to both physical and organizational hazards on the job. Our experiences highlight the importance of national and global trends that shape workers’ experiences on the job and their related health outcomes. Beyond a singular focus on prevention of non-communicable diseases, coordinated national and international efforts are needed to address worker health outcomes in the context of the conditions of work that clearly shape them."
https://openalex.org/W2746315003,"Chickens are a major source of protein worldwide, yet infectious diseases continue to threaten the poultry industry. Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a subgroup of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), causes colibacillosis in chickens resulting in economic loss because of treatment, condemnation of products, and death. In this study, we evaluated a recombinant antigens (rAg) vaccine combining common ExPEC surface proteins EtsC, OmpA, OmpT, and TraT for broad protective potential against APEC infections in chickens. The specific objectives were to evaluate antibody (serum) and cytokines (lymphoid organs) responses to vaccination; in vitro bactericidal ability of serum and splenocytes against multiple APEC serotypes; and in vivo protection against APEC challenge in chickens. Groups of four-day old chickens (N = 10) were vaccinated twice (two-week interval) subcutaneously with rAgs alone or in combination and CpG adjuvant or PBS (control). IgY antibody in the serum and mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, IFN-γ, IL-4, IFN-β, and IL-8 in bursa, spleen, and thymus were measured using ELISA and RT-qPCR, respectively. Serum and splenocytes were tested for their bactericidal ability in vitro against multiple APEC isolates. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated chickens were challenged with 108 CFU of APEC-O2 via air sac at 31 days post first vaccination. Vaccine protection was determined by the decrease of bacterial loads in blood and organs (lung, heart, spleen, and liver), as well as gross colibacillosis lesion scores in air sac, heart, and liver. Vaccination significantly (P < 0.05) elicited IgY against specific antigens, induced immune related mRNA expression in the spleen and bursa, reduced in vitro growth of multiple APEC serotypes, and decreased bacterial loads in the heart and spleen, and gross lesion scores of the air sac, heart and liver in chickens. The vaccine reported may be used to provide broad protection against APEC strains, increasing animal welfare and food production."

Furthermore, no studies on the association of PUD with anthropometric indices, blood parameters, and nutritional components have been reported. The aim of this study was to assess associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters, nutritional components, and lifestyle factors with PUD in the Korean population.Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of the South Korean population using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters and nutritional components among patients with PUD.Age was the factor most strongly associated with PUD in women (p = <0.0001, odds ratio (OR) = 0.770 [0.683-0.869]) and men (p = <0.0001, OR = 0.715 [0.616-0.831]). In both crude and adjusted analyses, PUD was highly associated with weight (adjusted p = 0.0008, adjusted OR = 1.251 [95%CI: 1.098-1.426]), hip circumference (adjusted p = 0.005, adjusted OR = 1.198 [1.056-1.360]), and body mass index (adjusted p = 0.0001, adjusted OR = 1.303 [1.139-1.490]) in women and hip circumference (adjusted p = 0.0199, adjusted OR = 1.217 [1.031-1.435]) in men. PUD was significantly associated with intake of fiber (adjusted p = 0.0386, adjusted OR = 1.157 [1.008-1.328], vitamin B2 (adjusted p = 0.0477, adjusted OR = 1.155 [1.001-1.333]), sodium (adjusted p = 0.0154, adjusted OR = 1.191 [1.034-1.372]), calcium (adjusted p = 0.0079, adjusted OR = 1.243 [1.059-1.459]), and ash (adjusted p = 0.0468, adjusted OR = 1.152 [1.002-1.325] in women but not in men. None of the assessed blood parameters were associated with PUD in women, and only triglyceride level was associated with PUD in men (adjusted p = 0.0169, adjusted OR = 1.227 [1.037-1.451]).We found that obesity was associated with PUD in the Korean population; additionally, the association between nutritional components and PUD was greater in women than in men."
https://openalex.org/W2748863878,"It has been shown that the size of myocardial infarction in rats created by coronary ligation technique is not uniform, varying from 4% to 65%. We hypothesized that infarct size variability induced by coronary artery ligation might be caused by coronary artery branching pattern. Coronary artery angiography was performed in 50 normal Lewis rats and in chronic myocardial infarction models in which coronary artery was ligated immediately below the left atrial appendage or 2mm distal to the left atrial appendage (n = 25 for each), followed by histological analysis. Unlike the human, the rats had a single major septal artery arising from the proximal part of the left coronary artery (n = 30) or right coronary artery (n = 20). There were three branching patterns of left circumflex artery (LCX): 33 (66%) had LCX branching peripherally from a long left main coronary artery (LMCA), while the remainder 17 (34%) had the LCX branching from the proximal part of the septal artery or a short LMCA. The rats with distal coronary ligation presented myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory irrespective of LCX branching pattern. In the rats with proximal coronary ligation, 64% (n = 16) had broad myocardial infarction involving the anterior and lateral territories, while the remainder (36%, n = 9) had myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory with the intact LCX arising proximally from a short LMCA. The interventricular septum was spared from infarction in all rats because of its anatomical location. Infarct size variations were caused not only by ligation site but also by varying LCX branching patterns. There are potential risks to create different sizes of myocardial infarction, particularly when targeting a broad range of myocardial infarction. The territory of the septal artery always appears to be spared from myocardial infarction induced by the coronary ligation technique."

https://openalex.org/W2749930289,"Visual saliency maps reflecting locations that stand out from the background in terms of their low-level physical features have proven to be very useful for empirical research on attentional exploration and reliably predict gaze behavior. In the present study we tested these predictions for socially relevant stimuli occurring in naturalistic scenes using eye tracking. We hypothesized that social features (i.e. human faces or bodies) would be processed preferentially over non-social features (i.e. objects, animals) regardless of their low-level saliency. To challenge this notion, we included three tasks that deliberately addressed non-social attributes. In agreement with our hypothesis, social information, especially heads, was preferentially attended compared to highly salient image regions across all tasks. Social information was never required to solve a task but was regarded nevertheless. More so, after completing the task requirements, viewing behavior reverted back to that of free-viewing with heavy prioritization of social features. Additionally, initial eye movements reflecting potentially automatic shifts of attention, were predominantly directed towards heads irrespective of top-down task demands. On these grounds, we suggest that social stimuli may provide exclusive access to the priority map, enabling social attention to override reflexive and controlled attentional processes. Furthermore, our results challenge the generalizability of saliency-based attention models."

These are generally caused by either Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), M. bovis (MBO) or M. avium (MAV). To test the hypothesis that different species of pathogenic mycobacteria isolated from varied anatomic locations or animal species differ in virulence and pathogenicity, we performed experiments with three mycobacteria strains (NTSE-3(MTB), NTSE-4(MBO) and NTSE-5 (MAV)) obtained from animal species. Spoligotyping analysis was used to confirm both MTB and MBO strains while the MAV strain was confirmed by 16s rDNA sequencing. BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with the three strains at low and high CFU doses to evaluate variations in pathogenicity. Clinical and pathological parameters were assessed. Infected mice were euthanized at 80 days post-inoculation (dpi). Measures of lung and body weights indicated that the MBO infected group had higher mortality, more weight loss, higher bacterial burden and more severe lesions in lungs than the other two groups. Cytokine profiles showed higher levels of TNF-α for MBO versus MTB, while MAV had the highest amounts of IFN-β in vitro and in vivo. In vitro levels of other cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-β showed that Th1 cells had the strongest response in MBO infected mice and that Th2 cells were inhibited. We found that the level of virulence among the three isolates decreased in the following order MBO>MTB>MAV."
https://openalex.org/W2745468811,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been observed as an early event prior to the presence of clinical symptoms and is believed to be a crucial factor contributing to AD pathogenesis. Amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) disturb the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated postsynaptic Ca2+ signalling in response to presynaptic stimulation by increasing the availability of extracellular glutamate as well as directly disturbing the NMDARs. The abnormal Ca2+ response can further lead to impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), an important process in memory formation. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of a CA1 pyramidal dendritic spine and conduct computational experiments. We use this model to mimic alterations by AβOs under AD conditions to investigate how they are involved in the Ca2+ dysregulation in the dendritic spine. The alterations in glutamate availability, as well as NMDAR availability and activity, are studied both individually and globally. The simulation results suggest that alterations in glutamate availability mostly affect the synaptic response and have limited effects on the extrasynaptic receptors. Moreover, overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDARs in AD is unlikely to be induced by presynaptic stimulation, but by upregulation of the resting level of glutamate, possibly resulting from these alterations. Furthermore, internalisation of synaptic NR2A-NMDAR shows greater damage to the postsynaptic Ca2+ response in comparison with the internalisation of NR2B-NMDARs; thus, the suggested neuroprotective role of the latter is very limited during synaptic transmission in AD. We integrate a CaMKII state transition model with the Ca2+ model to further study the effects of alterations of NMDARs in the CaMKII state transition, an important downstream event in the early phase of LTP. The model reveals that cooperation between NR2A- and NR2B-NMDAR is required for LTP induction. Under AD conditions, internalisation of membrane NMDARs is suggested to be the cause of the loss of synapse numbers by disrupting CaMKII-NMDAR formation."
https://openalex.org/W2745813958,"CD154 (commonly referred to as CD40-ligand) is a critical T cell factor that participates in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and is over-expressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF-α blockade treatment had dramatic efficacy in RA.To investigate whether TNF-α blockade treatment can inhibit CD154 expression in RA.Blood samples were collected from 33 patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and 3 months after TNF-α blockade treatment. Clinical serological data determined by standard assays and T cell CD154 expression levels determined by flow cytometry were statistically analyzed for these two time points.The percentage of CD154 expression on gated CD4+ T cells of PBMCs from RA patients after 3 months TNF-α blockade treatment was significantly lower than before treatment (2.94 ± 3.21% vs. 7.21 ± 5.64%; p = 0.0001). The disease activity and anti-CCP antibody levels were also significantly reduced after TNF-α blockade treatment. The CD154 expression levels were positively correlated with disease activity index DAS28, and CRP. The post-stimulated CD154 expression percentage of purified CD4+ T cells between baseline and after TNF-α blockade treatment was not significantly different (p = 0.221). Baseline CD154 levels were positively correlated with treatment-induced changes in DAS28 (p = 0.014; r2 = 0.187).TNF-α blockade treatment significantly decreased the CD154 expression on CD4+ T cells, disease activity and anti-CCP antibody simultaneously in RA patients. However TNF-α blockade did not impair T cell capacity to express CD154 after stimulation. These results suggest that decreased CD154 expression after TNF-α blockade may be due to decreased RA disease activity but not direct inhibition of CD154 responsiveness of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2746340508,"The oral bacterial species Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, has plastic genomes that may be driven by homologous recombination with exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is incorporated by natural transformation and conjugation. However, bacteriophages and plasmids, both of which are main resources of exogenous DNA, do not exist in the known P. gingivalis genomes. This could be associated with an adaptive immunity system conferred by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes in P. gingivalis as well as innate immune systems such as a restriction-modification system. In a previous study, few immune targets were predicted for P. gingivalis CRISPR/Cas. In this paper, we analyzed 51 P. gingivalis genomes, which were newly sequenced, and publicly available genomes of 13 P. gingivalis and 46 other Porphyromonas species. We detected 6 CRISPR/Cas types (classified by sequence similarity of repeat) in P. gingivalis and 12 other types in the remaining species. The Porphyromonas CRISPR spacers with potential targets in the genus Porphyromonas were approximately 23 times more abundant than those with potential targets in other genus taxa (1,720/6,896 spacers vs. 74/6,896 spacers). Porphyromonas CRISPR/Cas may be involved in genome plasticity by exhibiting selective interference against intra- and interspecies nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2747738845,"Long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are increasingly being implicated as important factors in many aspects of cellular development, function, and disease, but remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lincRNA transcriptome using RNA-Seq data generated from human fetal RPE (fRPE), RPE derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-RPE), and undifferentiated iPS (iPS). In addition, we determine the suitability of iPS-RPE, from a transcriptome standpoint, as a model for use in future studies of lincRNA structure and function. A comparison of gene and isoform expression across the whole transcriptome shows only minimal differences between all sample types, though fRPE and iPS-RPE show higher concordance than either shows with iPS. Notably, RPE signature genes show the highest degree of fRPE to iPS-RPE concordance, indicating that iPS-RPE cells provide a suitable model for use in future studies. An analysis of lincRNAs demonstrates high concordance between fRPE and iPS-RPE, but low concordance between either RPE and iPS. While most lincRNAs are expressed at low levels (RPKM < 10), there is a high degree of concordance among replicates within each sample type, suggesting the expression is consistent, even at levels subject to high variability. Finally, we identified and annotated 180 putative novel genes in the fRPE samples, a majority of which are also expressed in the iPS-RPE. Overall, this study represents the first characterization of lincRNA expression in the human RPE, and provides a model for studying the role lincRNAs play in RPE development, function, and disease."

The recorded perfusion responses in PAD patients (n = 9) were better differentiated from the normal subjects (n = 7) using the model-based analysis rather than characterization using the apparent peak and time-to-peak of the responses. The analysis results suggested different amounts of microvascular disease within the patient group. Overall, this work demonstrates a novel analysis method and facilitates understanding of the physiology involved in ASL reactive hyperemia. ASL reactive hyperemia with model-based analysis may be used as a noninvasive microvascular assessment in the presence of arterial stenoses, allowing us to look beyond the macrovascular disease in PAD. A subgroup who will have a poor prognosis after revascularization in the patients with critical limb ischemia may be associated with more severe microvascular diseases, which may potentially be identified using ASL reactive hyperemia."
https://openalex.org/W2748970339,"Here, we established the Drosophila Giant Fiber neurons (GF) as a novel model to study axonal trafficking of L1-type Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAM) Neuroglian (Nrg) in the adult CNS using live imaging. L1-type CAMs are well known for their importance in nervous system development and we previously demonstrated a role for Nrg in GF synapse formation. However, in the adult they have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and regeneration. In addition, to its canonical role in organizing cytoskeletal elements at the plasma membrane, vertebrate L1CAM has also been shown to regulate transcription indirectly as well as directly via its import to the nucleus. Here, we intend to determine if the sole L1CAM homolog Nrg is retrogradley transported and thus has the potential to relay signals from the synapse to the soma. Live imaging of c-terminally tagged Nrg in the GF revealed that there are at least two populations of retrograde vesicles that differ in speed, and either move with consistent or varying velocity. To determine if endogenous Nrg is retrogradely transported, we inhibited two key regulators, Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) and Dynactin, of the retrograde motor protein Dynein. Similar to previously described phenotypes for expression of poisonous subunits of Dynactin, we found that developmental knock down of Lis1 disrupted GF synaptic terminal growth and that Nrg vesicles accumulated inside the stunted terminals in both mutant backgrounds. Moreover, post mitotic Lis1 knock down in mature GFs by either RNAi or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) induced mutations, resulted in normal length terminals with fully functional GF synapses which also exhibited severe accumulation of endogenous Nrg vesicles. Thus, our data suggests that accumulation of Nrg vesicles is due to failure of retrograde transport rather than a failure of terminal development. Together with the finding that post mitotic knock down of Lis1 also disrupted retrograde transport of tagged Nrg vesicles in GF axons, it demonstrates that endogenous Nrg protein is transported from the synapse to the soma in the adult central nervous system in a Lis1-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2746599294,"Background The VEGF gene polymorphism rs699947 related to clinical pathology, mortality, and recurrence of HCC. Few studies mentioned an association between VEGF gene polymorphisms with illness progression in chronic liver disease. We aimed to explore differences of VEGF gene polymorphism rs699947 in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Indonesian population. Methods A cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling and without matching was performed during a 3 years period (2011–2014) at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Blood DNA was sequenced from 123 subjects with chronic liver diseases [39 chronic hepatitis (CH), 39 liver cirrhosis (LC), and 45 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)]. 59 healthy subjects also participated. Using isolated VEGF genes for specific primers for rs699947, blood samples were examined by targeting DNA sequences with Applied Bio systems. All data were analyzed using STATA version 11.0 with significance level at P<0.05. Results The mean of age in HCC and LC subjects were older than in CH and healthy (P value <0.05); there were more males in LC, HCC and the healthy groups but not in CH (P>0.05). HBV was the dominant etiology in HCC, LC, and CH besides HCV and non HBV-HCV (P<0.05). There were significant differences in the SNP -2578 distributions of allele C compared to allele A in all subjects (healthy vs. LC, and HCC; LC vs. CH (P<0.05), but no significant difference A>C vs. C>C, and genotypes distribution. Proportion of SNP -2578 A>C vs. C>C CH 1.8:1; HCC 1.4:1; healthy 1.7:1; but its proportion in LC was inversed (1:1.2). Genotype A was low in all subjects (5%-11%). Significant difference of allele distribution was found in healthy vs. LC, and HCC; CH vs. LC. Based on HWE analyses, distribution of allele C was dominant. There were not significant differences in deletion, insertion-deletion at -2547 until -2526, and haplotype (Ht) CCGACCCC (P>0.05). The OR analyses of allele and SNP showed that allele A can be a predictor of disease progression in LC to HCC (OR 2.26) and healthy to LC (OR 1.65); and SNP A>C also can be a predictor in healthy to HCC (OR 1.41) and CH (OR 1.14). Conclusion The occurrence of allele A and SNP A>C VEGF gene (-2578) might predict illness progression from healthy to CH, LC or HCC and LC to HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2748058058,"Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression contributes to many developmental transitions. Previously, we found that the AAA chaperone Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) regulates ecdysone-dependent dendrite pruning of Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (c4da) neurons via an effect on RNA metabolism. In a search for RNA binding proteins associated with VCP, we identified the spliceosome-associated protein Mfap1, a component of the tri-snRNP complex. Mfap1 is a nucleolar protein in neurons and its levels are regulated by VCP. Mfap1 binds to VCP and TDP-43, a disease-associated RNA-binding protein. via distinct regions in its N- and C-terminal halfs. Similar to vcp mutations, Mfap1 overexpression causes c4da neuron dendrite pruning defects and mislocalization of TDP-43 in these cells, but genetic analyses show that Mfap1 is not a crucial VCP target during dendrite pruning. Finally, rescue experiments with a lethal mfap1 mutant show that the VCP binding region is not essential for Mfap1 function, but may act to increase its stability or activity."
https://openalex.org/W2747195246,"Sotalia guianensis is a small dolphin that is vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts. Along the Brazilian Atlantic coast, this species is threatened with extinction. A prioritized action plan for conservation strategies relies on increased knowledge of the population. The scarcity of studies about genetic diversity and assessments of population structure for this animal have precluded effective action in the region. Here, we assessed, for the first time, the genetic differentiation at 14 microsatellite loci in 90 S. guianensis specimens stranded on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil. We estimated population parameters and structure, measured the significance of global gametic disequilibrium and the intensity of non-random multiallelic interallelic associations and constructed a provisional synteny map using Bos taurus, the closest terrestrial mammal with a reference genome available. All microsatellite loci were polymorphic, with at least three and a maximum of ten alleles each. Allele frequencies ranged from 0.01 to 0.97. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.061 to 0.701. The mean inbreeding coefficient was 0.103. Three loci were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium even when missing genotypes were inferred. Although 77 of the 91 possible two-locus associations were in global gametic equilibrium, we unveiled 13 statistically significant, sign-based, non-random multiallelic interallelic associations in 10 two-locus combinations with either coupling (D' values ranging from 0.782 to 0.353) or repulsion (D' values -0.517 to -1.000) forces. Most of the interallelic associations did not involve the major alleles. Thus, for either physically or non-physically linked loci, measuring the intensity of non-random interallelic associations is important for defining the evolutionary forces at equilibrium. We uncovered a small degree of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.010; P-value = 0.463) with a hierarchical clustering into one segment containing members from the southern and northern coastal regions. The data thus support the scenario of little genetic structure in the population of S. guianensis in this geographic area."
https://openalex.org/W2747223476,"African adolescents and young adults remain at substantial risk of infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and AIDS is the leading cause of death among African adolescents (10–19 years). Sexual partnership patterns influence transmission risk of sexually transmitted infections. We describe patterns reported by youth (15-30y) in a community-based survey in Tanzania. Among participants reporting multiple partners, we investigated factors associated with reported concurrency. Female (N = 6513) and male (N = 7301) participants had median ages of 21 and 22 years, respectively. Most participants (92%) reported having previously been sexually active, of whom 15% of males and <1% of females reported ≥4 partners in the past year. The point prevalence of concurrency was 2.3% (95%CI 1.9–2.9) for females and 10.6% (95%CI 9.3–12.1) for males. High levels of multiple and concurrent partnerships were reported by those previously married. Females were more likely than males to report having spousal/regular partners and longer partnership lengths. Compared to males, the partnerships reported by females were less likely to be new partnerships, and more likely to be defined by the respondent as still ‘ongoing’. Females reporting younger sexual debut were more likely to report concurrent sexual partners. Far fewer young women reported multiple and concurrent partnerships, but we cannot definitively conclude that concurrency was uncommon for women, because stigma towards women’s multiple sexual partnerships might contribute to substantial under-reporting, as was found in extensive qualitative research in the study population. This study provides one of the most comprehensive quantitative descriptions of partnership patterns of young people in an African setting. Interventions addressing sexual risk among youth should involve male partners, empower women to protect themselves within different types of partnerships, and encourage a greater openness about young people’s sexual relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2748525021,"Powder-injectors use gas propulsion to deposit lyophilised drug or vaccine particles in the epidermal and sub epidermal layers of the skin. We prepared dry-powder (Tg = 45.2 ± 0.5°C) microparticles (58.1 μm) of a MenY-CRM197 glyconjugate vaccine (0.5% wt.) for intradermal needle-free powder injection (NFPI). SFD used ultrasound atomisation of the liquid vaccine-containing excipient feed, followed by lyophilisation above the glass transition temperature (Tg' = - 29.9 ± 0.3°C). This resulted in robust particles (density~ 0.53 ±0.09 g/cm3) with a narrow volume size distribution (mean diameter 58.1 μm, and span = 1.2), and an impact parameter (ρvr ~ 11.5 kg/m·s) sufficient to breach the Stratum corneum (sc). The trehalose, manitol, dextran (10 kDa), dextran (150 kDa) formulation, or TMDD (3:3:3:1), protected the MenY-CRM197 glyconjugate during SFD with minimal loss, no detectable chemical degradation or physical aggregation. In a capsular group Y Neisseria meningitidis serum bactericidal assay (SBA) with human serum complement, the needle free vaccine, which contained no alum adjuvant, induced functional protective antibody responses in vivo of similar magnitude to the conventional vaccine injected by hypodermic needle and syringe and containing alum adjuvant. These results demonstrate that needle-free vaccination is both technically and immunologically valid, and could be considered for vaccines in development."
https://openalex.org/W2749834165,"Reptiles are the first amniotes to develop an intromitent penis, however until now the mechanisms involved in the electrical field stimulation-induced contraction on corpora cavernosa isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus were not investigated. Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa were mounted in 10 mL organ baths for isometric tension recording. Electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions were performed in presence/absence of phentolamine (10 μM), guanethidine (30 μM), tetrodotoxin (1 μM and 1mM), A-803467 (10 μM), 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine (1 mM), salsolinol (3 μM) and a modified Krebs solution (equimolar substitution of NaCl by N-methyl–D-glucamine). Immuno-histochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase was also performed. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 8 Hz and 16 Hz) caused contractions in both Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa. The contractions were abolished by previous incubation with either phentolamine or guanethidine. Tetrodotoxin (1 μM) also abolished the EFS-induced contractions of rabbit CC, but did not affect EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC. Addition of A-803467 (10 μM) did not change the EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC but abolished rabbit CC contractions. 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine and salsolinol had no effect on EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC and Rabbit CC. Replacement of NaCl by N- Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) abolished EFS-induced contractions of rabbit CC, but did not affect Crotalus CC. The presence of tyrosine hydroxylase was identified in endothelial cells only of Crotalus CC. Since the EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC is dependent on catecholamine release, insensitive to TTX, insensitive to A803467 and to NaCl replacement, it indicates that the source of cathecolamine is unlikely to be from adrenergic terminals. The finding that tyrosine hydroxylase is present in endothelial cells suggests that these cells can modulate Crotalus CC tone."
https://openalex.org/W2746371589,"Chemically diverse fragments tend to collectively bind at localized sites on proteins, which is a cornerstone of fragment-based techniques. A central question is how general are these strategies for predicting a wide variety of molecular interactions such as small molecule-protein, protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid for both experimental and computational methods. To address this issue, we recently proposed three governing principles, (1) accurate prediction of fragment-macromolecule binding free energy, (2) accurate prediction of water-macromolecule binding free energy, and (3) locating sites on a macromolecule that have high affinity for a diversity of fragments and low affinity for water. To test the generality of these concepts we used the computational technique of Simulated Annealing of Chemical Potential to design one small fragment to break the RecA-RecA protein-protein interaction and three fragments that inhibit peptide-deformylase via water-mediated multi-body interactions. Experiments confirm the predictions that 6-hydroxydopamine potently inhibits RecA and that PDF inhibition quantitatively tracks the water-mediated binding predictions. Additionally, the principles correctly predict the essential bound waters in HIV Protease, the surprisingly extensive binding site of elastase, the pinpoint location of electron transfer in dihydrofolate reductase, the HIV TAT-TAR protein-RNA interactions, and the MDM2-MDM4 differential binding to p53. The experimental confirmations of highly non-obvious predictions combined with the precise characterization of a broad range of known phenomena lend strong support to the generality of fragment-based methods for characterizing molecular recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2746864986,"Several studies of self-monitoring dysfunction in schizophrenia have focused on the sense of agency to motor action using behavioral and psychophysiological techniques. So far, no study has ever tried to investigate whether the sense of agency or causal attribution for external events produced by self-generated decision-making is abnormal in schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to investigate neural responses to feedback information produced by self-generated or other-generated decision-making in a multiplayer gambling task using even-related potentials and electroencephalogram synchronization. We found that the late positive component and theta/alpha synchronization were increased in response to feedback information in the self-decision condition in normal controls, but that these responses were significantly decreased in patients with schizophrenia. These neural activities thus reflect the self-reference effect that affects the cognitive appraisal of external events following decision-making and their impairment in schizophrenia."
