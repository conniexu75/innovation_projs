https://openalex.org/W2013657375,"Theories of the regulation of cognition suggest a system with two necessary components: one to implement control and another to monitor performance and signal when adjustments in control are needed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task-switching version of the Stroop task were used to examine whether these components of cognitive control have distinct neural bases in the human brain. A double dissociation was found. During task preparation, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) was more active for color naming than for word reading, consistent with a role in the implementation of control. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's areas 24 and 32) was more active when responding to incongruent stimuli, consistent with a role in performance monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2137755719,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates gene expression in response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We determined the transcriptional scope of the UPR using DNA microarrays. Rather than regulating only ER-resident chaperones and phospholipid biosynthesis, as anticipated from earlier work, the UPR affects multiple ER and secretory pathway functions. Studies of UPR targets engaged in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) reveal an intimate coordination between these responses: efficient ERAD requires an intact UPR, and UPR induction increases ERAD capacity. Conversely, loss of ERAD leads to constitutive UPR induction. Finally, simultaneous loss of ERAD and the UPR greatly decreases cell viability. Thus, the UPR and ERAD are dynamic responses required for the coordinated disposal of misfolded proteins even in the absence of acute stress."
https://openalex.org/W1965717790,"We have conducted genetic screens for period length mutants in Arabidopsis using a transgenic bioluminescence phenotype. This screen identified mutations at a locus, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), that lengthen the free-running period of clock-controlled gene transcription and cell expansion, and alter the timing of the daylength-dependent transition from vegetative to floral development. Map-based cloning of ZTL identified a novel 609 amino acid polypeptide consisting of an amino-terminal PAS domain, an F box and six carboxy-terminal kelch repeats. The PAS region is highly similar to the PAS domain of the Arabidopsis blue-light receptor NPH1, and the Neurospora circadian-associated protein WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1). The striking fluence rate-dependent effect of the ztl mutations suggests that ZTL plays a primary role in the photocontrol of circadian period in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2112981236,"The ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family link actin filaments of cell surface structures to the plasma membrane, using a C-terminal F-actin binding segment and an N-terminal FERM domain, a common membrane binding module. ERM proteins are regulated by an intramolecular association of the FERM and C-terminal tail domains that masks their binding sites. The crystal structure of a dormant moesin FERM/tail complex reveals that the FERM domain has three compact lobes including an integrated PTB/PH/ EVH1 fold, with the C-terminal segment bound as an extended peptide masking a large surface of the FERM domain. This extended binding mode suggests a novel mechanism for how different signals could produce varying levels of activation. Sequence conservation suggests a similar regulation of the tumor suppressor merlin."

We isolated a late-flowering Arabidopsis mutant, fkf1, that is rescued by vemalization or gibberellin treatment. We positionally cloned FKF1, which encodes a novel protein with a PAS domain similar to the flavin-binding region of certain photoreceptors, an F box characteristic of proteins that direct ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and six kelch repeats predicted to fold into a beta propeller. FKF1 mRNA levels oscillate with a circadian rhythm, and deletion of FKF1 alters the waveform of rhythmic expression of two clock-controlled genes, implicating FKF1 in modulating the Arabidopsis circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1694932661,"Logging and the building of roads through forests results in their fragmentation. Around the perimeter of each forest fragment is an edge where ecological changes start to take place. Eventually, the edge effect leads to recession of the forest edges and diminution of the fragment until it disappears. As [Gascon and colleagues][1] explain in their Perspective, this worrying trend is a particular problem in tropical forests. The authors propose ways in which conservationists can prevent the loss of forest fragments (which are often protected areas surrounded by agricultural land) through carefully thought out conservation planning and management schemes.

https://openalex.org/W2043529152,"Targeted deletion of metabotropic glutamate receptor-subtype 1 (mGluR1) gene can cause defects in development and function in the cerebellum. We introduced the mGluR1alpha transgene into mGluR1-null mutant [mGluR1 (-/-)] mice with a Purkinje cell (PC)-specific promoter. mGluR1-rescue mice showed normal cerebellar long-term depression and regression of multiple climbing fiber innervation, events significantly impaired in mGluR1 (-/-) mice. The impaired motor coordination was rescued by this transgene, in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that mGluR1 in PCs is a key molecule for normal synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and motor control in the cerebellum."

However, little is known about the mechanism of how ASK1 executes apoptosis. Here we investigated the roles of caspases and mitochondria in ASK1-induced apoptosis. We found that benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk), a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, mostly inhibited ASK1-induced cell death, suggesting that caspases are required for ASK1-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of ASK1ΔN, a constitutively active mutant of ASK1, induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 but not of caspase-8-like proteases. Consistently, caspase-8-deficient (Casp8 −/−) cells were sensitive to ASK1-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-8 is dispensable for ASK1-induced apoptosis, whereas ASK1 failed to activate caspase-3 in caspase-9-dificient (Casp9 −/−) cells. Moreover, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk, preceded the onset of caspase-3 activation and cell death induced by ASK1. ASK1 thus appears to execute apoptosis mainly by the mitochondria-dependent caspase activation.

Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ced-9 protects cells from undergoing apoptosis (8Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The structural and functional homolog of Ced-9 in mammals has been identified as Bcl-2, which belongs to a large family of molecules involved in either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic signals (9Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 10Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The mammalian counterpart of Ced-3 has been identified as caspase-3, a member of a large family of intracellular proteases that play central roles in apoptotic machinery (11Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Ced-4 homolog has been identified and termed apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf1), which is essential for the activation of caspase-9, another Ced-3 homolog (12Zou H. Henzei W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar,13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of pro-apoptotic signals, the activation of caspases is consistently implicated in apoptosis (14Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 15Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Among the caspase family, the effector caspases represented by caspase-3 are frequently activated in response to various apoptosis inducers and essential for the execution and completion of apoptosis in many, but not all, cell types or death stimuli (16Porter A.G. Jänicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Pathways leading to activation of the effector caspases have been identified to be either dependent or independent on the mitochondrial release of cytochromec into the cytosol (17Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). The released cytochromec, together with dATP, binds to Apaf-1, which in turn activates an initiator caspase, caspase-9 (13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Another initiator caspase, caspase-8, mainly mediates cytochrome c-independent death signal, which is initiated upon ligation of death receptors (18Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar,19Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). These two pathways converge on the activation of the effector caspases followed by cleavage of a variety of apoptotic substrates. Activation of the effector caspases appears to be tightly regulated by a divergent signaling mechanism including the members of Bcl-2 family;e.g., a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is cleaved by caspase-8, and the truncated Bid induces the mitochondrial cytochrome c release (20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). In addition to caspase and Bcl-2 families, a number of signaling molecules have been suggested to regulate apoptosis (22Dragovich T. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3207-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase family are involved in signal transduction of apoptosis as well as cell growth and differentiation (23Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 24Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Two different MAP kinase cascades that converge on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also known as SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase) and p38 MAP kinase are preferentially activated by cytotoxic stressors such as UV radiation, x-ray, heat shock and osmotic shock, and by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 26Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

The possible roles of JNK pathway in apoptosis signaling have been demonstrated by knockout mouse studies. Mice lacking the JNK3 gene were reported to exhibit marked reduction in excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons (28Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincón M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). JNK2 was shown to be required for apoptosis of immature thymocytes induced by anti-CD3 antibody but not for activation-induced cell death of mature T cells (29Sabapathy K. Hu Y. Kallunki T. Schreiber M. David J.-P. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Compound mutant mice lacking the JNK1 and JNK2 genes suggested that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate region-specific apoptosis during early brain development (30Kuan C.-Y. Yang D.D. Roy D.R.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a ubiquitously expressed MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that activates the SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 signaling cascades (31Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ASK1 in epithelial cells in a low serum condition-induced apoptosis, and in ovarian cancer cells, expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 inhibited microtubule-interfering agent-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ASK1 plays a role in the mechanism of stress-induced apoptosis (31Ichijo H.

Although moderate expression of a constitutively active form of ASK1 induced neuronal differentiation in naive PC12 cells (34Takeda K. Hatai T. Hamazaki T.S. Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), overexpression of ASK1 induced apoptosis in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and primary rat sympathetic neurons (35Kanamoto T. Mota M. Takeda K. Rubin L. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Bazenet C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant-negative ASK1 reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal from these cells (35Kanamoto T. Mota M. Takeda K. Rubin L. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Bazenet C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ASK1 was activated upon treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α or agonistic anti-Fas antibody, and a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 reduced tumor necrosis factor-α- and Fas-induced JNK activation and apoptosis, suggesting that ASK1 is a pivotal component in cytokine-induced apoptosis as well (31Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 36Nishitoh H. Saitoh M.

However, it is still unknown how ASK1-induced apoptosis is executed, particularly in relation to caspase activities. Here we show that ASK1-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase activities and that the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway is the main mechanism of execution of ASK1-induced apoptosis. Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (CCL-64; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E12.5 embryos and cultured in DMEM containing a higher concentration of glucose (4.5 mg/ml) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C.

A monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (clone 3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibodies to caspase-3, cytochromec, and α-tubulin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Pharmingen, and Harlan Sera-Lab, respectively. zVAD-fmk was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding HA-tagged ASK1 mutants and β-galactosidase were constructed as described (32Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in assay plates and allowed to grow in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight. Mv1Lu cells and MEFs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with recombinant adenoviruses in DMEM supplemented with 1% and 0.1% FBS, respectively. Nearly 100% infection of recombinant adenoviruses to Mv1Lu cells and MEFs can be achieved at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 and 400, respectively, as determined by β-galactosidase staining (data not shown). Cell viability of Mv1Lu cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.4% trypan blue in PBS, and the proportion of dead blue cells was determined. For MEFs, cell viability was determined using a cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo), in which 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8) was used as a substrate. The relative number of surviving cells was determined in duplicate by estimating the value of uninfected cells as 100%. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, the membranes were probed with antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. After 15 min of incubation with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (PI; Pharmingen) at room temperature, the fluorescence emitted by cells (10,000 cells/sample) was analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Approximately 2 × 106 cells were lysed with 200 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The lysate was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K at 42 °C for 1 h. DNA was purified by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Dry DNA pellets were then resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.2 mg/ml ribonuclease A. Samples were loaded on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Approximately 4 × 105 cells were used for measurement of caspase activities. Caspase-3-like activity was measured by a CPP32/caspase-3 fluorometric protease assay kit (MBL) following the manufacturer's instructions, in which a fluorogenic synthetic peptide DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC) was used as a substrate. Caspase-8- and -9-like activities were measured using IETD-AFC and LEHD-AFC (Calbiochem), respectively. The fluorescence of the released AFC was measured with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in 125 μl of buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then homogenized with 30 strokes of a homogenizer (Wheaton). The mitochondria-enriched fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c. To investigate the mechanism regulating an execution process of ASK1-induced apoptosis, we first characterized the death-inducing activity of ASK1 in Mv1Lu cells and primary MEF cells. Mv1Lu and MEFs were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged constitutively active mutant of ASK1 (Ad-ASK1ΔN) or an HA-tagged catalytically inactive mutant of ASK1 (Ad-ASK1KM) (32Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Expression of ASK1ΔN and ASK1KM was detectable as early as 8 h after infection by Western blot analysis (data not shown) and was clearly detected in a m.o.i.-dependent manner after 24 h in both cells (Fig.1, lower panel, and data not shown). Forty-eight h after infection, ASK1-induced cell death became apparent in Mv1Lu as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig.1, upper panel). Only ASK1ΔN but not ASK1KM induced a significant cell death, confirming that the death-inducing effect of ASK1 depends on its enzymatic activity. Although a longer time period was required (3 to 6 days culture after infection), adenovirus-mediated expression of ASK1ΔN but not ASK1KM strongly induced cell death in MEFs as well (data not shown). To examine whether the ASK1-induced cell death is accompanied by apoptotic features, distribution of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA were analyzed by annexin V staining and DNA laddering assay, respectively. Compared with uninfected or Ad-ASK1KM-infected cells, Ad-ASK1ΔN-infected cells displayed an increased annexin V-positive population in Mv1Lu (Fig.2 A). Of note, annexin V-positive but PI-negative population was also increased in the ASK1ΔN-expressing cells, suggesting that ASK1-induced cell death follows an ordered apoptotic process. When the cytoplasmic small-fragmented DNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragmentation was observed in Ad-ASK1ΔN-infected MEFs but not in uninfected or Ad-ASK1KM-infected cells (Fig.2 B). These findings indicate that the expression of ASK1ΔN effectively induces apoptosis in Mv1Lu cells and MEFs and that these cells provide useful models to investigate the mechanism of ASK1-induced apoptosis. Since members of the caspase family are crucial mediators of apoptosis (14Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 15Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 16Porter A.G. Jänicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar), we examined the requirement of caspase activities for ASK1-induced apoptosis using zVAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. We confirmed that the addition of zVAD-fmk did not reduce the adenovirus-mediated expression of ASK1ΔN in Mv1Lu cells (Fig.3, lower panel). When cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay, ASK1-induced death was significantly inhibited in the presence of zVAD-fmk, suggesting that caspase activity is required for ASK1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3,upper panel). Consistently, proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-3 was induced by the expression of ASK1ΔN but not ASK1KM in a m.o.i.-dependent manner, suggesting that caspase-3 is activated during the course of ASK1-induced apoptosis (Fig.4).Figure 4Processing of pro-caspase-3 induced by the expression of ASK1 ΔN. MEFs were left uninfected or infected with the indicated m.o.i. of Ad-ASK1ΔN or Ad-ASK1KM. Four days after the infection, cells were lysed and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody to caspase-3. As a positive control for processing of pro-caspase-3, cells were exposed to 5 μg/ml of anisomysin for 12 h (indicated asAniso).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the involvement of initiator caspases in ASK1-induced apoptosis, we next examined the activities of caspase-8- and -9-like proteases in comparison with caspase-3-like activity induced by the expression of ASK1ΔN. Fluorogenic synthetic peptides, DEVD-AFC, IETD-AFC, and LEHD-AFC were utilized as substrates to assess the activities of caspase-3-, caspase-8-, and caspase-9-like proteases, respectively. Consistent with the ASK1ΔN-induced processing of pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 4), expression of ASK1ΔN but not ASK1KM strongly induced caspase-3-like activity 48 h after the infection in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 5 A, left panel). At this time point, a substantial level of caspase-9-like activity was also induced by the expression of ASK1ΔN, whereas only a marginal activation of caspase-8-like proteases was detected (Fig.5 A, middle and right panels). To exclude a possibility that activation of caspase-8-like proteases occurred earlier, we examined the time course of activities of caspase-8- and caspase-3-like proteases (Fig. 5 B). Activation of caspase-3-like proteases was first detected 28 h after the infection of ASK1ΔN in Mv1Lu cells. In contrast, no significant activation of caspase-8-like proteases was detected throughout the course of ASK1-induced apoptosis, suggesting that activation of caspase-8-like proteases is not involved in ASK1-induced apoptosis. We next assessed the requirement of caspase-8 and -9 for ASK1-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis using MEFs deficient for caspase-8 (Casp8−/−)2 or -9 (Casp9 −/−) (39Kuida K. Haydar T.F.

Expression of ASK1ΔN clearly induced caspase-3-like activity in Casp8−/− MEFs as well as in wild type (Casp8 +/+) MEFs (Fig. 6 A). Consistently, Casp8 −/− and Casp8 +/+ MEFs were equally sensitive to ASK1-induced cell death as determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Fig. 6 B). Together with no obvious increase in caspase-8-like activity in ASK1ΔN-expressing Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 5), these results strongly suggest that caspase-8 is dispensable for ASK1-induced activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. In contrast, ASK1-dependent activation of caspase-3-like proteases was completely absent in Casp9 −/− MEFs (Fig.7 A), suggesting that caspase-9 is prerequisite to ASK1-induced activation of caspase-3. On the other hand, Casp9 −/− MEFs were still sensitive to ASK1-induced cell death, although less sensitive than the wild type (Casp9+/+) MEFs (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that other caspases, which lack DEVDase activity, may be involved in the execution of apoptosis induced by ASK1 (see “Discussion”). Since activation of caspase-9 requires the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), we examined whether cytochrome c release occurs in ASK1-induced apoptosis. We isolated the cytosolic fractions from ASK1ΔN- or ASK1KM-expressing cells and detected the released cytochrome c from mitochondria by Western blot analysis. The expression of ASK1ΔN but not ASK1KM resulted in release of cytochromec from mitochondria in Mv1Lu cells and MEFs (Fig.8 A and data not shown), clearly demonstrating the involvement of cytochrome crelease in ASK1-induced apoptosis. Importantly, the addition of zVAD-fmk did not inhibit the cytochrome c release from mitochondria, suggesting that the cytochrome c release is a trigger rather than a consequence of the caspase activation in ASK1-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this notion, ASK1ΔN-induced cytochrome c release was detected as early as 18 h after the infection of Ad-ASK1ΔN and increased thereafter (Fig.8 B). Since no apparent cell death was detected within 30 h in ASK1ΔN-expressing Mv1Lu cells (data not shown), cytochrome c release obviously preceded the onset of cell death and was likely to be one of the determinants of ASK1-induced apoptosis. Taken together, ASK1 appears to induce apoptosis mainly via the mitochondrial pathway followed by caspase-9 and -3 activation. In the present study, we investigated the roles of mitochondria and caspases in the execution of ASK1-induced apoptosis. We found that caspase activities are required for ASK1-induced apoptosis at least in two different cell-types, epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) and fibroblasts (MEFs). In the presence of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, ASK1-induced apoptosis was almost suppressed (Fig. 3), suggesting that ASK1-induced apoptosis is largely dependent on caspase activities. Based on the requirement of caspase activities, we first presumed that ASK1 might kill cells through death receptor-induced direct activation of caspase-8, since activation of JNK has been reported to lead to de novo synthesis of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. Fas ligand (FasL), via c-Jun-dependent transcription (40Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar, 41Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In fact, expression of an activated form of MEKK1, another MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) in the JNK pathway, results in apoptosis of Jurkat T cells and PC12 cells in a FasL induction-dependent manner (40Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar, 41Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, ASK1 induced only a limited increase in the caspase-8-like activity (Fig. 5), and MEFs deficient in caspase-8 were still sensitive to ASK1-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis (Fig. 6). These results clearly demonstrate that caspase-8 is not a minimum requirement for ASK1-induced apoptosis at least in these cells. In contrast, another initiator caspase, caspase-9, appears to be crucial for caspase-3 activation in ASK1 signaling. Caspase-9 was activated by the expression of ASK1ΔN (Fig. 5), and more convincingly, ASK1-induced caspase-3 activation was completely absent in Casp9 −/− MEFs (Fig. 7 A). These results strongly suggest that caspase-9 is indispensable for ASK1-induced activation of caspase-3 and exclude a possibility that caspase-3 is directly activated downstream of the ASK1-JNK and/or -p38 axes. Unexpectedly, however, Casp9 −/− MEFs were not completely resistant to ASK1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7 B). An explanation for the discrepancy between the complete absence of ASK1-induced caspase-3-like activity and the limited resistance to apoptosis induced by ASK1 in Casp9 −/− MEFs is that other caspases, which lack DEVDase activity, may participate in the execution of ASK1-induced apoptosis or may be activated in compensation for caspase-9 deficiency (42Zheng, T. S., Hunot, S., Kuida, K., Momoi, T., Srinivasan, A., Lazebnik, Y., Nicholson, D. W., and Flavell, R. A. (2000)Nat. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar). A candidate for such among effector caspases is caspase-6, since the optimal tetrapeptide sequence for caspase-6 is VEHD and considerably differs from DEVD, a preferential sequence for caspase-3 and -7 (43Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Alternatively, incomplete inhibition of ASK1-induced apoptosis by zVAD-fmk (Fig. 3) may suggest the possible involvement of the caspase-independent mechanism in ASK1-induced apoptosis, including a recently identified caspase-independent effector of apoptosis, AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) (44Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Casp9 −/− MEFs were in fact less sensitive to ASK1-induced apoptosis than Casp9 +/+ MEFs (Fig.7 B). The observed difference in the sensitivity to ASK1-induced apoptosis is likely to be attributable to the lack of the increase in DEVDase activity in Casp9 −/− MEFs. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol is required for activation of capase-9 (13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed cytochrome c release in ASK1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). Of note, the addition of zVAD-fmk, which effectively inhibited the cell death induced by ASK1 (Fig. 3), caused no significant reduction in cytochrome c release, indicating that caspase activities are not required for ASK1-induced release of cytochrome c. Moreover, ASK1-induced release of cytochrome c obviously preceded the onset of cell death. These results strongly suggest that cytochrome c release is not a consequence but a trigger of ASK1-induced caspase activation. Mitochondrion may thus be a direct target of death signals mediated via ASK1-JNK and/or -p38 axes. The molecular target for the activated JNK or p38 to induce cytochromec release from mitochondria remains to be elucidated. Candidates as such are the Bcl-2 family members, which play pivotal roles in decision of cell death and survival mainly at the level of mitochondria (9Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 10Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Recently, Bcl-2 was reported to be phosphorylated in a normal physiologic process at G2/M as well as in response to microtubule-interfering agents via the ASK1-JNK1 pathway (45Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Bcl-2 is suggested to lose its anti-apoptotic activity, and therefore cells appear to be susceptible to death signals (45Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to study whether other members in the Bcl-2 family may also be regulated by ASK1-JNK and/or -p38 signals. In conclusion, the results presented here strongly suggest that the mitochondria-initiated activation of effector caspases is a main mechanism operating in the execution of ASK1-induced apoptosis. However, further investigations will be needed to elucidate the issue of cell-type specificity in ASK1 signaling and the possible involvement of other signaling pathways mediating ASK1-induced death signals.

These molecules are degraded by a family of enzymes known as phosphodiesterases, which serve a critical function by regulating the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of phosphodiesterase 4B2B to 1.77 angstrom resolution. The active site has been identified and contains a cluster of two metal atoms.

https://openalex.org/W1980821707,"Correct pathfinding by Drosophila photoreceptor axons requires recruitment of p21-activated kinase (Pak) to the membrane by the SH2-SH3 adaptor Dock. Here, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio as another essential component in photoreceptor axon guidance. Regulated exchange activity of one of the two Trio GEF domains is critical for accurate pathfinding. This GEF domain activates Rac, which in turn activates Pak. Mutations in trio result in projection defects similar to those observed in both Pak and dock mutants, and trio interacts genetically with Rac, Pak, and dock. These data define a signaling pathway from Trio to Rac to Pak that links guidance receptors to the growth cone cytoskeleton. We propose that distinct signals transduced via Trio and Dock act combinatorially to activate Pak in spatially restricted domains within the growth cone, thereby controlling the direction of axon extension."
https://openalex.org/W2031104472,"Globally, tropical deforestation releases 20 to 30% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Conserving forests could reduce emissions, but the cost-effectiveness of this mechanism for mitigation depends on the associated opportunity costs. We estimated these costs from local, national, and global perspectives using a case study from Madagascar. Conservation generated significant benefits over logging and agriculture locally and globally. Nationally, however, financial benefits from industrial logging were larger than conservation benefits. Such differing economic signals across scales may exacerbate tropical deforestation. The Kyoto Protocol could potentially overcome this obstacle to conservation by creating markets for protection of tropical forests to mitigate climate change."

The SN of early PD patients have dramatically decreased levels of the thiol tripeptide glutathione (GSH). GSH plays multiple roles in the nervous system both as an antioxidant and a redox modulator. We have generated dopaminergic PC12 cell lines in which levels of GSH can be inducibly down-regulated via doxycycline induction of antisense messages against both the heavy and light subunits of γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Down-regulation of glutamyl-cysteine synthetase results in reduction in mitochondrial GSH levels, increased oxidative stress, and decreased mitochondrial function. Interestingly, decreases in mitochondrial activities in GSH-depleted PC12 cells appears to be because of a selective inhibition of complex I activity as a result of thiol oxidation. These results suggest that the early observed GSH losses in the SN may be directly responsible for the noted decreases in complex I activity and the subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction, which ultimately leads to dopaminergic cell death associated with PD.

Oxidative stress appears to play a major role in the death of these neurons. Dopaminergic neurons are believed to be especially prone to oxidative stress because of the potential for dopamine oxidation to occur either through auto-oxidation or via metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. Oxidation of dopamine produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 can react with ferrous (Fe2+) iron to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH·), which can damage nearby proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane phospholipids (1Beal M.F. Neurobiology. 1992; 31: 119-130Google Scholar). Iron levels are increased in the SN of PD patients along with elevations in various indices of oxidative damage (2Reiderer P. Sofic E. Rausch W.D.

Although GSH is not the only antioxidant molecule reported to be altered in PD, the magnitude of GSH depletion appears to parallel disease severity and it is the earliest known indicator of oxidative stress in presymptomatic PD, preceding decreases in both mitochondrial complex I activity and dopamine levels (5Perry T.L. Yong V.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 67: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Jenner P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1993; 87: 1913-1917Google Scholar). Nigral neurons contain GSH, and levels are reduced in the PD brain (7Pearce R.K. Owen A. Daniel S. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J. Neural Transm. 1998; 104: 661-677Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized by a two-step reaction involving the enzymes γ-GCS and glutathione synthetase. γ-GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme in this process, and brain GSH appears to primarily arise through synthesis from its constituent amino acids via this enzyme (8Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ-GCS is a dimer composed of a heavy catalytic subunit and a light regulatory subunit (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the mitochondria via an energy-dependent transporter (8Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria contains GSH peroxidase and all other components necessary for detoxification of hydroperoxides but no catalase. Decreases in GSH availability in the brain therefore are believed to promote mitochondrial damage via increased ROS (10Jain A. Martensson J. Stole E. Auld P.A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have created permanent PC12 cell lines in which GSH can be inducibly down-regulated by expressing antisense rat γ-GCS heavy and light subunit cDNAs in a reverse doxycycline (dox)-inducible system making decreases in GSH levels drug-dependent. These cells were used to explore the affects of lowering GSH levels on mitochondrial function in dopaminergic cells as a model for PD. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. dox inducible anti-γ-GCS lines (anti-γ-GCS) were produced by transfecting PC12 cells with pUHD172–1neo regulatory plasmid using LipofectAMINE reagent® (Life Technologies, Inc.) (Fig. 1). Cells were grown for 15 days in medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418). Resulting drug-resistant colonies were transiently transfected with response plasmid containing lacZ (pBIG,CLONTECH) and treated with either 0 or 25 μg/ml dox followed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining to identify rTta lines with low basal expression and high dox inducibility (data not shown). These lines were stably transfected with response plasmid (pBI,CLONTECH) containing antisense heavy and light rat γ-GCS cDNAs cloned via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from adult rat brain tissue using primers generated from previously published sequences (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin for 15 days, and drug-resistant colonies were selected. Experiments were run on two to three separate anti-γ-GCS cell lines using cells containing rTta alone as a negative control. Western blot analysis of cell extracts from anti-γ-GCS and rTta cells grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of dox was performed as described previously (12Liu R.M. Gao L. Choi J. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L861-L869PubMed Google Scholar). Cell homogenates resuspended in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, were used to assay γ-GCS activity levels as described previously (11Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Assays were run in the absence of α-aminobutyrate as blank. γ-GCS values were normalized/protein using reagent from Bio-Rad. Cellular GSH and GSSG levels were measured by the method of Griffith (13Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). Total GSH and GSSG was measured after the addition of 5′-5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl disulfide at an absorbance of 412 nm (13Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). GSSG was selectively measured after assaying samples in which GSH is masked by pretreatment with 2-vinylpyridine. The difference between the two values gives the GSH levels in the cells. For measurement of mitochondrial GSH and GSSG levels, high quality mitochondria were isolated from anti-γ-GCS and control cells as described previously (14Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All values were normalized/protein and/or citrate synthetase activity. Dying versus live cells were visualized by incubating cells for 5 min in 0.2% trypan blue in sterile phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and noting the presence of any blue (nonviable) cells versusphase bright cells under the light microscope (n = 10 fields examined/cell type). Cells or isolated mitochondria were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 20 μm 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes,) for 30 min, 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g in a microfuge, and pellets were resuspended in 50 μm digitonin for 20 min, room temperature. The addition of digitonin alone did not contribute to DCF fluorescence. Following centrifugation, fluorescence was monitored in the supernatant in a Turner fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm. DCF values were normalized/protein. Cells were harvested in a cold 1:1 mixture of 12% trichloroacetic acid and 0.2 msodium citrate, pH 7.0, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for assay of total cellular ATP levels by the method of Mattsonet al. (15Mattson M.P. Zhang Y. Bose S. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). ATP values were normalized/protein. MTT reduction in isolated mitochondria was measured using the method of Berridge and Tan (16Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). MTT values were normalized/protein and reported as percent control (17Cohen G. Rafay F. Natasa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4890-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was monitored in isolated mitochondria using a biological oxygen monitor (YSI Model 5300, YSI Inc.). Rate of oxygen consumption was measured after the addition of 7 mm pyruvate/malate and 125 nmol of ADP as described previously (17Cohen G. Rafay F. Natasa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4890-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Ku H.H. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 72: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Measurement of all mitochondrial enzyme complex activities were done according to the method of Trounce et al. (14Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were preincubated in either the presence or absence of the thiol reductant DTT (4 mm, 35 min) prior to assay. Immunoprecipitation was performed on isolated mitochondrial fractions under nondenaturing conditions with an antibody generated against the ND1 subunit of NADH dehydrogenase using the IMMUNOcatcher kit from CytoSignal Research Products (Irvine, CA) according the manufacturer's instructions. The ND1 polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide representing amino acid residues 33–43 of the ND1 subunit of complex I (19Pettus E.H. Cottrell B. Wallace D. Greenamyre J.T. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 1640Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously to confirm the presence of immunoprecipitated protein. Amounts of reduced sulfhydryl groups were measured in both whole mitochondrial and immunoprecipitated NADH dehydrogenase subunit-containing fractions by the method of Habeeb (20Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Samples treated with 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide were used as a blank. Biochemical data are given as mean ± SD, and significance testing was performed using ANOVA (analysis of variance). Generation of PC12 cells with inducibly reduced GSH levels. Using a reverse doxycycline inducible system, we have generated PC12 cell lines in which activity levels of γ-GCS, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, can be inducibly down-regulated via addition of dox (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of anti-γ-GCS cells demonstrated that increasing concentrations of dox resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in levels of both heavy and light subunit γ-GCS protein in these cells (Fig.2, A and B). No corresponding decrease in either heavy or light γ-GCS subunit protein was seen in rTta control cells treated with dox at the same concentrations (data not shown). Levels of γ-GCS activity were also found to decrease in antisense γ-GCS containing cell lines in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with dox (Fig.3 A). In contrast, control rTta cells showed no significant changes in γ-GCS activity. dox-dependent decreases in γ-GCS levels were found to vary proportionally with time up to at least 72 h following initial drug induction while no change was observed in γ-GCS enzyme levels in the rTta control cells (Fig. 3 B). Cells containing only rTta plasmid showed no significant changes in γ-GCS levels for cultures incubated for the same time periods.Figure 3Measurement of GCS activity and cellular and mitochondrial glutathione levels in dox-treated anti-γ-GCS cells. A, dox concentration curve of γ-GCS activity in anti-γ-GCSversus control rTta cells.

Treatment with 25 μg/ml dox for 24 h caused a decrease in GSH levels of ∼50% in the antisense γ-GCS cell lines, a similar decrease to that observed in the SN of early PD brains (2Reiderer P. Sofic E.

Neurol. 1994; 36: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). This dosage was used for all subsequent studies unless otherwise noted. Acute decreases in GSH levels had no effect on cell viability or growth as measured by trypan blue staining (data not shown); only rare blue cells were noted in either the rTta or antisense γ-GCS cells following a 24-h treatment with 25 μg/ml dox. As GSH is an important redox regulator, cellular levels of ROS and related species were estimated to examine the effects of reduced GSH levels on production of oxidative stress (Fig. 4). Lowering GSH levels was found to cause a significant increase in both cellular and mitochondrial ROS values in the anti-γ-GCS cell lines. rTta lines showed no change (data not shown). GSH is known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm and to enter the mitochondria via an energy-dependent transport-mediated process (8Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreases in cellular GSH in the anti-γ-GCS cells following dox induction resulted in a significant decrease in both mitochondrial GSH and GSSG levels (Fig.3 D). The effect of decreased mitochondrial GSH levels on mitochondrial performance was quantified by measurement of cellular ATP levels (Fig.5 A) as well as mitochondrial pyruvate-dependent MTT reduction (Fig. 5 B) and oxygen consumption (Fig. 5, C and D). All were found to be significantly reduced after treatment with dox. These results suggest that decreasing GSH levels have a profound affect on mitochondrial function. PD appears to involve selective decreases in mitochondrial complex I activity (1Beal M.F. Neurobiology. 1992; 31: 119-130Google Scholar, 6Jenner P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1993; 87: 1913-1917Google Scholar, 24Hillered L. Chan P.H J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 19: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Haas R.H. Nasirian F. Nakano K. Ward D. Pay M. Hill R. Shults C.W. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). MTT reduction and state 3 respiration assayed using the complex I substrate pyruvate were both found to be decreased upon GSH depletion of PC12. To see whether the effects of GSH depletion were specific to complex I or more general, we compared the activities of complex I versus complexes II-III and IV in isolated mitochondria from dox-treated versus untreated cells. Lowering of GSH levels in these cells resulted in a significant decrease in complex I activity, but interestingly no significant losses were seen in either complex II-III or IV (Fig.6). The addition of the thiol reducing agent DTT was found to restore complex I activity to levels comparable with those found in corresponding controls, indicating that the inhibition of enzyme activity is likely because of oxidation of sulfhydryl groups within the enzyme complex. DTT had no affect on either complex I activity alone or on II-III and IV activities with or without dox addition. Levels of reduced protein sulfhydryl residues were decreased in a dox-dependent manner in mitochondria isolated from GSH-depleted cells suggesting that decreases in cellular GSH levels results in increased thiol oxidation of mitochondrial proteins (Fig.7 A).Figure 7Measurement of reduced sulfhydryl groups before and after ND1 immunoprecipitation.

This decrease in reduced thiol groups was in the absence of any GSH depletion-mediated loss in immunoprecipitated protein levels (Fig. 7 B). Early depletions in nigral GSH levels observed in the Parkinsonian brain are not explainable by increased oxidation of GSH to GSSG. GSH losses have been suggested to be because of increased activity of the enzyme γ-glutamyltranspeptidase resulting in increased removal of both GSH and GSSG from cells, although this has yet to be definitely proven (26Sian J. Dexter D.T. Lees A.J. Daniel S. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To explore the effects of a depletion in GSH on dopaminergic cells like those in the SN, we constructed a model in which levels of the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, γGCS, are inducibly depleted. Although GCS activity levels do not appear to be specifically impaired in sporadic cases of PD (26Sian J. Dexter D.T. Lees A.J. Daniel S. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the net effect of our genetic manipulation mimics that which is seen in the Parkinsonian brain, i.e. a decrease in GSH levels without corresponding increases in GSSG levels. Using this model we have demonstrated that lowering GSH levels in PC12 appears to elicit a selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity leading to decreased mitochondrial function. Decreased mitochondrial activities following glutathione depletion in PC12 includes a loss in cellular ATP levels. Although acute depletion of GSH appeared to have no effect on overall cell viability or growth after 24 h, ATP is required for various cellular activities including the synthesis of GSH itself and therefore prolonged decreases in ATP levels would be expected to eventually result in decreased cell viability such as seen in PD. Selective reductions in GSH levels, which precede losses in mitochondrial complex I activity, have been reported to occur not only in Parkinson's disease but also in toxin models associated with it such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (21Perry T.L. Godin D.V. Hansen S. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 33: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 27Hallman H. Lange J. Olson L. Strömberg I. Jonsson G. J.

Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the inhibition of complex I activity and subsequent decreases in ATP following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration can be totally accounted for by decreases in GSH levels is unclear as complex I also appears to be inhibited by direct interaction with 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridium (MPP+) formed during monoamine oxidase-B-mediated oxidation of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (30Jha N. Andersen J.K. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Neurochemistry. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, India1999: 99-108Google Scholar). However decreasing GSH levels by treatment with the pharmacological agent buthionine sulfoxamine has been shown to potentiate the neurodegenerative effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the SN and to alone cause sublethal damage to the nigrostriatal system (31Wüllner U.

Hom D.G. McNeill T.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2164-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that complex I activity is especially susceptible to decreases in GSH levels. Previous studies have shown that complex I activity in bovine heart submitochondrial particles is particularly effected by oxidative stress and that ROS generated by the hypoxanthine-xanthine system selectively affects utilization of oxygen by NAD-linked substrates in rat brain mitochondria (25Haas R.H. Nasirian F. Nakano K. Ward D. Pay M. Hill R. Shults C.W. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Marcillat O. Giulivi C. Ernster L. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16330-16336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex I is in fact considered to be one of the most severely affected by age-related increases in oxidative stress (34Lenaz G. Bovina C. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Formiggini G. Genova M.L. Marchetti M. Pich M.M. Pallotti F. Parenti-Castelli G. Biagini G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In synaptic mitochondria, complex I exerts a major control over oxidative phosphorylation such that at 25% inhibition, energy metabolism is disturbed resulting in decreased ATP synthesis; complex III and IV inhibition in the range of 70–80% is required to exert similar effects (35Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). GSH is known to protect proteins from oxidation by conjugating with oxidized thiol groups to form protein-SS-GSH mixed disulfides, which can then be re-reduced to protein and GSH by glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, or protein disulfide isomerase (36Ravindranath V. Reed D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1990; 169: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Jung C.H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). GSH is the major cellular component involved in maintaining protein sulfhydryl groups in their reduced state and much emphasis has been placed lately on its role in redox regulation as a mechanism for controlling activities of various thiol-dependent enzymes including those involved in metabolic regulation (for review, see Refs. 38Ziegler D.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar and 39Del Corso A. Cappiello M. Mura A. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study by Sriram et al. (29Sriram K. Shankar S.K. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that administration of the excitotoxic compoundl-β-N-oxalylamino-l-alaninein vitro and in vivo resulted in depletion of GSH leading to inactivation of mitochondrial complex I activity via thiol oxidation. This appears to be the cause for the characteristic mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent corticospinal neurodegeneration mediated by this neurotoxin; both could be prevented by treatment with antioxidant thiol agents. Previous experiments by Cohen et al. (17Cohen G. Rafay F. Natasa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4890-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) suggest that oxidation of protein sulfhydryl residues can result in inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport when the complex I substrate pyruvate is used as the electron donor. Activity of NADH dehydrogenase, the enzymatic component of complex I, appears to be thiol-regulated (40Shivakumar B.R. Kolluri S.V. Ravindranath V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1167-1173PubMed Google Scholar, 41Balijepalli S. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that not only is the decrease in NADH dehydrogenase activity elicited by GSH depletion of dopamine-containing cells restored by treatment with the thiol-reducing agent DTT but also that lowering levels of GSH results in the biochemical oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups contained within this enzyme. Taken together, these data suggest that GSH depletion may lead to oxidation of protein sulfhydryl residues in the enzyme important for its function resulting in profound effects on subsequent mitochondrial performance. Total glutathione depletion (GSH+GSSG) cannot cause oxidation of a sulfhydryl itself, but lowering glutathione levels can cause a rise in steady-state levels of H202 (as we see in our cells), which in turn can result in oxidation of vicinal dithiols to a dithiol. The reversibility in the loss of complex I activity with DTT suggests that this is likely a mixed disulfide or intramolecular disulfide formed from vicinal thiols rather than the formation of a sulfinic (−S02H) or sulfonic (S03H) acid. Mixed disulfides can be formed through a sulfenic (−SOH) intermediate produced by reaction of H202 with a thiolate (-S-), followed by reaction with GSH. Intramolecular disulfides can be formed by the same route where the vicinal thiol displaces the GS- or by direct reaction of the vicinal thiol with an −SOH intermediate. Based on our data, we propose that the early depletion of GSH in dopaminergic neurons of the SN in the PD brain may be responsible for selective inhibition of complex I activity and concomitant loss of mitochondrial function, which have been associated with the neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. A recent pilot study examining the effects of GSH administration in a small group of untreated PD patients report that daily intravenous delivery of the tripeptide for the period of a month resulted in a significant improvement in disability (42Sechi G. Deledda M.G. Bua G. Satta W.G. Deina G.A. Pes G.M. Rosati G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1996; 20: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whether such treatment is effective in actually altering brain levels of GSH and having lasting effects that can act to retard the progress of the disease is unclear; however, our data suggest that maintaining thiol homeostasis may be critical for protecting dopaminergic neurons of the SN against neurodegeneration and that thiol reductants may be therapeutic in this disorder.

Weiss L. Histology: Cell and Tissue Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1983Google Scholar). Type A spermatogonia, the male germ line stem cells, divide by mitosis to yield other type A stem cells as well as the differentiated type A spermatogonia (2Dym M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11287-11289Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The differentiated type A proceed through a series of mitotic divisions to produce meiotic spermatocytes. The early spermatocytes enter the first of two meiotic divisions, producing round spermatids; the round spermatids then differentiate into late spermatids that are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules as spermatozoa. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways for these events remain largely unknown. It has been suggested that the stem cell factor/c-kit system may play a crucial role in regulating proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (3Yoshinaga K. Nishikawa S. Ogawa M.

Stem cell factor (SCF)1 exists in either a soluble form or membrane-bound to Sertoli cells. Type A spermatogonia express the receptor for SCF, c-kit (3Yoshinaga K. Nishikawa S. Ogawa M. Hayashi S.

Sage J. Cuzin F. Rassoulzadegan M. Development. 1998; 125: 4585-4593PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the self-renewal and proliferation of spermatogonia have demonstrated that 1) administration of ACK-2, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of SCF to c-kit, disrupts proliferation of mouse spermatogonia and promotes apoptosis (4Packer A.I. Besmer P. Bachvarova R.F. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and 2) recombinant SCF stimulates the division of isolated primary spermatogonia (6Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that SCF/c-kitregulates spermatogonial mitotic progression, a process indispensable for the self-renewal and differentiation of the male germ-line stem cell population. However, the signal pathway triggered by SCF and its downstream cascade to regulate spermatogonial cell mitosis are not known. Recent studies suggest that PI3-K acts as an immediate downstream molecule of growth factor receptors to mediate mitogenic signaling in cells. The activation of PI3-K is sufficient to drive some types of cells to go through G1/S transition and to proliferate (11Klippel A. Escobedo M.A. Wachowicz M.S. Appell G. Brown T.W. Giedlin M.A. Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed whether the PI3-K signaling pathway is activated by SCF to regulate the proliferation of spermatogonia. We observed that SCF induced the PI3-K/AKT/p70S6K signaling pathway. Rapamycin completely blocked cyclin D3 expression and the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation induced by SCF. Taking these data together, our studies indicted that SCF/c-kitrecruits PI3-K/AKT/p70S6K/cyclin D3 to stimulate proliferation of type A spermatogonia. The testes of 5 day-old mouse pups (Balb/c) were removed and digested with a mixture of enzymes that included collagenase, trypsin, and hyaluronidase; then, type A spermatogonial cells were isolated from the resultant mixture of testicular cells using a bovine serum albumin gradient column as described previously (9Dym M.

All transient transfections were performed using Lipofectin reagent following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested and lysed with the following buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To immunoprecipitate c-kit, whole cell lysates containing 100 μg of total proteins were incubated with 1 μg/ml c-kit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was facilitated by addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times at 4 °C with the lysis buffer. Similarly, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-K was immunoprecipitated by incubating 300 μg of total protein with the monoclonal p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times at 4 °C with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from beads by boiling and were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were blotted onto the nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with TBS buffer containing 5% fat-free milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and hybridized with the primary antibodies: anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), c-kitpolyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AKT antibody and phospho-AKT antibodies (New England Biolabs, Inc.), p70S6K antibody and phospho-p70S6K antibodies (New England Biolabs, Inc.), Rb antibody and phospho-Rb antibodies (New England Biolabs, Inc.), cyclin D3 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), and PKC-ζ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After hybridization with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the immunocomplex was detected with the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Freshly isolated type A spermatogonial cells were plated on cover slides with serum-free Ham's F-12. The cells were incubated with 50 nm rapamycin for 30 min, and then 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse stem cell factor (mSCF) (R&D Systems, Inc.) and 30 μg/ml BrdUrd (Sigma) were added to the cells. After 18 h of culture, the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained for BrdUrd following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Spermatogonia cells were transfected with active p110 and cultured for 48 h, and then the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. 500 μg of total protein were used to immunoprecipitate PKC-ζ by incubating with 1 μg of anti-PKC-ζ antibody and 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in a rolling tube overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and two times with kinase buffer (35 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmmagnesium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). PKC-ζ activity was assayed in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 4 μg of myelin basic protein for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer, and phosphorylated myelin basic protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The isolated spermatogonial cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 8 h and then treated with 100 ng/ml mSCF (R&D Systems, Inc.) for 5 or 10 min. 30 μg of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). SCF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a ∼120-kDa protein (Fig.1 A). To confirm that this protein is c-kit, 100 μg of lysates of the control and SCF-treated (10 min) cells were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml c-kit antibody. The immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the 4G10 antibody. The results showed that the 120-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by the c-kitantibody and was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, 300 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the PI3-K (1 μg/ml) p85 subunit monoclonal antibody and blotted with 4G10 phosphotyrosine antibody. The tyrosine phosphorylated c-kitwas co-immunoprecipitated with the p85 subunit of PI3-K (Fig.1 C). These results demonstrated that SCF/c-kittriggers PI3-K signaling in spermatogonia and that the PI3-K signaling pathway may be the pathway for SCF to regulate the proliferation of spermatogonial cells. p70S6K is a downstream regulator of the PI3-K signaling pathway. It has emerged as an important regulator of cell growth, playing a positive role during progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (12Grewe M. Gansauge F. Schmid R.M. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3581-3587PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we next tested whether p70S6K is also activated by SCF/c-kit through PI3-K in type A spermatogonial cells. Isolated spermatogonial cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and then the cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3-K) or 50 nm rapamycin (an mTOR-dependent inhibitor of p70S6K) for 30 min and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml mSCF (R&D Systems, Inc.) for 45 min or 6 h. 40 μg of protein extracts of treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with phospho-p70S6K antibodies, including anti-Thr-389 and anti-Thr-421/Ser-424. As shown in Fig. 2, SCF induced phosphorylation of p70S6K strongly at Thr-389 at both the 45-min and 6-h intervals. This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by both wortmannin and rapamycin. Thus, it is clear that SCF/c-kit activates a rapamycin-sensitive PI3-K/p70S6K signaling pathway in spermatogonial cells. The above results suggested that SCF/c-kit may use the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway to cause cell cycle progression in spermatogonia. However, in addition to PI3-K/p70S6K, the cell cycle may be regulated by other multiple mitogenic pathways, including Ras-p42/p44 MAPK (16Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and PI3-K-dependent but rapamycin-insensitive pathways (17Takuwa N. Fukui Y. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1346-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To confirm that PI3-K/p70S6K, but not other pathways, is recruited by SCF/c-kit to cause spermatogonial cell proliferation, we performed a BrdUrd incorporation study in isolated mouse spermatogonia treated in the presence or absence of SCF and rapamycin. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium and then pretreated with 50 nm rapamycin for 30 min. 100 ng/ml mSCF (R&D Systems, Inc.) and 30 μg/ml BrdUrd were added to the medium. The cells were maintained in culture for another 18 h. Then the cells were stained for BrdUrd. SCF induced a 4-fold increase in BrdUrd-positive cells compared with controls. Rapamycin completely blocked BrdUrd incorporation induced by mSCF (Fig. 3). Thus, the SCF/c-kit-induced DNA synthesis in spermatogonia occurs through the rapamycin-sensitive PI3-K/p70S6K pathway. The above experiments suggested that SCF uses the PI3-K/p70S6K signaling pathway to promote the proliferation of spermatogonial cells. Next, we addressed how SCF/c-kit/PI3-K/p70S6K regulates cell cycle progression in spermatogonial cells. Cell cycle processing through G1/S transition requires the induction of thed-type cyclins. It was suggested that cyclin D3 may play a principal role in regulating the spermatogonial cell cycle through G1/S phase progression (18Zhang Q. Wang X. Wolgemuth D.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To address whether cyclin D3 is regulated by SCF/c-kit/PI3-K signaling in spermatogonial cells, isolated mouse spermatogonial cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight. After pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nm) or rapamycin (50 nm) the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml mSCF (R&D Systems, Inc.) for 6 or 18 h. 50 μg of whole lysates of treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with cyclin D3 antibody. The results indicated that expression of cyclin D3 was down-regulated after serum withdrawal for 18 h in spermatogonial cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2); addition of 100 ng/ml mSCF restored thisd-type cyclin expression after 6 h (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the induction of cyclin D3 expression by mSCF was blocked by either wortmannin or rapamycin (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). Moreover, the same samples were used to analyze the phosphorylation status of RB with phospho-Rb antibodies, including phospho-Rb (Ser-780), phospho-Rb (Ser-249/Ser-252), phospho-Rb (Thr-373), phospho-Rb (Ser-795), and phospho-Rb (Ser-807/Ser-811). Only phospho-Rb (Ser-780) gave a strong phosphorylation signal (Fig. 4, panel A). Furthermore, the phosphorylation at Ser-780 of Rb was also blocked by both wortmannin and rapamycin (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). These results indicated that SCF increases the expression of cyclin D3 and phosphorylates Rb at Ser-780 through the PI3-K/p70S6K signaling pathway. The signaling between PI3-K and p70S6K is complex. Recently, PKC-ζ and AKT, two important regulators of cell growth, have been demonstrated to mediate the PI3-K signaling to p70S6K. A study with neonatal rat gonocytes, which are the precursors of type A spermatogonia and express c-kit (19Orth J.M. Qiu J. Jester Jr., W.F. Pilder S. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), demonstrated that PKC-ζ is co-expressed with PI3-K (20Li H. Papadopoulos V. Vidic B. Dym M. Culty M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that PKC-ζ is expressed in mouse spermatogonia (Fig. 5 A). The constitutively active catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K activated PKC-ζ, and this activity was suppressed to basal levels by 100 μm PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate, an inhibitor of PKC-ζ, (Fig. 5 B). To test whether PKC-ζ mediates the signal between PI3-K and p70S6K in spermatogonial cells, the cells were cotransfected with the constitutively active catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K and p70S6K in the presence of 100 μmpseudosubstrate peptide. 20 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with p-p70S6K (Thr-389). The results showed that the pseudosubstrate peptide did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by the active p110 catalytic subunit (Fig. 5,C and D). Thus, PKC-ζ is not involved in the SCF/c-kit/PI3-K signaling to activate p70S6K in spermatogonial cells. AKT acts as a downstream kinase of PI3-K, and its activity is stimulated by a variety of growth factors and insulin via a wortmannin-sensitive pathway (21Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 22Takata M. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Klip A. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20611-20618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Activated AKT phosphorylates p70S6K through an indirect pathway, which is not completely understood. To test whether AKT mediates SCF/c-kit/PI3-K signaling to p70S6K in spermatogonial cells, we carried out an experiment analyzing AKT activity and its effect on p70S6K phosphorylation by SCF/c-kit/PI3-K in spermatogonia. Isolated mouse spermatogonia cells were serum-starved for 8 h. The cells were then pretreated or untreated with 100 nm Wortmannin for 20 min, and then they were stimulated with 100 ng/ml mSCF for 30 min. 50 μg of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with phospho-AKT (Ser-473) antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 A,phosphorylation of AKT was induced by SCF through a wortmannin-sensitive pathway. We cotransfected the spermatogonial cells with p70S6K plasmid and constitutively active AKT (pLXSN-v-AKT) to determine whether active AKT induces the phosphorylation of p70S6K. After 48 h of transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium, with or without 50 nm rapamycin, for 24 h and then harvested for immunoblotting. 20 μg of total proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with p-p70S6K (Thr-389). p70S6K was highly phosphorylated by v-AKT, and rapamycin completely abolished this function of v-AKT (Fig. 6 B). We next cotransfected the spermatogonia with the dominant negative form of AKT-K179M, p70S6K, and constitutively active p110. After 48 h transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h; they were then harvested for immunoblotting. 20 μg of total proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with p-p70S6K (Thr-389). AKT-K179M markedly inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation induced by the constitutively active catalytic subunit p110 of PI3-K (Fig. 6, C andD). These results suggest that AKT is the principal positive regulator that mediates the signaling of SCF/c-kit/PI3-K to activate p70S6K and that AKT activates p70S6K via FRAP/mTOR kinase in spermatogonia. The molecular mechanisms regulating spermatogonial proliferation by stem cell factor largely remain unknown. We now demonstrate for the first time that the SCF/c-kit system up-regulates cyclin D3 and promotes cell cycle progression in spermatogonia through a rapamycin-sensitive PI3-K/AKT/p70S6K pathway. c-kit belongs to the PDGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (23Chabot B. Stephenson D.A. Chapman V.M. Besmer P. Bernstein A. Nature. 1988; 335: 88-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). It plays a crucial role in regulating hemopoiesis, melanogenesis, and spermatogenesis. In the testes, c-kit is predominantly expressed in type A spermatogonial cells (3Yoshinaga K. Nishikawa S. Ogawa M. Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Fujimoto T. Development. 1991; 113: 689-699PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dym M. Jia M.C. Dirami G. Price J.M. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Ravindranath N. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In response to its ligand, SCF, c-kit may trigger multiple signaling pathways to regulate the proliferation and/or differentiation of the spermatogonia. However, the signaling pathways induced by c-kit and how these signals are linked to spermatogonial cell renewal and/or differentiation are poorly understood. Our data indicated that SCF induced the binding of the PI3-K p85 subunit to c-kit. p70S6K is phosphorylated on Thr-389 by SCF/c-kit through the wortmannin and rapamycin-sensitive pathway in this type of cell. Cotransfection experiments showed that constitutively active p110 of PI3-K phosphorylates p70S6K in spermatogonial cells. These data demonstrate that SCF/c-kitrecruits the PI3-K/mTOR pathway to activate p70S6K; the latter interacts with the cell cycle machinery to induce cell proliferation. The cell cycle through the G1/S checkpoint is regulated by multiple mitogenic signaling pathways, including Ras-p42/p44 MAPK (16Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), PI3-K/p70S6K (24Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and the PI3-K-dependent but rapamycin-insensitive pathway (17Takuwa N. Fukui Y. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1346-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our BrdUrd experiment indicated that the SCF/c-kit-induced spermatogonial cell proliferation is completely abolished by rapamycin (Fig. 3). The mechanisms of rapamycin blocking BrdUrd incorporation induced by SCF is likely caused by the inhibitory function of rapamycin on cyclin D3 expression and phosphorylation of Rb (Fig. 4), both of which are necessary to promote cell cycle progression that is induced by SCF in spermatogonia. The inhibition of rapamycin on cyclin D3 expression and phosphorylation of Rb is consistent with its inhibition of p70S6K phosphorylation by SCF. The SCF-induced cyclin D3 expression and Rb phosphorylation are also sensitive to wortmannin, the inhibitor of PI3-K. Thus, the function of PI3-K to up-regulate cyclin D3 expression and phosphorylate Rb is mediated by p70S6K; SCF/c-kit induces the rapamycin-sensitive PI3-K/p70S6K/cyclin D3 pathway in regulating the cell cycle progression and growth in spermatogonial cells. During the cell cycle through the G1 phase, Rb is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including Ser-249/Ser-252, Ser-780, Ser-795, Ser-807/Ser-811, and Thr-373, by cyclin D/cdk4 (cdk6) and cyclin E/cdk2. Our data demonstrated that in regulating spermatogonial cell proliferation, SCF mainly induces the phosphorylation of Rb at Ser-780, which is phosphorylated only by cyclin D/cdk (25Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that cyclin D3 is the early response gene and the possible main target for SCF that drives G1/S phase progression of spermatogonial cells. This result is consistent with the observation that cyclin D3-associated kinase activity was detected in immature but not adult testes and that cyclin D3 plays an important role in regulating the self-renewal of male germ stem cell (18Zhang Q. Wang X. Wolgemuth D.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both PKC-ζ and AKT, downstream kinases of PI3-K signaling, are highly expressed in spermatogonia. Although PI3-K activated PKC-ζ, blocking of PKC-ζ did not suppress the phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by the constitutively active PI3-K catalytic subunit p110 (Fig.5). Thus, PKC-ζ is not involved in PI3-K signaling to activate p70S6K in spermatogonia. AKT is strongly phosphorylated by SCF/c-kit/PI3-K. Cotransfection studies in mouse type A spermatogonial cells showed that constitutively active AKT induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and dominant negative AKT-K179M completely inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by the constitutively active PI3-K catalytic subunit, p110. Rapamycin totally abolished phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by constitutively active AKT (Fig.6). These results indicate that AKT is the main kinase mediating SCF/c-kit/PI3-K to p70S6K through FRAP/mTOR. A recent study demonstrated that c-kit-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is essential for spermatogonial proliferation and male fertility (26Blume-Jensen P. Jiang G. Hyman R. Lee K.F. O'Gorman S. Hunter T. Nat Genet. 2000; 24: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although c-kit is required for normal hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis, mutations, which disrupt the PI3-K binding to c-kit and impaired PI3-K signaling pathway, only resulted in male sterility due to blockage of the proliferation of spermatogonial cells. There were no apparent hematopoietic or pigmentation defects in the homozygous mutant mice (26Blume-Jensen P. Jiang G. Hyman R. Lee K.F. O'Gorman S. Hunter T. Nat Genet. 2000; 24: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Another recent study that disrupted the binding of PI3-K to c-kit resulted in defective oogenesis and spermatogenesis. The males were sterile due to a block in the early stages of spermatogenesis (27Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, PI3-K signaling is particularly important for spermatogonial proliferation and spermatogenesis. Our current data confirm these findings and further elucidate the downstream cascade for SCF/c-kit/PI3-K signaling that regulates spermatogonial proliferation. In summary, upon stimulation with stem cell factor, c-kitrecruits the rapamycin-sensitive PI3-K/p70S6K pathway to induce cyclin D3 expression and phosphorylation of Rb leading to spermatogonial proliferation. AKT is the main transducer that links c-kit/PI3-K to p70S6K and is also important for spermatogonial proliferation (Fig.7). The differential signaling pathway in male germ line stem cells leading to stem cell renewalversus stem cell differentiation remains to be elicited.

Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in the intestine may be largely derived from a different ACAT protein. To test this hypothesis, we produced specific polyclonal anti-ACAT-2 antibodies that quantitatively immunodepleted human ACAT-2, a 46-kDa protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In hepatocyte-like HepG2 cells, ACAT-1 comprises 85–90% of the total ACAT activity, with the remainder attributed to ACAT-2. In adult intestines, most of the ACAT activity can be immunodepleted by anti-ACAT-2. ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 do not form hetero-oligomeric complexes. In differentiating intestinal enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, ACAT-2 protein content increases by 5–10-fold in 6 days, whereas ACAT-1 protein content remains relatively constant. In the small intestine, ACAT-2 is concentrated at the apices of the villi, whereas ACAT-1 is uniformly distributed along the villus-crypt axis. In the human liver, ACAT-1 is present in both fetal and adult hepatocytes. In contrast, ACAT-2 is evident in fetal but not adult hepatocytes. Our results collectively suggest that in humans, ACAT-2 performs significant catalytic roles in the fetal liver and in intestinal enterocytes.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). ACAT is present in a variety of cells and tissues. In macrophages, ACAT participates in the cholesterol-cholesteryl ester cycle (2Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); chronic accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages leads to foam cell formation characteristic of atherogenesis (review in ref. 3Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the liver, ACAT utilizes cholesterol as its substrate, which is either synthesized endogenously or acquired via the LDL receptor and chylomicron remnant receptor. Hepatic cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol are important lipid ingredients of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). In monkeys, hepatic ACAT may increase the atherogenicity of LDL by augmenting both its secretion from the liver and accumulation of cholesteryl oleate in plasma LDL (4Carr T.P. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L.

ACAT-2 shares high homology with ACAT-1 near the C terminus but not near the N terminus. Tissue distribution studies show that the expression of ACAT-1 message and protein is ubiquitous (21Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol.

The studies in mice and monkeys have led experts to believe that in mammals ACAT-2 comprises the majority of ACAT activity in the liver and intestines (24Young S.G. Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 81-83Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 25Joyce C. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Curr. Opin.

These results provide the rationale for selective inhibition of a given ACAT isoenzyme in a tissue-specific manner. Recently, the ACAT-1 knockout mouse has been used as a model in predicting the consequences of selective inhibition of ACAT-1 in humans (26Brewer Jr., B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 703-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Accad M. Smith S. Newland D.L. Sanan D.A. King L.E.J. Linton M.F. Fazio S. Farese R.V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Results from studies in mice or monkeys may not directly apply to humans. To assess the functional significance of ACAT-1 in various human tissue homogenates, our laboratory developed a protein knockout approach (28Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We used the detergent CHAPS to solubilize ACAT-1, followed by specific anti-ACAT-1 antibodies to remove ACAT-1. We then measured the residual ACAT activity in the immunodepleted supernatants. The results showed that in liver, adrenal glands, macrophages, and kidneys, most of the ACAT activity (80% or more) had been immunodepleted. In contrast, in the intestine most of the ACAT activity was largely resistant to immunodepletion (29Lee O. Chang C.C.Y. Lee W. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1722-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that in adult humans, a different ACAT may exist in the intestine. To address this issue further, as detailed in this paper, we prepared specific anti-ACAT-2 antibodies against the N-terminal region of ACAT-2. We used anti-ACAT-1 and anti-ACAT-2 antibodies to perform immunodepletion experiments in HepG2 cells, Caco-2 cells, human livers, and human intestines. We also conducted immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining analyses in livers and intestines. Our studies show that in the adult human, ACAT-2 is the major ACAT isoform in the intestine, whereas ACAT-1 is the major ACAT isoform in the liver. These results provide the foundation for designing ACAT inhibitors targeted at specific human tissues. Antipain, CHAPS, chymostatin, elastantinal, fetal bovine serum, leupeptin, oleoyl-CoA, poly-l-lysine, and taurocholate were purchased from Sigma. Pefabloc was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Reagent grade solvents were obtained from Fisher. Transwell inserts were from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Human intestinal cDNA library was purchased from CLONTECH. Multilink kit was from BioGenex Laboratories (San Ramon, CA). Microtome and OCT compound were obtained from Sakura Finetechnical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The monoclonal antibodies against hACAT-1 (ACAT-1a) and hACAT-2 (ACAT204) were from Vancouver Biotech Ltd. A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using RNA from HepG2 cells as the templates and primer sequences that were derived from an EST clone (R10292) containing high regional homology to ACAT-1. A partial cDNA was obtained, which was designated as a candidate of human ACAT-2 cDNA. This retained the N-terminal and C-terminal regions but lacked three different internal coding regions. By using a human intestinal cDNA library as the template, appropriate primers (ACAT-2-N′, 5′-ATG-GAG-CCA-GGC-GGG-GCC-CGT-CTG-CGT-CTG-3′; and ACAT-2-C′, 5′-CTA-GGT-ATG-GCA-GGA-CCA-AGA-TCG-AGG-TGT-C-3′) were used for polymerase chain reaction. Several positive clones were isolated, the largest clone of which contained 2,100 base pairs (sequence deposited in the GenBank data base; accession numberAF099031). The nucleotide sequence was determined from both strands by the automated DNA primer cycle sequencing reaction. The sequencing reaction was repeated once for confirmation. One difference exists between our clone and the clone (accession number AF059203) reported by Oelkers et al. (20Oelkers P. Behari A. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Our clone encodes isoleucine (atc), instead of threonine (acc) at amino acid 254. For expression studies, the ACAT-2 coding region was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-neo (Invitrogen). In addition, a DNA fragment encoding the 6-histidine tag followed by a T7 tag (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was inserted at the N terminus of hACAT-2 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction. The constructs were verified by sequencing. CHO cells were grown as monolayers in medium A (Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin). The ACAT-deficient mutant AC29 was described previously (12Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using appropriate constructs for transfection into AC29 cells, we isolated stable clones that either expressed the untagged ACAT-1, the His-T7-tagged HisACAT-1 (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the untagged ACAT-2, or the His-T7-tagged HisACAT-2. Stable transfectant clones were isolated using a procedure previously described (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We used both untagged ACAT-2 and HisACAT-2 cells as the ACAT-2 enzyme source to perform various biochemical experiments (described in Fig. 2, see “Results”). The results showed that the addition of the His tag did not alter the enzymatic properties of ACAT-2. HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Two clones of Caco-2 cells, yielding similar results reported here, were obtained from ATCC or from Dr. Jeffrey Field at the University of Iowa. Both cell types were cultured at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 20% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 2 mml-glutamine, supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Eleven human hepatocytes (1 fetal, 4 child, and 6 adult) were collected at the Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, and stored in liquid nitrogen in 12% Me2SO. Two additional fetal hepatocytes (22 and 35 weeks) were from Anatomic Gift Foundation, Laurel, MD. The liver and intestinal samples were obtained from organs that were removed from bodies 2–21 h postmortem and frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Causes of deaths varied among donors. A total of 20 adult human livers and 21 adult intestines were collected from the Anatomic Gift Foundation, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Starzl Transplantation Institute of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and at Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 proteins were not degraded significantly among various liver samples. In contrast, significant degradations of ACAT-2 protein occurred in two-thirds of the intestinal samples. Therefore, only intestinal samples that did not exhibit degradation of ACAT-2 were used for immunodepletion and immunohistochemical staining studies. Nine fetal tissues (livers and intestine) were collected. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 proteins were not degraded significantly among various fetal samples. The specific polyclonal antibodies DM10 and monoclonal antibody ACAT-1a were described previously (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

The specific polyclonal antibodies from two rabbits (DM54 and DM56) were generated according to the procedure as described (28Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

The antisera were subsequently purified by a protein A-Sepharose column, followed by a GST-ACAT2 fusion protein affinity column. The monoclonal antibody against hACAT-2 was generated according to the procedure as described (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), using the GST-ACAT2 fusion protein described above as the antigen. Media of one of the hybrid cell lines ACAT204 was collected and employed in the present study. Mouse antiserum against sucrase, HSI14 (32Beaulieu J.F. Nichols B. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20000-20011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Andrea Quaroni at Cornell University. Various protease inhibitors were prepared as individual concentrated stocks and stored at −20 °C. The mixture was prepared freshly in appropriate buffer to reach final concentration of 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 40 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mg/ml elstantinal, and 40 μg/ml Pefabloc. F12511, ±CP-113818, DuP-128, and CI-976 were synthesized and purified to 99% purity by the Medicinal Chemistry Division of Pierre Fabre Research. CI-976, 2,2-dimethyl-N-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) dodecanamide; DuP-128,N′-(2,4-difluorophenyl)- N-[5-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-ylthio)pentyl]-N-heptylurea; ±CP- 113818,N-[2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methylpyridin-3-yl]-2-(hexylthio) decanamide; F 12511, (S)-2′,3′,5′-trimethyl-4′-hydroxy-a-dodecylthio-phenylacetanilide. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, cell extracts were solubilized with 2.5% CHAPS in the presence of 1 mKCl. The mixture, designated as solubilized cell extract, was mixed on ice with preformed taurocholate/cholesterol/PC-mixed micelles (with final concentration of taurocholate at 9.3 mm, PC at 11.2 mm, and cholesterol at 1.6 mm). The amount of mixed micelles solution was used in excess to dilute the detergent CHAPS presented in the solubilized enzyme, such that a final CHAPS/PC molar ratio of less than 0.4 was maintained. The ACAT assay was initiated by adding 20 μl of a solution containing 10 nmol of [3H]oleoyl-CoA (in 0.25 m Tris at pH 7.8) and 10 nmol of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin to the enzyme-mixed micelles mixture. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for up to 20 min. About 0.4 g of each frozen tissue sample was homogenized at room temperature with 1 ml of lysis solution (10% SDS, 100 mm DTT in the presence of protease inhibitor mixtures). The homogenization was carried out using a Potter-Elvenhjem grinder at medium speed for 2 min, followed by passing the homogenates through a 3-ml syringe fitted with a 21-gauge needle 20 times. The homogenates were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The total protein concentration was determined, and tissue homogenates were analyzed with 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electro-transferred from gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with 0.8 μg/ml of various affinity-purified IgG as indicated. Monolayers of cells were harvested by hypotonic shock at room temperature for 3 min followed by scraping (33Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The scraped cells were thoroughly homogenized on ice with a stainless steel tissue grinder (Wheaton; Dura-Grind) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.8) at 2–5 mg of protein/ml and then solubilized by 2.5% CHAPS and 1 m KCl. The extract was incubated at 4 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to isolate the solubilized cell lysate from the nuclei and other particulate materials. The cell lysate (450 μl, with 2 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with 50 μl of Buffer A containing 12 μg of IgG in a microcentrifuge tube with constant shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. The immune complex was mixed further for 1 h after adding 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (diluted 1:1 with Buffer A). The immunodepleted supernatants and the immunoprecipitates were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. To measure ACAT activity remaining in the immunodepleted supernatant, 24 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 220 μl of taurocholate/cholesterol/PC-mixed micelles at 4 °C. The ACAT assay was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. To detect ACAT protein in the immunoprecipitates, the immunoprecipitates were washed with 3× 0.5 ml of PBS and then dissolved by adding 120 μl of 10% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min without thiol-reducing reagent. The lysate was loaded onto four identical 10% SDS-PAGE and then processed for immunoblots to detect the ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 proteins. Frozen tissues were thawed on ice in Buffer A with protease inhibitor mixtures. Tissues were homogenized using a Potter-Elvenhjem grinder at medium speed for 5 min on ice and solubilized with 2.5% CHAPS and 1 m KCl at protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. After centrifugation of 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to isolate the solubilized homogenate, its protein concentration was determined; and the final concentration at 5–8 mg/ml was adjusted for immunodepletion analysis according to the procedure described under “Tissue Culture Cells” section. Liver and small intestinal samples were obtained from autopsy cases within 2 h postmortem. Tissues with visible pathological changes were excluded from further study. Seven samples were from adults (ages between 34 and 74 years old) and four samples were from fetuses (9–28 gestational weeks). Samples were fixed by periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C, rinsed with 0.05 mol/liter PBS containing graded series of sucrose (10, 15, and 20%), embedded in OCT compound, rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80° C. The frozen materials were cut into 5-μm-thick sections using cryostat (HM 500-M, MICROM, Waldorf, Germany) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The indirect immunoperoxidase method described previously (23Sakashita N. Miyazaki A. Takeya M. Horiuchi S. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used, using primary antibodies at 2 μg/ml. Wedge biopsy samples of 6 adult liver samples (ages between 12.7 and 59 years old) were quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen at T. E. Starzl Transplantation Institute and then shipped to Dartmouth on dry ice. Four fetal livers and intestines (22–40 gestational weeks) were obtained from the Dartmouth-Hitchchock Center, quickly frozen at −80° C until use. Sections 4 μm thick were cut from neutral-buffered, formaldehyde-fixed, and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, mounted on barrier slides, dried at 60° C, deparaffinized, and hydrated. A modification of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique (34Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13457) Google Scholar) was used for histochemical staining, with anti-ACAT-1 or anti-ACAT-2 as primary antibodies at 2 μg/ml. After immunostaining, the slides were briefly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (BioGenex Laboratories, CA). Protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that similar to what as been reported for ACAT-1 (14Yu C. Chen J. Lin S. Liu J. Chang C.C.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), ACAT-2 solubilized in either CHAPS or in SDS tends to form higher molecular weight materials that are two or four times the apparent size of the ACAT-2 monomer within 24 h. The use of freshly prepared extract in the presence of 25–100 mm DTT effectively minimizes the formation of the aggregated material. Therefore, for immunoblot analysis, we routinely used freshly prepared cell extract in SDS and DTT, conduct SDS-PAGE, and evaluate ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 in their monomeric forms (50 and 46 kDa). For immunoprecipitation analysis, we avoid the use of DTT (which will cause dissociation of IgG into the heavy and light chains), and we analyze the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE without thiol-reducing agent. Under this condition, more than 80% of the ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 are found in dimeric form (100 and 92 kDa, respectively). Quantitation of immunoblots was performed using the Molecular Dynamics Computer Densitometer and ImageQuant software. In transient transfection studies, the ACAT-2 cDNA complemented the ACAT deficiency of CHO cell mutant AC29 (result not shown). A stable transfectant clone, designated as the ACAT-2 cell, has been isolated. Unlike AC29 cells but similar to the cells expressing HisACAT-1 (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), ACAT-2 cells express significant ACAT activity in vitro and contain abundant cholesteryl esters as cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Fig.1). The specific activity of ACAT-2 expressed in this cell line ranged between 200 and 300 pmol/min/mg, which is similar to that of HisACAT-1 cells. To study ACAT-2 in vitro, we used cell homogenates from ACAT-2 cells as the enzyme source. ACAT-2 can be optimally solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS at 2–2.5% and high salt (1m KCl) (Fig. 2 A); the enzyme is more active when assayed in bile salt-based mixed micelles than in liposomes, with taurocholate being the best bile salt tested (Fig. 2 B). Its cholesterol saturation curve is sigmoidal, although less so than the curve for ACAT-1 (Fig.2 C). The oleoyl-coenzyme A saturation curve is hyperbolic (Fig. 2 D), with a K m value of 14.8 μm, which is twice as high as the value for ACAT-1 (7.4 μm). Thus, the characteristics of ACAT-2 are similar to those of ACAT-1 described earlier (16Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results justify the use of the immunodepletion approach to assess the ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 activity"
https://openalex.org/W2012777155,"Inheritance of stable states of gene expression is essential for cellular differentiation. In fission yeast, an epigenetic imprint marking the mating-type (mat2/3) region contributes to inheritance of the silenced state, but the nature of the imprint is not known. We show that a chromodomain-containing Swi6 protein is a dosage-critical component involved in imprinting the mat locus. Transient overexpression of Swi6 alters the epigenetic imprint at the mat2/3 region and heritably converts the expressed state to the silenced state. The establishment and maintenance of the imprint are tightly coupled to the recruitment and the persistence of Swi6 at the mat2/3 region during mitosis as well as meiosis. Remarkably, Swi6 remains bound to the mat2/3 interval throughout the cell cycle and itself seems to be a component of the imprint. Our analyses suggest that the unit of inheritance at the mat2/3 locus comprises the DNA plus the associated Swi6 protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2003506860,"Stability of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA is tightly regulated through its 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). Here, we demonstrate that VEGF mRNA levels are increased by anisomycin, a strong activator of stress-activated protein kinases. Hence, VEGF mRNA induction is inhibited by SB202190, an inhibitor of JNK and p38/HOG kinase. Furthermore, VEGF mRNA expression is increased in cells that overexpress JNK and p38/HOG by an increase in its stability. We show by two different approaches that anisomycin exerts its effect on the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR. First, by using an in vitro mRNA degradation assay, the half-life of the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR region transcript was found to be increased when incubated with extracts from anisomycin-treated cells; and second, the 3′-UTR was also sufficient to confer mRNA instability to theNhe3(Na+/H+exchanger 3) heterologous reporter gene, and anisomycin treatment stabilized the chimeric mRNA (Nhe3fused to the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR). This chimeric mRNA is also more stable in cells overexpressing p38/HOG and JNK that have been stimulated by anisomycin. We show that such regulation is mediated through an AU-rich region of the 3′-UTR contained within a stable hairpin structure. By RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show that this region binds proteins specifically induced by anisomycin treatment.

We have previously demonstrated that growth factors and transforming oncogenes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway increase VEGF transcription by activation of AP-2 and Sp1 transcription factors, which bind to a proximal region of the promoter (26Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This action was shown to be elicited strictly by the activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (26Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the transduction pathways implicated in the increased expression of VEGF mRNA by anisomycin, a strong activator of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). We demonstrate that anisomycin increases VEGF mRNA stabilization through the activation of p38/HOG kinase and JNK. This action is presumably mediated by specific recruitment of proteins, which remain to be identified, on various parts of the 3′-untranslated region of VEGF mRNA. The established Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line CCL39 (American Type Culture Collection), its derivatives PS120 and PS200 (which lack Nhe1 antiporter activity) (27Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and human embryonic kidney 293 and corresponding transfected cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. For the p38/HOG and JNK stable transfectants, we have used two CCL39 derivatives, PS200 and PS120, in which we cotransfected hemagglutinin-tagged JNK and p38/HOG, respectively (28Derijard B.

Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ exchanger expression vectors (Nhe1 isoform) were cotransfected as a selection gene (30Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) with a 20:1 ratio. Nhe1-expressing clones were selected by the acid load test (27Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and p38/HOG or JNK expression was detected by using anti-hemagglutinin antibody in Western blot experiments. For the selection of cells stably transfected with Nhe3 chimeras, we used the acid load test in the presence of amiloride derivatives, which specifically inhibit Nhe1, but not Nhe3 (31Noel J. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. or from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]UTP were from ICN or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec. SB202190 (32Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of human embryonic kidney 293 poly(A)+ RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with an oligo(dT) primer. This material was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. The following oligonucleotides derived from the human VEGF 3′-UTR (7Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J.

Intermediate oligonucleotides were also chosen to amplify smaller fragments. These oligonucleotides overlapped the StuI restriction site situated in the middle of the 3′-UTR sequence. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: oligonucleotide 3, 5′-GCAGATGTCCCGGCGAAGAG-3′; and oligonucleotide 4, 5′-CTCTTCGCCGGGACATCTGC-3′. An aliquot of cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction volume with 200 ng of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Goldstar TaqDNA polymerase (Eurogentec) or Ampli-Taq (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.001% gelatin. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using the following parameters: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles, followed by an extra cycle with a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. Expected fragments were purified on agarose gels and cloned in the pTAG vector (R&D Systems Europe Ltd.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The different inserts were analyzed by restriction enzymes and partially sequenced using the Universal, T7 primer, or specific oligonucleotides. The coding region corresponding toNhe3 (35Tse C.M. Brant S.R. Walker S. Pouysségur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in the pECE vector (36Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) at theKpnI site to obtained the pECE/Nhe3 vector. AnEcoRI fragment of 1700 base pairs obtained from the pTAG vector containing the entire 3′-UTR was subcloned within the pECE/Nhe3 vector at the 3′-end of the correspondingNhe3 region. Then, this construct was cut withBstXI and XbaI, and a fragment of 1130 base pairs obtained from the pTAG vector cut with the same enzymes was ligated to obtain the Nhe3 WT/TOT 3′-UTR. The Nhe33′-UTR TOT vector was obtained by removal of the polyadenylation signal of SV40 provided by the pECE vector by cutting the Nhe3WT/TOT 3′-UTR with XbaI and NaeI, blunting with Klenow, and ligating. The 3′-UTR SspI construct was obtained by cutting the Nhe3 WT/TOT 3′-UTR with SspI andNaeI, blunting with Klenow, and religating. The 3′-UTRSpeI vector was obtained by cutting the Nhe33′-UTR TOT vector with SpeI and SmaI, blunting with Klenow, and ligating. The 3′-UTR PmlI/SspI vector was obtained by cutting the 3′-UTR SspI construct with PmlI and SmaI and ligating. The plasmids containing the VEGF 3′-UTR used in EMSA and RNA degradation assays contained the rat VEGF 3′-UTR and have been previously described (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). For generating the StyI construct, the vector was digested with HindIII (polylinker of the pSP64 vector) andStyI, blunted with Klenow, and ligated. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in RNA Insta-Pure buffer (Eurogentec). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, isopropyl alcohol-precipitated, and resuspended in sterile water. In mRNA stability experiments, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for the times indicated on the figures. For determination of mRNA half-life, 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as an internal standard. The entire cDNA for mouse VEGF (kindly provided by Dr. Werner Risau) or Nhe3 was used as a probe in Northern blot experiments. CCL39 cells and PS200 hemagglutinin-tagged JNK- and p38/HOG-containing clones were grown to confluence and stimulated with 500 ng/ml anisomycin for different periods of time. Cells were then rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed as described previously (34Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized pSP64 poly(A) 3′-UTR template (Promega) (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) using the SP6 bacteriophage RNA polymerase with the RNA transcription kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transcription reactions were treated with RNase-free DNase (Stratagene) for 15 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and isopropyl alcohol-precipitated. In vitro RNA stability assays were performed as described previously (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Briefly, capped, polyadenylated, and radiolabeled RNA transcripts were incubated with 130 μg of cytoplasmic extracts. At each time point, the reaction was stopped by the addition of ammonium acetate and EDTA. mRNA were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. Quantification of the undegraded transcript was analyzed with the use of a Fuji phosphoimaging system. For EMSA experiments, capped, polyadenylated, and radiolabeled RNA transcripts were combined with protein extracts (10 μg) in binding buffer as described (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and treated for 15 min at room temperature with 40 units of ribonuclease T1. When competitors were used, they were incubated for 15 min with the proteins in binding buffer before the addition of the radiolabeled transcripts. The reaction mixtures were resolved on native polyacrylamide gels (30% acrylamide and 0.8% bisacrylamide) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Cell cultures were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Triton lysis buffer (37Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). For GST fusion protein precipitation, 5 μg of GST-Jun was added per sample, followed by 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. For kinase assays, 4 μl of total antiserum directed against murine p38/HOG (38Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar) 2A. Brunet, unpublished data. was preincubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose before the addition of the extract. Precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer plus an additional wash with kinase buffer (37Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer for 15 min. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The radioactivity incorporated into GST-Jun or GST-ATF2 (the p38/HOG substrate) was analyzed with the use of the Fuji phosphoimaging system. For immunoblotting, 60 μg of proteins was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.), and the membrane was incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C. The protein was decorated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Exponentially growing CCL39 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated with [3H]leucine (l-[2,3,4,5-3H]leucine; 2 mCi/ml, 0.8 mm final concentration) in the absence or presence of anisomycin or cycloheximide at different concentrations. After 6 h of stimulation, cells were fixed and washed twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). The precipitated material was solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. To identify if SAPKs play a role in the signaling pathway leading to VEGF mRNA expression in CCL39 cells, we studied the effects of a strong activator of these kinases, anisomycin. As shown in Fig.1, VEGF mRNA was rapidly induced by anisomycin and reached a maximum after 7 h of stimulation. Such an induction could be obtained with a low concentration of anisomycin (5 ng/ml) for the CCL39 cells (Fig. 2) and PS200 cells (data not shown). However, the maximal induction was obtained at higher concentrations in all cell lines tested (CCL39 and its derivatives PS120 and PS200, HeLa cells, 9L cells, and pro-B cells) (Fig. 2 and data not shown). As anisomycin is a strong inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig. 2 b), we have compared the effects of anisomycin and cycloheximide, which was previously shown to induce VEGF mRNA (39Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar, 40Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 a shows that in our cell system, only very high concentrations of cycloheximide (total protein synthesis inhibition was obtained at 10 μg/ml) could slightly induce VEGF mRNA. This result shows that the anisomycin-dependent induction of VEGF cannot be completely attributable to its effect on protein synthesis inhibition.Figure 2Anisomycin induces VEGF mRNA expression by a mechanism independent of its effect on protein synthesis. a, exponentially growing CCL39 cells were stimulated with anisomycin (ANISO) or cycloheximide (CYCLOHEX) at different concentrations for 5 h. 30 μg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. 18 S ribosomal RNA is shown as a loading control. This experiment is representative of three independent experiments. b, cells were incubated or not with different amounts of anisomycin or cycloheximide (in μg/ml) during 6 h in the presence of [3H]leucine. The radioactivity incorporated is presented as a mean of two different experiments done in quadruplicate. CONT, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As anisomycin has no effect on VEGF gene transcription (26Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we suspected that it could act at the post-transcriptional level by increasing VEGF mRNA stability. To demonstrate this effect, we performed a decay assay in the presence of actinomycin D. Consistent with our hypothesis, removal of anisomycin resulted in a rapid decay of VEGF transcripts (Fig.3 a, lanes 1–3), whereas the maintenance of anisomycin induced a persistence in VEGF transcript levels (lanes 5–7). Under this last condition, anisomycin increased the VEGF mRNA half-life from 30 min to >4 h. Thus, anisomycin increases VEGF mRNA stability by blocking its degradation. To analyze the implication of SAPKs in the induction of VEGF mRNA by anisomycin, we used a specific inhibitor of p38/HOG and JNK, SB202190 (32Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 33Ming X.F. Kaiser M. Moroni C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6039-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 20 μm, this drug inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2, which are the direct targets of JNK and p38/HOG, respectively (Fig. 4 a). We then evaluated the ability of SB202190 to block VEGF mRNA stabilization by anisomycin. Indeed, pretreatment of the cells with SB202190 totally abolished the effect of anisomycin (Fig. 4 b). This result demonstrates that anisomycin stabilizes VEGF mRNA through the activation of SAPKs. To confirm the implication of the SAPKs in VEGF mRNA stabilization, we produced cells overexpressing p38/HOG or JNK. Fig. 5 a shows that basal and anisomycin-stimulated JNK and p38/HOG activities were significantly increased in these cells. We next analyzed the level of VEGF mRNA in these cells. Fig. 5 b shows that not only the basal, but also the anisomycin-induced VEGF mRNA levels were increased in stably transfected cells compared with control cells. VEGF mRNA levels were 5- and 10-fold higher in these cells than in their transfected controls, respectively, after anisomycin stimulation (200 ng/ml). This induction was particularly elevated in the JNK-expressing clone tested, which expressed 5–10-fold more JNK than the control cells. Such induction is directly dependent on the JNK expression level (data not shown). Then, we measured the VEGF mRNA half-life in these cells in the absence of anisomycin. After 5 h of incubation with anisomycin to reach a high level of VEGF mRNA, we substituted anisomycin with actinomycin D for the indicated periods of time. As expected, overexpression of SAPK was sufficient to slow down the VEGF mRNA degradation (Fig. 6), a result reflecting the increased basal levels of p38/HOG and JNK. Quantification of the transcript levels showed that the VEGF mRNA half-life was 30 min in control cells, 1 h and 30 min in p38/HOG-transfected cells, and 2 h and 30 min in JNK-transfected cells (Fig. 6). These results are in agreement with those of Liet al. (41Li J. Perrella M.A. Tsai J.C. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Patterson W. Endege O. Zhou F. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

Functional expression of transfected constructs was examined regarding their ability to phosphorylate ATF2 for p38/HOG or c-Jun for JNK (see “Experimental Procedures”). Kinase activity measured by 32P incorporation in specific substrates was quantified with the use of a phosphoimaging system. Presented are the means of three independent experiments. b, the effects of both kinases on VEGF mRNA expression were analyzed by Northern blotting. Cells were either untreated or treated with anisomycin (A, ANISO; 200 ng/ml) for 5 h. 18 S ribosomal RNA is shown as a loading control (CONT.). Note that the time of exposition of the blot was 7 h instead of overnight as for the blots in Fig. 1 and 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Anisomycin mediates VEGF mRNA stability by stimulating p38/HOG and JNK transduction pathways in vivo. a, control (CONT) and p38/HOG- and JNK-transfected cells were stimulated with anisomycin (ANISO; 200 ng/ml) for 5 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated with actinomycin D (ActD; 5 μg/ml) for the times indicated. 18 S ribosomal RNA is shown as a loading control.

Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether anisomycin is able to induce VEGF 3′-UTR stabilization in an in vitro degradation assay. Fig.7 shows that [32P]UTP-labeled, capped, and polyadenylated in vitro transcribed RNA containing the full-length VEGF 3′-UTR had a significantly longer half-life when incubated with anisomycin-treated cell extracts versus unstimulated cell extracts (ratio of 1.7 ± 0.2, n = 12). This protection is even more important with cellular extracts issued from p38/HOG- and JNK-expressing cells either treated or not with anisomycin (data not shown). These results highlight the importance of these protein kinases in anisomycin-mediated VEGF mRNA stabilization. These results also suggest that the effects observed in vivo are mediated through the 3′-UTR. We next wanted to study whether the VEGF 3′-UTR will confer anisomycin sensitivity to a stable heterologous transcript. The entire VEGF 3′-UTR or an appropriate deletion of this 3′-UTR was fused to the Na+/H+ exchanger reporter gene (Nhe3 isoform) (Fig.8 a). Since transcription of all the chimeric constructs was driven by the vector containing the SV40 promoter, differences at the chimeric mRNA levels could be attributed to fused VEGF 3′-UTR sequences. Fig. 8 arecapitulates the different constructs obtained by deletion on the 3′-UTR. The chimeric constructs WT, 3′-UTR TOT, 3′-UTR SspI, 3′-UTR SpeI, and 3′-UTR PmlI/SspI were stably transfected into CCL39 cells. Expression of transfected constructs was assayed by the ability of Nhe3 to confer acid load cell resistance in the presence of amiloride derivatives (31Noel J. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar). This method of selection is particularly interesting in our study since low amounts of Nhe3 are sufficient to confer resistance to the acid load test. Therefore, it allows selection of cells expressing very low levels of chimeric mRNA, a result anticipated by grafting the VEGF 3′-UTR. As shown in Fig. 8 b, in the absence of any stimulus, Nhe3/VEGF 3′-UTR TOT chimeric mRNA amounts were strongly reduced compared with the Nhe3 mRN"
https://openalex.org/W2079740701,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, is critical for vascular homeostasis. While eNOS is membrane-associated through itsN-myristoylation, the significance of membrane association in locating eNOS near sources of Ca2+ entry is uncertain. To assess the Ca2+ source required for eNOS activation, chimera containing the full-length eNOS cDNA and HA-tagged aequorin sequence (EHA), and MHA (myristoylation-deficient EHA) were generated and transfected into COS-7 cells. The EHA chimera was primarily targeted to the plasma membrane while MHA was located intracellularly. Both constructs retained enzymatic eNOS activity and aequorin-mediated Ca2+ sensitivity. The plasma membrane-associated EHA and intracellular MHA were compared in their ability to sense changes in local Ca2+ concentration, demonstrating preferential sensitivity to Ca2+ originating from intracellular pools (MHA) or from capacitative Ca2+ entry (EHA). Measurements of eNOS activation in intact cells revealed that the eNOS enzymatic activity of EHA was more sensitive to Ca2+ influx via capacitative Ca2+ entry than intracellular release, whereas MHA eNOS activity was more responsive to intracellular Ca2+release. When eNOS activation by CCE was compared with that generated by an equal rise in [Ca2+]i due to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, a 10-fold greater increase in NO production was found in the former condition. These results demonstrate that EHA and MHA chimera are properly targeted and retain full functions of eNOS and aequorin, and that capacitative Ca2+influx is the principle stimulus for sustained activation of eNOS on the plasma membrane in intact cells.

In the vascular endothelium, production of NO results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation which, in turn, reduces blood pressure. As expected, genetic ablation of the eNOS gene in mice results in systemic and pulmonary hypertension (7.Huang P.L. Huang Z. Moshimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.S. Fishman M.C.

Activation of eNOS is induced by increases in intracellular Ca2+ resulting from the activation of diverse G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors or from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Previous studies have shown that thapsigargin (TG), a selective inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase on endoplasmic reticulum and sacroplasmic reticulum, activates NO release in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) (9.Demura Y.

However, little is known about whether this activation results from intracellular Ca2+ release or from store-operated or capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) subsequent to depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool. eNOS is predominantly localized to caveolae, a specialized microdomain of the plasma membrane, which serves to compartmentalize signal transduction molecules (3.Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 11.Förstermann U.

Busse R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The caveolaen-eNOS interaction serves both to partition eNOS in caveolae and inhibit eNOS enzymatic activity. After Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation, eNOS becomes dissociated from caveolaen and becomes enzymatically activated. We hypothesize that an additional function of eNOS binding to caveolaen is to localize the enzyme in close proximity to CCE channels on the plasma membrane, and that the actual intracellular Ca2+that is required to activate this enzyme may be significantly different from that released from subcellular compartments as well as average [Ca2+]i. To test the hypothesis that CCE is essential for sustained activation of eNOS, EHA (eNOS-HA-aequorin) and MHA (myristoylation-deficient EHA) chimeras were generated and expressed in COS-7 and bovine PAEC. The EHA construct retained the ability to bind to caveolaen and target the plasma membrane, whereas the MHA construct was localized to the cytosol, and not to caveolae. Both constructs retained NOS and aequorin activity when expressed in COS-7 and PAEC. Using these two constructs, we investigated the relative contributions of release of intracellular Ca2+ versus CCE to the regulation of [Ca2+] in the region of eNOS and activation of NOS enzymatic activity under a variety of physiological conditions. We also measured NOS activation directly with an NO-sensitive fluorophore, comparing the ability to stimulate NO production of CCE induced by thapsigargin to that of generalized increase in [Ca2+]i produced by ionomycin. All procedures involving oligonucleotide and cDNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (13.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Wild type eNOS (14.Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA in pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Michel (Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). eNOS and ACVI/HA/AEQ containing adenylyl cyclase type VI (ACVI) and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged cytosolic aequorin (16.Nakahashi Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18093-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. To generate the eNOS-aequorin chimeric constructs, overlapping PCR was employed using a four-primer procedure (17.van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotide primers were as follows: primer 1, 5′-primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGGGCCACATG-3′) specific to eNOS including the XhoI restriction site (underlined) located at nucleotide 3341 of the bovine eNOS cDNA; primer 2, 3′-primer (5′-ataatcaggaacatcataGGGGCCGGGGGTGTCTGG-3′) specific to the last 18 bp of eNOS coding sequence (uppercase letters) and first 18 bp of HA epitope tag (YDVPDYASL) of ACVI/HA/AEQ (lowercase letters); primer 3, 5′-primer (5′-CCAGACACCCCCGGCCCCtatgatgttcctgattat-3′) specific to 18 bp of eNOS (uppercase letters) and HA tag (lowercase letters), respectively; primer 4, 3′-primer (5′-CCTCTAGATTAGGGGACAGCTCCACC-3′) specific to the last 15 bp of cytosolic aequorin followed by a stop codon and XbaI site (underlined). The products of PCR1 (generated by primers 1 and 2) and PCR2 (generated by primers 3 and 4) were mixed in equimolar amounts, joined by the 36 bp of overlapping sequence (generated by the internal primers 2 and 3) and filled in by plaque forming unit polymerase (Stratagene); the combined product was amplified using the external primers 1 and 4 to generate the 900-bp PCR3 product. This product was subsequently digested with XhoI andXbaI restriction enzymes (Stratagene). To generate EHA construct, eNOS plasmid was digested with XhoI andXbaI to release 300 bp of the eNOS fragment which was replaced with the 900-bp XhoI/XbaI fragment of PCR3 product. The resulting constructs were sequenced in both directions through the entire sequence generated by PCR; no mutations were detected. Similar to the EHA construct, the MHA construct was generated by replacing the 300-bp XhoI/XbaI fragment of myr−-eNOS plasmid with the 900-bpXhoI/XbaI fragment from the EHA construct. The first 400 bp of both constructs were sequenced to confirm the point mutations resulting in glycine to alanine substitution at amino acid position 2 of the eNOS sequence in MHA construct. Both expression plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and PAEC. The recombinant proteins were identified by immunoblotting with eNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antisera. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Bovine PAEC were isolated as described (18.Voyta J.C. Via C.P. Butterfield E.E. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 99: 2034-2040Crossref Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) and grown in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C; PAEC used in this study were between passages 3 and 6. EHA and MHA expression plasmids were transiently transfected into PAEC and COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). The transfection efficiency and eNOS expression were assessed by NADPH-diaphorase staining (19.Scherer-Singler U. Vincent S.R. Kimura H. McGeer E.G. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1983; 9: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 20.Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Fotuhi M. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7797-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. To determine the intracellular localization of EHA and MHA chimera, NOS enzymatic activity was assessed in subcellular fractions of COS-7 cells transfected with EHA or MHA constructs in the presence of excess substrates and cofactors as described previously (21.Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]l-arginine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the absence (basal) or presence of 100 nm TG and extracellular Ca2+ at 37 °C for 30 min followed by addition of 1 m trichloroacetic acid, and then lysed by freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen. The samples were extracted three times with ether and passed through a Dowex AG50W X-8 column (Sigma). The [3H]l-citrulline generated was collected and quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Three independent experiments were done and results are expressed as the percentage of basal NOS activity in the same plate. The measurements of NOS enzymatic activity in the presence of excess substrates and cofactors reveal total NOS abundance in subcellular compartments. In vitro [Ca2+] calibration curves were determined using the membrane fraction of EHA-transfected cells or cytosolic fraction of MHA-transfected cells as described (16.Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K.

Cells were lysed and cytosolic fraction was separated from membrane fraction by centrifugation. Aequorin was reconstituted with 5 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the presence of 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 3 h at 4 °C. Aequorin-mediated luminescence was measured with the LS50B Luminescence Spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Beaconsfield, United Kingdom) in the presence of various amounts of free Ca2+. The L max was obtained by integrating a continuous recording of aequorin-mediated light emission in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+. In vivo measurements of the effect of TG on aequorin in transfected COS-7 and endothelial cells were performed as described previously (16.Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K. Gonzales E. Guillou J.-L.

Cells were loaded with 5 μmcoelenterazine, washed, and resuspended in nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) supplemented with 75 μm Ca2+and 0.2 mm EGTA was added immediately prior to measurements. 4 × 106 cells were used for each measurement. Luminescence was measured with the LS50B spectrophotometer and subsequently transformed into [Ca2+]i values as described by Brini et al. (23.Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T.

(25.Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) using a perfusion system. Briefly, the transfected cells, grown on 13-mm coverslips, were placed in a perfused, thermostatted chamber in direct apposition to a low-noise photomultiplier. The photomultiplier has a built-in amplifier-discriminator, the output of which is captured by a Thorn-EMI photon counting board and stored on an IBM-compatible computer for later analysis. Aequorin luminescence data was converted into [Ca2+] values using an algorithm described previously (23.Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol.

In all experiments, L max was obtained by integrating a continuous recording of aequorin-mediated light emission in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10 mmCa2+. Light output from unstimulated transfected cells loaded with coelenterazine was not significantly higher than background. The light emission from EHA- or MHA-transfected cells loaded in the absence of coelenterazine or from cells transfected with vector alone was not detected. To induce CCE, 100 nm TG or 100 μm histamine were used as indicated in the figure legends. Average cellular [Ca2+]i in PAEC was fluorometrically measured using a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye, fura-2. PAEC were loaded with 2 μmfura-2 for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in nominally Ca2+-free buffer. 5 × 106 cells were used for each measurement. TG was given as indicated. Fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 510 nm in response to excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm was determined with the LS50B Spectrophotometer, and [Ca2+]i values were calculated according to the formula of Grynkiewkz et al. (27.Grynkiewkz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess NO release from intact cells, NOx (NO2− + NO3−) in the culture media was measured with a chemiluminescence NO analyzer (Model 205, Sievers Instruments, Inc., Boulder, CO) as described previously by Wang et al.(10.Wang Y. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol.

PAEC or transfected COS-7 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm TG in Krebs-HEPES buffer (99 mm NaCl, 4.69 mm KCl, 1.87 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmK2HPO4, 11.1 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μm l-arginine at 37 °C in 95% O2 plus 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, media was collected and 5–10 μl of each sample was used for NO measurement. The amount of NOx was normalized to the protein content determined by Bradford assay. To directly assess TG-mediated NO production, PAEC or transfected COS-7 cells on 25-mm coverslips were cultured in serum-free media for 24 h and loaded with 10 μm DAF-2 DA (Calbiochem), a membrane-permeable fluorescent NO indicator (28.Nakatsubo N.

Cells were washed and placed in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. After 1 min equilibration, TG was added to a final concentration of 100 nm followed by addition of 4 mm Ca2+. Fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IMT-2, Tokyo, Japan) calibrated for excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. The linearity of the response of DAF-2 to NO was assessed in vitro by generating known concentrations of NO with the NO donor NOC-9 (Calbiochem), measuring fluorescence intensity changes in the presence of 5 mm DAF-2. NOC-9 has a half-life of 3 min, and thus, solutions containing DAF-2 and 3 nm to 1 μm NOC-9 were studied 15 min after mixing in phosphate-buffered saline, representing >95% release of NO from NOC-9. Consistent with the prior publication of Kojima et al. (29.Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) we found that DAF-2 had a linear response in the physiological range of 0–2.4 μm NO (data not shown). Comparisons between groups were made using either paired or unpaired students t test, or ANOVA with Fisher post-hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., withp < 0.05 accepted as significant. To assess the Ca2+ source for eNOS activation, eNOS-aequorin chimeric constructs were generated by attaching HA epitope-tagged aequorin to the COOH terminus of wild type bovine eNOS (EHA) or myr−-eNOS (MHA) (Fig.1 A), and the chimera were subsequently transfected into COS-7 cells. The recombinant proteins were identified by both eNOS monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 B) and HA antibody (data not shown). In contrast to eNOS (M r = 135,000), transfection of COS-7 cells with EHA or MHA resulted in detection of a single product ofM r = 150,000. To determine if the recombinant proteins were properly targeted and retained NOS activity, enzymatic activity assays were performed in subcellular fractions of COS-7 cells transfected with wild type eNOS and myr−-eNOS as well as chimeric EHA and MHA constructs. Equivalent NOS activity was detected in whole cell lysates from cells transfected with all four constructs (Fig. 2 A). Similar to wild type eNOS, NOS activity was 2.5-fold higher in the plasma membrane fraction than that in the cytosol from EHA-transfected cells (Fig.2 B). In contrast, NOS activity was primarily detected in cytosolic and intracellular membrane fractions from either myr−-eNOS or MHA-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B), at a level that was 3–4-fold greater than that in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 2 C). Overall, these results indicate that targeting of the chimeric EHA and MHA proteins is similar to that of eNOS and myr−-eNOS, respectively, in transfected COS-7 cells. In addition, NOS enzymatic activity is comparable in EHA- and MHA-transfected cells.Figure 2NOS activity in COS-7 cells transfected with various eNOS constructs. A, NOS activity was assessed by measuring conversion of [3H]l-arginine to [3H]l-citrulline in postnuclear supernatant from cells transfected with eNOS, myr−-eNOS, EHA, or MHA constructs, respectively. 10 μg of protein was used for each assessment. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n= 4). (p > 0.05 versus eNOS.) Enzyme activity was not significantly different among the four samples.B, cytosolic and internal membrane (IM) eNOS activity. Wild type eNOS and EHA constructs had little detectable eNOS activity, whereas myr−-eNOS and MHA constructs had significantly greater (p < 0.001) activity in both compartments.

Wild type eNOS and EHA constructs targeted expression preferentially to the plasma membrane, whereas myr−-eNOS and MHA constructs targeted expression to the intracellular compartments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To localize aequorin activity in transfected cells, the cytosolic fraction was separated from the cell membrane fraction from cells transfected with EHA or MHA constructs. Consistent with the findings for NOS enzymatic activity (Fig. 2), 75% of the EHA luminescence was detected in the plasma membrane fraction, whereas 92% of the MHA activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction. The luminescence activity of EHA protein was not significantly different from that of MHA or ACVI/HA/AEQ chimera (data not shown), indicating that fusing the eNOS cDNA to the NH2 terminus of aequorin did not alter the ability of aequorin as a Ca2+ sensor. In order to measure [Ca2+]i with aequorin, anin vitro calibration curve was generated by measuring luminescence activity in response to differing amounts of EGTA-determined free Ca2+ (Fig.3). The plasma membrane fraction of EHA-transfected cells and the cytosolic fraction of MHA-transfected cells were used for the calibration. The relationship between [Ca2+] and log (L/L max) for EHA was not significantly different from that for MHA (Fig. 3) or from that for ACVI/HA/AEQ, adenylyl cyclase VI-aequorin fusion protein (data not shown). The results indicate that these aequorin constructs measure [Ca2+]i in the physiological range of 10−7 to 10−5m. It has been shown that TG activates CCE subsequent to intracellular Ca2+ pool depletion by inhibiting the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase (31.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 32.Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine if the membrane-associated EHA can detect the [Ca2+]ichange resulting from CCE, COS-7 cells were transfected with EHA or MHA constructs and subsequently treated with TG in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+ (TableI). The addition of TG resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in cells transfected with EHA or MHA. No change in luminescence was detected in cells transfected with vector alone (data not shown). Table Idemonstrates that, similar to the previous finding that membrane-bound aequorin primarily sensed Ca2+ influx while the cytosolic aequorin sensed Ca2+ release (16.Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K. Gonzales E. Guillou J.-L. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18093-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), MHA tended to detect slightly higher [Ca2+]i resulting from TG-mediated intracellular release than EHA (n = 7,p = 0.13), whereas EHA sensed higher [Ca2+] in response to the addition of 4 mmextracellular Ca2+ than MHA (n = 7,p = 0.04). For EHA, Ca2+ influx resulted in greater [Ca2+]i compared with intracellular release (p < 0.005). Importantly, theL max value was determined in each experiment and the luminescence value was normalized to L max to control for variable luminescence activity resulting from different levels of protein expression. Therefore, the differences detected between EHA and MHA solely reflects [Ca2+]i at the region where the recombinant protein EHA or MHA is distributed, rather than any variation in the level of expression of the two proteins.Table IComparison of intracellular Ca 2+ release and CCE in cells transfected with EHA and MHA constructsTGTG + Ca2+EHA1.29 ± 0.074.31 ± 0.73p < 0.005MHA1.58 ± 0.102.80 ± 0.25p = 0.03p = 0.13p = 0.04[Ca2+]i (μm) in transfected cells was obtained by transforming luminescence activity in response to 100 nm TG stimulation in the presence or absence of 4 mm Ca2+.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 7). In order to determine whether a physiological agonist could give rise to the differences in [Ca2+]i reported by the two aequorin chimeras in response to release versus CCE, histamine, an agonist stimulating intracellular Ca2+release via the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (33.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar) was explored. To evoke the release of stored Ca2+, cells were stimulated with histamine in the absence of external Ca2+; this was followed by the addition of external Ca2+ (Fig.4). The increase of [Ca2+]i was smaller in the absence than presence of [Ca2+]ex in EHA-transfected cells,i.e. 2 versus 5.5 μm, whereas the increase of [Ca2+]i was the same in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+ in MHA-transfected cells, about 2.8 μm. Thus, membrane-bound EHA was more sensitive to CCE while cytosol"
https://openalex.org/W1995847246,"Smad proteins are intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and related cytokines. Although ligand-induced nuclear translocation of Smad proteins is clearly established, the pathway mediating this import is yet to be determined. We previously identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the N-terminal region of Smad 3, the major Smad protein involved in TGF-beta signal transduction. This basic motif (Lys(40-)Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys(44)), conserved among all the pathway-specific Smad proteins, is required for Smad 3 nuclear import in response to ligand. Here we studied the nuclear import pathway of Smad 3 mediated by this NLS. We demonstrate that the isolated Smad 3 MH1 domain displays significant specific binding to importin beta, which is diminished or eliminated by mutations in the NLS. Full-size Smad 3 exhibits weak but specific binding to importin beta, which is enhanced after phosphorylation by the type I TGF-beta receptor. In contrast, no interaction was observed between importin alpha and Smad 3 or its MH1 domain, indicating that nuclear translocation of Smad proteins may occur through direct binding to importin beta. We propose that activation of all of the pathway-specific Smad proteins (Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9) exposes the conserved NLS motif, which then binds directly to importin beta and triggers nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2018370137,"huCdc7 encodes a catalytic subunit forSaccharomyces cerevisae Cdc7-related kinase complex of human. ASK, whose expression is cell cycle-regulated, binds and activates huCdc7 kinase in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Kumagai, H., Sato, N., Yamada, M., Mahony, D., Seghezzi, W., Lees, E., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 5083–5095). We have expressed huCdc7 complexed with ASK regulatory subunit using the insect cell expression system. To facilitate purification of the kinase complex, glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was fused to huCdc7 and GST-huCdc7-ASK complex was purified. GST-huCdc7 protein is inert as a kinase on its own, and phosphorylation absolutely depends on the presence of the ASK subunit. It autophosphorylates both subunits in vitro and phosphorylates a number of replication proteins to different extents. Among them, MCM2 protein, either in a free form or in a MCM2-4-6-7 complex, serves as an excellent substrate for huCdc7-ASK kinase complexin vitro. MCM4 and MCM6 are also phosphorylated by huCdc7 albeit to less extent. MCM2 and -4 in the MCM2-4-6-7 complex are phosphorylated by Cdks as well, and prior phosphorylation of the MCM2-4-6-7 complex by Cdks facilitates phosphorylation of MCM2 by huCdc7, suggesting collaboration between Cdks and Cdc7 in phosphorylation of MCM for initiation of S phase. huCdc7 and ASK proteins can also be phosphorylated by Cdks in vitro. Among four possible Cdk phosphorylation sites of huCdc7, replacement of Thr-376, corresponding to the activating threonine of Cdk, with alanine (T376A mutant) dramatically reduces kinase activity, indicative of kinase activation by phosphorylation of this residue. In vitro, Cdk2-Cyclin E, Cdk2-Cyclin A, and Cdc2-Cyclin B, but not Cdk4-Cyclin D1, phosphorylates the Thr-376 residue of huCdc7, suggesting possible regulation of huCdc7 by Cdks. huCdc7 encodes a catalytic subunit forSaccharomyces cerevisae Cdc7-related kinase complex of human.

DBF4, originally isolated as a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in initiation of DNA replication (3Johnston L.H. Thomas A.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was later identified as a multicopy suppressor of cdc7(ts) (4Kitada K. Johnston L.H. Sugino T. Sugino A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 21-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dbf4 was shown to associate with Cdc7 and to activate its kinase activity (5Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M.B. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Moll. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Kinases related to Cdc7 are widely conserved in eukaryotes, suggesting conserved important functions of this class of kinase in initiation of S phase (6Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K.

(online). 1999; 4: 834-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies in fission yeast clearly demonstrate essential role of Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 kinase complex (fission yeast homologue of Cdc7-Dbf4) in S phase initiation (11Brown G. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5535-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In human, cellular Cdc7 kinase activity appears to be largely determined by the level of ASK protein, the human homologue of Dbf4, which fluctuates during the cell cycle. ASK protein as well as huCdc7 kinase activity are kept high during S phase and decreases by the next G1 phase. Microinjection of anti-ASK antibody into human primary fibroblast inhibited progression into S phase, indicating essential roles of ASK in mammalian DNA replication (13Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cdk2-Cyclin E is also essential for G1-S transition in mammalian cells, although its crucial target for S phase initiation has not been elucidated. It is not known if Cdc7 and Cdk2-Cyclin E function in a parallel pathway or in the same pathway for S phase initiation. Results in budding yeast have suggested that Cdc7 may be regulated by phosphorylation of the conserved threonine present near the APE motif (Thr-281), although the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation has not been known (18Buck V. White A. Rosamond J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Ohtoshi A. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Gen.

Similar to prokaryotic DNA replication, initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes requires assembly of a series of replication proteins at the origins (20Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 197-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These include ORC (origin recognition complex), Cdc6, MCM (minichromosomal maintenance), Cdc45, DNA polymerases, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (RFA). One-hybrid assays in yeast indicated that Dbf4 protein is tethered at the origins (21Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that Cdc7 kinase complex is also present on chromatin in association with replication complexes at the origin. Biochemical studies have indicated that MCM complex may be an important target of Cdc7 kinase (7Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Brown G. Kelly T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5535-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that MCM2 may be a physiologically important substrate of Cdc7 (22Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). 1T. Takeda, K. Ogino, K. Tatebayashi, H. Ikeda, K. Arai, and H. Masai, submitted for publication. To characterize mammalian Cdc7 kinase complex in more detail, we have overexpressed and purified active human Cdc7-ASK kinase complex. Using a purified Cdc7 kinase preparation, we have examined phosphorylation of MCM complex and other various replication proteins by huCdc7-ASK kinase complex in vitro. We have shown that MCM2, either by itself or in a complex, serves as an efficient substrate of Cdc7 and that other replication proteins, including SV40 Tag, are also phosphorylated by huCdc7-ASK complex to different degrees. We have shown that Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of a MCM complex facilitates phosphorylation of MCM2 by huCdc7. We have also shown that Cdks, including Cdk2-Cyclin E, can phosphorylate huCdc7 and ASK proteinsin vitro and identified a possible phosphorylation site mutation (T376A) of huCdc7 that significantly affects the kinase activity of huCdc7. We have shown that the critical Thr-376 residue is phosphorylated by Cdk2-Cyclin E, Cdk2-Cyclin A, and Cdc2-Cyclin Bin vitro, providing the possible functional links between Cdks and Cdc7. NotI-linearized pKU3-HA-short huCdc7 (7Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was partially digested with XbaI and the 2.3-kilobase pair fragment containing the HA-tagged 562-amino acid (residues 13–574) huCdc7 coding frame was subcloned atNotI-XbaI sites of pVL1392, resulting in pVL1392-huCdc7(WT). The kinase-negative mutants, KE and KR (Lys-90 replaced by Glu and Arg, respectively), were similarly subcloned from pKU3-HAhuCdc7 into pVL1392. For expression of GST2-fused huCdc7 proteins in insect cells, the GST fragment, amplified by a set of primers (5′ ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CAT ATG TCC CCT ATA CTA GGT TAT 3′and 5′ ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CCA CGA CCT TCG ATC AGA TCC 3′) on pGEX-5X-3, was digested withNotI and was inserted at the NotI site of pVL1392-huCdc7 (wild-type or mutants), resulting in in-frame fusion of GST and huCdc7 coding frames. For expression of ASK, pME18S-mycASK (13Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was digested with StuI (present in the vector at 40 base pairs upstream of the myc tag) and NotI and subcloned atSmaI-NotI sites of pVL1393, resulting in myc-tagged ASK protein (containing 63 extra amino acids derived from the 5′-noncoding region). Three days after infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant virus solutions of GST-huCdc7 and myc-ASK (multiplicity of infection 2 of each), cells were scraped off from the plates and harvested. 109 cells were resuspended in 100 ml of IP buffer (40 mm Hepes·KOH (pH 7.6), 40 mm potassium glutamate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed in a glass hand homogenizer, and supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 8000 rpm at 4 °C. After addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin, the extract was incubated for 1 h with gentle rotation. The resin was thoroughly washed with the IP buffer, and washed resin could be directly used for in vitro kinase assays. To obtain purified soluble preparations of huCdc7 kinase complex, bound proteins were eluted from the resin with IP buffer containing 10 mmglutathione. Baculoviruses for preparation of mouse MCM2-4-6-7 complex were constructed as reported (23You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For preparation of the MCM4-6-7 complex, Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses containing MCM7, cloned onto pVL1392, and those containing His-tagged MCM4 and MCM6. Baculoviruses containing MCM3, cloned onto pVL1392, and those containing His-tagged MCM5, cloned onto pAcHLT-A (PharMingen), were used for coinfection to prepare MCM3-5 complex. Mouse MCM2 gene was cloned into pAcHLT-A. Free His-tagged MCM2 and MCM complexes (MCM2-4-6-7, MCM4-6-7 and MCM3-5) were purified as described above except that cells expressing His-tagged MCM2 were resuspended in IP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Nickel resin was added to the extracts, was extensively washed with IP buffer, and proteins were eluted from the resin by IP buffer containing 10 mmimidazole. Proteins were further purified by Mono Q column on SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak fractions containing the MCM2-4-6-7 complex, which eluted at 0.3 m NaCl, were dialyzed against IP buffer and were used for in vitro kinase assays. SV40 T antigen was purified from insect cells by using anti-Tag monoclonal antibody column, as described previously (42Simanis V. Lane D.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged mouse p27 protein, expressed in insect cells (gift from Dr. Junya Kato), was purified by nickel column, as described above for the MCM2-4-6-7 complex. The standard reaction mixtures (25 μl) for huCdc7 in vitrokinase assays contained 40 mm Hepes·KOH (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1–0.5 μg of MCM2 (or MCM2-4-6-7 complex) unless otherwise stated, and 50 ng of huCdc7-ASK kinase complex or immunoprecipitates. The reaction mixtures were normally incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 75 °C for 3 min and applied on 8% SDS-PAGE. Insect cell vectors for expression of mouse Cdk2, mouse Cdk4, human Cdc2, mouse Cyclin D1, human Cyclin E, and human Cyclin A were generously provided by Dr. H. Matsushime (24Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) and were used for coexpression with huCdc7 and ASK. Expression vectors for purification of mouse Cdk-Cyclin complexes, Cdk4, Cdk2, Cdc2, GST-Cyclin D1, GST-Cyclin E, GST-Cyclin A, and GST-Cyclin B were generous gifts from Dr. H. Yasuda, and Cdk-Cyclins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, as described for purification of GST-huCdc7 kinase complexes. Affinity-purified preparations of free MCM2 or MCM2-4-6-7 complex were treated with λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs, Inc; 4000 units/1 ml of affinity-purified preparation), and dephosphorylation of MCM subunits was confirmed on SDS-PAGE. Then, it was further purified on Mono Q column to separate MCM from the phosphatase. In the first stage, dephosphorylated or untreated MCM2-4-6-7 was incubated in the standard kinase reaction mixtures (lacking radioactive ATP) with Cdks for 20 min at 30 °C, and p27 (0.5 microgram) was added and was further incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The second stage reaction was initiated by adding huCdc7-ASK and [γ-32p]ATP (1 μCi), and aliquots were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at the times indicated. In control, p27 protein was present in the first stage reaction mixture. To generate mutant huCdc7 harboring an alanine substitution at four individual threonine or serine residue in TP or SP sequence, polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis was conducted. Four sets of primers (5′ ATG GCT TTT gCT CCC CAG CGT G-3′and 5′-CAC GCT GGG GAG cAA AAG CCA T 3′, 5′ ATT TCA CAT GAG gcC CCT GCA GTG AAA 3′ and 5′ TTT CAC TGC AGG Ggc CTC ATG TGA AAT 3′, 5′ TAG GGC AGG TgC ACC AGG ATT CA 3′ and 5′ TGA ATC CTG GTG cAC CTG CCC TA 3′, 5′ GGA TTC TAG CgC TCC CAA GTT AA 3′ and 5′ TTA ACT TGG GAG cGC TAG AAT CC 3′) were used to introduce alanine substitution at Ser-16, Ser-302, Thr-376 and Thr-472, respectively. The first and the second of the pair was combined, respectively, with 5′ CGG ATT TCC TTG AAG AGA GTG 3′ and 5′ CCT ATA AAT ATT CCG GAT TAT TC 3′ (vector primers), for polymerase chain reaction amplification of C-terminal and N-terminal halves of the coding region. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were recovered from polyacrylamide gel and were mixed with the vector primers for amplification of the entire coding region with an expected mutation. The fragment was digested with NotI +SmaI, and inserted at NotI-SmaI site of pVL1392. After in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of 10-fold excess of labeled nucleotide, the products were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The transferred protein band was excised, and the filter was incubated in 100 mg/ml CNBr in formic acid for 90 min at room temperature. The solution containing digested polypeptides was recovered and evaporated. After addition of 500 μl of water, it was further lyophilized and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The polypeptides were analyzed on a 24% low bis-Tricine gel. A synthetic oligopeptide, CVAPRAGT(PO3H2)PGFRA (residues 370–381 of huCdc7), was synthesized and used as antigen to develop rabbit antisera. Antibody was affinity-purified using the nonphosphorylated peptide and the antigen peptide. The huCdc7 coding frame, either the wild-type or kinase negative, lacking the first 12 amino acids and tagged with the 7-amino acid hemaglutinin epitope tag (7Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was cloned under the polyhedrin promoter on the insect cell expression vector pVL1393. Similarly, the ASK coding frame containing extra 63 amino acids derived from the 5′-noncoding region and fused to the myc epitope tag was cloned on pVL1393 (13Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both plasmids were transfected into insect cell Sf9, and recombinant viruses were recovered, which were coinfected into Sf9 cells. The huCdc7 and ASK formed a complex in insect cells, as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation of huCdc7 protein with anti-myc antibody (Fig.1, lanes 1–3, lower panel). The immunoprecipitate containing wild-type huCdc7 and ASK exhibited two smeared phosphorylated bands on SDS-PAGE, which were identified as ASK, as previously shown with mammalian cell extracts overexpressing the both subunits (Ref. 13Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; Fig. 1, lane 1). This phosphorylation was not detected with KE or KR mutant huCdc7, in which the conserved lysine residue at position 90 was replaced with glutamic acid or arginine, respectively, although they associated with ASK (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). Autophosphorylation of huCdc7 was not detected, when huCdc7 alone was expressed (Fig. 1, lane 4). Gel filtration analyses of the extract expressing both huCdc7 and ASK indicated that both proteins migrated at around 150 kDa, consistent with formation of a heterodimer (data not shown). To facilitate purification of an active huCdc7 kinase complex, we have fused GST tag at the N terminus of huCdc7 and expressed the GST-huCdc7 fusion protein in Sf9. In separate experiments, we have fused the GST tag to the N terminus of Hsk1 (6Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the fission yeast homologue of Cdc7, and showed the resulting GST-Hsk1 can complement the growth defect of the hsk1 null mutant, 3H. Masai, K. Ogino, and K. Arai, unpublished data. strongly suggesting that the presence of the GST tag at the N terminus of Cdc7-related kinases may not affect their functions. Sf9 cells, coinfected with recombinant viruses encoding GST-huCdc7 (wild-type or KE mutant) and myc-ASK, were harvested 3 days later, and extracts were prepared. GST-huCdc7-myc-ASK complex was affinity-purified onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin, and these preparations attached to the resin exhibited strong autophosphorylation activityin vitro (data not shown). The kinase complex could be eluted from the resin with buffer containing 10 mmglutathione. Since ASK is extensively phosphorylated in insect cells when coexpressed with huCdc7 and appears as smeared bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 2), the preparations containing the complex was pretreated with λ-phosphatase prior to loading onto gel (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). A major band corresponding to GST-huCdc7 and a cluster of several bands corresponding to myc-ASK were detected after silver staining in addition to several other contaminating bands (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 3). Only the huCdc7 band was detected in the preparations from the extract singly infected by wild-type GST-huCdc7 or KE GST-huCdc7 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and5). These preparations were used for in vitrokinase assays using GST-MCM2N containing the N-terminal 206 amino acids of human MCM2 protein generated in Escherichia coli. Autophosphorylation of GST-huCdc7 and myc-ASK as well as phosphorylation of GST-huMCM2N was detected with the wild-type huCdc7 complex, but not with the kinase-negative mutant huCdc7 nor with free GST-huCdc7 proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4), consistent with requirement of ASK protein for expression of huCdc7 kinase activity. The purified protein in solution was more efficient in phosphorylating an exogenous substrate than the resin-bound form or the immunoprecipitates (data not shown; see Fig. 7 B for comparison), probably due to absence of steric hindrance caused by the resin or associated antibody, which may inhibit the access of the substrate to the kinase.Figure 7Kinase activities of huCdc7 mutants lacking possible Cdk phosphorylation sites. A, schematic representation of the positions of possible Cdk phosphorylation sites and that of the conserved lysine residue mutated in KE and KR mutants.Roman letters indicate the conserved kinase motifs proposed by Hanks et al.

B, wild-type or mutant huCdc7 was coexpressed with myc-tagged ASK in insect cells, and extracts were prepared. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-huCdc7 antibody and were used for in vitro phosphorylation assays in the presence of GST-huMCM2N protein as a substrate. The huCdc7 used in the assays were: wild-type (lane 1), KE (lane 2); S16A (lane 3), S302A (lane 4), T376A (lane 5), and T472A (lane 6). Upper panel, autoradiogram of products of kinase assays run on 8% SDS-PAGE; middle panel, huCdc7 protein in the immunoprecipitates detected by Western blotting with anti-huCdc7 antibody; lower panel, myc-ASK protein in the immunoprecipitates detected by Western blotting with anti-myc antibody. Note that with wild-type, S16A, S302A, and T472A, myc-ASK is autophosphorylated and appears as a smear as a result of mobility shift. C, phosphorylation of MCM2 by the purified T376A GST-huCdc7-myc-ASK kinase complex. Upper panel, silver staining of the gel; lower panel, autoradiogram of the same gel. Kinases used were: no kinase (lanes 1 and5), wild-type huCdc7 + myc-ASK (lanes 2 and6), KE huCdc7 + myc-ASK (lanes 3 and7), and T376A huCdc7 + myc-ASK (lanes 4 and8). Substrates used were: free full-length MCM2 (lanes 1–4), and MCM2-4-6-7 complex (lanes 5–8).M, molecular weight marker. The affinity-purified substrates were further purified with Mono Q after λ-phosphatase treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The amount of the incorporation could be quantified by spotting an aliquot on P81 paper, which was extensively washed in 75 mmphosphoric acid. At 30 °C, the reaction continued linearly for 10 min and leveled off after 60 min (Fig.3 A). With 5 pmol of the full-length MCM2 protein, expressed in and purified from insect cells, as a substrate, the incorporation increased linearly up to 0.7 pmol of huCdc7 kinase complex and reached 20 pmol of incorporation of phosphate (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the kinase functions in a catalytic manner. The presence of salt was generally inhibitory for kinase activity. The level of incorporation was inhibited by 50% at 100 mm KCl (data not shown). The kinase reaction required the presence of a divalent cation, and the reaction reached plateu at over 4 mm Mg(OAc) and stayed at the similar level at up to 20 mm. Manganese could support only less than 20% of the incorporation of that attained with magnesium (Fig. 3 C). The reaction was not significantly affected by pH between the range of 6.0 and 8.5 and slightly decreased at pH 9.0 (data not shown). The reaction was most efficient at 37 °C and was inhibited by 30% at 48 °C. Incubation of the purified protein at 55 °C for 5 min resulted in loss of 50% activity. Titration of ATP concentration indicated the apparent K m for ATP in phosphorylation of MCM2 (in the MCM2-4-6-7 complex purified similarly from insect cells, see below) by huCdc7 is 1–2 μm, indicating high affinity of huCdc7 kinase complex for ATP. GTP, CTP, and UTP at 1 mm did not support any detectable level of phosphorylation (Fig.3 D). Previous biochemical and genetic evidence indicated that MCM complex may be the physiological substrate of Cdc7-related kinases (7Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Brown G. Kelly T. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Among the MCM components, MCM2 protein appears to be a conserved target of Cdc7 in various eukaryotes examined so far. We have purified various subassemblies of mouse MCM complex expressed in insect cells and used them as substrates forin vitro kinase assays. Uncomplexed full-length MCM2 served as an excellent substrate for huCdc7-ASK (Fig. 4 A,lane 3), and quantification of 32P incorporated into MCM2 indicated 2–2.5 molecules of phosphates were transferred to one molecule of MCM2 (Fig. 4 B). MCM2-4-6-7 also served as an excellent substrate, and MCM2 was efficiently phosphorylated (Fig.4 A, lane 5). MCM4 and -6 also were phosphorylated by huCdc7, albeit with much less efficiency (Fig. 4 A,lane 5). MCM4 and MCM6 in the MCM4-6-7 complexes were also phosphorylated to a similar extent (Fig. 4 A,lane 7). Phosphorylation of the MCM3-5 complex by huCdc7 was not evident due to the presence of insect cell-derived unknown kinases in the preparation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 9 and10). It should be noted that phosphorylation of free MCM2 causes upward mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), while MCM2 in the MCM2-4-6-7 complex shifts downward upon phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). This indicates the presence of specific phosphorylation site(s) on MCM2 that become available for phosphorylation by huCdc7-ASK only in the complex. Among other replication proteins examined, p180, p68 and p54 subunits of DNA polymerase α (in collaboration with Drs. T. Mizuno and F. Hanaoka), ORC4 protein (Ref. 25Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C.

McGarry) were phosphorylated by huCdc7 in vitro (data not shown). Viral initiators, SV40 Tag and bovine papilloma virus E1 proteins (in collaboration with Dr. J. Borowiec) were also phosphorylated by huCdc7-ASK (Fig. 4 A, lane 11 and data not shown). SV40 Tag was phosphorylated to the level comparable with that of MCM2. The functional significance of this phosphorylation is being investigated. The recombinant MCM proteins purified from Sf9 have undergone phosphorylation at the time of harvest presumably by a varieties of kinases present in the insect cells, which is estimated from the presence of mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE. This phosphorylation may affect its efficacy as a substrate for Cdc7 kinase. Sugino et al. 4M. Kihara, W"
https://openalex.org/W1998208544,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) occupy important roles during development serving to direct cells through specific differentiation programs. While several BMPs are essential for embryonic viability, their significance in mediating intercellular communication in the context of adult organ systems remains largely unknown. In the adult rat we characterized the tissue- and cell-specific transcription and translation of BMP-9. Utilizing a ribonuclease protection assay, we determined that in the adult animal, BMP-9 expression occurs predominantly in the liver. Furthermore, we determined that the non-parenchymal cells of the liver,i.e. endothelial, Kupffer, and stellate cells, are the major sources of this message. Western analyses corroborate the ribonuclease protection assay results, confirming that LEC and KC contain an abundance of immunoreactive BMP-9. Using [125I]BMP-9, a receptor with specific binding affinity for BMP-9 was characterized in primary cultures of hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. BMP-9 binding to these cell types was observed to be fully reversible and highly specific for this ligand. Additionally, we demonstrate that BMP-9 is specifically internalized upon binding to its receptor. This may represent a novel BMP receptor and is the first to be characterized in primary cultures of mature liver non-parenchymal cells. Our results depict BMP-9 as a potential autocrine/paracrine mediator in the hepatic reticuloendothelial system.

Members of this cytokine superfamily represent a highly conserved set of signaling proteins whose analogs are distributed widely in organisms fromDrosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens. A specific subclassification within the TGF-β superfamily comprises the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These secreted, dimeric proteins were characterized originally by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation following subdermal injection (1.Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar, 2.Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Generalizing from the available literature, it appears that BMP signaling is important to an organism during development and/or growth. For example, BMP-2 knockout mice expire in utero with numerous developmental lesions on extra-embryonic and embryonic structures (3.Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient for BMP-7 die soon after birth exhibiting several bone and soft tissue abnormalities which include underdeveloped kidneys that lack glomeruli (4.Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). BMP-5 knock-outs are healthy yet sustain many skeletal and soft tissue defects including but not limited to, loss of one pair of ribs, a smaller external ear, and a reduced ability to repair rib fractures (5.King J.A. Marker P.C. Seung K.J. Kingsley D.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These phenotypes arise when the affected tissues are undergoing morphogenesis suggesting that BMP signaling is particularly relevant during development when cells are being directed toward specific differentiation pathways. BMPs and their receptors are expressed in numerous cell types and during many different stages of embryonic development and adult life (6.Kingsley D.M. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 16-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 7.Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). These ligands are present in several soft tissues and skeletal structures suggesting that their biology is more complicated than what has so far been revealed by the phenotypes of the knockout animals now available. BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, and -7 have been reported to be expressed in major tissues of adult mammals including skin, heart, liver, kidney, lung, and brain (6.Kingsley D.M. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 16-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). BMP-7 is expressed abundantly in adult kidney and there is preliminary evidence that this BMP can obviate cell damage in kidney resulting from ischemia (8.Simon M. Maresh J.G. Harris S. Hernandez J.D. Arar M. Olson M.S. Abboud H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F382-F389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M. Shepard A. Jin D. Dattatreyamurty B.

While normal mice exhibit epidermal expression of BMP-6 during both developmental and mature stages of growth, adult mice overexpressing BMP-6 develop skin lesions resembling psoriasis (10.Blessing M. Schirmacher P. Kaiser S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other than these reports, the role of BMP signaling in mature soft tissue systems remains largely unexplored. It is likely that the description of BMPs as differentiation factors is incomplete since most adult tissues consist of terminally differentiated cell populations. On the other hand, it is known that most cell types undergo constitutive turnover, the significance of which may not be fully appreciated beyond tissue damage-repair episodes. With more than 20 mammalian BMPs now identified, only three type I receptors and three type II receptors have been cloned in mammals which have been shown to bind BMPs (11.Yamashita H. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Bone. 1996; 19: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The current receptor binding model as described for BMPs and TGF-β has been recently reviewed (12.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar) and stipulates that BMP ligands bind type I and type II receptors with similar affinity. However, signal transduction requires both types of receptors. BMP ligands serve to bring type I and II receptors together. This allows the Ser/Thr kinase activity of the type II receptor to phosphorylate and activate the type I Ser/Thr kinase. The activated type I receptor then initiates intracellular signaling by phosphorylating cytoplasmic substrates known as SMAD proteins. The receptor binding specificity of five BMPs have been described in the literature and indicates that there is some promiscuity exhibited by the known receptors for these ligands (13.Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14.Yamaji N. Celeste A.J. Thies R.S. Song J.J.

There is relatively little published data describing cell-specific receptor binding affinities and cell-specific receptor populations. There are a number of publications documenting cross-linking of BMP ligands with their receptors (13.Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and a select few reports characterizing the intrinsic properties of BMP binding to both cell lines and primary cultures (15.Cunningham N.S. Paralkar V. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11740-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,16.Luyten F.P. Chen P. Paralkar V. Reddi A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have investigated the tissue- and cell-specific expression of bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9). BMP-9 was originally cloned from a fetal mouse liver cDNA library and was shown to bind to specific receptors on HepG2 cells (17.Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L. Rosen V. Thies R.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4293-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, BMP-9 was shown to cause a modest increase in proliferation of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (17.Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L. Rosen V. Thies R.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4293-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate the endogenous sources of this cytokine and the cellular location of its receptor in livers of adult rats. This report describes the cellular expression and receptor binding characteristics of bone morphogenetic protein-9. A survey of major organs shows that in the adult rat, BMP-9 message predominantly occurs in the liver. Within the liver, non-parenchymal cells, namely, Kupffer cells (KC), hepatic stellate cells, and liver endothelial cells (LEC) were used. In addition, the BMP-9 binding properties of both LEC and KC were characterized. Our findings indicate that BMP-9 signals are initiated via autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms within the hepatic sinusoid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP receptor in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver. All reagents were biomedical research grade. Collagenase (Type IV from Clostridium histolyticum), protease (type XIV from Streptomyces griseus) (Sigma), metrizamide (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) and Nycodenz (Sigma) for LEC and KC isolation by density gradient centrifugation. Unlabeled BMP-2, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -12 were provided by Genetics Institute Inc. (Cambridge, MA). BMP-2, -4, -6, and -12 were shown to posses biological activity by Genetics Institute, Inc. BMP-12 was positive in the MLB13MYC clone 14 assay (18.Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). BMP-2, -4, and -6 gave positive results in the W-20-17 assay (19.Thies R.S. Bauduy M. Ashton B.A. Kurtzberg L. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). BMP-9 was iodinated as described by Frolik et al. (20.Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to possess biological activity after iodination (17.Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L. Rosen V. Thies R.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4293-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were obtained from (R&D Systems, Madison, WI). Two- to 4-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) were the source of the primary hepatic cell cultures and were handled in accordance with regulations established by the NIH. Rat liver sinusoidal cells were isolated from 200 to 300 g adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats using standard tissue digestion and centrifugal elutriation procedures. Hepatic stellate cells were isolated as described by Rockey and Chung (21.Rockey D.C. Chung J.J. J. Invest. Med. 1994; 42: 660-670PubMed Google Scholar). LEC were isolated by methods described by Gandhi et al. (22.Gandhi C.R. Harvey S.A. Olson M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). LEC were cultured on Corning 24-well cell culture plates pre-coated with 33 μg of type I rat tail collagen/ml HBSS prior to plating. LEC were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% iron-supplemented fetal calf serum (Hyclone Logan, UT), 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 g of heparin/liter, and one 4.5-ml vial of penicillin (25,000 units)/streptomycin (25 mg/ml) per liter of media, pH 7.4. Initially, 2.5 × 106 LECs at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml were placed in each well. Binding experiments were performed on LEC within 1 day following establishment of the cells in culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. KC were isolated as described by Gandhi et al. (23.Gandhi C.R. Stephenson K. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). KCs were cultured on Corning 24-well Cell Wells (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) culture plates using RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 25 mm NaHCO3, and one 4.5-ml vial of penicillin (25,000 units)/streptomycin (25 mg/ml) per liter of media, pH 7.4. Initially, 2.5 × 106 cells at a density of 2.5 × 106 cell/ml were placed in each well. KCs were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere prior to conducting all receptor characterization experiments. Kupffer cell and liver endothelial cell primary cultures are known to be highly enriched (95%) for the specified cell type as determined by peroxidase staining (KC marker) and acetylated low-density lipoprotein incorporation (LEC marker) (24.Eakes A.T. Olson M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1068-G1076PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated as described by Seglen (25.Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) and plated on Corning 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cell/well in William's E Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 7 mg/liter insulin. Total RNA was purified form cells and tissues using TRIzol Reagent and the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) immediately following the cell isolation protocol. The quantity of RNA extracted was estimated by determining theA 260 of the final precipitate dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using RPA II Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). BMP-9 antisense riboprobes were synthesized from a pGEM-3 construct containing 287 base pairs of rat BMP-9 coding region generously provided by Genetics Institute, Inc. Cyclophilin riboprobes were synthesized using pTRI-cyclophilin-rat as a template (Ambion Inc. Austin, TX). Cyclophilin and BMP-9 riboprobes were synthesized using Maxiscript T7/T3 Kit (Ambion Inc.) with 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). The Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce) was used to estimate total cell protein concentration from freshly isolated cell lysates prepared with cell lysis solution (1.25 mm HEPES, 62 mm sucrose, 0.25% Triton X-100, 6 mm deoxycholate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.078 mm pepstatin A, 0.004 mg/ml luepeptin, 0.012 mg/ml aprotinin). Total cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a Tricine-based buffer system as described by Schagger and van Jagow (26.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subsequently immunoblotted using a BMP-9 monoclonal antibody raised in mouse kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Inc. Detection of the antigen-antibody complex was performed using the goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain the desired intensity. BMP-9 binding assays were performed on 18-h cultures of primary hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells and on 48-h primary cultures of Kupffer cells. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in binding buffer (136.9 mm NaCl, 5.37 mm KCl, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.64 mmMgSO4, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) then transferred to binding buffer at 4 °C. Cells were exposed to 35–90 pm [125I]BMP-9 with appropriate concentrations of unlabeled BMP-9 for up to 24 h. After equilibration, cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer then dissolved in cell solubilization buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and counted. Cell numbers were determined from video images taken of the cells just prior to solubilization using a microscope-mounted video camera. Data were analyzed with Prism 2.0 software (Graphpad, Inc., San Diego, CA) and with the NIH program LIGAND. The reversibility of [125I]BMP-9 binding was determined by displacing the radioligand with excess unlabeled rhBMP-9. LECs were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 77 pm[125I]BMP-9 alone or with 77 pm[125I]BMP-9 plus an additional 8-fold excess unlabeled BMP-9. Following the overnight incubation, the binding buffer was exchanged for buffer containing only 615 pm unlabeled BMP-9. At the appropriate time points, buffer as aspirated then the cells were washed, dissolved, and counted. Receptors were cross-linked to iodinated BMP-9 with 500 μm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3), (Pierce). KC were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 77 pm[125I]BMP-9 alone or in the presence of 77 pmor 1.9 nm unlabeled rhBMP-9. The cells were washed three times to remove unbound ligand. Bovine serum albumin-free binding buffer, with or without 500 μm BS3, was then applied for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times and solubilized in cell lysis solution. Twenty-five μg of cellular protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and the radioactive signal was captured on a PhosphorImager plate. The specificity of the BMP-9-receptor binding interaction was determined by incubating KC and LEC with 77 pm[125I]BMP-9 at 4 °C overnight alone or with an additional 8- or 100-fold excess unlabeled competitor BMP. BMP-2, -4, -6, -9, and -12 were used in three separate experiments in 8-fold excess of the radioligand and in one experiment at 100-fold excess of the radioligand on both KC and LEC. BMP-7 was used in two experiments at 8-fold excess of radioligand on LEC. BMP-7 was used only once on KC at 8-fold excess and only once on KC at 100-fold excess (data not shown). After a 1-h incubation interval in serum-free media at 37 °C, cells were treated with 300 pm [125I]BMP-9 alone or with an additional 2.5 nm unlabeled BMP-9 for time periods up to 4.5 h at 37 °C. At the allotted times, cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold serum-free media to remove unbound ligand, then washed 3 times with ice-cold hypertonic acid wash solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5) (27.Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized with cell lysis solution, acid wash-removable, and cell associated radioactivity were determined separately. Data points showing the internalized and cell surface radioactivity in the presence of 8-fold excess of unlabeled BMP-9 represent results from a single experiment. All data points with error bars represent pooled results from three independent experiments. Total RNA was isolated from the major organs of healthy, mature Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and probed for BMP-9 mRNA using a ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) (Fig.1). The housekeeping gene cyclophilin was probed to indicate the equivalence of RNA loading as well as sample RNA integrity. Among the organs and tissues examined, it is clear that in the adult rat, BMP-9 transcription occurs predominantly in the liver. The major component cell populations of the rat liver were isolated and the RPA was used to measure BMP-9 message levels (Fig.2). Again, cyclophilin was probed to show equal RNA loading and sample RNA integrity. BMP-9 message was found to be expressed by KC, LEC, and hepatic stellate cells. Interestingly, we were unable to detect BMP-9 message RNA in liver parenchymal cells. The presence of BMP-9 messenger RNA suggests that these cells are capable of translating BMP-9 protein. To confirm this assumption, Western blot analyses were performed on whole liver homogenate and LEC, KC, and hepatocyte cell lysates using a monoclonal antibody raised against recombinant human BMP-9 (Fig. 3). Freshly isolated cells were solubilized and samples of total cell proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. As a control, 2 ng of rhBMP-9 was positioned in the first lane on the left and is indicated by the band at approximately 13 kDa, the expected molecular mass of monomeric BMP-9. Hepatocytes did not contain a detectable amount of the protein, however, BMP-9 is associated with KC and LEC following their isolation from the liver (Fig. 3, lanes LEC and KC). This monoclonal antibody clearly detects BMP-9 protein in samples of liver non-parenchymal cells (Fig. 3, lane NC). However, this method was not sensitive enough to detect BMP-9 protein in samples prepared from whole liver (Fig. 3, lane L). The immunoreactive bands with masses greater than 13 kDa are due entirely to secondary antibody immunoreactivity independent of the primary antibody (data not shown). The Western blot analysis corroborates the RPA results, establishing hepatic non-parenchymal cells as the primary source of BMP-9. It is thought that BMPs act locally by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms. Upon finding that liver cells express BMP-9 we sought to identify a hepatic cell type capable of specifically binding this cytokine. Primary cultures of LEC and KC bound iodinated rhBMP-9 ([125I]BMP-9) as demonstrated by its displacement by unlabeled BMP-9 (Fig. 4, A andB). When cells were incubated at 4 °C in the presence of 35–90 pm [125I]BMP-9 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled, homologous competitor, the resulting competition binding isotherms depict a ligand-receptor interaction of high affinity. Our assay was unable to detect [125I]BMP-9 binding in primary cultures of hepatocytes (data not shown). Binding parameters were similar between the two non-parenchymal cell types (Table I). LEC had an EC50 value of 57.2 pm with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 24.8 up to 131.9 pm. The EC50 value determined for KC was 5.1 pm with upper and lower 95% confidence intervals at 7.1 and 3.6 pm, respectively. We then used the NIH program LIGAND to construct Scatchard plots and to estimate apparentK d and B max values, (Fig.5, A and B).Table IBMP-9 binding parameters for different cell typesCell typeKupffer cellLiver endothelial cellHepG2 (17)K d24.9 pm84.6 pm300 pmB max1100 rec/cell3600 rec/cell10,000 rec/cellComparison of the K d and B maxvalues determined for KCs and LECs with the values reported for HepG2 cells. Open table in a new tab Comparison of the K d and B maxvalues determined for KCs and LECs with the values reported for HepG2 cells. Initially, we were unable to fit the combined Kupffer cell data using this program. Data for each experiment, when processed individually, yielded an extremely low apparent K dat 7.4 ± 11.5 attomolar (mean ± S.D., n = 6). Subsequently, we were able to fit the combined Kupffer cell data using a cooperativity setting of −0.1 which yielded an apparentK d of 24.9 pm andB max of 0.71 pm (Table I). In a 0.25-ml system, this represents 0.18 fmol/105 cells, or approximately 1100 receptors/cell. Visual inspection of Fig.5 A shows that specific binding is less than 1 fmol/well. Combined data for experiments using liver endothelial cells yielded an apparent K d of 84.6 pm andB max of 2.41 pm (Table I). In a 0.25-ml system, this represents 0.63 fmol/105 cells, or approximately 3600 receptors/cell. Introducing a cooperativity factor of −0.1 made no significant difference to the fit of the liver endothelial cell data. Visual inspection of Fig. 5 B shows that specific binding is approximately 1 fmol/well. Scatchard analysis assumes that ligand binding is reversible. In order to confirm that this was occurring in our system LEC were incubated in the presence of 77 pm [125I]BMP-9 at 4 °C for increasing amounts of time after which the amount of ligand bound was determined (Fig. 5 C). It was shown that [125I]BMP-9 binding by LEC increased over the 6-h interval and that unlabeled BMP-9, when added in excess, was able to displace the radioligand (Fig. 5 D). We performed affinity label cross-linking experiments with the radioligand. Binding equilibrium was established with primary cultures of KC and the primary amine-targeting cross-linking reagent BS3 was applied. The cellular proteins were then solubilized and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The radioactive signal was imaged with a PhosphorImager plate (Fig.6). A major band with an apparent molecular mass of 70–75 kDa is clearly evident. We interpret this band to be a ligand-receptor complex consisting of a monomer of [125I]BMP-9, 13 kDa in size, cross-linked to a ≅60-kDa receptor. The signal at the bottom represents monomeric [125I]BMP-9 that was not cross-linked. In addition, the radiolabeled ligand-receptor complex was not seen when the indicated concentrations of unlabeled rhBMP-9 were added. Finally, the formation of the radiolabeled complex is dependent upon the presence of BS3. The experiment was performed twice yielding identical results. To demonstrate the specificity of BMP-9 binding to LEC and KC we attempted to compete for the [125I]BMP-9-binding site with other members of the TGF-β superfamily (Fig.7). Using 2 ng/ml radioligand in an overnight incubation at 4 °C, we established maximum binding for both LEC (Fig. 7 A) and KC (Fig. 7 B). Competitor BMPs-2, -4, -6, -9, and -12 were used at 16 ng/ml (8-fold excess,filled bars) and 200 ng/ml (100-fold excess, open bars). Only BMP-9 was able to compete for radioligand-binding sites on LECs and KCs. Comparing the amount of bound radioactivity in the presence of 16 ng/ml to that bound in the presence of 200 ng/ml unlabeled BMP-9, it was apparent that an 8-fold excess of BMP-9 established the nonspecific binding of [125I]BMP-9 to both of these cell types. Both concentrations of unlabeled BMP-9 reduced the amount of bound radioactivity by nearly 80%. When candidate competitor BMP-2, -4, -6, and -12 were provided at 100-fold excess of the BMP-9 radioligand, binding was reduced by approximately 10%. Preliminary results obtained using excess BMP-7 as a competitor have yielded similar results, suggesting that it is also unable to compete for the BMP-9 binding site on these cell types (see “Experimental Procedures” and data not shown). The BMPs tested here are clearly not interacting with the same cell surface-binding site as BMP-9. Therefore, in the interest of conserving reagents, this experiment was repeated three times using competitor candidate BMPs and TGF-β1,3 at 8-fold concentrations relative to the BMP-9 radioligand. The fact that none of these superfamily members were able to compete for the [125I]BMP-9 binding sites suggested that BMP-9 was interacting with a previously unidentified receptor on these cells. We asked whether or not these cells could internalize the cell surface receptor-BMP-9 complex. Initially we determined that three acid wash cycles effectively remove more than 99% of the total BMP-9 bound (data not shown). In addition, we established that ligand internalization was temperature-dependent and that this process was minimal (approximately 10% bound radioactivity was internalized) when cells were incubated at 4 °C. LEC were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of [125I]BMP-9. Acid wash-removable, internalized, and total bound [125I]BMP-9 were then determined (TableII)(see “Experimental Procedures”). A majority of the iodinated ligand remained on the cell surface when cells were maintained at 4 °C.Table IIBMP-9 internalization is temperature dependent[125I]BMP-9Percent totalAcid washCell associatedng/ml 261.87.8 481.811.1 886.811.61680.311.0Liver endothelial cells were incubated at 4 °C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of [125I]BMP-9.

Fz receptors can signal through β-catenin–dependent and –independent pathways. In Drosophila , Fz and Fz2 are redundant receptors for Wg. In addition, Fz conveys signals through a distinct pathway to organize planar polarization of epithelial structures. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic sequences of Fz2 and Fz preferentially activate the β-catenin and planar polarity cascade, respectively. Both receptors activate either pathway, but with different efficiencies.

https://openalex.org/W2023128560,"MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation processes have been shown to interfere with the degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The cytosolic MAP kinase phosphatase MAP kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3) induces apoptosis of endothelial cells in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) via dephosphorylation of the MAP kinase ERK1/2, leading to Bcl-2 proteolysis. Here we report that the endothelial cell survival factor nitric oxide (NO) down-regulated MKP-3 by destabilization of MKP-3 mRNA. This effect of NO was paralleled by a decrease in MKP-3 protein levels. Moreover, ERK1/2 was found to be protected against TNFα-induced dephosphorylation by coincubation of endothelial cells with the NO donor. Subsequently, both the decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels and the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in response to TNFα were largely prevented by exogenous NO. In cells overexpressing MKP-3, no differences in phosphatase activity in the presence or absence of NO were found, excluding potential posttranslational modifications of MKP-3 protein by NO. These data demonstrate that upstream of theS-nitrosylation of caspase-3, NO exerts additional antiapoptotic effects in endothelial cells, which rely on the down-regulation of MKP-3 mRNA.

Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). In the past few years, several signaling systems have been identified that control apoptotic cell death (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5078) Google Scholar, 3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6104) Google Scholar, 4Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the caspase cascade executes the apoptotic pathway, MAP kinases1 are involved in modulating various regulatory pathways of the cell death machinery (5Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Whereas the c-Jun N-terminal MAP kinase (stress-activated protein kinase) promotes apoptosis in various cell types (6Verheij M.

Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), the MAP kinase ERK1/2 exerts prosurvival functions (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). Recently, ERK1/2 was shown to regulate protein levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, thus linking ERK1/2 with the apoptotic signaling complex (8Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In detail, by maintaining Bcl-2 in its phosphorylated status, ERK1/2 prevents Bcl-2 from ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting its degradation via the proteasome complex (8Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 in turn prevents the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (10Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar), an event that leads to formation of the apoptosome complex ultimately culminating in the activation of the executioner caspase-3 (11Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6150) Google Scholar). Besides the well established pro-apoptotic effect elicited by high concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), NO also exerts potent antiapoptotic effects in a variety of cells (12Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 13Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Several interactions of NO with the apoptotic signaling machinery have been postulated to explain the apoptosis inhibitory effects of NO. NO was shown to nitrosate not only the apoptosis executing enzyme caspase-3, where different apoptotic pathways converge (13Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Furthermore, NO has been implicated to inhibit caspase-dependent Bcl-2 cleavage and, consequently, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in MCF-7 hepatocytes and endothelial cells (17Kim Y.-M.

Importantly, NO was also reported to interact with p21ras and MAP kinase signaling (20Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, NO was shown to activate the MAP kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase and, though to a lesser extent, p38 and ERK1/2 byS-nitrosation of p21ras (21Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L.

Here we address the effects of NO to interfere with the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 as a potential target of the antiapoptotic capacity of NO in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the down-regulation of the cytosolic MAP kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3) (22Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), which is known to dephosphorylate ERK1/2 (23Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), maintains ERK1/2 active and, thus, inhibits the execution of apoptosis by preventing Bcl-2 degradation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. SNP, TNFα, and actinomycin D were obtained from Sigma; NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate and NOC-15 were from Alexis (Läufeling, Switzerland); and SNAP and 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone were from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Cell Systems/Clonetics, Solingen, Germany; passage 2–4) were cultured in endothelial basal medium (Cell Cystems/Clonetics) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (3 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) until the third passage. After detachment with trypsin, cells were grown in culture dishes for 18 h before experiments were performed. HUVEC were exposed to constant laminar fluid flow by means of a cone and plate apparatus as described previously (24Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fissthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. MKP-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides that were synthesized to containBamHI and EcoRV restriction sites and subsequently cloned into the respective sites of the pcDNA3.1-MycHis vector (InVitrogen, the Netherlands). Transient transfection of HUVEC was performed by incubation of 3.0 × 105 cells/6-cm well with 3 μg of plasmid as described previously (25Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To transiently transfect COS-7 cells, 7 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the respective insert were employed using Superfect™ (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To determine ERK1/2 phosphorylation, HUVEC were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μm/ml leupeptin, pH 7, 4) for 15 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min). Then, samples were run on a 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and finally protein was probed using a phosphospecific antibody against p42/p44 (New England Biolabs). Western blot analysis of MKP-3 and Bcl-2 protein levels was performed by using an antibody directed against MKP-3 (kindly provided by Dr. Steve Arkinstall, Serono) and against Bcl-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. To determine cytosolic cytochromec levels, the mitochondrial versus the cytosolic fraction was separated as described previously (26Walter D.H. Haendeler J. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Western blot membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder, 1% fetal calf serum at room temperature for 1 h and probed with anti-cytochromec antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA, 1:333 dilution). HUVEC or COS-7 cells transfected with the respective plasmid were lysed in 300 μl of buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmTris/HCl (pH 8)) for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), phosphatase activity of the supernatant was detected by colorimetric measurements of the hydrolysis of the phosphatase substrate pNPP (Sigma) at 405 nm. Total protein content was analyzed, and enzyme activity was calculated as ΔOD × mg protein−1 × s−1. Following the cotransfection of HUVEC with pcDNA3.1-lacZ (1 μg) and either pcDNA3.1-MKP-3 (2 μg) or the pcDNA3.1 control vector (2 μg), the transfected cells were identified by β-galactosidase staining. Viableversus dead stained cells were counted by two blinded investigators, and the results were expressed as dead/viable cells ×100. In addition, potential differences in cell death rate because of necrosis were excluded by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. RNA was prepared according to Batt et al. (27Batt D.B. Carmichael G.G. Liu Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 86: 15-17PubMed Google Scholar), and 10 μg was loaded on 0.8% formamide-agarose gels. RNA was blotted on nylon membranes, and the blots were hybridized with a radioactively labeled full-length human MKP-3 probe and incubated for 24 h. Then the blots were washed (0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC) and exposed to x-ray films. For preparation of nuclei, cells were detached with trypsin and lysed with Nonidet P-40. Nuclei (2 × 106) were separated by a 20.5% sucrose gradient and incubated in the presence of ATP, GTP, CTP, and [32P]UTP for 30 min at 30 °C to allow for the transcription of 32P-labeled mRNA. Then, RNA was extracted essentially as stated above (27Batt D.B. Carmichael G.G. Liu Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 86: 15-17PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare hybridization membranes, human full-length MKP-3 cDNA (100 μg) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (50 μg) were blotted onto nylon membranes using a dot blot device (Scotlab, Coatbridge, UK). Blots were cross-linked, hybridized with the radioactively labeled transcripts for 24 h at 65 °C, washed (0.1% SDS, 2× SSC), and exposed to x-ray films. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. or mean ± S.E. as indicated from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA (variance: least significant difference test). To characterize a potential interference of NO with apoptotic signal transduction involving the MAP kinase p42/p44 (ERK1/2), HUVEC were stimulated with TNFα in the presence or absence of the exogenous NO donor SNP. Then, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was determined by Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific antibody. As shown in Fig.1 A, stimulation of endothelial cells with the proapoptotic cytokine TNFα resulted in a time-dependent dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, as described previously (8Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, the exogenous NO donor SNP abrogated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation by TNFα at all time points examined (Fig.1 A). Thus, exogenous NO interferes with ERK1/2 dephosphorylation in response to TNFα. As ERK1/2 dephosphorylation is known to be a prerequisite for degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, the influence of exogenous NO on Bcl-2 protein degradation was investigated. For this purpose, Bcl-2 levels following exposure to TNFα in the presence or absence of the NO donors SNP or SNAP were determined by Western blotting. Fig. 1 B illustrates that the degradation of Bcl-2 protein following stimulation with TNFα is largely prevented by coincubation with SNP or SNAP. To further confirm the functional significance of the observed protective effect of NO on ERK1/2 phosphorylation status and Bcl-2 protein levels, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in TNFα-stimulated cells was measured under the influence of NO. Subcellular protein fractions were isolated from endothelial cells stimulated with TNFα in the presence or absence of SNP to separate the cytosolic fraction from the mitochondrial. As depicted in Fig. 1 C, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in response to TNFα is suppressed by coincubation with SNP. These data suggest an inhibitory role of NO in TNFα-induced apoptosis signaling upstream of the mitochondria by maintaining ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The inhibition of ERK1/2 dephosphorylation renders Bcl-2 resistant against degradation and, subsequently, inhibits the mitochondrial release of cytochromec. NO is known to functionally regulate proteins byS-nitrosation of essential cysteine residues (13Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 28Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-3, which dephosphorylates ERK1/2, contains an essential cysteine residue located at position 293 within its catalytic domain, the mutation of which was shown to inactivate MKP-3 phosphatase activity (23Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NO exerts an inhibitory effect on the phosphatase activity of MKP-3 on a posttranslational level, possibly by S-nitrosation of the enzyme. Phosphatase activity of HUVEC and COS-7 cell lysates overexpressing MKP-3 was analyzed in the presence and absence of NO donors by use of a pNPP hydrolysis assay. The phosphatase activity in HUVEC overexpressing MKP-3 was not influenced by an 18-h coincubation with SNP in vivo (93% of the enzymatic activity determined in MKP-3-transfected control cells with no SNP added, Fig.2 A) nor by a 30-min in vitro incubation with the NO donor NOC-15 of COS-7 cell extracts following MKP-3 protein expression (91% of control extracts, Fig.2 B). Thus, NO does not appear to modify MKP-3 phosphatase activity on a posttranslational level. Furthermore, we determined the effect of NO on the major downstream signal event ignited by MKP-3, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In MKP-3-transfected cells, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol induced by MKP-3 overexpression was not influenced by exogenous NO (Fig. 2 C). Having demonstrated that NO does not interfere with MKP-3 activity, we investigated a possible regulatory effect of NO on MKP-3 expression. Therefore, MKP-3 mRNA levels were determined following incubation of HUVEC with the NO donors SNP or SNAP for 2, 4, and 6 h. As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, MKP-3 mRNA is markedly down-regulated in the presence of the NO donor SNP (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained using the NO donor SNAP (data not shown). The down-regulation of MKP-3 was confirmed on the protein level, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 C). To assess the effect of endogenously derived NO, endothelial cells were exposed to shear stress, which activates the endothelial NO synthase (29Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 30Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2991) Google Scholar). Exposure of human endothelial cells to constant laminar flow induced a time-dependent decrease in MKP-3 mRNA levels, as shown in Fig. 3 D. Again, this effect was paralleled by a reduction in MKP-3 protein levels following the exposure to constant laminar shear stress, which was entirely prevented by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate (data not shown). To identify the mechanism by which NO decreases MKP-3 expression, MKP-3 mRNA transcription was analyzed by nuclear run-on experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the nuclear transcription rate of MKP-3 mRNA was not altered by the NO donor SNP. Therefore, MKP-3 mRNA stability was additionally analyzed by incubation of HUVEC with actinomycin D. SNP significantly reduced the stability of MKP-3 mRNA (Fig. 4 B,p < 0.01), indicating that NO destabilizes rather than transcriptionally down-regulates MKP-3 mRNA. To assess a functional role of MKP-3 for TNFα-induced ERK1/2 dephosphorylation, MKP-3 mRNA levels were determined following stimulation of endothelial cell with TNFα. As shown in Fig.5, TNFα induced a prolonged increase in MKP-3 mRNA levels, which was largely suppressed by NO. Taken together, NO derived from exogenous as well as from endogenous sources down-regulates MKP-3 mRNA levels in endothelial cells.Figure 4Effect of NO donor treatment on MKP-3 mRNA transcription rate and stability of MKP-3 transcripts. A, MKP-3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA transcription rates from isolated nuclei following incubation of HUVEC in the absence or presence of SNP for 2 h were determined by nuclear run-on experiments. Bar plots give the relative amount of MKP-3 mRNA in comparison with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (n = 4, not shown). B, MKP-3 mRNA stability in the absence (♦) or presence (▪) of SNP (20 μm) was detected by Northern blot analysis following the addition of actinomycin D (7.5 μg/ml).

Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,9Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we characterized the influence of NO on cell death induction by MKP-3. Death rate of HUVEC was significantly increased by overexpression of MKP-3 compared with control cells that were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector with no insert (p < 0.001, Fig. 6,A and C). When cells were exposed to low levels of NO provided by the NO donor SNP, cell death induction by MKP-3 overexpression was almost completely abolished (p < 0.001, Fig. 6, A and C). Furthermore, shear stress exposure to augment endogenous NO release also reduced MKP-3-induced cell death even below control levels (p< 0.005, Fig. 6 B). This effect was abolished by the addition of the competitive antagonist of NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate (Fig.6 B). Thus, death signaling in HUVEC induced by MKP-3, under conditions that do not allow for the modulation of MKP-3 expression, is sensitive to exogenous as well as to endogenous NO. Finally, to exclude a potential influence of NO on the ERK1/2-phosphorylating kinase MEK (MAP kinase kinase), we investigated the effects of NO on cell death induction by MKP-3 during pharmacological inhibition of MEK with 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone. As shown in Fig. 6 D, NO was still capable of suppressing cell death induction by MKP-3 overexpression even in the presence of the MEK inhibitor 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone. NO represents a key regulator of endothelial cell survival (16Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,32Fleming I. Busse R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 5-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Various interactions of NO with intracellular signal transduction have been described to explain the prosurvival effects of low levels of NO as produced by the endothelial NO synthase. In this study, we addressed the role of the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-3 as a potential target of the protective effect of NO in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that NO destabilized MKP-3 mRNA and, thereby, interferes with the TNFα-induced dephosphorylation of the MAP kinase p44/42 (ERK1/2). Subsequently, NO prevents Bcl-2 degradation and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which results in the protection of endothelial cells from apoptosis. ERK1/2 is an established player in the antiapoptotic defense network (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has previously been reported to confer protection against apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (33Erhardt P. Schremser E.J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,34Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway was shown to phosphorylate the Bcl-2 family member Bad, resulting in the dissociation of Bad from Bcl-xL, which allows the protection of cells from apoptosis (35Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation was demonstrated to stabilize Bcl-2 and prevent its proteasome-dependent degradation (8Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In accordance with the prosurvival influence of phosphorylated ERK1/2, its inactivation by MAP kinase phosphatase signaling in response to cellular stress was shown to induce cytotoxicity (8Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the maintenance of ERK1/2 activation via the regulation of MAP kinase phosphatase gene expression might represent an additional checkpoint in cellular signaling. NO is capable of interacting with apoptosis signaling in multiple ways. The variety of interactions of NO with proapoptotic signaling events include the maintenance of sustained Bcl-2 expression in B lymphocytes (37Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of caspase activity byS-nitrosation of the catalytic cysteine residue (13Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 15Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Here, we report the down-regulation of MKP-3 mRNA levels and, thus, the maintenance of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by NO as a novel mechanism that contributes to the protective effects of NO in endothelial cells. Our data demonstrate that NO exerts an inhibitory effect upstream of the ignition of the proapoptotic signaling cascade by inhibiting up-regulation of MKP-3. These findings extend the redundancy of NO to modulate apoptosis signaling to a rather proximal checkpoint of interference as compared with the integrative antiapoptotic blockade achieved by the inhibition of the downstream effector caspase-3 (Fig.7). Moreover, by stabilizing ERK1/2 phosphorylation via down-regulation of MKP-3, NO may modulate proliferative signals that involve activation of the transcription factors Elk-1 and ATF-2 by ERK1/2 in addition to the prosurvival maintenance of Bcl-2 levels. Remarkably, the modulation of MKP-3 protein levels by NO is accomplished by regulation of MKP-3 gene expression as opposed to the posttranslational inhibition of caspase protease activity. The down-regulation of MKP-3 mRNA by NO was independent of the transcription rate as shown by nuclear run-on experiments but is caused by a destabilization of MKP-3 mRNA. NO-induced modulation of mRNA stability has previously been reported. The inhibition of NO production in endothelial cells was shown to mimic the induction of thrombospondin-1 mRNA by hypoxia, which is known to rely on the posttranscriptional stabilization of thrombospondin-1 mRNA (40Phelan M.W. Faller D.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, soluble guanylate cyclase mRNA was demonstrated to be destabilized by NO-dependent up-regulation of a destabilizing protein (41Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of MKP-3 mRNA stability by NO remains elusive, the induction of a destabilizing protein is rather unlikely given the rapid onset of the NO effect. In conclusion, we demonstrate that following stimulation with TNFα, low levels of NO maintain ERK1/2 phosphorylation via down-regulation of MKP-3 mRNA levels, thereby providing constant phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 target Bcl-2, which prevents the degradation of Bcl-2 and, subsequently, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Thus, the antiapoptotic multiplicity of the effects of NO extends from checkpoints up- and downstream of cytochrome c release and includes posttranslational modifications of protein function as well as the regulation of gene expression to control apoptotic signaling events.

Camps and Dr. Steve Arkinstall (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute) for kindly providing us with the anti-MKP-3 antibody and Iris Henkel and Susanne Ficus for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1981343617,"Cells in the morphogenetic furrow of the Drosophila eye disc undergo a striking shape change immediately prior to their neuronal differentiation. We have isolated mutations in a novel gene, act up (acu), that is required for this shape change. acu encodes a homolog of yeast cyclase-associated protein, which sequesters monomeric actin; we show that acu is required to prevent actin filament polymerization in the eye disc. In contrast, profilin promotes actin filament polymerization, acting epistatically to acu. However, both acu and profilin are required to prevent premature Hedgehog-induced photoreceptor differentiation ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. These findings suggest that dynamic changes in actin filaments alter cell shape to control the movement of signals that coordinate a wave of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1979380946,"Ligand-induced activation of G protein-coupled receptors is emerging as an important pathway leading to the activation of certain receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Substance P (SP) exerts many effects via activation of its G protein-coupled receptor (neurokinin-1, NK-1). SP participates in acute inflammation and activates key proteins involved in mitogenic pathways, such mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), stimulating DNA synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that SP-induced MAPK activation and DNA synthesis require activation of the EGFR. In U-373 MG cells, which express functional NK-1, SP induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including EGFR. SP induced formation of an activated EGFR complex containing the adapter proteins SHC and Grb2, but not c-Src. SP activated the MAPK pathway as shown by increased Erk2 kinase activity. SP induced Erk2 activation, and DNA synthesis was inhibited in cells transfected with a dominant negative EGFR plasmid lacking kinase activity, as well as in cells treated with a specific EGFR inhibitor. In addition, pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gαι protein subunits, prevented SP-induced EGFR transactivation and subsequent DNA synthesis. Our results implicate EGFR as an essential regulator in SP/NK-1-induced activation of the MAPK pathway and cell proliferation in U-373 MG cells, and these events are mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gα protein. We suggest that this mechanism by which SP controls cell proliferation is an important pathway in tissue restoration and healing.

SP has been implicated in the regulation of several physiologic and pathophysiologic processes such as pain, smooth muscle contraction, and intestinal secretion (1Pernow B. Pharmacol.

For example, SP is a chemoattractant for monocytes (3Ruff M.R. Wahl S.M. Pert C.B. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1985; 2 (suppl.): 107-110Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Weidermann C.J.

Besides acting as a pro-inflammatory mediator and a neurotransmitter, SP induces mitogenesis of several cell types including T lymphocytes (11Payan D.G. Brewster D.R. Goetzl E.J. J.

In addition, SP acts synergistically with growth factors to stimulate skin fibroblast proliferation (14Kahler C.M. Herold M. Reinisch N. Wiedermann C.J. J. Cell.

Induction of mitogenesis and migration by SP suggests a possible beneficial role for this peptide in tissue healing during chronic inflammation. Indeed, several in vivo studies show that SP and SPR are up-regulated during chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by diffuse tissue damage (16Mantyh C.R. Gates T.S. Zimmermann R.P. Welton M.L. Pasaro E.P. Vigna S.R. Maggio J.E. Kruger L. Mantyh P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 17Sharkey K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which SP exerts its effects on cell proliferation during wound healing and tissue restoration. SP binding sites have been identified in the nervous system as well as peripheral tissues such as in immune (3Ruff M.R. Wahl S.M. Pert C.B. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1985; 2 (suppl.): 107-110Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), epithelial (20Pothoulakis C. Castagliuolo I. Li H. Wang C. Hoffman B.J. LaMont J.T. Leeman S. Mezey E. Am. J.

Sequence analysis of the cloned NK-1 has demonstrated that it belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, and displays a typical 7-transmembrane-spanning domain structure (21Hershey A.D. Krause J.E. Science. 1990; 247: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The SPR has been shown to associate with a variety of Gα protein isotypes, such as Gα0/11, Gαi, and Gαs (22Nishimura K. Frederick J. Kwatra M.M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1998; 18: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Roush E.D. Kwatra M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, SP binding to SPR and consequent activation of G protein subunits results in the activation of a variety of second messengers, including inositol-3-phosphate kinase resulting in hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, cAMP formation (24Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), and arachidonic acid release (25Kahler C.M. Herold M. Wiedermann C.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These events lead to mobilization of intracellular calcium and enhancement of protein kinase activity, including protein kinase C (24Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Mitogenic pathways are tightly regulated by a variety of molecular events, most notably the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on several key effector proteins. Growth factors, such EGF and platelet-derived growth factor, bind specifically to membrane receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in autophosphorylation of the receptor. Once activated, such receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruit adapter proteins to the cell plasma membrane, forming an activated complex that initiates a signaling cascade leading to nuclear translocation of transcription factors and cell proliferation (26Pazin M.J. Williams L.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 374-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mitogenic mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid (27Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), thrombin (27Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar), which bind to GPCRs, ultimately activate similar signaling pathways. Because GPCRs lack intrinsic kinase activity, transactivation of growth factor receptors is a possible mechanism by which ligand binding to GPCRs can activate mitogenic signal transduction pathways. For example, the EGFR has been recently identified as an essential element in the GPCR-mediated activation of MAPK-dependent pathways in cells treated with various GPCR agonists (27Daub H. Weiss F.U.

In this study, we sought to characterize the role of transactivation of growth factor RTKs in SP-induced cell proliferation. Specifically, we determined whether SP-induced EGFR activation can activate the MAPK cascade and induce cell proliferation. Using U-373 MG cells, an astroglioma cell line that expresses functional NK-1 receptors (31Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1989; 488: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we found that nanomolar concentrations of SP cause transphosphorylation of EGFR and the formation of an activated EGFR complex containing specific adapter proteins. We demonstrate that SP-induced MAPK activation and cell proliferation require the presence of a functional EGFR kinase domain and involve a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein. To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration that transactivation of the EGFR is involved in SP-induced cell proliferation. U-373 MG cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 10 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). CHO cells (ATCC) were cultured in F-12 nutrient mixture containing 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma). U-373 MG cells were cultured in complete medium, and when 75% confluent, they were incubated for 18 h in medium containing 0% FCS. Cells were then incubated with SP (10 nm) (29Luo W. Sharif T.R. Sharif M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar) or EGF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were preincubated (18 h) with PTX (100 ng/ml) (Calbiochem). Monolayers were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed (45 min on ice) using nondenaturing RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 5 min), and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinichonic acid method (Pierce). Lysates (2 mg/ml) were incubated with the appropriate antibody (10 μg/mg cell lysate) for 2 h at 4 °C. EGFR was precipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody, whereas SHC and c-Src were precipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1 μg of antibody/200 μg of whole cell lysate for all above immunoprecipitates) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-agarose or protein G Plus-agarose (50 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice by centrifugation (20 s, 12,000 × g) with ice-cold RIPA buffer followed by one wash with ice-cold PBS and then boiled (5 min) in 30 μl of sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on a SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred and immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues were identified using the PY99 antibody (1:1000 dilution), and SHC proteins were identified using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Grb2 proteins were identified using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories; Lexington, KY). Immunocomplexes were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated on sterile coverslips at a density of 100,000 cells/ml and cultured in complete media. After 24 h, medium containing 0.5% FCS was placed on the cells overnight. Cells were stimulated with SP (10 nm) for the indicated time periods, followed by two washes with ice-cold PBS. The following procedures were done at room temperature using PBS at a pH of 7.4 unless otherwise stated. Cells were then fixed on the coverslip using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then washed (three times for 10 min with PBS). Cells were then permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The Triton X mixture was removed, and free aldehyde groups were inactivated by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride in PBS for 10 min and then washed (three times for 5 min with PBS). Cells were then incubated in 3.0% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h to block any nonspecific binding. Cells were then probed with 4 ng/ml antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 40 min, followed by washing (three times for 5 min with PBS). Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were then detected by the addition of donkey anti-mouse rhodamine-labeled antibody for 40 min (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Excess rhodamine-labeled antibody was removed by washing (three times for 5 min with PBS). Coverslips were then mounted, and proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues were visualized using a confocal microscope (Model MRC1024, Bio-Rad) with Plan-Neofluar objective (100×). Images were digitally stored in Bio-Rad COMOS software. U-373 MG cells were transfected using a modified CaPO4/DNA precipitation procedure (34Hauck W. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3602-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/ml and cultured for 24 h. Two hours prior to transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Then, a total of 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA/ml of medium was introduced to the cells. After 18 h, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in complete medium for the indicated period of time. Preliminary experiments showed that the transfection efficiency (evaluated by expression of green fluorescent protein (In vitrogen)) in cells transfected with pCHER (35Prywes R. Livneh E. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and selected with methotrexate (10 mm), was ∼30–40%, whereas the efficiency was improved to over 90% by co-transfection with pSP73 (Promega) a plasmid carrying a neomycin resistance gene (data not shown). Erk2 in vitro kinase activity was determined as described previously by Daub et al. (36Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Briefly, mock and pCHER transfected U-373 cells (75% confluent) were treated with SP (10 nm) for 7 min or EGF (10 ng/ml) for 3 min. Erk2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the RIPA soluble lysates using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice in RIPA and once in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm sodium orthovanidate). Kinase reactions were performed immediately in a 30-μl volume of kinase buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma), 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). After 10 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× sample buffer. Reactions were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were dried, and phosphorylated myelin basic protein was identified by audoradiography. DNA proliferation assays were performed as described previously (37Binion D.G. West G.A. Ina K. Ziats N.P. Emancipator S.N. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1895-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-373 MG cells were plated at 25,000/cm2 in 6-well plates, and after 24 h cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with pCHER (2.0 μg/well) and pSP73 (0.5 μg/well), which contains a neomycin resistance gene. Cells were washed twice with PBS after 18 h and then cultured in complete medium containing geneticin (1 mg/ml) to select for transfected cells. After 48 h, medium was removed, and cells were cultured overnight in medium containing no FCS. In some experiments mock-transfected cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μm tyrphostin AG1478 (Calbiochem) for 15 min before stimulation. Cells were then stimulated (6 h at 37 °C) with SP (10 nm) or EGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence of [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well). Cells were washed (three times) with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 0.3 m NaOH, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. DNA synthesis was expressed as counts/min. In separate experiments, control CHO cells, a cell line that does not express functional EGFR, and CHO cells stably expressing the human NK-1 receptor (a kind gift of Dr. Nick Boyd, Boston University Medical School, Boston, MA) were transfected with pEGFR (a kind gift of Dr. David Levy, New York University) using the same procedure as stated above. DNA proliferation assays in response to SP were performed as described above. U-373 MG cells express functional NK-1 (32Eistetter H.R. Mills A. Brewester R. Alouani S. Rambosson C. Kawashima E.

J Neuroimmunol. 1995; 59: 155-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In basal conditions, few proteins in U-373 MG cells appear to be tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1). Upon treatment with SP (10 nm), at least four distinct protein bands showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot (Fig.1). Increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected as early as 2 min after exposure to SP, and several proteins remained phosphorylated for up to 1 h. Similarly, immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that only a few proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated cells (Fig.2 A). However, at 30, 60, and 90 min, there was a dramatic increase of phosphorylated tyrosine residues localized in the nucleus, as well as on the cell's outer membrane (Fig. 2, B–D). These data, taken together, demonstrate the ability of SP to induce phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues, even though NK-1 lacks intrinsic kinase activity (2Nakanishi S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).Figure 2SP induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in U-373 MG cells. Cells were cultured on coverslips and then incubated without (A) or with SP (10 nm) for 30 (B), 60 (C), or 90 (D) min. Cells were fixed and subject to immunocytochemistry. Proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues were identified using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody and visualized using confocal microscopy. The amount of phosphorylated tyrosine residues increases dramatically and time dependently in response to SP. Phosphorylated proteins appear to be localized mainly in focal regions of the plasma membrane and in the nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the NK-1 is a GPCR and recent studies have indicated that GPCRs can transactivate RTKs, we examined the effect of SP on EGFR. As shown in Fig.3 A, SP at nanomolar concentrations induced a transient and biphasic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in U-373 MG cells. EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable as early as 2 min after SP exposure and returned to control levels at 5–7 min. EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated again at 10–15 min and began to diminish at 30 min (Fig.3 A). Ligand-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR causes recruitment of adapter proteins such as SHC, Grb2, Sos, and Src family kinases to the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR (26Pazin M.J. Williams L.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 374-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, SP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins that co-precipitated with EGFR. To identify the proteins co-precipitating with EGFR, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-SHC, Grb2, and c-Src antibodies. Increased association with activated EGFR (Fig. 3 B) and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C) of SHC in response to SP was detected. Furthermore, the adapter protein Grb2 was also associated with the activated EGFR complex in response to SP (Fig. 3 D). However, there was no increase in the amount of c-Src associated with the EGFR complex, and no tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src in response to SP was evident (data not shown). The association between Grb2 and EGFR is an essential step in the activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, ultimately initiating DNA synthesis. Because SP triggers both EGFR transactivation and MAPK activation, we tested the functional role of EGFR in SP-induced activation of the MAPK Erk2. As determined by increased phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in vitro, Erk2 was activated following U-373 MG stimulation with SP and with the RTK ligand EGF (Fig. 4). In cells transfected with a dominant negative EGFR plasmid lacking kinase activity (pCHER), however, Erk2 activation by both SP and EGF was considerably inhibited (Fig. 4). To further determine the functional role of SP-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, we tested the effect of pCHER and tyrphostin AG1478 (a specific inhibitor of EGFR) on SP-induced DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig.5 A, SP and EGF induced DNA synthesis in mock-transfected U-373 MG cells as indicated by increased [3H]thymidine incorporation. SP- and EGF-induced DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited in pCHER-transfected U-373 MG cells. Furthermore, incubation of cells with tyrphostin AG1478 almost completely inhibited both SP- and EGF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig.5 A). The requirement for EGFR in SP-induced DNA synthesis was also tested in CHO cells that do not normally express either NK-1 and EGF receptors. In these experiments CHO cells were mock-transfected, transfected with NK-1 alone, or with NK-1 and EGFR together, and then SP-induced DNA synthesis was determined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, SP and EGF did not stimulate DNA synthesis in either normal CHO cells or CHO cells expressing NK-1. However, in CHO cells expressing NK-1 and EGFR, exposure to SP significantly increased DNA synthesis (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that the kinase activity of the EGFR is required for SP to induce DNA synthesis. NK-1 associates with several G protein α subunits such as Gq/11, Gαo, and Gαs (22Nishimura K. Frederick J. Kwatra M.M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1998; 18: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Roush E.D. Kwatra M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We next determined whether SP-mediated EGFR activation and subsequent DNA synthesis was mediated through a PTX-sensitive Gαι subunit. As shown in Fig.6, pretreatment of cells with PTX completely prevented SP-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, SP-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with PTX (Fig. 7), whereas PTX had no effect on EGF-induced DNA synthesis. These results suggest that SP-induced activation of EGFR involves a PTX-sensitive Gα subunit.Figure 7SP-induced DNA synthesis requires a PTX-sensitive Gα subunit. U-373 MG cells were serum-starved and incubated with PTX overnight. Then they were incubated with SP (10 nm) or EGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence of [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well). After 6 h, cells were washed, scraped, and placed in scintillation vials to determine [3H]thymidine incorporation. Results were expressed as counts/min (cpm). SP and EGF significantly increased DNA synthesis over control. SP-induced DNA synthesis was completely prevented by PTX treatment, whereas PTX had no significant effect on EGF induced DNA synthesis.

It is mitogenic, both in vivo and in vitro, it is quasi-obligatory for transformation, it can protect cells from a variety of apoptotic injuries, and it can also induce differentiation in certain types of cells (1Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The fact that the IGF-IR can induce cell differentiation (that eventually results in inhibition of growth and cell death) is in clear contradiction to its other properties, which are more of a growth-promoting type. The mechanism by which the IGF-IR switches from one signaling to another is in itself of considerable interest. We have recently shown that, in the case of the IGF-IR, the choice between stimulation of cell proliferation or differentiation depends on the availability of the immediate substrates of the IGF-IR (2Valentinis B.

In those experiments, we used as a model 32D cells (3Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, IGF-I can induce in these cells a differentiation program along the granulocytic pathway (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A characteristic of 32D cells is that they are devoid of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 (12Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H.

This unbalance between the two major substrates of the IGF-IR suggested that the absence of IRS-1 could play a role in the induction of differentiation by IGF-I in 32D IGF-IR cells. Indeed, re-introduction of IRS-1 in these cells resulted in inhibition of IGF-I-mediated differentiation, which was also inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Shc (2Valentinis B. Romano G.

It seems therefore that proliferation or differentiation of 32D IGF-IR cells depends on the availability of substrates, with IRS-1 favoring proliferation and Shc proteins favoring differentiation. An important aspect of those experiments was that the IGF-IR, by itself, causes 32D cells to grow very rapidly for the first 48 h. During this 48-h period, there is no appreciable difference in the rate of growth between 32D IGF-IR cells and 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells (Refs. 2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M.

This is in agreement with the established fact that differentiation of cells, especially hemopoietic cells, requires a short period of cell proliferation (5Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D.

A typical example is the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which induces both the proliferative and the differentiating programs, with the latter eventually prevailing. In previous papers (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol.

Since this pathway connects with the activation of p70S6K (16Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have focused, in the present investigation, on p70S6K (17Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have found that sustained activation of p70S6K (in vivophosphorylation of threonine 389 and threonine 421/serine 424) correlates with the inhibition of differentiation (and therefore with the transformed phenotype). In addition, rapamycin and okadaic acid (OKA), both of which inhibit p70S6K activation, induce differentiation of 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells. Inhibition of differentiation is accompanied by an increase in size of the cells, which is in agreement with the effect of homologues of IRS-1 (18Bohni R. Riesco-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F. Beckingham K. Hafen E. Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and p70S6K (19Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) on cell size in Drosophila. By determining the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) mRNA, we also find that the differentiation program is already activated in 32D IGF-IR cells while they are still actively proliferating. MPO mRNA, however, does not increase in 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells. These results suggest that IRS-1 may indeed extinguish the differentiation program of 32D IGF-IR cells (without affecting its proliferative program), and that this effect may be mediated by the sustained activation of p70S6K. Finally, we report here that 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells, in addition to be able to grow in the absence of IL-3 without differentiating, can also form tumors in mice. These latter experiments confirm and extend previous reports that overexpression of IRS-1 results in transformation (20D'Ambrosio C. Keller S.R. Morrione A. Lienhard G.E. Baserga R. Surmacz E.

These three cell lines are mixed populations obtained by retroviral infection and have already been described by Valentinis et al. (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S.

Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% WEHI cell conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 and the required antibiotics to maintain the selective pressure (250 μg/ml G418, from Life Technologies, Inc., or 250 μg/ml hygromycin, from Calbiochem). For brevity, the WEHI cell conditioned medium will be referred to as IL-3. Cells exponentially growing were collected, washed three times, and seeded in IL-3-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing only 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 50 ng/ml IGF-I. In some experiments, inhibitors (10 nm or 20 nm okadaic acid (Sigma), or 2.5 or 10 ng/ml rapamycin (Sigma)) were added. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml. After 4 and 6 days, viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cytospins were performed for morphological analysis. To establish the ability for IL-3-independent growth, cells from the same experiments at day four were re-plated in fresh IL-3-free medium with IGF-I (50 ng/ml) at a density of 5 × 104cells/ml. Cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion after 4 additional days (for a total of 8 days of culture). To evaluate the degree of granulocytic differentiation, cytospins were stained with Wright-Giemsa and the cells in the different stages of differentiation counted at the microscope. Differentiation was expressed as percentage of bands and polymorphonuclear cells in the total number of scored cells. For the detection of phosphorylated proteins, exponentially growing cells were washed three times and incubated in serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) for 4 h before stimulation with 20 ng/ml IGF-I (Life Technologies, Inc.). When inhibitors were used, cells were pre-incubated with the inhibitors for 1 h (okadaic acid) or 15 min (rapamycin) before stimulation with IGF-I. At the desired time point, cells were collected, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer in ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and probed with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Oncogene Science). Blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) The phosphorylation of specific amino acids in p70S6K (phospho-Thr389, phospho-Thr421/Ser424, and phospho-Ser411) was detected with antibodies purchased from New England Biolabs. The total amount of p70S6K loaded was monitored after stripping of the filters by immunoblotting with an anti p70S6K antibody (C-18, Santa Cruz). IRS-1 was detected with an antibody to its carboxyl-terminal (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Exponentially growing cells were prepared and seeded under the same conditions used for growth analysis. After 24 and 48 h, cells were collected and immediately analyzed for size and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Cell size was determined by forward scattering (FS). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by staining the cells with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was analyzed using an Elite ESP-EPICS flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Software was Elite version 4.5. For the detection of the MPO mRNA level, exponentially growing cells were prepared and seeded under the same conditions used for growth analysis. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and total RNA was extracted with the Tri-Reagent solution (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total RNA for each sample were run on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with a 1.45-kilobase myeloperoxidase cDNA fragment obtained from the pUC19-MMPO6 plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. Mauro Valtieri). The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified using the QuickSpinn G-50 Sephadex columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was performed in 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 16 h. Cells exponentially growing were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and injected intraperitoneally into NIH Swiss nude mice. Each animal was injected with 10 × 106 cells and sacrificed after 6 weeks, and its organs were isolated, weighed, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Histological sections of the organs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for the presence of infiltrating 32D cells. The parental 32D cells cl. 3 (5Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J.

Both 32D IGF-IR cells and 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells grow at similar rates in IGF-I-supplemented medium for the first 48 h and do not show any morphological sign of differentiation (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol.

We have monitored the deoxybromouridine labeling of these cells, growing in IGF-I, between IL-3 withdrawal (0 time) and 24 h, and between 24 and 48 h. With both cell lines, and for both time intervals, the labeling with deoxybromouridine was 100% (data not shown). Thus, in the first 48 h, the two cell lines are essentially indistinguishable, although 32D IGF-IR cells eventually differentiate and decrease in number. In a previous paper (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we had shown that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc was essentially similar in the 2 cell lines, and that IRS-1 was tyrosyl-phosphorylated when 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells were stimulated with IGF-I. Soon et al. (10Soon L. Flechner L. Gutkind J.S. Wang L.H. Baserga R. Pierce J.H. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3816-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that, in the absence of IRS-1, PI 3-kinase activity is undetectable in 32D IGF-IR cells, which survive and grow (for at least 48 h) in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors (11Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of IRS-1 causes a dramatic increase in PI 3-kinase activity, and these findings of Soon et al. (10Soon L. Flechner L. Gutkind J.S. Wang L.H. Baserga R. Pierce J.H. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3816-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been confirmed (data not shown). Akt/PKB is strongly activated by IGF-I in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells, but only weakly activated in 32D IGF-IR cells (2Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is not surprising since Akt activation is markedly increased by PI 3-kinase (23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), whose activity, in turn, is strongly increased by IRS-1 (27Myers M.J. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this report, we have focused our attention on p70S6K, whose activity is strongly dependent on the activation of PI 3-kinase (16Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Akt/PKB pathway (28Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The analysis of the specific phosphorylated amino acid was performed on samples run on a 4–15% gradient gel. We used one membrane for each blot of p70S6Kphospho-amino acid to detect a clear, specific signal without interference from the stripping of the membrane. The time of observation ranged from 0 to 60 min. To show the mobility shift of p70S6K, that is generally accepted as an indicator of p70S6K activity (16Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), samples were run on a 7.5% gel. Using the antibody to phosphothreonine 421/phosphoserine 424 (30Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), p70S6K phosphorylation is clearly detectable, after IGF-I stimulation, in 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells, but not in 32D IGF-IR cells (Fig. 1, panel C). A difference was also detected using an antibody to phospho-threonine 389 (Fig. 1, panel A), which is the residue whose dephosphorylation most closely parallels loss of kinase activity (28Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The response to IGF-I stimulation was stronger and more prolonged in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells than in 32D IGF-IR cells. The antibody to phosphoserine 411 of p70S6K could not detect clearly reproducible differences between the two cell lines, after stimulation with IGF-I (Fig. 1, panel E). Panels B, D, and F show the total amounts of p70S6K in each lane. A mobility shift blot is shown in Fig.1 (panel G); a shift is detectable in both cell lines, but it is more accentuated, especially at 30 min, and more sustained in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells. However, it is evident that the IGF-IR can activate p70S6K even in the absence of IRS-1. Threonine 389 belongs to the group of serine/threonines of p70S6K that are rapamycin-sensitive. In fact, they were originally considered to be the only residues that were rapamycin-sensitive, with the residues in the C terminus (like threonine 421 and serine 424) considered insensitive (29Han J.W.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). More recent reports have questioned this difference (33Hara K.K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 34Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although rapamycin actually targets mTOR, its effect is most crucial on the phosphorylation of threonine 389 (28Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if rapamycin-sensitive residues are less activated in 32D IGF-IR cells, then rapamycin, at appropriate concentrations, ought to induce differentiation of 32D/IGF-IR/IRS1 cells. For this purpose, 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells were treated with rapamycin in the presence of IGF-I. As shown in Fig. 2(panel A), the proliferation of 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells is inhibited by rapamycin (at concentrations of 2.5 and 10 ng/ml). After 4 days, the cell number of rapamycin-treated 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells is essentially the same as in untreated 32 IGF-IR cells. At the same time, differentiation resumes under rapamycin treatment reaching the same percentage observed for 32D IGF-IR cells (panel B). The effect of rapamycin on p70S6K activation is summarized in Fig. 3. In the presence of rapamycin, IGF-I fails to phosphorylate threonine 389 (panel A) and also, to a lesser extent, serine 411 (panel E). Despite some difficulty in identifying the phospho-p70S6K in panel C, one can say that rapamycin also inhibits phosphorylation of threonine 421/serine 424. This well known inhibition by rapamycin (see “Discussion”) was confirmed by mobility shift (Fig. 3,panel G). The amounts of p70S6Kprotein in each lane are shown in Fig. 3 (panels B, D, and F). These experiments confirm that the p70S6K pathway plays a major role in determining the fate of 32D IGF-IR cells (differentiationversus transformation). It has recently been reported that, inDrosophila, both the IRS homologue CHICO (18Bohni R. Riesco-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F. Beckingham K. Hafen E. Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and the S6 kinase homologue (19Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) regulate cell size. We compared the cell size of 32D IGF-IR and 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells, by forward scatter analysis. Since the cell cycle distribution of a cell population affects cell size, we also stained the cells with Hoechst 33342 and determined the cell cycle distribution. There was no difference between the two cell lines (data not shown). We then compared cell size of subpopulations in different phases of the cell cycle (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4 (panel A) compares the cell size distribution generated by FACS analysis for subpopulations of 32D IGF-IR and 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle 48 h after IL-3 withdrawal and supplementation with IGF-I. In all three phases of the cell cycle, the mean of the forward scatter of 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells was 15–20% higher than the mean of 32D IGF-IR cells. This difference was highly reproducible in repeated experiments. Similar results, but somewhat less pronounced, were detected at 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal and IGF-I supplementation. Fig. 4(panels B–D), shows three necessary controls. Inpanel B, the subpopulation of 32D IGF-IR cells in the G2/M phase was analyzed in either IL-3 or IGF-I. The cells have a larger size in IL-3, indicating that 32D IGF-IR cells are not just smaller than 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells. In the experiment shown inpanel C, we compared 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells (again in G2/M) in either IGF-I or in IGF-I plus rapa"

These sensory systems encompass a span from hearing to proprioception to osmoregulation, yet are among the least understood at the molecular level. The advent of patch clamp analysis revolutionized the study of mechanosensitive systems. Electrophysiological evidence quickly implicated mechanosensitive (MS)1channels as the primary transducing element in these sensory cascades (1Hamill O. McBride D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 17-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 2Sachs F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 104: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Soon, MS channel activities had been detected in more than 30 cell types (3Martinac B. Jackson M.B. Thermodynamics of Membrane Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 327-352Google Scholar) including embryonic chick skeletal muscle cells and frog muscle, where they were first discovered (4Brehm P. Kullberg R. Moody-Corbett F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1984; 350: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Guharay F. Sachs F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1985; 363: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These systems have remained veiled because of the very low abundance of the channels or the tissues that bear them. In addition, the lack of tangible ligands for MS channels has hampered efforts to enrich a population by biochemical means. This veil began to lift when MS channel activities were detected in bacteria. Early studies inEscherichia coli giant spheroplasts (6Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) showed MS conductances, and soon similar activities were detected in giant protoplasts of Bacillus subtilis (7Szabo I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus faecalis (8Szabo I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At least three MS activities are now recognized inE. coli: MscL (mechanosensitivechannel large conductance), MscS (Mscsmall), and MscM (Msc mini) (9Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several studies support a role for these bacterial MS channels in osmoregulation, serving as “emergency relief valves” in response to acute hypotonic shock (10Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J.

Previously it was demonstrated that a 136-amino acid protein fromE. coli formed a homo-multimeric membrane-bound complex that correlated with the large membrane conductance (13Blount P. Sukharev S.I.

This protein, MscL, became the first MS channel to be cloned and subjected to molecular dissection, presenting a simple, accessible system to assess how tension in a lipid membrane can effect the gating of an MS channel (16Blount P.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 420-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A great stride forward in our understanding of the MS phenomenon was made as the crystal structure of a putative MscL homologue fromMycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) was solved to 3.5 Å (25Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). This structure agreed with earlier data in many important aspects (24Blount P. Moe P.C. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 420-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the homomultimer was composed of subunits bearing two transmembrane elements, with both termini residing within the cytoplasm (13Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this homologue had not been shown to encode an MS channel activity. Hence, it was unclear how much of the knowledge gained about the functionally relevant residues and domains of the E. coli model system would be applicable to the structure derived from this putative orthologue. Here we show by patch clamp analysis that the M. tuberculosis gene does indeed encode an MS channel activity. Furthermore, some analogous mutations in the M. tuberculosischannel lead to perturbation of channel gating as seen in the E. coli channel, strongly suggesting that these orthologues share a common molecular mechanism for detecting and responding to membrane tension. However, the insensitivity of the wild-type M. tuberculosis channel to membrane tension in the physiological range, when expressed in heterologous systems, suggests differences in environmental factors that normally contribute to the gating of this homologue. All mscL genes initially were ligated into the multiple cloning site of the vector pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequence verification and amplification and subsequently moved to the expression vector pB10b (26Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The mscL-null E. coli strain PB104 (13Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was used to host the intermediate cloning steps and the expression constructs. For whole-cell physiology experiments, E. colistrains Frag1 (27Epstein W. Davies M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its derivative MJF455 (ΔmscL::Cm, ΔyggB) (12Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), were utilized. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in Lennox Broth (LB) with shaking at 250 rpm. For plasmid-bearing strains, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added, and expression was induced by addition of IPTG (1 mm) to mid-logarithmic phase cultures. Induced expression times were 1 h for in vivo experiments and 2 h for single channel analysis experiments. Growth curves were generated from cultures of E. coli MJF455 expressing the MscL protein in trans. Cultures were inoculated from a single colony to 15 ml of LB plus ampicillin and IPTG and grown as above for the duration of the experiment. The cloned wild-type M. tuberculosis mscL gene was a gift from D. Rees (25Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Manipulations by polymerase chain reaction usedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under standard reaction conditions (28Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 3-12Google Scholar), and sequences were confirmed by analysis of both strands. The published sequence data were used to design oligonucleotide primers that encompassed the open reading frame and the native Shine-Delgarno sequence. Linkers XbaI (5′) andXhoI (3′) were added to facilitate the directional cloning of the fragment into pB10b. The oligonucleotide primers used were: 5′ linker, AGA TCT AGA TCT GCA GAA AGG ACA TCG CAT GCT CAA AGG, and 3′ linker CTC GAG CTC GAG GCT ATT GCG ATT CTG TGC. The construction of the amino-terminal, deca-histidine-tagged protein and crystallization procedure has been described previously (25Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Tb-mscL was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase in a modified mega-primer protocol (29Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 173-182PubMed Google Scholar). The mutating primers used are: A20G, GCC GAT TAC CAC CCC GAC AGC CAG GTC; V21A, TGT GCC GAT TAC CGC CGC GAC AGC CAG; V21D, TGT GCC GAT TAC ATC CGC GAC AGC CAG; and G24S, CGT GAA CGC TGT GCT GAT TAC CAC CGC. E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch clamp experiments as described previously (6Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), with modifications (16Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions using a buffer composed of 200 mm KCl, 90 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 6.0. Records were gathered at −20 mV for channel pressure response experiments and +30 mV to −50mV for determination of the current-voltage relationship and conductance. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5 kHz filtration using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to measure the pressure response of the channels. The pressure threshold for activation of the Tb-MscL channel, with respect to the activation threshold of MscS, was determined as described previously (16Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, the opening threshold for MscS was defined as the pressure required to open simultaneously within 7 s two or more channels. The MscL opening threshold was defined as the pressure at which single channel openings were readily observed every 0.5 to 2 s. Purified amino-terminal histidine-tagged Tb-MscL protein was incorporated into synthetic azolectin membranes as described previously (30Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Blount P. Kung C. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1994; 6: 51-59Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Martinac B. Kung C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 458-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the reconstitution of the crystallized protein, a single crystal was washed three times in the mother liquor and dissolved in a low salt buffer (20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with 0.05% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Aliquots of the purified protein were combined with azolectin vesicles at a mass ratio of 1:500 or greater and collected by a 20-min centrifugation at 30 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman Instruments). The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 5% ethylene glycol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and desiccated overnight at 4 °C. Desiccated liposomes were rehydrated for at least 2 h in Buffer A (150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) to a lipid concentration of 90 mg/ml. Blisters suitable for access by patch clamp were induced in the liposomes by incubation in Buffer A plus 30 mm MgCl2. Excised air-cleared patches were clamped at +20 mV (pipette) and examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions in the same buffer. Data were acquired as above. A severe hypotonic shock was employed to discriminate any potential phenotypic rescue by mutant channels more sensitive than Eco-MscL. Although this protocol resulted in very high mortality for the experimental and control populations (see Table I), the data are paralleled by results achieved with wild-type Eco-MscL and Tb-MscL using a more mild shock. 2P.

A fresh overnight culture of E. coli strain MJF455 was diluted 1:100 to LB plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.4–0.5. The culture was then combined with one volume of pre-warmed LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 2 mm IPTG, and 1m NaCl (500 mm final concentration) and grown for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Hypotonic shock was effected by a 103-fold dilution into sterile double-distilled H2O, whereas the control was diluted into LB plus 500 mm NaCl (LB-500) followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. All samples were then diluted to the appropriate density in LB-500 and spread on LB plates with ampicillin. Viability following the osmotic shock was assessed by viable plate count. As shown in Fig.1 A, the Tb-MscL structural gene yields a mechanosensitive channel activity when expressed inE. coli spheroplasts; no such channel activity was observed in the absence of expressed protein. The relatively short open time and large conductance of this channel were similar to several other MscL orthologues (26Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the large degree of membrane tension required for gating distinguishes this channel from most of the other characterized MscL channels. Quantitatively, Tb-MscL requires about twice the tension needed to gate theE. coli MscL (Eco-MscL) as shown in Table I(Threshold). This “stiffness” elevates the gating threshold of the channel to the average lytic limit of the spheroplast membrane (Table I), making acquisition of extended records extremely difficult. Previous studies show that Eco-MscL MS channels gate at lower membrane tensions in azolectin membranes (32Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It therefore seemed likely that extended electrophysiological records for the Tb-MscL would be more easily obtained using this approach. Hence, purified amino-terminal polyhistidine tagged Tb-MscL (25Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) was reconstituted in azolectin liposomes (Fig. 1 B). As expected, longer electrophysiological traces were obtained allowing for a more detailed analysis of the activity. Note that the observation of channel activities similar to those seen in spheroplasts suggest that addition of the polyhistidine tag does not substantially alter the protein mechanistically. The channel conductance, like other orthologues (26Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), was about 2 nanosiemens and non-rectifying under symmetrical buffer conditions (Fig. 1 D). However, similar to observations made in E. coli spheroplasts, the reconstituted Tb-MscL channels still required more than twice the gating pressure seen for most other MscL orthologues when assayed by this technique. Although reconstituted Eco-MscL gates at less than 100 mm of Hg pipette pressure (13Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), Tb-MscL typically requires ∼200 mm Hg (Fig.1). To determine if the process used for crystallization of the Tb-MscL disrupted the native folding of the protein, crystals of the Tb-MscL were resolubilized, functionally reconstituted, and examined by patch clamp analysis. The electrophysiological behavior of these reconstituted channels was indistinguishable from that of the purified polyhistidine-tagged Tb-MscL protein (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the crystallization procedure does not irreversibly change the conformation of the Tb-MscL channel. To test the functional nature of MscL channels in vivo, an assay was designed to characterize the ability of expressed MS channels to rescue E. coli cells from an acute hypotonic shock. This assay used the E. colistrain MJF455 (ΔmscL ΔyggB) that, lacking both of the major MS channels, is subject to lysis upon a hypotonic shock. Previously, it was demonstrated that yggB, which correlates with the majority of MscS activity, suppressed this lysis (12Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Here, as seen in Table I, we demonstrated that wild-type Eco-MscL channels, when expressed in trans, also suppress this lysis; note that the suppression is complete, giving viability similar to the Frag1 parental. In contrast, the wild-type Tb-MscL was shown to be incapable of effecting such a rescue. These data are consistent with the electrophysiological characterization of this homologue; the very high gating threshold of the Tb-MscL channel, resting close to the average lytic limit of the spheroplast bilayer as noted in Table I, apparently allows the cells to lyse before the channel is able to gate and effect a rescue. However, an alternative explanation would be that homologues from other species are inherently unable to suppress the lysis phenotype. We therefore performed this experiment using an MscL orthologue from B. subtilis (26Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and supplemental data showing an alignment of the three MscL proteins used in this study. The MscL channel of B. subtilis (Bs-MscL), when assayed by patch clamp, was shown to have properties very similar to the E. coli MscL including the amount of tension required to gate the channel (26Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When tested by this in vivo assay, the Bs-MscL channel was found to suppress lysis similar to Eco-MscL, demonstrating that an orthologue from a Gram-positive organism can substitute for the normal in vivo function of Eco-MscL (Table I). Hence, although some orthologues can functionally substitute as a conduit for solute efflux upon hypo-osmotic shock the Tb-MscL channel cannot, likely due to a significantly higher gating threshold. Although the electrophysiological data suggested that the Tb-MscL is functionally related to the Eco-MscL, it was not clear if the two shared a deeper structural similarity. A common structure would imply a common mechanism; mutations that make the Tb-MscL channel more structurally similar to the Eco-MscL channel may also decrease its gating threshold to approach that of the E. coli channel. Furthermore, mutations that had been shown to affect the E. coli MscL (10Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) should yield analogous effects when applied to the Tb-MscL channel. Therefore, to mechanistically correlate the two channels, Eco-MscL and Tb-MscL, we generated several such site-directed mutations in Tb-MscL. A previous random mutagenesis study identified several mutations within the Eco-MscL channel that, when expressed in E. coli, led to a slow or no growth gain-of-function phenotype and channels with lower gating thresholds in patch clamp (10Blount P. Schroeder M.J. Kung C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32150-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl.

A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine if similar lesions would change the gating properties of the Tb-MscL, analogous mutations were generated at two of these sites. The first site chosen for substitution was Val-21, which corresponds to the Eco-MscL residue Val-23. As observed in the Tb-MscL structure, this residue projects into the most constricted region of the pore. Substitution of this residue in the Eco-MscL with a glycine, alanine, or aspartate led to a more sensitive channel that could evoke significant cell death when expressed in E. coli (33Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.2, a substitution of either a charge or a smaller non-polar residue at valine 21 resulted in a Tb-MscL channel activity with a markedly lower gating threshold (see “Experimental Procedures” for the details of threshold determination). Replacement of this valine with alanine lowered the gating threshold nearly 2-fold compared with the wild-type Tb-MscL (Fig. 2, top; Table I) and yielded channel kinetics with long open-dwell times similar to those observed in Eco-MscL. Introduction of a charged residue, aspartate, at this position lowered the gating threshold in a similar fashion but altered the channel kinetics to dwell in a flickery sub-conducting state (Fig. 2, middle; Table I). Both mutations conferred a mild gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype when expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3). In contrast to the E. coli analogous mutation (33Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), neither mutation led to a severe phenotype; the phenotype is primarily observed in high density cultures. In addition, as depicted in Fig.4, when host viability (black bars) is compared with the channel sensitivity (gray bars), the Tb-MscL Val-21 mutants are also not competent for rescue of the host cell. However, the ability of these mutations to yield a more sensitive channel suggests that the Eco- and Tb-MscL share similar underlying molecular mechanisms for sensing and gating in response to membrane tension.Figure 3Two Tb-MscL V21X mutants confer a gain-of-function phenotype.

In this report we demonstrate that, as with other cell types, inhibition of NFκB initiates microvascular endothelial apoptosis in response to TNF. A1 is able to inhibit this apoptosis over 24 h. We demonstrate that A1 is localized to and functions at the mitochondria. Whereas A1 is able to inhibit mitochondrial depolarization, loss of cytochrome c,cleavage of caspase 9, BID, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, it does not block caspase 8 or caspase 3 cleavage. In contrast, A1 is not able to prevent endothelial apoptosis by TNF over 72 h, when NFκB signaling is blocked. On the other hand, the caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-formylmethyl ketone, completely blocks TNF-induced endothelial apoptosis over 72 h. Our findings indicate that A1 is able to maintain temporary survival of endothelial cells in response to TNF by maintaining mitochondrial viability and function. However, a mitochondria-independent caspase pathway eventually results in endothelial death despite mitochondrial protection by A1. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) does not cause endothelial apoptosis unless the expression of cytoprotective genes is blocked.

Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The inflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 on endothelial cells include the modulation of adhesion molecule expression, secretion of chemokines, and the up-regulation of other cytokines such as interleukin-1 (2.Suzuki H.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2578-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies over the past few years have also shown that TNF can induce parallel pathways of apoptosis and anti-apoptosis in endothelial cells (4.Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M.

In general TNF stimulation of endothelial cells does not result in apoptosis unless the expression of new genes is inhibited by using either cycloheximide (CHX) or actinomycin D (Act D) (4.Pohlman T.H.

This finding indicates that the TNF death pathway does not require new gene expression but rather activation of proteins that are already expressed in the cell. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic proteins that serve to curb activation of the death pathway are synthesized following TNF stimulation (7.Karsan A. Trends Cardiovasc.

Following trimerization of TNF receptor 1 by TNF, apoptosis is activated through the release of silencer of death domains and recruitment of a series of death domain-containing proteins, TRADD, RIP, and FADD, resulting in the formation of a death-induced signaling complex (DISC) (9.Jiang Y.

DISC formation results in activation of the apical death proteases caspase 8 and/or caspase 10, followed by activation of downstream caspases, and culminating in the cleavage of various cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates (15.Boldin M.P.

The C-terminal fragment of BID translocates to the mitochondria to facilitate the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space (18.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J.

We have been particularly interested in A1, as it is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is included in the TNF-inducible set of cytoprotective genes (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,26.Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that A1 inhibits TNF-initiated apoptosis in the presence of Act D in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), death induced by TNF and CHX is not blocked by A1 or Bcl-2 (6.Slowik M.R. Min W. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar). A similar discrepancy in the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit TNF-mediated apoptosis has been reported (27.Hennet T. Bertoni G. Richter C. Peterhans E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1456-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Vanhaesebroeck B. Reed J.C. De Valck D. Grooten J. Miyashita T. Tanaka S. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1075-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Although extensive work has been done with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to understand their mechanism of action, little is known about A1. Given that A1 is a much smaller molecule than Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and that it has been shown to have functions distinct from Bcl-2, we were interested in understanding how A1 functions to inhibit apoptosis in endothelial cells (26.Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G.

Reed J.C. Prystowsky M.B. Blood. 1996; 87: 983-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The transcription factor NFκB is a key mediator of both the inflammatory response and the cytoprotective response. Inhibition of NFκB activity in many, but not all, cell types results in the sensitization of cells to TNF-initiated apoptosis in the absence of Act D or CHX (32.Sugiyama H. Savill J.S. Kitamura M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28808-28815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that induction of A1 in response to TNF or LPS is dependent on NFκB activation, a finding that has subsequently been confirmed by others (35.Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. Gerondakis S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). An HMEC cell line that constitutively expresses an inhibitor of NFκB, HMEC-FlagIκBmt, does not up-regulate A1 following TNF stimulation (35.Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that inhibition of NFκB sensitizes endothelial cells to TNF-induced death. Cotransduction of the HMEC-FlagIκBmt cell line with A1 protects endothelial cells from death. A1 does not abrogate activation of caspase 8 or caspase 3 but, consistent with its mitochondrial localization, prevents mitochondrial depolarization, inhibits release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase 9. In contrast to studies using extracts of Bcl-XL-expressing cells, we find that A1 is able to prevent cleavage of BID in this model. Although maintaining mitochondrial viability initially protects endothelial cells from apoptosis, over 72 h A1-overexpressing cells succumb to cell death due to caspase activation and cleavage of downstream substrates.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell LinesHMEC (38.Ades E.W.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Generation of HMEC-Flag-A1, HMEC-FlagIκBmt, and HMEC-LNCX cells has previously been described (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HMEC-FlagIκBmt/LXSH and HMEC-FlagIκBmt/HA-A1 cells were constructed by retroviral cotransduction using previously described methods (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Stable HMEC-1 cell lines were obtained by selection in 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem) and/or 300 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Polyclonal HMEC lines were used in order to avoid artifacts due to retroviral integration site.Apoptosis AssaysOligonucleosomal BandingOligonucleosomal banding was demonstrated by harvesting of total cellular DNA with separation on a 2% agarose gel as described previously (39.Karsan A. Yee E. Poirier G.G. Zhou P. Craig R. Harlan J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar).Viability AssayFor viability assays, HMEC were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 15,000 cells/well. On the following day, cells were incubated in TNF (concentrations as indicated) with or without CHX (50 μg/ml) or Act D (1 μg/ml). At various time points, viable cell numbers were estimated by 3-(4′,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or neutral red uptake as described (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 40.Abello P.A. Fidler S.A. Bulkley G.B. Buchman T.G. Arch. Surg. 1994; 129: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Viability was expressed as a proportion of cells incubated without TNF.Hypodiploid FractionTo assess the proportion of cells with subdiploid DNA content, cells were permeabilized in ethanol and stained with propidium iodide as described previously (39.Karsan A. Yee E. Poirier G.G. Zhou P. Craig R. Harlan J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar).Loss of ΔΨmTo measure mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), 5 × 105cells were incubated with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) (Molecular Probes) and analyzed for fluorescence on a flow cytometer. The mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma) was used as a positive control for the detection of loss of ΔΨm.Caspase Activity AssayIETD-p-nitroaniline (pNA) cleavage was performed with a colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems). Briefly, 200 μg of whole cell lysates from HMEC cells exposed to 10 ng/ml TNF for various times was combined with 200 μmIETD-pNA in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C. The release of the chromophore by active caspases was quantitated at 405 nm and normalized to untreated cell lysates.ImmunoblottingTo separate intracellular membrane and cytosolic fractions, cells were lysed in 0.025% digitonin, and pellet (membrane) and supernatant (cytosolic) fractions were separated. Fractionation of mitochondria into the membrane fraction was confirmed in each experiment by probing with anti-cytochrome c oxidase. Total cellular extracts were prepared from HMEC, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting as described (35.Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal loading of lanes was confirmed by Ponceau staining the membranes and in some cases by stripping and reprobing blots with an anti-tubulin Ab. Anti-BID Ab was a gift from Xiaodong Wang (University of Texas, Southwestern). Anti-caspase 9 Ab was provided by Xiadong Wang or purchased from PharMingen. Anti-caspase 8 Ab was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-caspase 3 Ab was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., or Transduction Laboratories. Anti-PARP Ab was provided by Guy Poirier (University of Laval, Quebec, Canada) or purchased from Biomol. Anti-cytochrome c was purchased from PharMingen and anti-cytochrome C oxidase from Molecular Probes.ImmunocytochemistryHMEC cultures were stained with the immunogold staining technique for intracellular localization of A1. The monolayers were washed with M199 and fixed in 1:1 acetone:ethanol for 7 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum (PBS/BSA/NGS, Sigma), cultures were incubated with the primary antibody (anti-FLAG/M5) for 60 min at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS containing 5% BSA and 4% NGS. After washing, the monolayers were incubated with the secondary antibody (AuroprobeTM LM goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 5-nm gold particles) at 1:40 dilution for 90 min, washed repeatedly with buffer and double-distilled H2O, incubated in silver enhancing solution, and counterstained with Giemsa. Controls included HMEC-LNCX cells and cultures incubated with control buffer or normal mouse IgG instead of primary Ab.Immunoelectron MicroscopyMonolayers were washed with 0.1m phosphate buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Following washing with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, cells were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 40 min at 4 °C, washed, block-stained in uranyl magnesium acetate, dehydrated, and embedded in Epox 812. Ultrathin plastic sections mounted on nickel grids were incubated with saturated solution of sodium-m-periodate (NaIO4) for 30 min, washed with double-distilled H2O, incubated with 0.1 nHCl for 10 min, and then with Tris/Tween 20 buffer containing 2% BSA and 5% NGS. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody (anti-FLAG/M5) at 1:100 dilution in Tris/BSA containing 1% NGS for 60 min and then with the secondary antibody (AuroprobeTM EM goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles) at 1:20 dilution for 60 min. Following washing, sections were counterstained with lead citrate and viewed under a Zeiss EM10.DISCUSSIONIn contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, the function of A1, a TNF-inducible member of this family, has not been well studied (41.Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar,42.Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). A1 is a smaller protein that is lacking the loop region in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which is thought to regulate the activity of these molecules (26.Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the BH4 domain, A1 has minimal homology to Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and a series of glutamine residues that are not present in other family members (26.Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As well, because a typical transmembrane domain is not present at the C terminus of A1, the subcellular localization of this molecule has not been entirely clear (26.Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One study shows that A1 has a cytoplasmic distribution (29.D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in function between A1 and Bcl-2 have been noted. Unlike Bcl-2, A1 cooperates with the E1A antigen to provide a potent transforming capability in vitro (29.D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar). Murine A1 permits myeloid differentiation to granulocytes, whereas Bcl-2 inhibits this process (31.Lin E.Y. Orlofsky A. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Prystowsky M.B. Blood. 1996; 87: 983-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that A1 may not have the anti-proliferative capacity that has been reported for Bcl-2 (30.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that A1 is up-regulated by TNF and LPS through the activation of NFκB in endothelial cells (35.Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of A1 protects against TNF-mediated endothelial death (5.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although A1 is protective against TNF-initiated death in the presence of Act D, it cannot prevent apoptosis mediated by TNF and CHX (Fig. 1) (6.Slowik M.R. Min W. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar). Tang and colleagues (48.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that CHX-induced T cell death involves FADD-directed activation of caspase 8 and caspase 3. Thus, the presence of CHX may potentiate a mitochondria-independent apoptotic pathway through the direct activation of caspase 3 by caspase 8, which is not inhibitable by A1. On the other hand, the use of Act D may potentiate a mitochondrial death pathway, which is inhibitable by A1. This observation may explain why in another study Bcl-XL was able to inhibit cytochrome c release, but not cell death, since these investigators used TNF and CHX to trigger apoptosis (20.Gross A.

There have been other contradictory reports regarding protection against TNF-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 family members (27.Hennet T. Bertoni G. Richter C. Peterhans E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1456-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Vanhaesebroeck B. Reed J.C. De Valck D. Grooten J. Miyashita T. Tanaka S. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1075-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas cell type differences may partially account for these discrepancies, the use of Act D or CHX as a sensitizer is likely another factor in the reported results.The above findings for TNF-induced apoptosis can be compared with those described for Fas-induced death. Depending on the cell type, Bcl-2 may or may not block Fas-initiated apoptosis (49.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Type I cells show strong activation of caspase 8 by Fas (49.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). In contrast, type II cells only show weak activation of caspase 8, and the activation of caspase 8 and 3 occurs only following mitochondrial depolarization (49.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 inhibits Fas-induced death in type II but not type I cells (49.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CHX does not affect DISC formation in type II cells although it sensitizes these cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis likely by synergizing with the mitochondrial death pathway (50.Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, the CHX effect may depend on cell type as well as apoptotic trigger. Unfortunately, we cannot verify the Fas effect in HMEC-1 cells, since these cells do not express Fas (51.Choi K. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Because we were interested in studying A1 function, we attempted to avoid the confounding effects of CHX or Act D, by using a model where HMEC-1 cells are sensitized to TNF-initiated apoptosis by the inhibition of NFκB using a super repressor IκBαS32/36A (IκBmt) (Fig. 2) (52.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). IκBmt cannot be serine-phosphorylated and hence is not degraded, thereby retaining NFκB in the cytoplasm (52.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Cells that overexpress this mutant (HMEC-FlagIκBmt) do not up-regulate A1 in response to TNF or LPS (35.Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HMEC-FlagIκBmt cells were cotransduced with either an HA-tagged A1 or the empty vector (LXSH). When NFκB activation is blocked, the onset of apoptosis can be inhibited by A1 (Fig. 3). Although the degree of caspase 8 cleavage is similar whether A1 is expressed or not, caspase 3 activation is slightly delayed in A1-expressing cells. Furthermore, A1 clearly inhibits mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, caspase 9 activation, BID cleavage, and PARP cleavage. Taken with the mitochondrial localization of A1, the above findings suggest that A1 can prevent mitochondrial events of apoptosis but not the direct activation of caspase 3 by caspase 8, which presumably is a cytosolic event (Fig.10). Others (53.Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) have also suggested that A1 may function at the mitochondria, because it is able to inhibit apoptosis caused by etoposide, which signals a mitochondrial death pathway.Given that caspase 3, which is responsible for cleavage of downstream cellular substrates as well as activation of several other caspases, is still activated in the presence of A1, it is difficult to imagine that A1-expressing cells are protected from apoptosis indefinitely (54.Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 55.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C.

In previous studies, TNF-induced death could only be studied in the time frame of 24 h due to the concomitant addition of Act"
https://openalex.org/W2064092755,"The transposase family of proteins mediate DNA transposition or retroviral DNA integration via multistep phosphoryl transfer reactions. For Tn10 and phage Mu, a single active site of one transposase protomer catalyzes the successive transposition reaction steps. We examined phosphorothioate stereoselectivity at the scissile position for all four reaction steps catalyzed by the Tn10 transposase. The results suggest that the first three steps required for double-strand cutting at the transposon end proceed as a succession of pseudo-reverse reaction steps while the 3' end of the transposon remains bound to the same side of the active site. However, the mode of substrate binding to the active site changes for the cut transposon 3' end to target DNA strand joining. The phosphorothioate stereoselectivity of the corresponding steps of phage Mu transposition and HIV DNA integration matches that of Tn10 reaction, indicating a common mode of substrate-active site interactions for this class of DNA transposition reactions."

To better define the basis of the ICAM-4/β2 integrin interaction, we have generated wild-type, domain-deleted and mutated recombinant chimeric ICAM-4-Fc proteins and analyzed their interaction in a cellular adhesion assay with LFA-1 and Mac-1 L-cell stable transfectants. We found that monoclonal antibodies against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, or LWab block adhesion of transfectant L-cells to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein and that the ICAM-4/β2 integrin interaction was highly sensitive to the presence of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+. Deletion of individual Ig-domains D1 or D2 of the extracellular part of ICAM-4 showed that LFA-1 binds to the first Ig-like domain, whereas the Mac-1 binding site encompassed both the first and the second Ig-like domains. Based on the crystal structure of ICAM-2, we propose a model for the Ig-like domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4. Accordingly, by site-directed mutagenesis of 22 amino acid positions spread out on all faces of the ICAM-4 molecule, we identified four exposed residues, Leu80, Trp93, and Arg97 on the CFG face and Trp77 on the E-F loop of domain D1 that may contact LFA-1 as part of the binding site. However, the single and double mutants R52E and T91Q on the CFG face of domain D1, which correspond to the key residues Glu34 and Gln73 for ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1, had no effect on LFA-1 binding. In contrast, all mutants on the CFG face of domain D1 and residues Glu151 and Thr154 in the C′-E loop of the domain D2 seem to play a dominant role in Mac-1 binding.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ICAM proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and have a differential pattern of expression and cellular distribution. ICAM-1 is expressed at low levels on different types of cells and is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines on leukocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts (8Springer T.A.

Nature. 1992; 360: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). ICAM-2 is constitutively expressed by leukocytes, endothelial cells (13Nortamo P. Li R. Renkonen R. Timonen T. Prieto J. Patarroyo M. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2629-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and platelets (14Diacovo T.G. deFougerolles A.R. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ICAM-4 is specifically expressed on red cells and carries the LW blood group antigens (15Bailly P. Hermand P. Callebaut I. Sonneborn H.H. Khamlichi S. Mornon J.P. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ICAM-5 is expressed by subsets of neurons, but not by glial cells, exclusively within the telencephalon of mammalian brains (16Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ICAM-4 and ICAM-5 bind to the CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, αLβ2) integrin enriched in lymphocytes like the others ICAMs (17Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J.

ICAM-1, -2, and -4 have been shown to also bind the CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, αMβ2) integrin expressed on neutrophils and ICAM-3 to bind the novel integrin CD11d/CD18 (αDβ2) located at the surface of macrophages (19Van der Vieren M.

The LW and Rh antigens are associated at the phenotypic level, since LW expression is greater in RhD-positive than in RhD-negative cells, and Rhnull cells, which lack all Rh antigens, are also deficient in the LW protein (22Cartron J.P. Blood Rev. 1994; 8: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The LW glycoprotein has been recently renamed ICAM-4 based on strong sequence similarities with the ICAM family and on subsequent work indicating that it also binds to LFA-1 and Mac-1 (15Bailly P. Hermand P. Callebaut I. Sonneborn H.H. Khamlichi S. Mornon J.P. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25 (20): 3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Like ICAM-2, the extracellular domain of ICAM-4 consists of two Ig-like domains, and the NH2-terminal Ig domain contains two disulfide bonds (Cys39/Cys83 and Cys43/Cys87) already observed in other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which make this region more compact. ICAM-4 does not contain the otherwise conserved Glu34 and Gln73 residues important in LFA-1/ICAMs interaction (23Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Bella J. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C.W. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In ICAM-4, these two positions are replaced by Arg52 and Thr91 residues, respectively, whereas ICAM-5 has the conserved Glu40 at the first position and Thr79 at the second position like ICAM-4. Moreover, the adjacent residues at Arg52 in ICAM-4, Leu51, Thr53, and Leu55, are identical or similar in the five ICAMs, suggesting also a potential role of these residues. At least two other ICAM-1 residues, Gln27 and Tyr52, critical for binding of LFA-1 are also common to ICAM-2 and ICAM-4 (Gln45 and Tyr69).In this report, based on a new model for the Ig-like domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4, deduced from the crystal structure of ICAM-2 (25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we have used recombinant ICAM-4-Fc proteins and LFA-1 or Mac-1 L-cell stable transfectants to investigate and characterize the ICAM-4/β2 integrin interactions. We found that these interactions are highly sensitive to the presence of divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+, and we have identified domains and ICAM-4 residues that contribute to the binding sites for LFA-1 and Mac-1.DISCUSSIONWe here propose a three-dimensional model of the ICAM-4/LW protein based on the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of ICAM-2 (25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As expected, the three-dimensional structure of ICAM-4 is composed of two Ig-like domains D1 and D2, each showing two faces formed by the ABED (ABE) strands of one antiparallel β-sheet and the CFG (C′CFG) strands of the second antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). The two domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4 are also predicted to form an elbow angle between them. However, without experimental data on the three-dimensional atomic structure of the ICAM-4 extracellular region, it is difficult to evaluate this angle, which has been estimated to be 30 and 35° in the crystal structures of ICAM-1 and -2, respectively (24Bella J. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C.W. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the ICAM family, the interdomain positioning and flexibility results from interdomain interactions, which are here partially conserved between ICAM-2 and ICAM-4. For example, the interdomain hydrophobic contacts involving Ala13 and Tyr85 from domain D1 and Leu170, Leu172, and Phe180 from domain D2, in ICAM-2 (25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), are partially conserved in ICAM-4, involving the corresponding residues Ala28 and Tyr101 from domain D1 and Leu184 and Leu186 from domain D2 with the participation of Pro130, conserved in all ICAMs and located at the top of the B-C loop in domain D2. However, the multiple salt bridges at Arg175 in ICAM-2 are not conserved in ICAM-4 and are potentially replaced by a bridge involving charged residues, Lys33 in the A-B loop from domain D1 and Asp187in the F-G loop from domain D2 of ICAM-4, which might stabilize the domain 1–2 structure. This interdomain contact difference results from a shorter ICAM-4 F-G loop of three residues, including Arg175 in the D2 domain. Looking down the axis of the molecule, the four predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn38, Asn48, Asn160, and Asn193) carried by the ICAM-4 polypeptide (15Bailly P. Hermand P. Callebaut I. Sonneborn H.H. Khamlichi S. Mornon J.P. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) are uniformly distributed around the molecule, as seen looking down the axis of the molecule. However, the N-glycan tripod arrangement observed around domain 2 of human and mouse ICAM-2 (25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is excluded for ICAM-4, which presents only two potentialN-glycan chains in each domain. This observation suggests that the extracellular part of ICAM-4 molecule can be more flexible than that of ICAM-2, with respect to the cell membrane surface.N-linked glycosylations carried by ICAM-1 have been reported to affect CD11b/CD18 binding (36Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). N-Glycans carried by ICAM-4 may also regulate the biological interaction with cells bearing β2 integrins. Thus, the interdomain interaction andN-linked glycan differences observed between ICAM-2 and ICAM-4 may therefore reflect differences in the presentation of residues involved in the β2 integrin binding site and potentially influence β2 integrin recognition by ICAM-4.To study the ICAM-4/β2 integrin interaction using this model, we first established a Mac-1-transfected L-fibroblast cell line, which was characterized by flow cytometry and cell adhesion assays together with an LFA-1 transfectant in L-cells and a control LAD cell line deficient in β2 integrins (Fig. 2).These studies showed that the ICAM-4/LW protein can function as a ligand for LFA-1 and Mac-1, and the specificity was further confirmed by the ability of mAbs against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and LW to block adhesion of transfected L-cells to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein. However, the Mac-1 transfectant reacted more efficiently with ICAM-4 than did the LFA-1 transfectant (Figs. 2 and 3). We also found that the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ promoted maximal binding of LFA-1 and Mac-1 to ICAM-4, whereas Mg2+ cations without Ca2+ (chelated by EGTA) failed to support binding. These data are in agreement with the previous observations suggesting that divalent cations are required for the ICAM-4/LW blood group antigen expression (21Bloy C. Hermand P. Blanchard D. Cherif-Zahar B. Goossens D. Cartron J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for ICAM-1/β2 integrin interaction (23Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar).mAb 7E4 (anti-CD18), which blocks ICAM-1/β2 integrin interaction (28Nortamo P. Patarroyo M. Kantor C. Suopanki J. Gahmberg C.G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), inhibited the binding of LFA-1 and Mac-1 transfectants to ICAM-4-Fc. mAbs BS46 and BS56 (anti-LW), which recognize an epitope located on domain D1 of ICAM-4, as shown by domain deletion analysis, also exhibited a blocking effect, and mAbs 25.3.1 (anti-CD11a) and BEAR-1 (anti-CD11b) inhibited LFA-1 and Mac-1 binding, respectively. These findings indicate that the interactions between ICAM-4 and the β2 integrins are specific. The study of domain deletion mutants also demonstrated that domain D1 of ICAM-4 is necessary and sufficient for expression of the LFA-1 binding site. However, the domain D2 may have a role in presentation of the binding site to β2 integrins when ICAM-4 is expressed at the cell surface in the context of the cell glycocalyx. In contrast, the Mac-1 binding site required the presence of domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4, indicating that there are protein recognition sequences between domain D2 and Mac-1. By comparison, LFA-1 binds to domain D1 of ICAM-1 (23Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,24Bella J.

Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and to domain D1 of ICAM-2 but does not bind to ICAM-3 (1Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).The most unexpected result from this study was the absence, in the β2 integrin binding surface on ICAM-4, of the key residues Glu and Gln (at positions 34 and 73 in ICAM-1), which may represent an essential common motif in the β2 integrin site of all ICAMs across species, although Gln73 of ICAM-1 may not interact with the I domain of LFA-1 (37Stanley P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3358-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, the single and double mutants of the corresponding positions on ICAM-4, Arg52 and/or Thr91, by Glu and Gln, as they exist in ICAM-1, did not enhance the interaction with LFA-1 and even reduced the interaction with Mac-1, suggesting that the presence of an acidic residue at position 52 is not essential for ICAM-4/β2 integrin interactions and may actually alter the protein interaction surface.Presumably, other residues including the conserved residues between ICAM-4 and the other members of the ICAM family (Leu51, Thr53, and Leu55), play some critical role in the ICAMs/β2 integrin interactions. Further investigations including analysis of interactions between the I-domain of β2 integrins and ICAM-4 will be helpful to clarify this point. Recently, Spring et al. (38Spring F.A. Olsson M.L. Parsons S.F. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1998; 92 (abstr.): 589aPubMed Google Scholar) reported that ICAM-4/LW may interact also with the β2 integrin VLA-4. This is surprising, since LAD cells show accessible antigen densities of 31,000 and 41,000 sites/cell for CD29 and CD49d, respectively (18Tian L. Yoshihara Y. Mizuno T. Mori K. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 928-936PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to the α- and β-chains of the α4β1 integrin VLA-4. Since our data indicate that LAD cells do not bind to ICAM-4-Fc coated to a plastic dish, further investigations will be necessary to address this issue.Having established the importance of domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4 for β2 integrin interaction, site-directed mutagenesis of six predicted surface-exposed residues, Leu80, Trp93, Arg97, Glu151, Thr154, and Trp77, identified on the three-dimensional model of ICAM-4 (Fig. 1), suggested that LFA-1 and Mac-1 binding sites are distinct but overlapping (Fig. 7). However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the L80G mutant could be unable to recognize LFA-1 and Mac-1 due to misfolding problems, whereas in contrast, Trp93, Arg97, Glu151, Thr154, and Trp77 seem to be directly involved in binding functions, since mutants of these residues are probably correctly folded. The positive charge of the Arg97 might also play some role, since its substitution by the opposite charged residue showed an even greater effect on transfectant adhesion than the Ala substitution. It can be noted that mutagenesis of residues Arg52 and Thr91, which affect Mac-1 but not LFA-1 binding, also favors distinct LFA-1 and Mac-1 binding sites. These β2 integrin binding sites seem to reside on the CFG face of domain D1 with an extended recognition sequence in the C′-E loop of domain D2 for Mac-1 interaction, since the single point mutations E151A or E151K and T154V and the double mutant W77A,E151A supported only 40 to 10% Mac-1 transfectant binding as compared with wild-type ICAM-4. Interestingly, Trp77, Leu80, Trp93, and Arg97, the most critical residues for LFA-1 binding (Fig. 7 A), are located at the middle of E-F loop, the beginning of the F strand, and the middle of the G strand, respectively, which localize the LFA-1 binding area at the bottom of the CFG β-sheet of the domain D1. By comparison, the β2 integrin binding sites on ICAM-1 and -2 have been proposed to be located at the top CFG β-sheet with the key conserved residues Glu and Gln at the ends of the C strand and the beginning of the G strand, respectively (23Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 25Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17513-17518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to the position of Trp77 at the interface of domains D1 and D2 (Fig. 1), the possibility should not be excluded that the effect of the Trp77 mutant on LFA-1 binding could be indirect, by affecting the rigidity of the elbow between the two domains. Finally, the 50% decrease adhesion of LFA-1 and Mac-1 transfectants to the W19A mutant might result from protein misfolding, but its localization, behind the CFG face, suggested some indirect effect by a partial geometrical distortion of the β2 integrin binding sites.The ICAM-4 model shown here will provide a framework for a better understanding of the recognition between ICAMs and β2integrins and other potential ligands known to interact at distinct but overlapping binding sites on domain D1 of ICAMs like rhinovirus (23Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and P. falciparum infected erythrocytes to ICAM-1 (39Berendt A.R. McDowall A.

Staunton D.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 63-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whether or not ICAM-4 on the red cells interacts efficiently in vivo with β2 integrins carrying cells is currently unknown. Such interaction might play some role, for instance in the red cell turnover to eliminate senescent red cells by interaction of β2 integrins of spleen macrophages in the spleen red pulp with ICAM-4 or during erythroid maturation to retain immature erythroid precursors in the bone marrow (17Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25 (20): 3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Van der Vieren M. Le Trong H. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. St. John T. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).In this report, we have shown that the CFG face of domain D1 of ICAM-4 is a binding area for β2 integrins with an extension of the binding area to domain D2 for the Mac-1 integrin. With the possible exception of Arg97, we found that the overall shape rather than the charge of critical residues on the CFG face is likely to be involved in the binding function. With reasonable confidence we can exclude the possibility that β2 integrin binding sites on ICAM-4 involve critical residues on other faces of each domain, as reported for the LFA-1 binding site on ICAM-3 (41Bell E.D. May A.P. Simmons D.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1363-1370PubMed Google Scholar). In the future, cocrystallization studies will be the best way to determine the precise interaction sites between β2 integrins and ICAM-4. The five intercellular adhesion molecules, ICAM-1,1 -2, -3, and -4 and telencephalin (TLN, ICAM-5), currently known in humans are counterreceptors for the leukocyte CD11/CD18 integrins, which play a key role in cell/cell interactions (1Gahmberg C.G.

Rev. 1998; 163: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ICAM genes are clustered in chromosome region 19p13.2 (3Trask B. Fertitta A. Christensen M. Youngblom J. Bergmann A.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ICAM proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and have a differential pattern of expression and cellular distribution. ICAM-1 is expressed at low levels on different types of cells and is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines on leukocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts (8Springer T.A.

Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 117-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas ICAM-3 is constitutively highly expressed by leukocytes (10de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Exp.

Patarroyo M. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2629-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and platelets (14Diacovo T.G. deFougerolles A.R. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ICAM-4 is specifically expressed on red cells and carries the LW blood group antigens (15Bailly P. Hermand P. Callebaut I. Sonneborn H.H. Khamlichi S. Mornon J.P. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ICAM-5 is expressed by subsets of neurons, but not by glial cells, exclusively within the telencephalon of mammalian brains (16Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ICAM-4 and ICAM-5 bind to the CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, αLβ2) integrin enriched in lymphocytes like the others ICAMs (17Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J.

ICAM-1, -2, and -4 have been shown to also bind the CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, αMβ2) integrin expressed on neutrophils and ICAM-3 to bind the novel integrin CD11d/CD18 (αDβ2) located at the surface of macrophages (19Van der Vieren M.

For example, the expression of DNMT-1 in the antisense orientation reverses the tumorigenicity of Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells both in culture and in syngeneic mice (7.MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the intraperitoneal injection of DNMT1 antisense oligonucleotides into LAF/1 mice bearing tumors derived from the syngeneic tumor cell line Y1 inhibits tumor growth (8.Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, the reduction of DNMT-1 caused by either 5-aza-cytidine treatment or by the mutation of one allele of the DNMT-1 gene reduces the frequency of the appearance of intestinal adenomas in Minmice bearing a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (9.Laird P.W.

The mechanism by which the over-expression of the DNMT-1 induces tumorigenesis remains unresolved. An attractive model is that the hyperactivation of DNMT-1 leads to the hypermethylation and inactivation of a large number of genes that suppress tumorigenesis (10.Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar), tumor invasion (11.Yoshiura K. Kanai Y. Ochiai A. Shimoyana T.

Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3370-3374PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that the DNMT-1 protein, through protein-protein interactions, is involved in controlling either the entry into the S-phase of the cell cycle or the activity of the origins of replication and thereby progression through the cell cycle (13.Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14.Szyf M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate how the inhibition of DNMT-1 results in the inhibition of tumorigenesis, we have developed phosphorothioate-modified hemimethylated oligonucleotides that, in the presence of a lipophilic carrier, can enter into the nucleus of cancer cells in culture, form a stable complex with DNMT-1, and specifically inhibit its activity with an EC50 of approximately 60 nm (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16.Szyf M. Bigey P. Curr. Res. Mol. Ther. 1998; 1: 93-101Google Scholar). We have also developed an inactive analog of this phosphorothioate hemimethylated inhibitor of the same sequence, which does not form a stable complex with DNMT-1 and does not inhibit its activity, that can serve as an experimental control (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16.Szyf M. Bigey P. Curr. Res. Mol. Ther. 1998; 1: 93-101Google Scholar). In addition, antisense oligonucleotides and an adenovirus expressing DNMT-1 antisense mRNA were use to test the hypothesis that the inhibition of DNMT-1 directly affects the growth of A549 cells by inhibiting DNA replication. A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (ATCC, CCL 185) were treated with the relevant oligonucleotide at 100 nm, which was mixed with 6.5 μl of Lipofectin (2 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 ml of OptiMEM serum-free medium as described previously (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The dose of oligonucleotide was determined by preliminary dose-response assays to result in the maximum inhibitory activity with essentially no nonspecific toxicity (data not shown). The direct inhibitor used in our study is a phosphorothioate-modified hemimethylated hairpin of the sequence 5′-CTGAA(methyl)CGGAT(methyl)CGTTTCGATCCGTTCAG-3′ (3118); the control oligonucleotide is identical and is also phosphorothioate-modified but has been modified at all the 2′-O-methyl positions of the sugar backbone (3088). Both oligonucleotides were tagged with fluorescein at their 5′ end. The antisense DNMT1 oligonucleotide used in our study and the mismatch control are phosphorothioate-modified: DNMT1antisense, 5′-AAGCATGAGCACCGTTCTCC-3′; and mismatch control, 5′-AACGATCAGGACCCTTGTCC-3′. The oligonucleotide-containing medium was removed from the cells and replaced with regular growth medium after 4 h. The treatment was repeated after 24 h. DNA synthesis was determined at the indicated time points after initiation of the first treatment by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA following an 8-h pulse with 66 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. DNMT1 full-length cDNA was cloned into the AdEasy shuttle vector pAdTrack cytomegalovirus in the XbaI site in the antisense orientation. Adenoviral recombination and preparation of infectious particles in HEK 293 cells was performed as described previously (17.He T-C. Zhou S. DeCosta L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2504-2514Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with either the control AdEasy virus or the AdEasy DNMT1antisense at a multiplicity of infection of 50 or 150. 100% of the cells were infected as determined by visualizing green fluorescent protein under a fluorescence microscope. 48 h after transfection, the cells were pulsed with thymidine as described above, and nuclear extracts were prepared for determination of DNA methyltransferase activity (15.Bigey P.

Cells were treated twice with hairpin oligonucleotides at 24-h intervals. 48 h after the start of the first treatment, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml colcemid (Life Technologies, Inc.). At the times indicated, the cells were fixed with −20 °C methanol, stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; ICN Biomedicals), mounted, and examined. A549 cells were treated twice with oligonucleotide DNA methyltransferase inhibitors at 24-hour intervals as described above. Following the second treatment, the oligonucleotide-containing medium was aspirated and replaced with complete medium containing 20 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 h. The newly synthesized DNA was isolated from equal amounts of total DNA by immunoprecipitation with an anti-BrdUrd antibody as described previously (18.Contreas G. Giacca M. Falaschi A. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 824-826PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the gel isolation of strands 0.4–1.2 kb in size. To verify our results, a second recently described method of enriching for nascent DNA, by selecting for 5′-RNA-DNA chains from early replication bubbles, was used (19.Gerbi S.A. Bielinsky A-K. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 13: 271-280Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total DNA extracted from the cells was treated with λ-exonuclease, as described previously, to eliminate all of the nicked 5′-phosphorylated DNA, leaving intact nascent DNA that has an RNA primer at its 5′ position. The nascent DNA-enriched samples were subjected to competitive PCR to quantify the amount of nascent DNA initiated from each origin. Competitive PCR was performed as described previously, using the previously described primers and competitors for the β-globin, c-myc, and dnmt1origins of replication (20.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved in OptiMEM for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with serum-free OptiMEM containing 800 μm hydroxyurea and incubated for an additional 24 h. To release the cells from the G1/S block, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Oligonucleotide treatment was performed during the last 4 h of the serum starvation and immediately prior to treatment with hydroxyurea as described above. We have previously demonstrated that the treatment of A549 cells with direct inhibitors of DNMT-1 results in an inhibition of their anchorage-independent growth (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 A we show that the fluorescein-tagged inhibitor (3118) inhibits DNMT-1 activity from A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner relative to the inactive analog (35% inhibition at concentration of 50 nmand 65% inhibition at a concentration of 100 nm) as determined by an in vitro DNMT-1 assay (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DNMT-1 inhibitor inhibits DNA replication, we assayed the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation following either single or double treatments. The results, shown in Fig.1 B, demonstrate that the direct inhibitor of DNMT-1 causes a 50% inhibition in DNA synthesis 24 h after initiation of treatment relative to the inactive analog (30 versus 80%, respectively). This level of inhibition of DNA synthesis remains similar 24 or 72 h after a second oligonucleotide treatment (which corresponds to 48 and 96 h after the start of the experiment). To verify that the inhibition of DNA replication by 3118 is a consequence of inhibition of DNMT-1 activity and not a different cellular response triggered by 3118, we inhibited DNA methyltransferase by expressing DNMT1 antisense mRNA. A549 cells were infected with either an AdEasy adenovirus expressing theDNMT1 cDNA in the antisense orientation or a control AdEasy virus expressing green fluorescent protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” DNMT-1 activity from A549 cells infected by the AdEasy DNMT1 antisense is inhibited 55% relative to A549 cells infected with the control virus as determined by an in vitro DNMT-1 assay shown in Fig. 1 C (15.Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of DNMT-1 by antisense DNMT1 inhibits DNA replication, we assayed the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation following a 48-h infection. The results, shown in Fig.1 D, demonstrate that inhibition of DNMT-1 causes a 40% inhibition in DNA synthesis 48 h after infection relative to cells infected with the control virus. The fact that both antisense expression and the direct inhibitor 3118 inhibit replication supports the hypothesis that inhibition of DNMT-1 inhibits replication. To verify that all of the treated cells incorporate the direct inhibitor and its control, we performed both fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2 A) and cell sorting (data not shown). Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the oligonucleotide becomes concentrated within the nucleus, suggesting that the local inhibition of DNMT-1 activity may be greater than that observed in the in vitro experiments. To determine whether inhibition of DNMT-1 affects the rate of progression through the cell cycle, we performed a mitotic index assay using the mitotic inhibitor colcemid (Fig. 2, B–D), as described previously (23.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), in the presence of either the direct inhibitor (3118) or the inactive analog (3188). The maximal mitotic index of cells treated with the inactive analog was 37% and was achieved 26 h after the start of the colcemid treatment. The maximal mitotic index of the cells treated with the direct inhibitor was 24% and was achieved 34 h after the start of the colcemid treatment (Fig. 2 D). These results demonstrate that a direct inhibitor of DNMT-1 slows the progression through the cell cycle. The rate of DNA synthesis is normally dependent upon the number of active origins. To determine whether the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase results in an inhibition of origin activity and whether this effect is dependent on the state of methylation of origins of replication, competitive PCR was used to quantify the abundance of two well characterized origins, β-globin and c-myc (Fig.3), in newly synthesized DNA as described previously (22.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These origins are differentially methylated (22.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and are thought to replicate at different points in the S-phase. A549 cells were treated with either the direct inhibitor (3118) or the control (3188) for 48 h and then pulsed with BrdUrd for 1 h. Newly synthesized DNA was prepared by immunoprecipitation of BrdUrd pulse-labeled DNA with anti-BrdUrd antibodies followed by the gel isolation of strands 0.4–1.2kb in size. To standardize the experiment, because of differences in primers and competitor amplification efficiencies, competitive PCR of both β-globin and c-myc origins was performed using A549 genomic DNA (Fig. 3,A–D). The results (Fig. 3, E–G) show that the DNMT-1 inhibitor (3118) inhibits the activity of both β-globin and c-myc origins of replication to a similar extent, suggesting that inhibition of DNMT-1 inhibits the origins of replication irrespective of their state of methylation. To further study how inhibition of DNMT-1 affects DNA replication, we used the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, reduces the pool of deoxyribonucleotides in the cell, resulting in the blocking of progression of pre-existing replication forks and late origins but not initiation at early firing origins (24.Tsvetkov L.M. Russev G.C. Anachkova B.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2252-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, any added effect of the inhibitors would have to be achieved by a mechanism that is independent of the mechanisms affected by hydroxyurea. A549 cells were treated with Lipofectin carrier alone, the direct inhibitor (3118), or the inactive analog (3188) for 4 h, followed by a 24-h treatment with 800 μm hydroxyurea (MO, MF 1–3). The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in complete medium for 3 h (MO, MF 4–6). The rate of initiation of the c-myc origin of replication (MO1–6) and of a secondary initiation site located 7 kb downstream (MF1–6) was determined by competitive PCR of RNA-primed DNA that was resistant to λ-exonuclease as described previously (19.Gerbi S.A. Bielinsky A-K. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 13: 271-280Google Scholar). Nascent DNA differs from genomic DNA by being RNA primed. Fig.4 A shows that the λ-exonuclease treatment eliminates effectively all the genomic DNA and the dephosphorylated plasmid DNA control. As shown in Fig. 4B and quantified in Fig. 4, C and D, hydroxyurea treatment alone does not inhibit the firing of the c-mycorigin of replication (MO1 and MF1), as expected. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that the treatment has indeed arrested all of the cells at early S-phase as expected (data not shown). If the direct inhibitor affects the elongation of nascent DNA strands rather than initiation, then the results (MO2 and MF2) should be the same as treatment with hydroxyurea alone (MO1 and MF1). However, as observed in Fig. 4 B and quantified in Fig. 4, C and D, the rate of initiation from the c-myc origin of replication is significantly inhibited by the direct inhibitor (MO2 and MF2) but not by the inactive analog (MO3 and MF3). To test whether the effect of the DNMT-1 inhibitor is reversible or whether it has a general toxic effect on the cell, we measured the nascent DNA abundance following release from the hydroxyurea block and growth in regular medium for 3 h (Fig. 4, B–D). As shown in Fig. 4 B and quantified in Fig. 4, C and D, none of the cells (i.e. those untreated (MO4, MF4), the cells treated with the direct inhibitor (MO5, MF5), or cells treated with the inactive analog (MO6, MF6)) had any substantial inhibition of replication from the c-myc origin. These results (MO4–6 and MF4–6) demonstrate that the inhibitory effects observed on DNA replication by the DNMT-1 inhibitor are reversible and thus are not toxic. The data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 shows that inhibition of DNMT-1 dramatically reduces the abundance of nascent strands near origins. However, this inhibition has a significantly less pronounced effect on overall DNA synthesis as measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 1). The discrepancy between the extent of inhibition of nascent strand abundance near origins and the extent of inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation can most simply be explained by the hypothesis that inhibition of DNMT-1 leads to inhibition of initiation and not to inhibition of ongoing replication fork movement. To ascertain that the inhibition of origin activity observed with 3118 is a consequence of DNA methyltransferase inhibition, we measured origin activity following inhibition of DNA methyltransferase by a previously characterized DNMT1 antisense oligonucleotide (25.Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A549 cells were treated with Lipofectin carrier alone, theDNMT1 antisense oligonucleotide (MD88), or the mismatch control (MD208) for 4 h, which was followed by a 24-h treatment with 800 μm hydroxyurea. The antisense oligonucleotide (MD88) inhibits DNMT-1 activity from A549 cells relative to the mismatch control (50% inhibition at a concentration of 80 nm) as determined by an in vitro DNMT-1 assay (data not shown). The rate of initiation of the c-myc origin of replication and of two initiation sites located in thednmt1 locus (Fig. 4) (20.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Ramchandani S. Pelletier R. Bigey P. Price G. Szyf M. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9335-9341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was determined by competitive PCR of RNA-primed DNA that was resistant to λ-exonuclease. As observed in Fig. 4 E and quantified in Fig. 4 F, the origin activity from both the c-myc origin of replication and the two dnmt1 initiation sites of replication is significantly inhibited by the DNMT1 antisense relative to the mismatch oligonucleotide. Our experiments demonstrate that the inhibition of DNMT-1 inhibits the activity of at least 3 origins of replication. The mechanism through which inhibition of DNMT-1 leads to inhibition of DNA replication remains unsolved. A simple and attractive hypothesis is that inhibition of DNMT-1 leads to passive demethylation and activation of putative tumor suppressors when DNA is synthesized in the absence of DNMT-1 activity. It has been demonstrated that prolonged treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or an antisense inhibitor of DNMT-1 can lead to a sustained induction of p16 (25.Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26.Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Otterson G.A. Khleif S.N. Chen W. Coson A.B. Kaye F.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1211-1216PubMed Google Scholar). However, in both cases, the immediate cytostatic effects on cell growth have been shown to be independent of the induction of p16 (25.Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26.Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Otterson G.A. Khleif S.N. Chen W. Coson A.B. Kaye F.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1211-1216PubMed Google Scholar). In A549 cells p16 is deleted, however, it is possible that the passive demethylation and activation of another putative tumor suppressor is involved. Two observations are inconsistent with this hypothesis. First, if the DNMT-1 inhibitor causes passive demethylation by depleting the DNMT-1 pool, demethylation of a specific locus should be a stochastic event. If this is true, then the level of demethylation of a specific locus and hence the proportion of the cells expressing a given tumor suppressor should increase with successive rounds of replication. In contrast, the results presented in Fig. 1 Bshow that the inhibition of DNA synthesis is both rapid and does not increase with time. Second, the direct inhibitor of DNMT-1 is effective in the presence of hydroxyurea, which inhibits DNA synthesis and thereby should prevent passive demethylation. An alternative hypothesis is that the appearance of hemimethylated DNA at origins of replication following the inhibition of DNMT-1 signals the arrest of DNA replication. A number of mechanisms are known to be in place to ensure that replication does not proceed in the absence of DNA methylation. Synthesis of DNMT-1 is induced at the entry to the S-phase (29.Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it becomes targeted to sites of DNA replication (31.Leonhardt H.A. Page W. Weier H.-U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 32.Lui Y. Oakeley E.J. Sun L. Jost J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) where it interacts with PCNA (33.Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Consistent with its localization during S-phase, we and others have previously shown that DNA replication and methylation are concomitant events (22.Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34.Rein T. Kobayashi T. Malott M. Leffak M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25792-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The repression of DNA replication following the inhibition of DNMT-1 might be an additional mechanism. However, the results shown in Fig. 3 are inconsistent with this hypothesis, since they demonstrate that both methylated and nonmethylated origins of replication are similarly affected. Yet another hypothesis is that the direct inhibitor as well as antisense treatment disrupts protein-protein interactions between DNMT-1 and other proteins of the replication complex, such as the previously demonstrated interaction with PCNA (33.Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), required for DNA replication. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that a protein related to DNMT-1 is expressed in Drosophila and associates with PCNA (35.Hung M-S. Karthikeyan N. Huang B. Koo H.-C. Kiger J. Shen C.-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because Drosophila DNA does not bear methylated cytosines, this report supports the hypothesis that DNMT-1 might have additional functions in the replication fork. It is possible that the DNA methylation activity of DNMT-1 has evolved to coordinate the processes of DNA replication and inheritance of the DNA methylation pattern (14.Szyf M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are required to establish the details of the mechanisms that are responsible for arresting DNA replication following the inhibition of DNMT-1. However, the inhibition of DNA replication by a direct inhibitor of DNMT-1, as well as an antisense oligonucleotide and an antisense adenoviral vector, strongly suggests that DNMT-1 activity is essential for the activity of origins of replication in at least some cancer cell lines.

We previously reported that mouse brains harboring mutant PS2 contained increased levels of amyloid β protein (Aβ) 42 in the Tris-saline-soluble fraction (Oyama, F., Sawamura, N., Kobayashi, K., Morishima-Kawashima, M., Kuramochi, T., Ito, M., Tomita, T., Maruyama, K., Saido, T.

Here, using a new extraction protocol, we quantitated the Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the Tris-saline-insoluble fraction. The insoluble Aβ levels were found to be higher than the soluble Aβ levels, and the insoluble Aβ42 levels were markedly increased in mutant PS2 transgenic mice. To investigate the origin of the insoluble Aβ42, we prepared the detergent-insoluble, low density membrane fraction. This fraction from two independent lines of mutantPS2 transgenic mice contained remarkably increased levels of Aβ42 and significantly low levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelin.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a series of Aβ quantitation studies of autopsied human tissues has clearly shown that Aβ42 already accumulates to a significant extent in the TS-insoluble fraction of normal aged brains even before senile plaques become immunocytochemically detectable (23Nakabayashi J.

Kuriyama M. Ihara Y. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 922-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of Aβ in the TS-insoluble fraction has recently been demonstrated in cultured human neuroblastoma cells (26Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings raise the question as to which species of Aβ, soluble Aβ or insoluble Aβ, is involved in the initial stage of Aβ deposition. A likely possibility is that the earliest abnormality in β-amyloidogenesis is the altered intracellular trafficking of the specific membrane domains, because i) a substantial fraction of Aβ is present in the detergent-insoluble membrane compartment, which is rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, in cultured cells and rat brains (26Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar); ii) Aβ, generated from apically missorted APP in a cholesterol-dependent manner in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, serves as a seed for Aβ fibrillogenesis (28Mizuno T. Nakata M. Naiki H. Michikawa M. Wang R. Haass C. Yanagisawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15110-15114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); iii) GM1 ganglioside-bound Aβ is detected in Down's syndrome brains exhibiting exclusively diffuse plaques, the earliest stage of senile plaques (29Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar); and iv) the addition of GM1-containing vesicles to Aβ solution dramatically accelerates Aβ fibril formation in vitro (30Choo-Smith L.P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to obtain further insight into the effects of mutant PS2 on the Aβ levels in the TS-insoluble, guanidine hydrochloride-solubilized fraction of the mouse brain and to characterize the intracellular compartmentalization of insoluble Aβ. The heterozygous PS2 transgenic mice used in this study were from the previously established lines W2 (wild-type PS2 transgenic mice) and M1 and M2 (N141I mutantPS2 transgenic mice) (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each line of transgenic mice was backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain, and those mice carrying thePS2 transgene were selected using a transgene-specific polymerase chain reaction assay (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Littermates withoutPS2 transgenes were used as the nontransgenic controls. The levels of PS2 mRNA and PS2 fragments and the levels of APP and its C-terminal fragments in the mouse brains were determined as described previously (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another set of PS2 transgenic mice, including the N, K, and P lines was generated as follows (62Yoo, A. S., Cheng, I., Chung, S., Grenfell, T. Z., Lee, H., Pack-Chung, E., Handler, M., Shen, J., Xia, W., Tesco, G., Saunders, A. J., Ding, K., Frosch, M. P., Tanzi, R. E., and Kim, T.-W. (2000)Neuron, in pressGoogle Scholar). To construct the transgene vector, the cytomegalovirus promoter was excised from the expression vector pCI (Promega) and replaced with an oligonucleotide polylinker into which the platelet-derived growth factor β-chain promoter fragment was inserted (31Kang D.E. Soriano S. Frosch M.P. Collins T. Naruse S. Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4229-4237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and N141I mutant PS2 cDNAs (32Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Hallmark O.G. Moir R.D. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11006-11010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) in the pcDNA3.1-Zeo(+) backbone were subcloned into the above construct. DNA fragments containingPS2 transgenes were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized zygotes from FVB/N mice. Mice expressing either wild-type (N line) or N141I mutant form (K and P lines) of PS2 were generated and genotyped using tail snip DNA. Transgene expression was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a human PS2-specific primer set. Transgenes were maintained in the FVB/N background. The antibodies used for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were BNT77 (raised against Aβ11–28; the epitope is located in Aβ11–16), BA27 (raised against Aβ1–40; specific for Aβ40), and BC05 (raised against Aβ35–43; specific for Aβ42). The specificities of these antibodies were previously described in detail (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos L.J. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Other Aβ monoclonal antibodies used were BAN50 (raised against Aβ1–16; the epitope is located in Aβ1–10) and 6E10 (raised against Aβ1–17) (Senetek PLC, Maryland Heights, MO). The polyclonal antibodies to PS2 used were 2972N (raised against residues 1–75 of PS2) (8Walter J. Capell A. Grunberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Prior R. Podlisny M.B. Fraser P. Hyslop P.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 673-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-PS2L1 (raised against the loop region, residues 327–336) (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The antibodies against APP used were 5A3/1G7 (34Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal antibody C4, which was raised against residues 666–695 of APP (cytoplasmic domain). Anti-flotillin antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). ELISA for Aβ was carried out as described previously (33Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Suzuki N. Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 452-460PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic rodent Aβ was purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). A microtiter plate was precoated with BNT77 as the capture antibody. The captured Aβ was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled BA27 or BC05 for the quantitation of Aβx-40 and Aβx-42, respectively. The brain tissue (about 120 mg) from each mouse was homogenized in 4 volumes of Tris-saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) by a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer, as described previously (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended by brief sonication in the same volume of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The suspension was centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 20 min in a TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The supernatant was diluted 1:12 to reduce the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride to 0.5m (36Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and subjected to ELISA. Detergent-insoluble membrane fractions were obtained according to the established protocol with minor modifications (26Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 37Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The brain tissue (120 mg) from each mouse was homogenized in MES-buffered saline (MBS) (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, followed by brief sonication on ice. The sucrose concentration of the extract was adjusted to 40% by the addition of 80% sucrose in MBS; the extract was then placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with a 5%/35% discontinuous sucrose gradient in MBS without Triton X-100 (4 ml of 5% sucrose/4 ml of 35% sucrose). The gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). A light-scattering interface at 5%/35% sucrose was carefully aspirated. These low density and Triton-solubilized high density fractions (bottom 4 ml) were separately pooled, diluted 3-fold with MBS, and centrifuged. The resultant pellets and the pellet obtained by centrifugation of the original sucrose gradient were extracted with guanidine hydrochloride and subjected to ELISA, as described above. To visualize Aβ42 in the LDM fraction by Western blotting, each LDM pellet was first extracted with chloroform/methanol (see below), and then the residue with formic acid. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were dried using a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY), solubilized with the Laemmli sample buffer containing 4 m urea, and subjected to Western blotting. Except in the case of Aβ and the C-terminal fragments of APP, Western blotting was performed on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Nihon Millipore Ltd., Yonezawa, Japan). Bound antibodies were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the detection of Aβ and the C-terminal fragments of APP, the proteins separated on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was immersed in boiling phosphate-buffered saline to enhance the detection sensitivity (38Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The bound antibodies were detected by either an ECL or ECL plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of the ECL bands of interest was performed using a densitometer (Model GS-700 imaging densitometer, Bio-Rad) as described previously (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from the pellet of each LDM fraction with chloroform/methanol (2: 1) and then with chloroform/methanol/water (1: 2: 0.8). The extracts were applied to DEAE-Toyopearl columns to separate the neutral lipids and acidic lipids (39Ando S. Saito M. Kuksis A. Chromatography of Lipids in Biomedical Research and Clinical Diagnosis. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 266-310Google Scholar). Aliquots of acidic lipids were subjected to acidic phospholipid analysis. To determine gangliosides, the rest of the acidic fractions were subjected to mild alkaline treatment and then applied to Toyopearl HW-40 columns for desalting (40Waki H. Kon K. Tanaka Y. Ando S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the cholesterol content, neutral lipid fractions were analyzed by an enzymatic method using an assay kit, Determiner FC-555 (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan) or F-Chol E (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Total lipid phosphorus was measured by a modified Bartlett method (41Itoh Y.H. Itoh T. Kaneko H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phospholipid composition was determined as follows. Each phospholipid was separated by TLC on high performance TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (32:25:14:4:2) as the solvent system (42Xu G. Waki H. Kon K. Ando S. Microchem. J. 1996; 53: 29-33Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Each band was scraped off the TLC plates after visualizing with iodine vapor and then subjected to phosphorus assay. Total ganglioside contents were determined by the method of Miettinen and Takki-Lukkainen (43Miettinen T. Takki-Lukkainen I.T. Acta Chem. Scand. 1959; 13: 856Crossref Google Scholar). Mouse brains were cut into halves and each half was fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded for histological analysis. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and by a modified Bielshowsky's method. They were also immunostained with various Aβ antibodies after formic acid treatment, as described elsewhere (13Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, 14Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The obtained data were statistically analyzed by the Mann-Whitney's U test using the Stat View computer software (Version 5.0, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA).p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) in the presence of 1% SDS. To precisely define the effect of N141I mutation of PS2 on the Aβ levels, we compared two transgenic mouse lines (W2 for wild-type, M1 for mutant) expressing comparable mRNA and protein levels of human wild-type and mutant PS2 (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Between the two lines, there was no difference in the levels of endogenous mouse APP and PS2 that could potentially affect the Aβ levels (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We modified the extraction procedure for quantitating Aβ in the TS-insoluble fraction; guanidine hydrochloride was used instead of formic acid. This is because extraction with concentrated formic acid, which is widely used, requires large volumes of NaOH and Trizma (Tris base) base for neutralization, resulting in a marked dilution of the samples. This substantially reduces the ELISA sensitivity for quantitation of the Aβ levels in the brain (24Shinkai Y. Yoshimura M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ito Y. Shimada H. Yanagisawa K. Ihara Y. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Gravina S.A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Long K.E. Otvos L.J. Younkin L.H. Suzuki N. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7013-7016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Guanidine hydrochloride was found to be even more effective for the extraction of low levels of Aβ than formic acid and provided reproducible results (26Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 36Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Using this new extraction protocol, we were able to detect significant amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the TS-insoluble fraction of the nontransgenic and transgenic mouse brains (TableI and Fig.1). The Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the TS-insoluble fraction were consistently higher than those in the TS-soluble fraction reported previously (20Oyama F. Sawamura N. Kobayashi K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Kuramochi T. Ito M. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Ueyama Y. Haass C. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The differences in the Aβ levels between the TS-insoluble and TS-soluble fractions may be even larger, because the authentic rodent Aβ used in the previous study was found to contain some impurities and might have led to an overestimation of the Aβ levels, in particular Aβ42 level. In fact, severalfold more Aβ than TS-soluble Aβ was detectable in the TS-insoluble fraction when quantitated using an identical authentic Aβ as the standard.Table ILevels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the TS-insoluble fraction from the mouse brainLineAgenAβ40Aβ42AβAβ42/Aβ40monthspmol/gNon-Tg560.913 ± 0.1350.163 ± 0.0361.080 ± 0.1700.180 ± 0.024851.016 ± 0.1620.290 ± 0.0571.306 ± 0.1940.290 ± 0.0591251.069 ± 0.1100.203 ± 0.0371.272 ± 0.1200.192 ± 0.0361550.819 ± 0.1970.161 ± 0.0290.980 ± 0.2240.200 ± 0.030W2550.684 ± 0.1080.152 ± 0.0260.838 ± 0.1320.224 ± 0.021840.705 ± 0.0870.247 ± 0.0340.955 ± 0.0790.360 ± 0.0771250.988 ± 0.0820.226 ± 0.0241.214 ± 0.0880.230 ± 0.0311550.984 ± 0.0630.203 ± 0.0141.187 ± 0.0750.206 ± 0.009M1540.593 ± 0.0380.432 ± 0.1351.022 ± 0.1570.728 ± 0.213850.744 ± 0.1650.560 ± 0.0731.302 ± 0.235"

Numerous studies have demonstrated its involvement in transcription and in tumorigenesis. To better understand the functions and regulation of HDAC1, a yeast two-hybrid screening approach was chosen to identify novel interactions involving HDAC1. Human HDAC1 was found to interact specifically in yeast, mammalian cells, and in vitro with the human Hus1 gene product, whose Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog has been implicated in G2/M checkpoint control. Both HDAC1 and Hus1 proteins localize to the nuclei. Furthermore, HDAC1 and Hus1 were found to exist in a complex with Rad9, a known Hus1-interacting factor. In addition, bioinformatics analysis of the protein sequences of Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9, three checkpoint Rad proteins that form a complex, revealed that they all contain a putative proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) fold, raising the possibility that these factors may bind to DNA in a PCNA-like ring structure. The results reported in this study strongly suggest a novel pathway involving HDAC1 in G2/M checkpoint control through the interaction with a functional Rad complex that may utilize a PCNA-like structure. Therefore, physically and functionally similar apparatus may function during G2/M checkpoint and DNA replication.

Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), HDAC1 is also the most extensively studied. It is involved in transcription regulation as an essential component of cofactor complexes that mediate transcription repression by cellular factors such as nonliganded hormone receptors (7Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

HDAC1 also interacts directly with other transcription repressors, including all three of the pocket proteins, Rb, p107 and p130 (12Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D.

It is generally believed that sequence-specific repressors bind to DNA and target HDAC1 to promoter regions through various protein-protein interactions. HDAC1 is thought to achieve transcription repression by locally deacetylating histones, leading to a compact nucleosomal structure that prevents transcription factors from accessing DNA to promote transcription. HDAC activity has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cancer development. Transcription repression of E2F-responsive genes by Rb or Rb-like pocket proteins has been at least partially attributed to HDAC1 (13Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 15Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The promoter for p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is activated when cellular HDAC activity is inhibited (17Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Miyaishi O. Ohkusu K. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa S. Nakano K. Mizuno T. Nomura H.

Furthermore, evidence exists to indicate the role of HDAC1 in the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (20Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 21Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C.

Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These results suggest a role for HDAC activity in cell cycle regulation and cancer development. Almost all interactions involving HDAC1 known so far were discovered during studies of its interacting factors. In the present study, we asked which novel interactions involving HDAC1 could be identified which might regulate HDAC1 functions. To achieve this goal, we adopted a yeast two-hybrid screening protocol, using a portion of human HDAC1 (amino acids 53–285 out of a total of 482 amino acids) as the bait and a HeLa cDNA library. This resulted in the identification of several clones that contain the full-length cDNA of the human Hus1(hHus1) gene. In addition to the specific interaction observed between HDAC1 and hHus1 in yeast, the proteins interacted specifically in an in vitro GST pull-down assay and in mammalian cells. We also observed that like HDAC1, hHus1 was localized to the nuclei. These results suggested that hHus1 interacted with HDAC1. This interaction has not been reported previously. The Hus1 protein of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a member of the cell cycle checkpoint Rad proteins that are involved in the mitotic checkpoint induced by either DNA damage or DNA replication block (23Kostrub C.F. al-Khodairy F. Ghazizadeh H. Carr A.M. Enoch T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although it is not an essential gene for normal growth, the loss of functional hus1 gene leads to cell mortality when DNA damage or replication blocks are induced in S. pombe. The same phenotype is observed when the other checkpointrad genes are mutated (23Kostrub C.F. al-Khodairy F. Ghazizadeh H. Carr A.M. Enoch T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that therad gene products are responsible for relaying a signal from damaged DNA and/or blocked DNA replication to the cell cycle regulatory machinery to induce cell cycle arrest and to prevent premature cell division. The exact molecular mechanism of this signaling pathway remains unclear. The immediate downstream effectors of therad genes have been postulated to be the chk andcds1 gene products. Both are protein kinases capable of phosphorylating and deactivating a phosphatase, cdc25p; cdc25 activity is required to activate cdc2p, a cyclin-dependent kinase, which controls cell cycle progress through mitosis. By deactivating cdc25 protein, cdc2p is maintained in its phosphorylated state, and mitosis is not initiated (for review, see Ref. 25Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The S. pombe Rad proteins discovered so far include Rad1p, Rad3p, Rad9p, Rad17p, Rad26p, and Hus1p. Human homologs have been identified for all of these genes except for rad26 (24Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T.

Mutations in theATM gene, which is responsible for the severe congenital disease ataxia-telagiectasia (30Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Human ATR has also been shown to be involved in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (32Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The Rad17 protein has extensive homology with the so-called clamp loaders, such as human RF-C factor (33Griffiths D.J. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), known to facilitate the loading of the proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA) onto DNA (34Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA trimers are assembled into a ring-like configuration that clamp and slide along the DNA double-helix and are thought to help tether DNA polymerase to DNA. Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that yeast Rad1 and Hus1 protein and their homologs in higher eukaryotic organisms may all contain the so-called PCNA fold (43Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 44Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and Rad1p, Hus1p, and Rad9p form a DNA damage-responsive complex (24Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on similarity searches, we suggest in this study that the Rad9 proteins may also contain the PCNA domain, and we demonstrate that HDAC1 could form a complex with Rad9, probably via Hus1. In summary, we report in this study findings suggesting a novel pathway involving HDAC1 in G2/M checkpoint control through the interaction with a functional Rad complex that may utilize a PCNA-like structure. Therefore, physically and functionally similar apparatus may function during G2/M checkpoint and DNA replication. The region of HDAC1 between amino acids 53 and 285 was PCR cloned using the primers 5′-GAAAAATGGAATTCTATCGC-3′ and 5′-GACAAAGTCGACACACTTGG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested withEcoRI/SalI and cloned into pAS2-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) digested withEcoRI/SalI to make our bait construct pAS2-HDAC1-53-285. pHM6-hHus1 expresses hHus1 with an N-terminally fused HA epitope tag. hHus1 cDNA was PCR amplified from the original yeast two-hybrid construct YYN0048 (see below) with GAL4AD LD primers (CLONTECH). The product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) resulting in pCR2.1-hHus1. TheEcoRI fragment from pCR2.1-hHus1 was cloned into CH2 vector (from the Department of Oncology, Novartis, Summit, NJ) digested withEcoRI to generate CH2-hHus1, from which theKpnI/NotI fragment containing hHus1 cDNA was cloned into pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) digested with KpnI/NotI. pcDNA3-hHus1-HA expresses hHus1 with a C-terminally fused HA epitope tag. It was cloned by inserting into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) the PCR product using pCR2.1-hHus1 as the template and two oligonucleotides, 5′-GCCACCATGAAGTTTCGGGCCAAGATCG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTTATGCATAGTCTGGAACGTCATATGGATACCCGGACAGTGCAGGGATGAAATACTGAAG-3′. pGEX-2TK-hHus1 is a bacterial construct that, upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, expresses GST-hHus1 fusion protein. It was cloned by inserting theEcoRI/NotI fragment from CH2-hHus1 into pGEX-2TK (Promega, Madison, WI) digested with SmaI. pcDNA3-HDAC1 contains the human HDAC1 cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector (a gift from Dr. Sambucetti, Department of Oncology, Novartis). pHA-1–179, pHA-179-482, pHA-241–363, and pHA-364–482 express fusion proteins between HA epitope tag and regions of HDAC1 from amino acids 1–179, 179-482, 241–363, and 364–482, respectively. To clone pHA-1–179, the BamHI/NcoI fragment of pcDNA3-HDAC1 was inserted into KpnI-digested CH2. pHA-179-482 was cloned by inserting the region C-terminal to theNcoI site in HDAC1 cDNA into EcoRI-digested CH2. To clone pHA-241–363, the region between HDAC1 amino acids 241 and 363 was PCR amplified using primers 5′-TTCAAGCCGGTCATGTCCAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGATCTTCTCCAGGTACTC-3′. The product was cloned into pCR2.1 to generate pTA-241–363, whose EcoRI fragment was cloned intoNotI-digested pHM6. To clone pHA-364–482, the region between HDAC1 amino acids 364 and 482 was PCR amplified using primers 5′-CAGCGACTGTTTGAGAACCTTAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAGAGGTCCATTCAGGC-3′. The product was cloned into pCR2.1 to generate pTA-364–482, whose EcoRI fragment was cloned intoNotI-digested pHM6. pEGFP-hHus1 expresses a fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and hHus1, with GFP at the N terminus of the fusion protein. To clone it, theEcoRI/ApaI fragment from pHM6-hHus1 was inserted into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) digested withEcoRI and ApaI. The bait used is described above. A HeLa cDNA library was purchased fromCLONTECH, which fused HeLa cDNAs to GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAL4AD). TheCLONTECH protocol was followed. 12 million transformants were first screened for His+ phenotype, followed by the filter β-galactosidase assay. Sequencing all of the clones (ACGT Inc., Northbrook, IL) after these two steps revealed the cDNA sequence of the hHus1 gene. The cDNA in one clone (YYN0048) was sequenced to completion, and an open reading frame was identified. The putative peptide sequence was subject to a BLAST search against sequences in public data bases. Expression of GST, GST-hHus1, or GST-p21 that fused GST to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside from pGEX-2TK-hHus1-, pGEX-2TK-p21-, or pGEX-2TK-transformed bacteria. The proteins were purified and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads following the protocol from Promega. The amounts of the three proteins on the beads were estimated by subjecting small portions of the samples to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An equal amount of each protein was used in the binding assays, while glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the binding mixtures to achieve equal amount of beads in the binding reactions. HDAC1 or deletion mutants of HDAC1 were in vitro translated using T7 TnT kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). The binding mixtures contained immobilized GST, GST-p21, or GST-hHus1, in vitro translated HDAC1 or one of the HDAC1 deletion mutants in binding buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). After a 1-h rotation at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Captured, radioactively labeled peptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by a PhosphoImager. COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) with settings at 0.25 kV and 950 microfarads. 2 days after transfection, the cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA). Immunoprecipitation of HDAC1-FLAG fusion protein used anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). Peptides used for competition were included in the indicated immunoprecipitation reactions at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. The assays were stopped by washing the beads with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times. Immunoprecipitated materials were separated on acrylamide gels and examined by Western blot with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim), anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH), or anti-Rad9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation assays involving endogenous proteins used nuclear extracts prepared with a simplified Dignam protocol. Briefly, K562 cells, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, were collected and incubated in Triton-lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.08% Triton X-100) on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were collected after a 5-min centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 45 min on ice. The extracts were obtained by centrifugation for 15 min after the incubation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 1 h with the appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. Each reaction was washed three times with the lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated materials were examined by Western blots. All of the antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. H1299 cells, a human lung carcinoma, were plated onto coverslips and transfected with either pcDNA3-hHus1-HA or pcDNA3-HDAC1-FLAG. 2 days after transfection, the cells were fixed with a paraformaldehyde (Sigma) solution (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for 15 min followed by a 30-min incubation in −20 °C methanol. The cells were subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20). After blocking, anti-HA monoclonal antibody or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak) was diluted with PBST, added to the cells, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed extensively with PBST and incubated with a PBST solution that contained RNase A, propidium iodide, and anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBST and mounted for viewing. Iterative data base similarity searches were performed with PSI-BLAST (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar) using all of the available protein sequences from the Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9 families (i.e. human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, S. pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster). After two or three cycles, these homology searches retrieved a few members of the DNA-sliding clamp family including PCNA and polymerase III (β-subunit). Currently, no single computational algorithm guarantees the optimal detection of divergent members in protein families. Thus, to investigate further a possible evolutionary connection among Hus1, Rad1, Rad9, and members of the PCNA family, we have used three additional complementary approaches. First, ungapped conserved regions (or blocks) in Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9 were converted to position-specific scoring matrices (or profiles) using BlockMaker and subsequently submitted as probes in MAST searches (38Henikoff, S., Henikoff, J. G., Alford, W. J., and Pietrokovski, S. (1995) Gene (Amst.)163, GC 17–26Google Scholar, 39Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. J. Comput. Biol. 1997; 4: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, a combination of secondary structure prediction methods (40Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) was used with three separate multiple sequence alignments generated by ClustalW (41Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In addition, a fold recognition method (GenThreader) that measures the compatibility of a primary sequence with a library of tertiary templates was applied to each of the 15 sequences (42Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). To identify novel HDAC1-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a HeLa cDNA library. Our initial attempt to use the full-length human HDAC1 as the bait failed, indicating that overexpression of this protein might be toxic to the yeast cells. Instead, the region between amino acids 53 and 285 was used. It is part of the conserved N-terminal domain among the different HDACs (1Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 2Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Among the 12 million clones screened, several demonstrated specific interaction with the bait. Fig. 1 shows the results of β-galactosidase assays for one of the clones, YYN0048. When YYN0048 was present in yeast with the bait, positive β-galactosidase activity was observed (Fig.1 A), whereas there was no β-galactosidase activity when YYN0048 was present together with either one of two nonspecific baits, a fusion between GAL4BD and the human lamin C protein (Fig.1 B) or GAL4BD alone (Fig. 1 C). All of the positive clones contained cDNA sequence for one gene. The full-length cDNA in YYN0048 revealed a prominent open reading frame. The translated amino acid sequence was subjected to a BLAST search against sequences in public data bases and identified as a human homolog to a fission yeast protein, Hus1p (23Kostrub C.F. al-Khodairy F. Ghazizadeh H. Carr A.M. Enoch T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). They share about 30% identity over the length of both peptides. Based on this homology, we named the human cDNA clone hHus1 for human Hus1. While our study was under way, other groups also cloned hHus1 (24Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To assay forin vitro interaction between HDAC1 and hHus1, in vitro translated HDAC1 using [35S]methionine was mixed with immobilized, bacterially expressed GST-hHus1. Bound HDAC1 was visualized by electrophoresis and a PhosphoImager. As negative controls, GST alone or GST-p21 fusion protein was used in similar binding reactions (Fig. 2 A). GST-hHus1 pulled down HDAC1 (lane 1), but neither GST-p21 fusion protein (lane 2) nor GST alone (lane 3) pulled down any appreciable amounts of HDAC1, indicating specificin vitro interactions between GST-hHus1 and HDAC1. Further characterization of the in vitro interaction using several HDAC1 deletion mutants in similar binding assays suggested that the region between amino acids 1 and 240 is involved in the interaction with GST-hHus1. This was demonstrated by the ability of mutants aa1–179 and aa179-482 to bind to GST-hHus1 (lanes 4and 7), in contrast to the weak or the lack of binding of the mutants aa241–363 and aa364–482 (lanes 10 and13). Based on these results, which are summarized in Fig.2 B and also supported by the yeast two-hybrid experiments, we propose that HDAC1 putative interaction domain with hHus1 is between amino acids 53"

Vital staining with acridine orange showed that the intestinal cells had acidic compartments generated by V-ATPase, consistent with the intracellular localization of VHA-11. RNA interference could efficiently silence vha-11 gene expression: introduction of vha-11 double strand RNA led to embryonic lethality. Worms injected with the vha-11 double strand RNA produced embryos that became lethal. The development of embryos was arrested at various stages. However, their numbers gradually decreased, and the worms eventually became sterile due to the failure of ovulation. Similar results were obtained for RNA interference of the V-ATPase proteolipid genes. These results suggest that V-ATPases, and thus inside-acidic organelles, are required for ovulation and embryogenesis.

The enzyme is a multi-subunit complex formed from a peripheral V1 sector with catalytic sites and a membrane-bound Vo sector with a proton pathway. At least 13 subunits are required for V-ATPase activity in yeast (1Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acidification generated by V-ATPase is required for intracellular processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein sorting, and zymogen activation (2Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proton electrochemical gradient established by V-ATPase energizes transporters for neurotransmitter uptake into synaptic vesicles and neurosecretory granules (4Moriyama Y. Hayashi M. Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Ishio S. Yamamoto A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same enzyme localized in the plasma membranes has critical functions in renal intercalated cells for regulation of transepithelial acid-base transport (5Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in osteoclasts for bone remodeling (6Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S.

Med. 1996; 2: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).In Caenorhabditis elegans, five vha genes (vha-1, vha-2, and vha-3 forc subunit; vha-4 for c“;vha-11 for C) encoding V-ATPase subunits have been found (9Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22570-22576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They are predominantly expressed in H-shaped excretory cells contributing to the excretory system in adult worms. Although all vha genes are highly expressed in embryonic stages, their functions are unknown.During C. elegans embryogenesis, embryos undergo a series of four unequal divisions to produce five somatic founders (AB, E, MS, C, and D) (11Kemphues K.J. Strome S. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 335-360Google Scholar). At the beginning of gastrulation, two E daughter cells move to the interior of an embryo to eventually generate intestinal cells. We observed that VHA-11, the C subunit of V-ATPase, was predominantly localized in the intracellular organelles of intestinal cells during late embryogenesis and that the generation of acidic compartments in the intestine was dependent on vha-11expression. In addition, double strand RNA interference was used to silence V-ATPase gene-specific expression. Worms injected withvha-11 double strand RNA became sterile, due to the failure of ovulation. The oocytes underwent multiple rounds of DNA replication without cytokinesis and became polyploid, possibly because ovulation was not coupled with oocyte maturation in the injected worms, suggesting that V-ATPase activity or inside-acidic organelles are essential for oocyte maturation.DISCUSSIONV-ATPase was localized immunochemically in dot-like structures of embryonic cells using antibodies against VHA-11. It may be associated with intracellular organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, similar to in other eukaryotic cells (2Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comma stage embryos, V-ATPase was highly expressed in intestinal cells being localized in their intracellular compartments. The distribution in embryos was similar to that of the acidic compartments stained with acridine orange. TheC. elegans intestine is known to contain numerous storage granules (21White J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998: 81-122Google Scholar). Furthermore, labeled probes are taken through endocytosis and accumulated within granules in which acridine orange is stored (22Clokey G.V. Jacobson L.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that the acidic pH generated by V-ATPase is required for nutrient intake by intestinal cells.We used RNA interference (13Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11578) Google Scholar) as a powerful tool for silencing V-ATPase gene-specific expressions. The progenies exhibited defects dependent on the time after injection of dsRNA. C. elegans germ cells in the gonads exhibit distal-proximal polarity during proliferation and meiotic prophase progression (17Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 241-270Google Scholar). Thus, each germ cell may show a defect, depending on the progress of oogenesis.vha-11 dsRNA-injected worms produced eggs up to 24 h, but the eggs did not hatch. The development of the eggs was randomly arrested at different stages. The amount of vha transcripts is high at the embryo rather than the larval and adult stages (10Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22570-22576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in the stage at the time of arrest may depend on the amount of maternal mRNA present in each embryo. 15–30% of the embryos arrested as one-cell stage, suggesting that the cell division cycle may require acidic compartments generated by V-ATPase. Inactivation of proteolipid subunit genes also caused embryonic lethality. Furthermore, similar results were obtained on injection of the dsRNA for F55H2.2, which is homologous to genes for theD subunit in the V1 sector. 2T. Oka and M. Futai, unpublished results. These results suggest that V-ATPase activity itself is essential for the progress of embryonic development.Two isoforms (VHA-1 and VHA-2/VHA-3) for 16-kDa proteolipids are found in C. elegans: vha-2 and vha-3 encode an identical protein (10Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22570-22576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA interference analysis of these proteolipids indicated that embryonic development requires VHA-1 but not VHA-2/VHA-3. So far, 16-kDa proteolipid isoforms have been identified in S. cerevisiae (23Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Umemoto N. Ohya Y.

Yeast. 1991; 7: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and D. melanogaster (26Finbow M.E. Goodwin S.F. Meagher L. Lane N.J. Keen J. Findlay J.B. Kaiser K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, two proteolipids (Vma3p and Vma11p) are essential for growth at neutral pH (24Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are components of each Vo sector of yeast V-ATPase (27Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, only single genes for 16-kDa proteolipid have been found in mouse (28Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and human (29Hesebe M. Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlike yeast, only VHA-1 is required for embryonic development in C. elegans. It became of interest to study roles of the VHA-2/VHA-3 proteolipid in adult worms.Yolk granules are embryonic organelles and store essential nutrients that support embryonic development (30Wallace R.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 1: 127-177Google Scholar). Their contents, yolk proteins, are derived from vitellogenins and have been shown to be taken up into acidic compartments of Xenopus oocytes through endocytosis (31Fagotto F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). YP170, one of the C. elegans vitellogenins, is also taken up by oocytes through an endocytotic pathway mediated by the RME-2 receptor protein (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that disruption of the genes required for endocytosis affected oogenesis. As expected, worms injected with the dsRNA for clathrin or adaptin gene produced non-viable embryos (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because V-ATPase acidifies the endocytotic compartments, one of the reasons for the embryonic lethality due to the dsRNAs of the vha genes may be the inhibition of yolk protein uptake by oocytes.The accumulation of endomitotic oocytes was observed in the gonads of worms injected with the dsRNAs for V-ATPase subunits. So far, several mutants defective in ovulation have been reported (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Greenstein D. Hird S. Plasterk R.H. Andachi Y. Kohara Y. Wang B. Finney M. Ruvkun G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One of them, the emo-1 mutant, has a zygotic defect in ovulation and eventually produces oocytes with polyploid nuclei (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because theemo-1 gene encodes a homologue of Sec61 gamma, which is a component of the protein translocation pore in the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells, it is proposed that the emo-1mutation disrupts the transport of oocyte proteins required for ovulation (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to emo-1, the introduction of the dsRNAs for small GTPase (ATP-ribosylation factor) and coatmer genes necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis also leads to the accumulation of endomitotic oocytes (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition of protein transport causes ovulation failure and the production of polyploid nuclei. A defect in oocyte ovulation caused by the dsRNAs for V-ATPase subunits is consistent with reports that acidic compartments are essential for protein trafficking such as endocytosis (3Forgac M. J.

Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mellman L. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPase was localized immunochemically in dot-like structures of embryonic cells using antibodies against VHA-11. It may be associated with intracellular organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, similar to in other eukaryotic cells (2Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comma stage embryos, V-ATPase was highly expressed in intestinal cells being localized in their intracellular compartments. The distribution in embryos was similar to that of the acidic compartments stained with acridine orange. TheC. elegans intestine is known to contain numerous storage granules (21White J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998: 81-122Google Scholar). Furthermore, labeled probes are taken through endocytosis and accumulated within granules in which acridine orange is stored (22Clokey G.V. Jacobson L.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that the acidic pH generated by V-ATPase is required for nutrient intake by intestinal cells. We used RNA interference (13Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11578) Google Scholar) as a powerful tool for silencing V-ATPase gene-specific expressions. The progenies exhibited defects dependent on the time after injection of dsRNA. C. elegans germ cells in the gonads exhibit distal-proximal polarity during proliferation and meiotic prophase progression (17Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 241-270Google Scholar). Thus, each germ cell may show a defect, depending on the progress of oogenesis. vha-11 dsRNA-injected worms produced eggs up to 24 h, but the eggs did not hatch. The development of the eggs was randomly arrested at different stages. The amount of vha transcripts is high at the embryo rather than the larval and adult stages (10Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22570-22576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in the stage at the time of arrest may depend on the amount of maternal mRNA present in each embryo. 15–30% of the embryos arrested as one-cell stage, suggesting that the cell division cycle may require acidic compartments generated by V-ATPase. Inactivation of proteolipid subunit genes also caused embryonic lethality. Furthermore, similar results were obtained on injection of the dsRNA for F55H2.2, which is homologous to genes for theD subunit in the V1 sector. 2T. Oka and M. Futai, unpublished results. These results suggest that V-ATPase activity itself is essential for the progress of embryonic development. Two isoforms (VHA-1 and VHA-2/VHA-3) for 16-kDa proteolipids are found in C. elegans: vha-2 and vha-3 encode an identical protein (10Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22570-22576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA interference analysis of these proteolipids indicated that embryonic development requires VHA-1 but not VHA-2/VHA-3. So far, 16-kDa proteolipid isoforms have been identified in S. cerevisiae (23Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), S. pombe(25Toyama R. Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R. Dhar R. Yeast. 1991; 7: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and D. melanogaster (26Finbow M.E. Goodwin S.F. Meagher L. Lane N.J. Keen J. Findlay J.B. Kaiser K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, two proteolipids (Vma3p and Vma11p) are essential for growth at neutral pH (24Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are components of each Vo sector of yeast V-ATPase (27Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, only single genes for 16-kDa proteolipid have been found in mouse (28Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and human (29Hesebe M. Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlike yeast, only VHA-1 is required for embryonic development in C. elegans. It became of interest to study roles of the VHA-2/VHA-3 proteolipid in adult worms. Yolk granules are embryonic organelles and store essential nutrients that support embryonic development (30Wallace R.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 1: 127-177Google Scholar). Their contents, yolk proteins, are derived from vitellogenins and have been shown to be taken up into acidic compartments of Xenopus oocytes through endocytosis (31Fagotto F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). YP170, one of the C. elegans vitellogenins, is also taken up by oocytes through an endocytotic pathway mediated by the RME-2 receptor protein (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that disruption of the genes required for endocytosis affected oogenesis. As expected, worms injected with the dsRNA for clathrin or adaptin gene produced non-viable embryos (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because V-ATPase acidifies the endocytotic compartments, one of the reasons for the embryonic lethality due to the dsRNAs of the vha genes may be the inhibition of yolk protein uptake by oocytes. The accumulation of endomitotic oocytes was observed in the gonads of worms injected with the dsRNAs for V-ATPase subunits. So far, several mutants defective in ovulation have been reported (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Greenstein D. Hird S. Plasterk R.H. Andachi Y. Kohara Y. Wang B. Finney M. Ruvkun G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One of them, the emo-1 mutant, has a zygotic defect in ovulation and eventually produces oocytes with polyploid nuclei (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because theemo-1 gene encodes a homologue of Sec61 gamma, which is a component of the protein translocation pore in the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells, it is proposed that the emo-1mutation disrupts the transport of oocyte proteins required for ovulation (18Iwasaki K. McCarter J. Francis R. Schedl T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to emo-1, the introduction of the dsRNAs for small GTPase (ATP-ribosylation factor) and coatmer genes necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis also leads to the accumulation of endomitotic oocytes (32Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition of protein transport causes ovulation failure and the production of polyploid nuclei.

Epstein-Barr virus EBV nuclear antigen 1 recombinant green fluorescent protein 4′,6′- diamidino-2-phenylindole One approach for determining how viruses depend on and alter normal host cell functions is to identify and characterize host factors with which the viral proteins interact. Such an approach can potentially identify host cell proteins that are utilized for aspects of the viral life cycle as well as cellular targets of viral oncoproteins. Such a strategy has been applied to the Epstein-Barr virus, a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is causally associated with infectious mononucleosis and several cancers (1Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During latent infection of human host cells, EBV1 genomes are maintained in the cell nucleus as double-stranded DNA episomes. Like the cellular chromosomes, the EBV episomes replicate once per cell cycle and segregate stably to the daughter cells (2Adams A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1743-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 4Yates J.L. Guan N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 483-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of the EBV episomes requires the viral origin of DNA replication,oriP, and one viral protein, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) (3Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). EBNA1 binding to oriP is thought to activate EBV DNA synthesis and govern the segregation of the episomes by mediating interactions with host cell proteins. In mitosis, EBV genomes and the EBNA1 protein have been observed to associate with the host metaphase chromosomes (5Delecluse H.J. Bartnizke S. Hammerschmidt W. Bullerdiek J. Bornkamm G.W. J. Virol. 1993; 65: 1292-1299Crossref Google Scholar, 6Petti L. Sample C. Kieff E. Virol. 1990; 176: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and therefore, EBNA1 may govern the partitioning of EBV genomes by mediating interactions between the EBV episomes and a component of the condensed host chromosomes. Characterizing factors that interact with EBNA1 are also important because EBNA1 may play a direct role in the development of EBV-associated cancers (7Wilson J.B. Bell J.L. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Previously, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify human proteins that specifically interact with EBNA1 (1Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated a cDNA molecule encoding a 35-kDa protein, termed EBP2 (EBNA1-binding protein), and verified its interaction with EBNA1 using three independent assays. The sequence of EBP2 is identical to the human nucleolar protein p40 (8Chatterjee A. Freeman J. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1123-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies on this protein previously showed that it is predominantly nucleolar in interphase and is associated with proliferating cells, but its cellular function had not been determined (8Chatterjee A. Freeman J. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1123-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analyses of EBNA1 mutants defective for EBP2 binding showed that the ability to bind EBP2 correlated with the ability of EBNA1 to mediate the stable segregation of oriP plasmids but not with the ability of EBNA1 to activate DNA replication (1Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent immunofluorescence studies showed that EBP2 colocalizes with EBNA1 on the cellular mitotic chromosomes. 2Wu, H., Ceccarelli, D. F. J., and Frappier, L. (2000) EMBO Rep., in press. These results suggested that the EBNA1-EBP2 interaction is important for EBNA1-mediated DNA segregation; however, the normal cellular function of EBP2 remained to be elucidated. Data bank searches with the human EBP2 sequence identified homologs of this protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Caenorhabditis elegans, none of which has been characterized. To better understand the conserved cellular function of EBP2, we investigated EBP2 in budding yeast. Here we show that Ebp2p is an essential protein that, like human EBP2, localizes to the nucleolus. A yeast strain containing a temperature-sensitive allele of EBP2 was generated and found to exhibit defects in pre-rRNA processing. Detailed analysis of the yeast rRNA-processing pathway indicates that Ebp2p is required for efficient processing of the 27 SA into the 27 SB precursor rRNA.

The ebp2::HIS3 disruption allele (pMM89) was created by replacing 87% of the coding region of the EBP2 gene with a HIS3 fragment. Aebp2::HIS3 fragment was used to transform diploid strain yMM41, and His+ clones were recovered. Strain yMM42 was sporulated and dissected, and the spores were incubated on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates at 30 °C. Fifteen out of 15 tetrads displayed a 2:2 pattern of inviability, and all of the viable spores were His−. Plasmids pMM112 (EBP2 LEU2) and pMM113 (EBP2 URA3) were created by cloning a 2.0-kilobase pair PvuII to BamHI fragment containing EBP2 DNA from pMM88 into the SmaI andBamHI sites of plasmids pRS415 and pRS416, respectively. TheEBP2 deletion plasmids were generated by replacing portions of the EBP2 gene within plasmid pMM112 with engineered DNA fragments. These deletion fragments were created by polymerase chain reactions employing oligonucleotides engineered to contain the appropriate restriction sites, start, and stop codons. TheEBP2 deletion plasmid constructs were tested for activity in yeast by introducing them into an ebp2::HIS3disruption strain by the plasmid shuffle technique. TheLEU2-containing EBP2 constructs were transformed into strain yMM49, and the Leu+ transformants were recovered (yMM58 and its siblings). The transformants were then transferred onto plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for loss of the URA3 EBP2 plasmid pMM113. Theebp2-1 allele was created by using a combination of mutagenic polymerase chain reaction, followed by the gap-repair method of yeast transformation. An EBP2 DNA fragment was amplified under conditions of low Mg2+ concentration (1.5 mm), and it was transformed into strain yMM49 along with linearized plasmid pMM112 (EBP2 LEU2) that had been digested with Eco47III and StuI to remove theEBP2-coding sequences. Leu+ transformants were recovered and plated to 5-fluoroorotic acid plates at temperatures from 16 °C to 36 °C. A single temperature-sensitive colony was isolated out of more than 600 transformants that could not grow at temperatures above 34 °C. The plasmid containing theebp2-1 allele (pMM144) was recovered and sequenced. EBP2.KAN and ebp2-1.KANintegration alleles were created by cloning a 1.2-kilobase pairFspI KANr fragment from plasmid pFA6-GFP-kanMX6 into the Eco47III site of plasmids pMM112 and pMM144, respectively, yielding plasmids pMM160 and pMM161. IntegratedEBP2.KAN or ebp2-1.KAN yeast strains yMM178 and yMM179 were created by transforming strain yMM13 withKAN-containing 2.8-kilobase pair EcoRV toStuI fragments from pMM160 and pMM161 and selecting transformants with G418. The integrity of the integrated alleles was confirmed by sequence analysis. TheGFP-ebp2ΔN62 fusion construct pMM169 was created by cloning a DNA fragment containing the S65T mutant of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria into the unique NsiI site of pMM147. NsiI sites were engineered into primers GFP-WP1 (GGCGCAATGCATAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC) and GFP-CP1 (CGCGGATGCATTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC), and they were used to amplify the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence from plasmid pFA6-GFP-kanMX6. The GFP-Ebp2p construct was expressed in yeast strain yMM151. To visualize cellular and nuclear morphologies, 1 ml of early log cultures grown in liquid yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium at 28 °C was collected, sonicated, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were then washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Five μl of cells were added to 5 μl of mounting medium containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, 45% glycerol, and 0.02 mg/ml 4′,6′- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). At least 300 cells from each culture were observed by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, and they were categorized with respect to their cellular and nuclear morphologies. For the indirect immunofluorescence studies using the anti-Nop1p antibodies, cells were prepared as described previously (11Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Polysome profiles were prepared essentially as described in (12Baim S.,. Pietras B.D Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBP2 and ebp2-1cultures (yMM178 and yMM179) were grown to early log phase at 28 °C, and then half the cultures were shifted to 36 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested and whole cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis. 30 A 260 units from each lysate were applied to 7–47% linear sucrose gradients, and the gradients were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 h in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradients with an Isco fractionator, and absorption at 254 nm was determined. EBP2 and ebp2-1 cultures (yMM178 and yMM179) were grown to early log phase at 28 °C and then shifted as required to 36 °C. Total RNA was prepared from 3 × 108 cells as described in (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 4.9.4-4.9.8Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and either stained with ethidium bromide or blotted for Northern analysis. The double-stranded DNA probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction and labeled with 32P using the Random Prime labeling kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hybridization and washing procedures were carried out using Genescreen plus membranes as per the instructions provided by the manufacturer (DuPont). RNA blots were visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. For Northern analysis of the rRNA-processing intermediates, 5 μg of total RNA per sample were electrophoresed over 1.25% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides b, c, ande were as described in Beltrame and Tollervey (14Beltrame M. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Oligo 25 (5′-TTCCTGTGGATTTTCACG-3′) and 18 (5′-AACCATGGTAGGCCACTAC-3′) are complementary to regions close to the 5′ end of the 25 S and 18 S rRNA, respectively. Oligonucleotide probes were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization and washing was carried out as described in Dunbar et al. (15Dunbar D.A. Wormsley S. Agentis T.M. Baserga S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5803-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were analyzed using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Pulse-chase experiments were essentially performed as described in Tollerveyet al. (16Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBP2 andebp2-1 strains were grown at 22 °C to early log phase, split into 4-ml aliquots, and either left at 22 °C or shifted to 36 °C for 2 h. Cultures were labeled with 200 μCi of [methyl-3H]methionine for 2.5 min. Cold methionine was then added to a final concentration of 50 mm. One-ml samples were collected at the times indicated, and total RNA was prepared as described above. Equal number of counts per sample were resolved on 1.25% denaturing agarose gels and transferred onto Zeta-membranes. The blots were cross-linked, soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to phosphorimaging analysis. Primer extension reactions were carried out with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) after annealing 0.1 pmol of 32P 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide e to 2.5 μg of total RNA. The cDNA products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 murea sequencing gels. Sequencing was accomplished by using the fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega), with pCF15 plasmid DNA serving as template, and oligo e serving as primer. To identify human proteins that interact with the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded EBNA1 protein, a two-hybrid screen was performed using the EBNA1 protein as “bait” to screen an expression library derived from human B lymphocytes (1Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This screen identified a human protein that interacts specifically with EBNA1, and it was named EBP2. The full-length cDNA encoding the EBP2 protein was cloned and sequenced, revealing that EBP2 encodes for a 306-amino acid protein. Data bank searches revealed an exact match between the human EBP2 sequence and nucleolar protein p40 (GenBank™ accession number U86602). Nucleolar protein p40 was previously shown to localize to the nucleoli of proliferating cells, but it had not been functionally characterized (8Chatterjee A. Freeman J. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1123-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Significant matches were also found between the human EBP2 protein sequence and predicted proteins encoded by C. elegans (C18A3.3), S. cerevisiae (YKL172w), and S. pombe (SPAC17H9) genes, each of which were identified as a result of genomic sequencing projects (17Dujon B. Alexandraki D. Andre B. Ansorge W. Baladron V. Ballesta J.P. Banvevi A. Bolle P.A. Bolotin-Fukuhura M. Bossier P. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins contains a C-terminal block of 200–300 amino acids that is at least 38% identical to sequences from human EBP2 (Fig. 1 A), but as yet there is no information on their respective functions. The 427-amino acid sequence of budding yeast Ebp2p was scanned for recognizable protein motifs, and it was found to contain two putative nuclear localization signals near its C terminus and a basic domain (lysine rich) followed by an acidic domain (glutamic acid rich) at its N terminus (Fig. 1 B). Within the N-terminal sequences there are five copies of the KKE motif, which is associated with yeast nucleolar proteins (19Gauthier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Other than these limited features, Ebp2p contained no obvious matches to previously identified protein consensus sequences that would provide insight into its function. To further investigate the function of Ebp2p, we determined whether or not the EBP2gene is essential in yeast. We isolated the EBP2 gene from a λ clone (ATCC 3657) that contained yeast genomic sequences from the left arm of chromosome XI, and this clone was used to create anebp2::HIS3 disruption allele (see “Experimental Procedures”). A heterozygous disruption strain was generated, sporulated, and dissected, yielding only two viable spores from each tetrad (Fig. 2 A). The viable colonies were His−, indicating that the inviable spores had inherited the disrupted ebp2::HIS3 allele. The inviable colonies were found to contain microcolonies of 1 to 4 cell bodies, indicating that the deletion strains were able to undergo at most two rounds of cell division before they ceased to divide. To confirm that the inviability associated with theebp2::HIS3 disruption was due to loss ofEBP2 function, the heterozygous diploid strain was transformed with an EBP2-expressing plasmid. This extra plasmid-borne, wild type copy of EBP2 was sufficient to restore viability in the strains that inherited the disruptedebp2::HIS3 allele (data not shown). These experiments indicate that EBP2 is an essential gene in yeast. In the effort to identify the regions of the Ebp2 protein that contribute to its essential function, we undertook a deletion analysis of the EBP2 gene (Fig.2 B). A series of plasmid-borne N- and C-terminalEBP2 deletion alleles was constructed and tested for the ability to complement an ebp2::HIS3 disruption allele by the plasmid shuffle method (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the N-terminal deletions, we created constructs that encoded for Ebp2 proteins containing deletions of 62, 90, 127, 178, and 231 amino acids. We found that, with the exception of the 231-amino acid deletion, all of these alleles were functional, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein is dispensable for the essential Ebp2p activity. For the C-terminal deletions, we created alleles removing 50, 105, and 151 amino acids from the end of the protein. Unlike the N terminus, the amino acids at the C terminus of the Ebp2 protein are critical for its activity. The strain bearing the 50-amino acid deletion construct grew slowly, and the 105- and 151-amino acid deletion alleles were non-functional. We also constructed an allele that combined the 178-amino acid N-terminal deletion with the 50-amino acid C-terminal deletion. The strain containing this construct was nearly completely dependent on the wild type EBP2 plasmid for viability, as only a few cells from the culture grew up on the 5-fluoroorotic acid plate. Therefore, the regions of yeast Ebp2p that are critical for its essential activity correspond to the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein and include the amino acids that are most highly conserved among the other EBP2 homologs as well as the putative nuclear localization signals. To investigate whether yeast Ebp2p was in fact a nucleolar protein, we constructed a fusion construct containing the sequences from the A. victoria GFP fused to the N-terminal region of Ebp2p. The resulting GFP-ebp2ΔN62 construct was tested for Ebp2p activity, and it was found to complement anebp2::HIS3 disruption allele. Cells expressing the GFP-Ebp2 fusion protein alone from the native EBP2 promoter were collected, stained with DAPI, and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). The GFP-Ebp2p signal was found to localize to the nuclear region of the cells, but the staining pattern did not always exactly overlap with the DAPI signal. Since the nucleolus often does not stain well with DAPI, we investigated whether the GFP-Ebp2p signal corresponded to the nucleolus. Anti-Nop1p antibodies were used as a nucleolar marker, and it was found that the Nop1p staining pattern coincided with the GFP-Ebp2p signal. Thus, like the reported location of human EBP2, yeast Ebp2p also appears to be a nucleolar protein. To further elucidate the function of the Ebp2 protein, we created and characterized a conditional ebp2 mutant. Random mutations were introduced into the EBP2 gene by mutagenic polymerase chain reaction, and the mutated fragments were introduced into yeast cells by the gap-repair method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Colonies were screened for their ability to grow at temperatures ranging from 16 °C to 36 °C, and a temperature-sensitive mutant (ebp2-1) was recovered that could not grow at temperatures above 34 °C (see below). Theebp2-1 allele was recovered from yeast, sequenced, and found to encode for a protein that differs from wild type Ebp2p at four amino acids (Q92P, S140P, F217S, and E243G). We further investigated the contribution of these four amino acids to Ebp2p function by creating additional EBP2 alleles that contained either the Q92P and S140P or the F217S and E243G substitutions. We observed that the allele containing the F217S and E243G substitutions conferred a ts− phenotype, and the Q92P and S140P allele appeared wild type for growth (data not shown). Interestingly, the E243G substitution corresponds to a glutamic acid residue that is conserved among all four of the EBP2 homologs. Having isolated the conditional ebp2-1 allele, we then sought to characterize the phenotypes that were associated with this mutation. The plasmid-borne ebp2-1 gene was used to create an integration allele (ebp2-1.KAN), and this construct was used to replace the wild type chromosomal EBP2 gene by homologous recombination. Like the plasmid-bearing strain, the integratedebp2-1 strain (YMM179) exhibited a temperature sensitivity that could be complemented by a plasmid containing a wild type EBP2 gene (Fig.4 A and data not shown). In addition, we created a EBP2.KAN strain (YMM178), and these two strains were used in temperature shift experiments to determine how loss of Ebp2p activity affects yeast cell growth. In liquid culture, the ebp2-1 strain exhibited a longer doubling time than the wild type strain at 28 °C (2.4 h versus1.7 h). After shifting to 36 °C, the EBP2 strain continued to divide, with a doubling time of 1.5 h (Fig.4 B). In contrast, the ebp2-1 culture divided for several generations at 36 °C, but it did so with increasingly longer generation times, such that by 14 h at 36 °C, cell division had nearly ceased. To confirm that theebp2-1 cells were able to cycle for a few generations at 36 °C, we performed a similar temperature shift experiment on plates. When single ebp2-1 cells were incubated on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates at the restrictive temperature of 36 °C, they formed microcolonies of up to 10–20 cells before cell division terminated (data not shown). Furthermore, temperature shift experiments revealed thatebp2-1 cells could recover from incubations at 36 °C for up to 16 h. These results suggest that the loss of Ebp2p activity that is associated with the ebp2-1mutation does not rapidly or irreversibly terminate cell division. Theebp2-1 mutation is, however, a strong allele, since we observed a complete, albeit delayed, block of cell division at the restrictive temperature. Since the human EBP2 protein was originally identified as a nucleolar antigen that was abundant in proliferating cells, we assayedebp2-1 mutants for defects associated with ribosome biosynthesis. Cell extracts from EBP2 andebp2-1 strains grown at 28 and 36 °C were prepared and fractionated on sucrose gradients to separate free proteins from monosomes and polysomes (Fig.5.). For the EBP2 strain at both 28 and 36 °C, we could detect an 80 S monosome peak and up to 7 peaks within the larger polysome portion of the profile. We could also visualize two minor peaks of sizes smaller than 80 S, consistent with the expected sedimentation properties of the free 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits. For the ebp2-1 strain at 28"
https://openalex.org/W2037866867,"During the formation of the nervous system, newly born neurons send out axons to find their targets. In its quest toward the target, each axon is led by a growth cone, a motile and dynamic structure at the axon's distal end. The growth cone responds to extracellular axon guidance cues by changing shape, speed, and direction, and also chooses between different extracellular substrates upon which to migrate (17Tessier-Lavigne M Goodman C.S Science. 1996; 274: 1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar, 19Van Vactor D Current Biol. 1999; 9: R797-R799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, the growth cone had been somewhat of a black box, with the intracellular mechanisms regulating guidance poorly characterized. Now, a series of papers in Cell and Neuron identify Trio, an activator of Rho GTPases, as a key transducer of axon guidance signals in the fly (1Awasaki T Saitoh M Sone M Suzuki E Sakai R Ito K Hama C Neuron. 2000; 26: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Bateman J Shu H Van Vactor D Neuron. 2000; 26: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Liebl E.C Forsthoefel D.J Franco L.S Sample S.H Hess J.E Cowger J.A Chandler M.P Shupert A.M Seeger M.A Neuron. 2000; 26: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Newsome T.P Schmidt S Dietz G Keleman K Asling B Debant A Dickson B.J Cell. 2000; 101 (this issue,): 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We review here how a set of independent genetic studies converged on this very versatile molecule, helping to bring the orchestral maneuvers of axon guidance molecules out of the dark. The past few years have witnessed the discovery of various extracellular factors that control axon guidance, and of the cell surface receptors that bind these factors. How the ligand–receptor complexes control axon guidance is not yet clear, but is thought to involve signaling to the actin cytoskeleton at any of several locations along the growth cone. The advancing edge of a growth cone consists of lamellipodia and filopodia, web-like and finger-like protrusions of the cellular membrane containing filamentous actin. Within the body of the growth cone, complexes of filamentous actin attach the advancing edge to the substratum and mediate contraction of the growth cone. Attractive axon guidance cues generally promote the extension of lamellipodia and filopodia and lead to growth cone advancement, while repulsive cues cause the collapse of these structures and result in growth cone contraction. Somehow, extracellular axon guidance molecules must coordinate changes in actin dynamics within lamellipodia, filopodia, and/or adhesive complexes, leading to the effective control of growth cone movement. Much of what is known about signaling pathways involved in axon guidance comes from work in Drosophila. Genetic screens have identified the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase Dlar, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abl, the tyrosine phosphorylated protein Ena, and the actin binding protein profilin as components of signaling pathways involved in axon guidance. As Dlar binds to Abl and to Ena, and as Ena binds to profilin, a pathway from Dlar all the way down to actin is coming into focus (7Hu S Reichardt L.F Neuron. 1999; 22: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). LAR and Mena, the mammalian homologs of Dlar and Ena, are found in both filopodia and focal adhesions, and could regulate the formation of these structures in growth cones (10Lanier L.M Gertler F.B Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Another group of signaling molecules likely to mediate axon guidance signals is the Rho family of small GTPases. Activation of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 promotes the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively, and induces the formation of adhesive complexes that stabilize these structures (15Nobes C.D Hall A Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 9Kozma R Sarner S Ahmed S Lim L Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of the Rho family member RhoA leads to increased actinomyosin contractility and growth cone collapse. Thus, Rac and Cdc42 activation mimicks attractive axon guidance cues, while Rac and Cdc42 inhibition or RhoA activation mimicks repulsive cues. Consistent with a function for Rho GTPases in axon guidance, expression of dominant-negative or constitutively active forms of Rac, or loss of the Rac and Cdc42 effector Pak, results in axon guidance defects in flies (13Luo L Jan L.Y Jan Y.-N Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 8Kaufmann N Wills Z.P Van Vactor D Development. 1998; 125: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hing H Xiao J Harden N Lim L Zipursky S.L Cell. 1999; 97: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in C. elegans, mutations in the Rho GTPase mig-2 lead to various axon guidance and neuronal cell migration defects (20Zipkin I.D Kindt R.M Kenyon C.J Cell. 1997; 90: 883-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Given that Rho GTPases regulate actin dynamics, a critical but previously unanswered question is how axon guidance factors might modulate their activity. Rho GTPases exist in two conformations, an inactive GDP-bound form and a GTP-bound form capable of activating downstream pathways (18Van Aelst L D'Souza-Schorey C Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho GTPases by facilitating the uptake of GTP. Spatially restricted regulation and/or recruitment of Dbl GEFs by axon guidance receptors would provide an elegant explanation for how the local presentation of axon guidance factors leads to local alterations in actin dynamics and consequently to changes in growth cone speed and direction. Consistent with a role for GEFs in regulating movement, loss of the Dbl GEF UNC-73 in the worm results in multiple defects in axon guidance and neuronal cell migration (16Steven R Kubiseski T.J Zheng H Kulkarni S Mancillas J Ruiz Morales A Hogue C.W.V Pawson T Culotti J Cell. 1998; 92: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this issue of Cell and this month's issue of Neuron, a set of studies describe the cloning of fly Trio, a homolog of UNC-73, and present evidence that Trio mediates the effects of axon guidance factors on actin dynamics. In each of the studies, analysis of the fly Trio sequence revealed two occurrences of a Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Found in all Dbl GEFs, the DH-PH element folds as a unit to form a pocket for the substrate Rho GTPase, and exhibits specificity in ability to activate the various Rho GTPases. The first DH-PH element of fly Trio activates fly Rac, while the second DH-PH element fails to activate any of the six fly Rho GTPases (14Newsome T.P Schmidt S Dietz G Keleman K Asling B Debant A Dickson B.J Cell. 2000; 101 (this issue,): 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Trio also contains a conserved N-terminal region found in several other Dbl GEFs, a series of spectrin repeats, and an SH3-like domain. Fly Trio protein is highly expressed in axons and growth cones, placing it in position to transduce axon guidance signals (1Awasaki T Saitoh M Sone M Suzuki E Sakai R Ito K Hama C Neuron. 2000; 26: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Newsome T.P Schmidt S Dietz G Keleman K Asling B Debant A Dickson B.J Cell. 2000; 101 (this issue,): 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Dickson and colleagues present a compelling case that Trio is a transducer of axon guidance signals during fly eye development (14Newsome T.P Schmidt S Dietz G Keleman K Asling B Debant A Dickson B.J Cell. 2000; 101 (this issue,): 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). During formation of the eye in the fly larva, photoreceptor neurons project axons through the optic stalk to targets in the lamina and medulla, two layers in the optic lobe of the brain (Figure 1A). In previous studies, loss of Dock, the fly homolog of the mammalian adaptor molecule Nck, was found to result in aberrant fasciculation of photoreceptor axons, overshoot of axons through the lamina, and the eventual mispositioning of axons beyond the medulla in the adult (Figure 1B and Figure 1C; 5Garrity P.A Rao Y Salecker I McGlade J Pawson T Zipursky S.L Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In mammals, the SH2 domain of Nck binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane proteins while one of its three SH3 domains binds Pak, a serine-threonine kinase with actin-regulatory functions. Indeed, Pak and dock mutant phenotypes are similar, and membrane localization of Pak largely rescues the dock phenotype, suggesting that the primary function of Dock is to recruit Pak to the membrane (6Hing H Xiao J Harden N Lim L Zipursky S.L Cell. 1999; 97: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, binding to active Rac or Cdc42 is required for activation of Pak kinase activity. In their study in this issue of Cell, Dickson and colleagues provide evidence that Pak is regulated by Trio activation of Rac during photoreceptor axon guidance (14Newsome T.P Schmidt S Dietz G Keleman K Asling B Debant A Dickson B.J Cell. 2000; 101 (this issue,): 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In a novel and elegant screen, Dickson and colleagues mutagenized flies and then used tissue-specific mitotic recombination to create homozygous mutant eyes, allowing them to examine the effects of mutating genes whose loss in the whole organism would cause lethality. Screening for flies with defective retinal projection patterns, they isolated alleles of dock, Pak, and trio. The phenotypes of trio and Pak are similar, consistent with Trio functioning to activate Pak. Furthermore, heterozygosity for Pak enhances weak trio mutations. Biochemical studies have shown that Trio activates Rac which in turn activates Pak. Although genetic enhancement does not discriminate between proteins working in series in a linear pathway or in parallel in separate pathways, it seems likely that Trio functions to activate Pak (Figure 1E). The motor axon projection of the fly embryo provides another system in which molecules controlling axon guidance can be identified and tested. Within each segment of the developing embryo, motor neurons extend axons in the intersegmental nerve (ISN) to innervate particular body wall muscles. One branch of the ISN, the ISNb, defasciculates (splits off) from the ISN at a defined point and turns away to innervate target muscles (Figure 2A). In an earlier study, Van Vactor and colleagues found that low doses of cytochalasin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, cause a “bypass phenotype” in which ISNb axons defasciculate from the ISN but fail to turn, thus bypassing their targets (Figure 2C; 8Kaufmann N Wills Z.P Van Vactor D Development. 1998; 125: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of RacN17, a dominant-negative Rac molecule, also results in a bypass phenotype. Taken together, these findings suggest that ISNb turning may be mediated by Rac control of actin dynamics. Loss of the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase Dlar or overexpression of the tyrosine kinase Abl results in axon bypass phenotypes, and Dlar and Abl directly associate in vitro, implying that Dlar and Abl function in a common signaling pathway to control motor neuron axon guidance (7Hu S Reichardt L.F Neuron. 1999; 22: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because human Trio was originally identified as a protein that binds to LAR (3Debant A Serra-Pages C Seipel K O'Brien S Tang M Park S Streuli M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), Van Vactor and colleagues hypothesized that fly Trio may connect a Dlar-Abl complex to Rac (2Bateman J Shu H Van Vactor D Neuron. 2000; 26: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The authors isolated the fly Trio sequence using a combination of degenerate PCR, library screening, and database searching, and then obtained mutations in trio. Their analysis of trio mutants revealed a phenotype similar to that of Abl mutants. In particular, the predominant phenotype in either trio or Abl mutants is “stopping short,” a failure of ISNb axons, after successful defasciculation and turning, to complete their extension toward their most distal target muscle (2Bateman J Shu H Van Vactor D Neuron. 2000; 26: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar; Figure 2B). The similarity of the trio and Abl phenotypes is consistent with the possibility that both Trio and Abl regulate growth cone guidance by affecting actin dynamics. Working independently, Liebl and colleagues cloned a gene identified in an earlier genetic screen for heterozygous enhancers of the lethality caused by mutation of Abl, and discovered that this gene encoded Trio (11Liebl E.C Forsthoefel D.J Franco L.S Sample S.H Hess J.E Cowger J.A Chandler M.P Shupert A.M Seeger M.A Neuron. 2000; 26: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Flies lacking Abl display defects in the formation of the embryonic ventral nerve cord, including thinning and breakage in axon tracts, and heterozygosity for trio exacerbates this phenotype. Along with two other groups (1Awasaki T Saitoh M Sone M Suzuki E Sakai R Ito K Hama C Neuron. 2000; 26: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Bateman J Shu H Van Vactor D Neuron. 2000; 26: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), Liebl et al. observed that loss of trio alone, like loss of Abl, leads to thinning of tracts. Thus, as in the motor axon projection, trio and Abl phenotypes resemble each other. These studies implicate Trio, Abl, and Dlar in common axon guidance decisions, and raise the possibility that they function in a common signaling network. In their study, Bateman et al. demonstrate that heterozygosity for trio enhances the phenotype of Dlar mutants. While this is consistent with Trio acting downstream of Dlar (Figure 2E), a role for Trio in parallel to Dlar or away from Dlar cannot be ruled out given that fly Trio lacks the C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain found in human Trio that binds to LAR (3Debant A Serra-Pages C Seipel K O'Brien S Tang M Park S Streuli M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the Liebl et al. study, heterozygosity for trio enhances the phenotype of Abl mutants. Again, while this is consistent with Trio and Abl functioning in the same pathway, it is also consistent with Trio functioning in parallel with Abl, perhaps even in a different region of the growth cone. These studies raise the issue of whether tyrosine phosphorylation pathways regulate Trio activity during axon guidance. In the photoreceptor projection, identification of the receptors responsible for the local activation of Trio in the growth cone will be informative. In the motor axon projection, whether Dlar or currently unidentified receptors regulate Trio remains to be established. Regardless, there are several ways tyrosine phosphorylation pathways might affect Trio function. For one, Trio's guanine nucleotide exchange activity might be altered by tyrosine phosphorylation. There is no evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of Trio, but in the case of another Dbl family member, Vav1, phosphorylation on various tyrosine residues can either activate or inhibit GEF activity (12Lopez-Lago M Lee H Cruz C Movilla N Bustelo X.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Dlar or other axon guidance receptors might regulate Trio by recruiting Trio to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, analogous to how tyrosine kinase receptors recruit Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras GTPase. Finally, as has also been suggested by studies on Vav1, the activity of Trio could be modulated by the binding of its PH domains to phospholipids, whose production could be regulated by axon guidance receptors. On the other hand, it is possible that components of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways do not directly regulate the activity of Trio during axon guidance, but modulate the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins downstream of Rho GTPases. One way to gain insight into Trio regulation may be to perform structure–function analysis. Newsome et al. show that a Trio transgene with an inactivating mutation in the second DH-PH element still rescues the trio phenotype in the eye, implying that the second DH-PH element is not required for axon guidance. Interestingly, the conserved N-terminal region, which in other Dbl family GEFs functions to negatively regulate GEF activity, is required for rescue, raising the possibility that regulators of Trio modulate the structure of this domain. In the future, it will be interesting to know if the SH3-like domain and the spectrin repeats are also required for Trio function in axon guidance. It may be only a short while before researchers find molecules that bind these various domains, allowing us to understand how Trio is linked to axon guidance proteins. Trio also appears to be involved in other axon guidance signaling pathways that have yet to be investigated. Trio protein is expressed widely in the nervous system, and the Trio phenotype is rather pleiotropic (1Awasaki T Saitoh M Sone M Suzuki E Sakai R Ito K Hama C Neuron. 2000; 26: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the eye, some axons in trio mutants arrest in the optic stalk (Figure 1D), a phenotype not seen in dock or Pak mutants. In the embryonic motor projection, a certain proportion of trio ISNb axons fail to extend to the branchpoint (Figure 2D), a phenotype seen with simultaneous loss of Dlar and two other transmembrane tyrosine phosphatases or with high doses of cytochalasin (4Desai C.J Sun Q Zinn K Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Kaufmann N Wills Z.P Van Vactor D Development. 1998; 125: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). These findings hint at the involvement of Trio in signaling pathways that remain to be characterized. With the discovery of Trio as a key molecule in several axon guidance models, the regulation of Rho GTPases is no longer playing second fiddle to tyrosine phosphorylation in our understanding of axon guidance. Previous to the current work on Trio, the evidence for Rho GTPases playing an instructive role in guidance was not conclusive. Now, as Trio is only one of many GEFs rather than a universal component of the actin cytoskeleton, we favor the idea that Rho GTPases not only allow for growth cone motility, but also, through local differences in activity, determine the direction of axonal extension. The recent completion of the sequence of the fly genome promises to facilitate the identification of mutant genes uncovered in genetic screens for axon guidance molecules. As a result, the list of signaling molecules required for axon guidance is sure to grow. The challenge for geneticists in the future will be to construct signaling pathways from analysis of axon guidance phenotypes, given the variety of signaling molecules whose loss results in similar phenotypes. For instance, genetic perturbation of Trio, Abl, Rac, Ena, and profilin all result in overlapping phenotypes in the ventral nerve cord and the motor axon projection. Knowledge of the biochemical activities of molecules implicated in axon guidance will be helpful for understanding how these molecules function within signaling pathways in the context of neuronal development. In recent years, biologists have developed a detailed understanding of how Rho GTPases and various actin binding proteins modulate actin dynamics, and have established cellular and in vitro systems for studying them. Indeed, this knowledge has already been used in the current set of studies to arrive at a more complete understanding of Trio function. Now that it is possible to study actin regulation in multiple in vivo and in vitro systems, biologists can begin to fill in the missing links that surround Trio in the network of molecular interactions that make up axon guidance."

More recently, several laboratories (10Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 15Raman I.M. Tong G. Jahr C.E.

Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) have investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2 subunits and shown that such phosphorylation is associated with increased function of the receptors. In particular, Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of the subunits prevents a Zn2+-dependent inhibition of the NMDA receptor channel, thereby resulting in increased channel conductance (18Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation is not yet clear, although it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation increased markedly under physiological or pathological conditions (19Menegoz M. Lau L.-F. Herve D. Huganir R.L. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar,20Wang Y.T., Yu, X.-M. Salter M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In particular, tyrosine phosphorylation is increased following long term potentiation (LTP) induction in hippocampus (21Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.P. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Another type of posttranslational modification of NMDA receptors consists of calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits. Calpain is a neutral, calcium-activated protease, which has been implicated in both physiological and pathological modifications of synaptic efficacy (23Lynch G. Baudry M. Brain Res. Bull. 1987; 18: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 25Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Membrane treatment with purified calpain produced a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2 subunits and the formation of lower molecular weight fragments still recognized by antibodies against the C-terminal domain of NR2A/B subunits (26Bi X. Rong Y. Chen J. Dang S. Wang Z. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 790: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Incubation of frozen-thawed brain sections in the presence of calcium also results in a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2A/B recognized by these antibodies, and this effect is completely blocked by calpain inhibitors. Finally, kainic acid treatment of cultured hippocampal slices is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2A/B and the formation of lower molecular weight fragments of the subunits (26Bi X. Rong Y. Chen J. Dang S. Wang Z. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 790: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We postulated that such an effect could be involved in the regulation of the turnover of NMDA receptors or in the relocation of the receptors since the C-terminal domains of NMDA receptors are involved in the targeting/anchoring of the receptors in synaptic membranes through interactions with a family of PDZ-containing proteins (27Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 29O'Brien R.J. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Interactions between phosphorylation and calpain-mediated regulation of NMDA receptors have also been reported (30Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Increasing the state of phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits by incubating tissue sections in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors was found to decrease the extent of calpain-mediated truncation of NR2A/B subunits of NMDA receptors. However, no information was available concerning which phosphorylation site(s) was responsible for this effect, and the possible functions of the interactions between phosphorylation and calpain-mediated regulation of NMDA receptors. In the present study, we used immunoprecipitation with antibodies against phosphotyrosine as well as antibodies against NR2A and NR2B subunits to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation interferes with calpain-mediated truncation of NR2A and/or NR2B subunits. Furthermore, we used a GST fusion protein to identify potential cutting sites by calpain in the C-terminal domain of NR2A. The results clearly indicate that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation protects against calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domain of NR2A subunits of NMDA receptors and suggest possible functions for calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NMDA receptors.DISCUSSIONOur results clearly indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation almost completely protects NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors from calpain-mediated truncation of their C-terminal domains. Thus, immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine did precipitate NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors as previously reported by many laboratories (36Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 37Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). No evidence for calpain-mediated truncation of tyrosine-phosphorylated NMDA receptor subunits was obtained. Under the same conditions, immunoprecipitation with anti-NR2A/B, anti-NR2A, and anti-NR2B indicated that calpain treatment produced a 62% decrease in the amount of NR2A/B, a 55% decrease in NR2A, and a 30% decrease in NR2B. The reason for the difference in percent decrease between anti-NR2A/B and the average of the values for anti-NR2A and anti-NR2B is not clear and could be due to differences in the ability of the antibodies to precipitate the subunits. The same samples exhibited only small or no decreases in the 170/180-kDa species labeled with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, providing further evidence that the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the 170–180-kDa species of NR2A and NR2B were not degraded by calpain. The exact fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2A or NR2B is not clearly known. It was estimated that only a small percentage of subunits was phosphorylated under control conditions and that this fraction could be markedly increased by different manipulations (36Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It is thus not likely that the calpain-resistant fraction of NR2 subunits (45% for NR2A and 70% for NR2B) represents the fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated subunits. Other factors must contribute to resistance to calpain-mediated truncation of the subunits including differences in sequences, other phosphorylation sites, or other posttranslational modifications.Using a GST-NR2A fusion protein provided the identification of one calpain cutting site in the NR2A C-terminal domain between residues 1278 and 1279 (Fig. 5). Other potential cutting sites exist for both NR2A and NR2B and have been indicated in the figure. These sites have been identified by comparison with known cutting sites for several calpain substrates as well as with a variety of peptides shown to be degraded by calpain (25Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). First, it is clear that there are many more potential calpain cutting sites in the C-terminal domain of NR2A than of NR2B. This might account for the larger decrease in NR2A than NR2B following calpain treatment of membranes. Second, the antibodies used to recognize NR2A/B are directed at the last 10 amino acids of the C-terminal domain, and it is thus likely that some fragments generated by calpain-mediated truncation of the subunits would not easily be observed in immunoblots. Interestingly, the anti-NR2B antibodies are directed at amino acids 984–1104 and would therefore still recognize receptor subunits lacking the C-terminal domain if the truncation site(s) is located after amino acid 1104. One potential cutting site at amino acids 1299–1300 is present in the C-terminal domain of NR2B. This site could generate the lower molecular weight species of NR2B observed in the immunoblot shown in Fig. 4. In particular, a species with an apparent molecular mass of about 150 kDa increased significantly following calpain treatment of membranes. The antibodies against NR2A are directed at amino acids 1253–1391 and would therefore still recognize receptors lacking only the last 75 amino acids of the subunit or subunits truncated before amino acid 1253. No small or large fragments were detected in immunoblots stained with anti-NR2A antibodies. This would be consistent with cutting sites located between amino acids 1253 and 1391.There are many tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domains of both NR2A and NR2B (indicated by bold letters in Fig. 5). Although the exact location of the tyrosine(s) phosphorylated in either NR2A or NR2B are not yet known, 2 tyrosine residues (amino acid 1267 and amino acid 1387) have been identified in the C-terminal domain of NR2A, the mutations of which prevent Src-mediated increase in NMDA receptor function (18Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The former site is interesting, as it is closely located from the calpain-cutting site at amino acids 1278–1279. Although our data did not provide for the identification of which tyrosine residue(s) is involved in the protection from calpain-mediated truncation, they did confirm that Src-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of NR2A inhibits calpain-mediated truncation. More information is needed to understand better the mechanisms responsible for protection against calpain-mediated truncation of NMDA receptors by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it is worth noting that this feature, which is phosphorylation-mediated protection, is a common feature of calpain substrates (30Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Another interesting feature of the potential calpain cutting sites concerns their relationships to a spectrin-binding site recently reported to be present in the C-terminal domains of NR2A and NR2B. For NR2B, the site has been proposed to be at the sequence QKKNRN (amino acids 1291–1296) (37Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), which is at a site located very close to a potential calpain cutting site (amino acids 1299–1300). Although no information is available for the exact location of the spectrin-binding sites of NR2A, if we assume that it is similar to that in NR2B and corresponds to the sequence QFQKN (amino acids 1278–1282), this would overlap with the calpain cutting site (amino acids 1278–1279). It is worth noting that spectrin itself is a preferred calpain substrate, and therefore both NR2 subunits and spectrin could be truncated as a result of calpain activation. Besides spectrin, the C-terminal regions of the NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptors interact with the PDZ domains of a family of synaptic cytoskeleton-associated proteins that may be involved in the formation of macromolecular signaling complexes (reviewed in Refs. 38Wechsler A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and 39Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Mice expressing C-terminal truncated NR2 subunits phenotypically resemble NR2 knock-out mice. However, C-terminal truncation of the NR2 subunits does not interfere with the formation of NMDA receptors that can be synaptically activated, leading to the hypothesis that it is rather the intracellular signaling that is deficient in cells expressing truncated receptor subunits (40Sheng M. Wyszynski M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to propose that one possible function of calpain-mediated truncation of NMDA receptor subunits is to produce the disassociation of NMDA receptors from the spectrin meshwork or from the macromolecular signaling complexes. This could lead to the relocation of the receptors in synaptic membranes to altered signal transduction pathways or be a signal for internalization and further degradation of the receptors. Experiments are underway to test this hypothesis.Finally, it is worth considering the potential functional consequences of the interactions between calpain and tyrosine phosphorylation at the level of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptors. In particular, it has been shown that LTP is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors (21Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.P. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As LTP has also been shown to be accompanied by calpain activation (41Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Sun W. Webster L.C. Grant S.G. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Li J. McNamara J.O. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 42Vanderklish P. Saido T.C. Gall C. Lynch G. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that one of the functions of tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors is to prevent calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits and possible down-regulation of NMDA receptors. In the absence of such a mechanism, each event leading to LTP could result in modification of the synaptic plasticity machinery itself. Similarly, ischemia results in a large increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A (at least) subunits (43Lynch G. Neurobiol. Learning Mem. 1998; 70: 82-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The same insult also results in calpain activation as evidenced by increased formation of calpain-mediated breakdown of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (44Takagi N. Shinno K. Teves L. Bissoon N. Wallace M.C. Gurd J.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,45Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamamura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results then predict that tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2 subunits would protect the subunits from calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains, and possibly then, from their dissociation with cytoskeletal proteins. As a result, this mechanism could maintain a higher degree of activity of NMDA receptors, despite the activation of calpain. It would be of interest to determine the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on NMDA receptor locations and functions under these conditions.

Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) have investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2 subunits and shown that such phosphorylation is associated with increased function of the receptors. In particular, Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of the subunits prevents a Zn2+-dependent inhibition of the NMDA receptor channel, thereby resulting in increased channel conductance (18Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation is not yet clear, although it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation increased markedly under physiological or pathological conditions (19Menegoz M. Lau L.-F. Herve D. Huganir R.L. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar,20Wang Y.T., Yu, X.-M. Salter M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In particular, tyrosine phosphorylation is increased following long term potentiation (LTP) induction in hippocampus (21Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.P. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another type of posttranslational modification of NMDA receptors consists of calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits. Calpain is a neutral, calcium-activated protease, which has been implicated in both physiological and pathological modifications of synaptic efficacy (23Lynch G. Baudry M. Brain Res. Bull. 1987; 18: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 25Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Membrane treatment with purified calpain produced a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2 subunits and the formation of lower molecular weight fragments still recognized by antibodies against the C-terminal domain of NR2A/B subunits (26Bi X. Rong Y. Chen J. Dang S. Wang Z. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 790: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Incubation of frozen-thawed brain sections in the presence of calcium also results in a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2A/B recognized by these antibodies, and this effect is completely blocked by calpain inhibitors. Finally, kainic acid treatment of cultured hippocampal slices is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of the 170-kDa species of NR2A/B and the formation of lower molecular weight fragments of the subunits (26Bi X. Rong Y. Chen J. Dang S. Wang Z. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 790: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We postulated that such an effect could be involved in the regulation of the turnover of NMDA receptors or in the relocation of the receptors since the C-terminal domains of NMDA receptors are involved in the targeting/anchoring of the receptors in synaptic membranes through interactions with a family of PDZ-containing proteins (27Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Interactions between phosphorylation and calpain-mediated regulation of NMDA receptors have also been reported (30Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Increasing the state of phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits by incubating tissue sections in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors was found to decrease the extent of calpain-mediated truncation of NR2A/B subunits of NMDA receptors. However, no information was available concerning which phosphorylation site(s) was responsible for this effect, and the possible functions of the interactions between phosphorylation and calpain-mediated regulation of NMDA receptors. In the present study, we used immunoprecipitation with antibodies against phosphotyrosine as well as antibodies against NR2A and NR2B subunits to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation interferes with calpain-mediated truncation of NR2A and/or NR2B subunits. Furthermore, we used a GST fusion protein to identify potential cutting sites by calpain in the C-terminal domain of NR2A. The results clearly indicate that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation protects against calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domain of NR2A subunits of NMDA receptors and suggest possible functions for calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NMDA receptors. DISCUSSIONOur results clearly indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation almost completely protects NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors from calpain-mediated truncation of their C-terminal domains. Thus, immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine did precipitate NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors as previously reported by many laboratories (36Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 37Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). No evidence for calpain-mediated truncation of tyrosine-phosphorylated NMDA receptor subunits was obtained. Under the same conditions, immunoprecipitation with anti-NR2A/B, anti-NR2A, and anti-NR2B indicated that calpain treatment produced a 62% decrease in the amount of NR2A/B, a 55% decrease in NR2A, and a 30% decrease in NR2B. The reason for the difference in percent decrease between anti-NR2A/B and the average of the values for anti-NR2A and anti-NR2B is not clear and could be due to differences in the ability of the antibodies to precipitate the subunits. The same samples exhibited only small or no decreases in the 170/180-kDa species labeled with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, providing further evidence that the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the 170–180-kDa species of NR2A and NR2B were not degraded by calpain. The exact fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2A or NR2B is not clearly known. It was estimated that only a small percentage of subunits was phosphorylated under control conditions and that this fraction could be markedly increased by different manipulations (36Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It is thus not likely that the calpain-resistant fraction of NR2 subunits (45% for NR2A and 70% for NR2B) represents the fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated subunits. Other factors must contribute to resistance to calpain-mediated truncation of the subunits including differences in sequences, other phosphorylation sites, or other posttranslational modifications.Using a GST-NR2A fusion protein provided the identification of one calpain cutting site in the NR2A C-terminal domain between residues 1278 and 1279 (Fig. 5). Other potential cutting sites exist for both NR2A and NR2B and have been indicated in the figure. These sites have been identified by comparison with known cutting sites for several calpain substrates as well as with a variety of peptides shown to be degraded by calpain (25Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). First, it is clear that there are many more potential calpain cutting sites in the C-terminal domain of NR2A than of NR2B. This might account for the larger decrease in NR2A than NR2B following calpain treatment of membranes. Second, the antibodies used to recognize NR2A/B are directed at the last 10 amino acids of the C-terminal domain, and it is thus likely that some fragments generated by calpain-mediated truncation of the subunits would not easily be observed in immunoblots. Interestingly, the anti-NR2B antibodies are directed at amino acids 984–1104 and would therefore still recognize receptor subunits lacking the C-terminal domain if the truncation site(s) is located after amino acid 1104. One potential cutting site at amino acids 1299–1300 is present in the C-terminal domain of NR2B. This site could generate the lower molecular weight species of NR2B observed in the immunoblot shown in Fig. 4. In particular, a species with an apparent molecular mass of about 150 kDa increased significantly following calpain treatment of membranes. The antibodies against NR2A are directed at amino acids 1253–1391 and would therefore still recognize receptors lacking only the last 75 amino acids of the subunit or subunits truncated before amino acid 1253. No small or large fragments were detected in immunoblots stained with anti-NR2A antibodies. This would be consistent with cutting sites located between amino acids 1253 and 1391.There are many tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domains of both NR2A and NR2B (indicated by bold letters in Fig. 5). Although the exact location of the tyrosine(s) phosphorylated in either NR2A or NR2B are not yet known, 2 tyrosine residues (amino acid 1267 and amino acid 1387) have been identified in the C-terminal domain of NR2A, the mutations of which prevent Src-mediated increase in NMDA receptor function (18Zheng F. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The former site is interesting, as it is closely located from the calpain-cutting site at amino acids 1278–1279. Although our data did not provide for the identification of which tyrosine residue(s) is involved in the protection from calpain-mediated truncation, they did confirm that Src-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of NR2A inhibits calpain-mediated truncation. More information is needed to understand better the mechanisms responsible for protection against calpain-mediated truncation of NMDA receptors by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it is worth noting that this feature, which is phosphorylation-mediated protection, is a common feature of calpain substrates (30Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Another interesting feature of the potential calpain cutting sites concerns their relationships to a spectrin-binding site recently reported to be present in the C-terminal domains of NR2A and NR2B. For NR2B, the site has been proposed to be at the sequence QKKNRN (amino acids 1291–1296) (37Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), which is at a site located very close to a potential calpain cutting site (amino acids 1299–1300). Although no information is available for the exact location of the spectrin-binding sites of NR2A, if we assume that it is similar to that in NR2B and corresponds to the sequence QFQKN (amino acids 1278–1282), this would overlap with the calpain cutting site (amino acids 1278–1279). It is worth noting that spectrin itself is a preferred calpain substrate, and therefore both NR2 subunits and spectrin could be truncated as a result of calpain activation. Besides spectrin, the C-terminal regions of the NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptors interact with the PDZ domains of a family of synaptic cytoskeleton-associated proteins that may be involved in the formation of macromolecular signaling complexes (reviewed in Refs. 38Wechsler A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and 39Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Mice expressing C-terminal truncated NR2 subunits phenotypically resemble NR2 knock-out mice. However, C-terminal truncation of the NR2 subunits does not interfere with the formation of NMDA receptors that can be synaptically activated, leading to the hypothesis that it is rather the intracellular signaling that is deficient in cells expressing truncated receptor subunits (40Sheng M. Wyszynski M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to propose that one possible function of calpain-mediated truncation of NMDA receptor subunits is to produce the disassociation of NMDA receptors from the spectrin meshwork or from the macromolecular signaling complexes. This could lead to the relocation of the receptors in synaptic membranes to altered signal transduction pathways or be a signal for internalization and further degradation of the receptors. Experiments are underway to test this hypothesis.Finally, it is worth considering the potential functional consequences of the interactions between calpain and tyrosine phosphorylation at the level of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptors. In particular, it has been shown that LTP is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors (21Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.P. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As LTP has also been shown to be accompanied by calpain activation (41Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Sun W. Webster L.C. Grant S.G. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Li J. McNamara J.O. Seeburg P.H.

Brain Res. 1995; 32: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that one of the functions of tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors is to prevent calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains of NR2 subunits and possible down-regulation of NMDA receptors. In the absence of such a mechanism, each event leading to LTP could result in modification of the synaptic plasticity machinery itself. Similarly, ischemia results in a large increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A (at least) subunits (43Lynch G. Neurobiol. Learning Mem. 1998; 70: 82-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The same insult also results in calpain activation as evidenced by increased formation of calpain-mediated breakdown of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (44Takagi N. Shinno K. Teves L. Bissoon N.

Our results then predict that tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2 subunits would protect the subunits from calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domains, and possibly then, from their dissociation with cytoskeletal proteins. As a result, this mechanism could maintain a higher degree of activity of NMDA receptors, despite the activation of calpain. It would be of interest to determine the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on NMDA receptor locations and functions under these conditions.

The palindromic SPBP binding site, SPRE, is situated in the stromelysin 1 promoter/enhancer region, where it mediates mitogen activation of the gene (1Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J.

SPBP does not belong to any of the classical transcription factor families, but the protein features several sequence motifs that may be of functional significance. Two runs of polyglutamine near the amino terminus may harbor a transactivation function and a leucine zipper in the central part may be involved in heteromerization with other transcription factors. A basic region similar to the DNA binding domain in leucine zipper transcription factors is believed to mediate binding of SPBP to DNA (1Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T.

At the extreme carboxyl terminus, the protein contains an atypical PHD/LAP domain similar to PHD/LAP domain 4 in thetrx trithorax proteins. PHD/LAP domains conform to the general consensus Cys-X 2-Cys-X 8–21-Cys-X 2–4-Cys-X 4–5-His-X 2-Cys-X 12–46-Cys-X 2-Cys (3Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E.J.

In this report, we provide evidence that the PHD/LAP domain in SPBP can act as an intra-chain protein-protein interaction module. The RING finger is a protein-protein interaction module occurring in a large, functionally diverse group of proteins. The RING finger consensus sequence is Cys-X 2-Cys-X 9–39-Cys-X 1–3-His-X 2–3-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 4–48-Cys-X 2-Cys (11Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The RING finger is structurally unique, in that the two first cysteines coordinate a zinc atom together with the fourth and fifth cysteines in the motif. A second zinc atom is held by the third cysteine, the histidine and the sixth and seventh cysteines. The resulting “cross-brace” motif constitutes an independent structural unit that is clearly distinct from the classical tandem array of fingers (8Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R.

Recently, it was reported that the small nuclear RING finger protein RNF4 (SNURF) interacts with steroid hormone receptors, notably the androgen receptor, and Sp1. Transcriptional coactivation was observed with both the androgen receptor and Sp1, and in addition, RNF4 moderately increased basal transcription from some promoters (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that RNF4 can interact directly with SPBP and stimulate its transactivation potential. The interaction between RNF4 and SPBP depends critically on the RING finger in RNF4 and is negatively affected by the PHD/LAP-domain of SPBP. o-Nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, D(+)-raffinose, heart muscle kinase, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma; nickel-NTA1-resin was from Qiagen; glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [α-32P]dATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN. Mouse embryo and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were fromCLONTECH. The plasmid 2 μ97trp was constructed by inserting the ApaI-BamHI fragment containing the Gal4 DB expression cassette from pPC97 (27Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) between theApaI and BamHI sites of pRS424 (28Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) and used as bait-vector in two-hybrid experiments. The library used in two-hybrid library screens was a mouse embryo cDNA library in pVP16 (a gift from S. Hollenberg (29Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar)). The vector pET-HTG (30Jensen T.H. Jensen A. Kjems J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 162: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used for expression of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, and the vector YepWOB6 (31Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) was used for expression of recombinant protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The E. coli strain used for expression of recombinant protein was BL21 DE3 carrying the plasmid pRI952 (32Del Tito Jr., B.J. Ward J.M. Hodgson J. Gershater C.J. Edwards H. Wysocki L.A. Watson F.A. Sathe G. Kane J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7086-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant protein in S. cerevisiae was performed in the strain JEL1 (33Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) S. cerevisiae two-hybrid reporter strains were CBY 14a and CBY14α (34Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and pPJ-4A (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein fusion constructs were made in pEGFPc1 (CLONTECH). Full-length RNF4 and SPBP cDNAs were maintained in the vector pBNSEN (36Pallisgaard N. Pedersen F.S. Birkelund S. Jørgensen P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) under the names pBN-RNF4 and pBN-SPBP, respectively. Full-length RNF4 cDNA was transferred from pBN-RNF4 as aHindIII-NotI cassette and inserted between theHindIII and Bsp1201 sites in pEGFP c1. AnXmaI-NotI cassette from pBN-SPBP containing full-length SPBP was inserted between the XmaI andBsp1201 sites of pEGFP c1 to yield pEGFP-SPBP. In both cases, in-frame fusions to the GFP-moiety are obtained. Subcloning of fragments into two-hybrid vectors or vectors for expression of recombinant protein was accomplished by inserting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generated fragments using either pBN-RNF4 or pBN-SPBP as the template. The amino acid coordinates of the inserts will be indicated in the results section as needed. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed by the overlapping PCR mutagenesis strategy. Specific information on the primers used will be available on request. To isolate λ-phages with inserted cDNA fragments coding for Akv-MuLV U3-region-binding proteins, we used the methodology developed by Vinson et al. (37Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Details relevant for our procedure have been described previously (38Nielsen A.L. Pallisgaard N. Pedersen F.S. Jørgensen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3449-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Pallisgaard N. Pedersen F.S. Kjeldgaard N.O. Jørgensen P. Adv. Appl. Biotechnol. Ser. 1990; 7: 87-94Google Scholar). Briefly, a random primed λgt11 Sfi-Not expression library was constructed, using poly(A)+ RNA from the murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 infected with Akv retrovirus. Radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides representing mainly the enhancer region of Akv-MuLV were used in the screening of the λgt11Sfi-Not expression library. λ clones encoding the DNA binding segment of SPBP were identified as binding to two independent sequences, one in the CAAT box region and one distal to the enhancer repeat region. The two-hybrid screen reported in Fig. 1 was performed using the mating-based system described by Bendixen et al. (34Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and covered approximately 2 × 107clones. One among several positive isolates carried an insert spanning codons 27–189 of the murine RNF4 cDNA open reading frame. Full-length cDNAs were obtained by screening of a mouse embryo λ-ZAP express cDNA library (Stratagene) using the original isolates as hybridization probes. NIH3T3 and HT1080 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection experiments were performed using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the supplier's manual. In general, transfections were done with 0.1 μg of reporter plasmid, 1 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.4 μg of β-galactosidase-expressing internal control plasmid. CAT assays and β-galactoside assays were performed as described previously (38Nielsen A.L. Pallisgaard N. Pedersen F.S. Jørgensen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3449-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Multiple tissue Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from various murine tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with radioactive DNA probes in the supplied hybridization buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. Between hybridizations, filters were stripped by boiling in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 5 min. Gel-purified DNA fragments were labeled using random primers, [α-32P]dATP, and DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). A fragment of SPBP encoding amino acids 1108–1812 was used to probe for SPBP-expression, and a fragment of RNF4 encoding amino acids 17–193 was used to probe for RNF4 expression. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length RNF4 and derivatives thereof were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pRI952 (32Del Tito Jr., B.J. Ward J.M. Hodgson J. Gershater C.J. Edwards H. Wysocki L.A. Watson F.A. Sathe G. Kane J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7086-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to an A 600= 1.0 and induced in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside for 3 h at 29 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmDTT, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sonicate was cleared by centrifugation and filtration through a 45-μm cellulose acetate filter (Sartorius) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times in sonication buffer followed by elution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione. Labeling of GST-RNF4 with [γ-32P]ATP and bovine heart muscle kinase was done as detailed previously (30Jensen T.H. Jensen A. Kjems J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 162: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). His-tagged SPBP1336–1812 was expressed in S. cerevisiae: SPBP1336–1218 was equipped with a heart muscle kinase phosphorylation site at the amino-terminal end and six histidine residues at the carboxyl-terminal in a polymerase chain reaction using the primers GAACCGGTAAGAAGAGCTTCAGTACCATCAAAAGAAGGTGGCCG and CAGCGGCCGCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAGGATGAGCAGCCAGGCTCC and pBN-SPBP as the template. The amplification product was digested withAgeI and NotI and between the AgeI andNotI sites in YEpWOB6. Yeast JEL1 cells containing the resulting construct were grown in YEPR medium (20 g/liter Difco peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter raffinose) (containing 2% raffinose) to an A 600 = 6, supplemented with 2% galactose, and grown for an additional 12 h. Pelleted cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ruptured in a bead beater (20 × 15 s) and extracted in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole. Following centrifugation and filtration through a 45-μm cellulose acetate filter, the extract was incubated with nickel-NTA resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times in extraction buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted by raising the imidazole concentration to 250 mm. The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol before use. In pull-down assays, 300 ng of32P-labeled GST-RNF4 (or GST as a control) was mixed with 400 ng of His-tagged SPBP and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.2% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Nickel-NTA-resin was added to the reactions, and incubations were continued for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the resins in binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, protein was stripped off with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and analyzed polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (2Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that nuclear extract was replaced with recombinant proteins in the amounts indicated in Fig. 6. The SPBP protein is 1965 amino acids in length. Fig. 1 gives a schematic representation indicating the positions of the polyglutamine runs (Q), the leucine zipper (Lz), the basic region (BR) and the PHD/LAP domain (PHD). The fragments shown in Fig. 1 were fused to the DNA binding region of GAL4 and used as baits in two-hybrid screens against a mouse embryo cDNA library fused to the activation domain of VP16 (29Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In the screen with the shaded bait fragment (SPBP1108–1812), the RING finger protein RNF4 (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 40Chiariotti L. Benvenuto G. Fedele M. Santoro M. Simeone A. Fusco A. Bruni C.B. Genomics. 1998; 47: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) appeared among the isolates. When retransformed into the yeast reporter strain, the isolated RNF4-VP16AD fusion interacted with the shaded bait fragment, but none of the other fragments in Fig. 1. The expression patterns of RNF4 and SPBP mRNA were analyzed by probing tissue-specific Northern blots with the corresponding cDNAs (Fig.2 A). Both mRNAs are present in total embryonic poly(A)+ RNA from all developmental stages tested. In adult tissues, RNA species hybridizing to both cDNAs were evident in brain, lung, liver, kidney, and testes. RNF4 mRNA was more abundant than SPBP mRNA; exposure times for the SPBP blots were four times longer than for the RNF4 blots. The expression pattern found here with murine RNF4 generally agrees with those observed with the human (40Chiariotti L. Benvenuto G. Fedele M. Santoro M. Simeone A. Fusco A. Bruni C.B. Genomics. 1998; 47: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and rat (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) orthologs. The intracellular localization of SPBP and RNF4 was examined using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions. Transient expression of either RNF4-GFP or SPBP-GFP in NIH3T3 fibroblasts resulted in nuclear accumulation of fluorescence in both cases, while transfection with a control construct expressing GFP alone led to fluorescence throughout the cell (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both SPBP and RNF4 are able to target GFP to the nucleus (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The effect of RNF4 on SPBP-mediated transactivation was assessed in transient expression experiments as shown in Fig.2 C. The reporter construct PALCAT (1Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) contains a single SPRE (SPBP binding site) upstream to a TK-CAT expression unit. Cotransfection with a construct expressing full-length SPBP stimulated CAT expression approximately 10-fold. RNF4 alone did not affect CAT-expression. However, simultaneous expression of RNF4 (full-length or a truncation expressing only the RING finger moiety) and SPBP resulted in CAT activities 30–45-fold over the basal level. Thus, RNF4 acts to enhance SPBP-mediated transactivation, and only the RING finger moiety of the protein is needed to bring about the effect. To identify the minimal region of SPBP able to interact with RNF4, a deletion series (fragments 2–13) of the original SPBP1108–1812bait fragment (fragment 1) was tested against VP16-RNF4 in two-hybrid assays (Fig. 3 A). The shortest interacting fragment (fragment 13) encompasses residues 1379–1743 in SPBP. This region harbors the basic segment presumed to participate in DNA binding. To further characterize the interaction, we introduced point mutations in the shortest interacting fragment. This was accomplished by allowing a randomly mutagenized PCR fragment, generated by error-prone PCR, to undergo homologous recombination in yeast (41Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 393-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) with the bait construct containing residues 1379–1743. The recipient yeast two-hybrid reporter strain also contained VP16-RNF4, and interaction-deficient mutants could therefore be identified by their loss of reporter gene activity. The mutations were mapped by direct sequencing after isolation of the mutated plasmids. Two single substitutions (P1702S and C1736R) and one double substitution (A1629T/G1737V) that completely abolished reporter gene activity are shown in Fig. 3 B. These mutations map between the basic segment and the COOH-terminal border of the shortest interacting fragment. Affinity-purified recombinant proteins were used in pull-down experiments to assess interactionin vitro. His-tagged SPBP1300–1812 was allowed to bind 32P-labeled, GST-tagged full-length RNF4 prior to addition of a nickel affinity matrix. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the bound material is shown in Fig.4 A. Approximately 35% of the input GST-RNF4 was recovered in the bound fraction (lane 6). No retention was observed with GST alone (lane 4) or when His-tagged SPBP was omitted (lane 5). To assess the specificity, we tested the effect of mutations in either partner (Fig.4 B). The C1736R point mutation in SPBP shown above to prevent genetic interaction also blocked interaction in vitro (lane 1). Substitutions of three cysteines and a histidine in the presumptive zinc-binding center in RNF4 also led to loss of interaction (lane 2). Furthermore, SPBP did not bind to an irrelevant protein (the splicing factor PSF, lane 3). Thus, RNF4 and SPBP exhibit a robust and specific in vitrointeraction that appear to be dependent on an intact RING finger in RNF4. The data in Fig.5 A reveal an interesting feature of the interaction between RNF4 and SPBP. An SPBP bait construct containing amino acids 1108–1965 (the entire carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, including the interaction region) failed to interact, while deletion of just the PHD/LAP domain at the extreme COOH terminus (maintaining 1108–1912) restored interaction. This indicates that the PHD/LAP domain counteracts RNF4 binding. To substantiate this, two other splice variants of SPBP were tested: one that only deviates from SPBP by having a slightly different PHD/LAP domain (SPBP1) and one that contains no PHD/LAP domain (SPBP2; see sequence comparison in Fig. 5 B). Fig. 5 A shows that the PHD/LAP-less variant interacted efficiently, while interaction with SPBP1 was markedly reduced. The repression exerted by the alternative PHD/LAP domain in SPBP1 was less severe than that observed in SPBP. The function of the PHD/LAP domain was further studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Three cysteines and one histidine residue in the PHD/LAP domain were altered to alanine and leucine, respectively, aiming to inactivate both of the putative zinc-coordinating centers. These point mutations alleviated the inhibitory effect of the PHD/LAP domains in both SPBP and SPBP1. RNF4 did not interact directly with the LAP domain (data not shown). To test directly whether the PHD/LAP domain interact with the RNF4 binding region in SPBP, the PHD/LAP was fused to VP16 AD and tested against various fragments of SPBP fused to Gal4 DB in two-hybrid assays. As evidenced in Table I, interaction in trans between the PHD/LAP and the RNF4 target region in SPBP was readily detectable. Elimination of the zinc coordination capability by substitutions of three cysteines and one histidine (LAPmut) totally abolished binding. Table I further shows that interaction with the RING finger and the PHD/LAP domain responded similarly to truncations in SPBP. The point mutations in SPBP shown above to obliterate SPBP-RNF4 interaction also prevented thetrans-binding of the PHD/LAP domain. RNF4 and the PHD/LAP domain thus appear to compete for the same target in SPBP. Thereby, the internal zinc finger (the PHD/LAP) may restrain the access of the external zinc finger (the RING finger of RNF4).Table IThe PHD/LAP-domain interacts in trans with the RNF4 binding region in SPBPVector1356781112C1735RP1702SA1669TRNF4≤0.281 ± 785 ± 5≤0.2≤0.2≤0.298 ± 6≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2LAP≤0.277 ± 433 ± 5≤0.2≤0.2≤0.268 ± 4≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2≤0.2LAPmut≤0.2≤0.2VP16AD fused to either RNF4, the PHD/LAP domain (SPBP1812–1965) or a PHD/LAP domain containing the site-specific substitutions C1926A, C1931A, H1936L, and C1939A was tested against Gal4DB fused to SPBP1108–1812 in two-hybrid assays. β-Galactosidase reporter gene activities were assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

Binding of SPBP to its cognate DNA target, SPRE, is readily detectable in mobility shift assays (2Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of RNF4 on SPBP-SPRE complexes, radiolabeled SPRE was incubated with recombinant SPBP1300–1812 (Fig.6). Subsaturating amounts of SPBP (lanes 3 and 5) resulted in low levels of complex formation. Addition of RNF4 to binding reactions containing the same amounts of SPBP as in lanes 3 and 5 caused an increase in the amounts of bandshifted complex (lanes 4 and6). The position of the shifted band was not altered in the presence of RNF4. No bandshift was seen with RNF4 alone (lane 2), and the presence of an excess of unlabeled SPRE-oligonucleotide prevented the bandshift (comparelanes 1 and 6). In summary, RNF4 stimulates accumulation of SPBP-SPRE complexes but does not seem to enter a ternary complex sufficiently robust to be detectable as a supershift. This report provides evidence that SPBP interacts directly with the RING finger protein RNF4. Both proteins are confined to the nuclear compartment and appear to be generally expressed. Nuclear localization of RNF4 was recently reported for the human and rat orthologs (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 40Chiariotti L. Benvenuto G. Fedele M. Santoro M. Simeone A. Fusco A. Bruni C.B. Genomics. 1998; 47: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of RNF4 to SPBP takes place in a ∼350 amino acids region containing the putative DNA binding domain but not the leucine zipper previously proposed to be involved in heterodimer formation (1Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions preventing binding map to a region immediately carboxyl-terminal to the basic putative DNA-binding motif. Sequence conservation between SPBP and related proteins can be noted in this region, for instance, the LVCCLC motif around 1735, where inhibitory mutations map, is conserved in the human ortholog AR1 (U19345), the retinoic acid induced protein GT1 (42Imai Y. Suzuki Y. Matsui T. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Brain Res. 1995; 31: 1-9Google Scholar), and a hypothetical human protein (AL133649). We find that the endogenous zinc finger in SPBP, the atypical PHD/LAP domain, is a protein-protein interaction module capable of mediating intra-chain interactions in SPBP. This particular subtype of the PHD/LAP domain is also present in AR1 (GenBankTM accession number U19345), trithorax (5Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), the human trithorax, ALL (43Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and a hypothetical human protein (GenBankTM accession number AL133649). Deletions or point mutations preventing binding of RNF4 also block interaction with the PHD/LAP domain, and the presence of the PHD/LAP domain in cis reduces the binding of RNF4. The simplest explanation for this is that the binding sites for the two zinc finger motifs fully or partially overlap, although more complex conformational mechanisms cannot be excluded. The net result is that the PHD/LAP domain functions as a negative modulator of cofactor binding. In fact, the observed restraint on cofactor binding is sufficiently strong that the system is likely to be regulated,i.e. by secondary modifications or other cellular factors. SPBP-mediated transcriptional activation is enhanced in the presence of RNF4. It was recently reported that RNF4 functions as a positive cofactor with steroid receptors, notably the androgen and estrogen receptors (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 can utilize RNF4 as a coactivator (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,44Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and a potential role in POZ family member-mediated repression has been reported (45Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that RNF4 is able to interact with a broad variety of transcription factors. Our observation that RNF4 is more abundantly expressed than SPBP, at least at the mRNA level, is consistent with this view. Distinct modes of interaction are utilized by RNF4 to associate with different transcription factors. Thus, binding to SPBP and Sp1 is mediated through the RING finger (this report and Ref. 44Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while steroid receptors are contacted by the non-RING moiety of RNF4 (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mechanism of RNF4-mediated coactivation is not understood. Given the interplay between RNF4 and the PHD/LAP domain it seems plausible that binding of the cofactor can induce or stabilize a distinct conformational state in SPBP increasing the transactivation potential of the latter. Alternatively, RNF4 itself may mediate contact to the general transcription machinery. Indeed, the non-RING moiety of RNF4 interacts avidly with the TATA-binding protein, TBP, in vitro (although the protein shows no endogenous transactivation activity when tested as a Gal4DB-fusion in transient expression assays) (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The observation that the RING finger alone is sufficient to stimulate SPBP-mediated transactivation may imply that direct interaction with TBP is not mechanistically relevant in our case. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the truncated RNF4 can form functional multimers with endogenous wild type RNF4 and thereby restore the ability to interact with TBP (RNF4 self-interacts). 2C. Lyngsø, Bouteiller, C. K. Damgaard, D. Ryom, S. Sanchez-Muñoz, P. L. Nørby, B. J. Bonven, and P. Jørgensen, unpublished observations. Some transcriptional coactivators can promote complex formation between transcription factors and DNA without entering a stable ternary complex. For instance, the coactivator Jab1 stabilizes complexes between c-Jun or JunD and the Ap1 site (46Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and MBF exerts a similar effect on BmFTZ-F1 (47Li F.Q. Ueda H. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3013-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, RNF4 causes both Sp1 (26Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and SPBP to bind their cognate DNA targets more strongly in vitro. This may contribute mechanistically to the stimulatory effect on transactivation. Like in the case of MBF and BmFTZ-F1, RNF4 promoted SPBP-SPRE complex formation occurred with recombinant proteins. The effect on Sp1 was only detectable in cell extracts (44Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), implying that additional factors may be required in this case. In vivo experiments reveal an additional difference, in that 20 amino acids at the extreme amino terminus of RNF4 are required for coactivation with Sp1 (44Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while they are dispensable for enhancement of SPBP-mediated transactivation.

This observation raises the possibility that TSP-1 helps to sequester TGF-β1 in platelet α granules and activates TGF-β1 once both proteins are secreted. Herein, we evaluated the level of active and latent TGF-β1 in the plasma and in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets from TSP-1 null and wild-type mice on two genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and 129Sv). The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/luciferase bioassay and an immunological assay were used to determine active and latent TGF-β1. No significant differences were observed in the levels of active and latent TGF-β1 in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets from TSP-1 null and wild-type mice. Active and latent TGF-β1 were significantly increased in the plasma and platelets of C57BL/6 mice as compared with 129Sv mice. In addition, there was an increase of plasma level of latent TGF-β1 in TSP-1 null mice as compared with wild-type mice on the C57BL/6 background but not on the 129Sv background. No active TGF-β1 was observed in the plasma of either TSP-1 null and wild-type mice. These data indicate that TSP-1 does not function as a chaperon for TGF-β1 during platelet production and does not activate significant quantities of secreted TGF-β1 despite a vast excess in the number of TSP-1 molecules as compared with TGF-β1 molecules. Because platelet releasates from TSP-1 null mice contain active TGF-β1, we suggest that other important mechanisms of physiological activation of TGF-β1 probably exist in platelets.

TGF-β1 is synthesized by cells in a latent form that must be activated to be recognized by cell-surface receptors and to trigger biological responses (2.Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Small latent TGF-β1 is a dimeric complex of ∼100 kDa, composed of two identical chains in which an amino-terminal 278 amino acid latency-associated peptide (LAP) is noncovalently associated with the carboxyl-terminal 112 amino acid active peptides (12.Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This latent complex is the product of a single gene. Prior to secretion, LAP is enzymatically cleaved from the active peptide, and the integrity and latency of the secreted complex are presumably maintained via electrostatic interactions (13.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Latent TGF-β1 can exist as a large complex in which it is associated with a latent TGF-β1-binding protein (LTBP). LTBP has features in common with extracellular matrix proteins and targets latent TGF-β1 to the matrix (2.Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The latency of TGF-β1 is dependent on the presence of LAP; the presence of LTBP is neither necessary nor sufficient for prevention of activation (14.Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K.

TSP-1-deficient mice are viable and exhibit subtle abnormalities in development (21.Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The adult mice exhibit increased inflammatory cell infiltrates and epithelial cell hyperplasia in the lungs, suggesting that TSP-1 is involved in normal lung homeostasis (21.Lawler J. Sunday M.

TSP-1 also activates TGF-β1 in cell culture assays when added to endothelial cells. The site in TSP-1 responsible for latent TGF-β1 activation has been localized to the type 1 repeats, especially the K412RFK415 sequence located between the first and second type 1 repeats of TSP-1 (16.Schultz-Cherry S.

The binding of TSP-1 to LAP appears to induce a conformational change that renders the TGF-β1 active. Mechanisms controlling conversion of the latent complex to the active state are key regulators of TGF-β1 activity. TSP-1 is the first activator of TGF-β1 shown to function in natural, untreated, nondiseased tissues in vivo (24.Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M.F. Lawler J. Hynes R.O.

Here, we evaluated and compared the level of active and latent TGF-β1 in the plasma and in platelet α granules of TSP-1 null and wild-type mice using the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/luciferase bioassay (25.Abe M.

We observed that (i) there is no active TGF-β1 in the plasma of both TSP-1 null and wild-type mice, (ii) there is an increase in the level of plasma latent TGF-β1 in TSP-1 null C57BL/6 mice compared with wild-type, and (iii) there is no significant difference in the level of active and latent TGF-β1 in platelets from TSP-1 null and wild-type mice. Despite the absence of TSP-1 in TSP-1 null mice, active TGF-β1 is observed in the platelet releasates. These data suggest that TSP-1 is not the only physiological activator of TGF-β1 in platelet α granules and that TSP-1 does not play a role of carrier for TGF-β1 during platelet biosynthesis. TSP-1 null animals were generated by homologous recombination in 129Sv-derived ES cells, as described previously (21.Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin. Blood was drawn by periorbital insertion of a heparinized capillary tube (∼1.5 cm in length). Blood from five to eight TSP-1 null and wild-type (C57BL/6 or 129Sv) mice was drawn into tubes containing acid-citrate dextrose and pooled separately. Platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation and washed in pH 6.5 buffer containing 0.102 m NaCl, 3.9 mm K2HPO4, 3.9 mmNa2HPO4, 22 mmNaH2PO4, and 5.5 mm glucose. The platelets were resuspended in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.14m NaCl, 5 mm glucose, and 2 mmCaCl2. The platelet counts were determined and platelet concentration was adjusted to 1.8 × 105platelets/μl. Platelets were activated with human thrombin (0.5 unit/ml; Sigma) for 3 min under constant stirring. Platelet aggregates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g, and the releasates of thrombin-stimulated platelets were collected and stored at −20 °C for further quantification of total and active TGF-β1 by both the TGF-β1 ELISA kit and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/luciferase bioassay (25.Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In other experiments, thrombin-activated platelets are treated with 10 mm EDTA for 10 min before the collection of the releasate of thrombin-stimulated platelets. Total and active TGF-β1 concentration in the plasma and in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets from TSP-1 null and wild-type mice were assayed by a sandwich TGF-β1 ELISA kit (Genzyme, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Plasma and supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets were thawed and divided into two pools. In the first pool, acid activation was required to convert latent to active TGF-β1 and to record detectable levels of total TGF-β1. By contrast, no acid activation is used in the second pool; the TGF-β1 levels in the samples are therefore representative of active TGF-β1 in the plasma or in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets. Plasma (10 μl) and supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets (50 μl) were added to sample diluent with or without 1n HCl for 60 min at 4 °C followed by neutralization with 1 n NaOH if samples were activated with HCl. Samples were plated on microtiter plates coated with anti-TGF-β1 antibody and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After vigorous washing, wells were incubated with a second biotin-conjugated anti-TGF-β1 antibody, and the peroxidase reaction was initiated. A standard curve was constructed using serial dilutions of human TGF-β1 (Genzyme) as standard. TGF-β1 levels in samples were compared with known standards and read as nanograms per milliliter. Total and active TGF-β1 concentration in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets from TSP-1 null and wild-type mice were assayed using the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/luciferase (PAI/L) assay, first described by Abeet al. (25.Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the ability of TGF-β1 to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs) transfected with a construct containing a truncated PAI-1 promoter fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transfected MLECs were a generous gift from Dr. D. B. Rifkin (New York University Medical Center). Cells were maintained in high glucose (4,500 mg/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 200 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulfate) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd., Nottingham, United Kingdom (UK)). Cells were cultured in a humid atmosphere at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and passaged maximally 30 times. As described above, the supernatants of thrombin-treated platelets were divided into two pools. This time, however, the first pool was diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% pyrogen-poor bovine serum albumin (Pierce & Warriner UK Ltd., Chester, UK) and heat-activated for 10 min at 80 °C. As before, the second pool remained untreated so as to measure the amount of active TGF-β1 present. MLECs were trypsinized and washed and the cell density adjusted to 1.6 × 105 cells/ml before plating 100 μl/well into a 96-well tissue culture plate (Falcon, Becton Dickenson, Oxford, UK). Cells were incubated for 3–4 h to allow for optimal attachment to the plastic. Following aspiration of the growth medium from the attached cells, 100 μl of the sample was added in triplicate. Cells and samples were then incubated for 14–16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following incubation, all wells were checked microscopically for cell viability before washing twice with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed using 100 μl/well of 1 × lysis buffer (Promega, Southampton, UK) and incubated with agitation at room temperature for 20 min. Forty-five microliters of the cell lysates were transferred to an opaque MicroliteTM 1 Microtiter® read plate (Dynex Technologies Ltd., West Sussex, UK). Lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using an MLX Luminometer (Dynex Technologies Ltd.) following the injection of 110 μl/well of substrate solution (20 mmtricine, 1.07 mmMg(CO)3Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 750 μm ATP, and 800 μm luciferin (Promega, Southampton, UK)). The flash of light obtained upon mixing the lysates with the substrate was recorded as relative light units. The mean values of the triplicates were then converted into concentrations of TGF-β1 in picograms per milliliter using a standard curve obtained with human recombinant TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the unpaired t test, considering p values <0.05 as significant. Since TGF-β1 binds to TSP-1 with high affinity (16.Schultz-Cherry S. Chen W. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TSP-1 may function as a carrier protein for TGF-β1. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the quantity of TGF-β1 that is secreted from wild-type and TSP-1 null platelets in response to thrombin. As shown in Fig. 1, the level of total TGF-β1 is equivalent in the supernatants from the wild-type and TSP-1 null platelets. We have confirmed this result by employing two different assays for TGF-β1 and two different strains of TSP-1 null mouse. In our hands, the bioassay consistently gives higher values than the TGF-β1 ELISA kit; however, the relative levels of active TGF-β1 as compared with total TGF-β1 are consistent between the two assays. TSP-1 reportedly binds to the platelet membrane after secretion when calcium is present (26.Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Prasanna H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11629-11632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β1 that is complexed with TSP-1 may also become associated with the platelet membrane. If this is the case, then the TGF-β1 levels that we measured in the supernatant of the thrombin-treated wild-type platelets may be anomalously low. To determine whether this is the case, we treated the platelets with 10 mm EDTA after thrombin treatment to remove the TSP-1 from the platelet membrane (Fig. 2). Treatment of the platelets with EDTA resulted in an increase in the level of TGF-β1 in the supernatants of both the wild-type and the TSP-1 null platelets (Fig. 2). Thus, while there appears to be a calcium-dependent mechanism for the association of TGF-β1 to the platelet membrane, it does not require TSP-1. It is known that LAP contains an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence that might function to localize latent cytokine to the cell surface by binding integrins (2.Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Grainger et al. (27.Grainger D. Wakefield L. Bethell H.W. Farndale R.W. Metcalfe J.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) reported indirect evidence that the RGD sequence in platelet-derived latent TGF-β1 may be recognized by platelet integrins. Like several other matrix proteins, human LTBP also contains an RGD sequence; however, there are no reports that this sequence serves as an integrin ligand (2.Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, LAP can remain associated with the TSP-1/TGF-β1 complex without inhibiting the activity of TSP-1-associated TGF-β1 (23.Ribeiro S.M.F. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we have found that the absence of TSP-1 has no effect on the level of active TGF-β1 in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets (Figs. 1 and 2). In the lung, pancreas, and liver, TSP-1 null mice exhibit pathologies that are similar to, although generally not as severe as, TGF-β1 null mice (21.Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24.Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M.F. Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Boivin G.P. Bouck N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The abnormalities include epithelial cell hyperplasia and focal inflammation. Treatment of the TSP-1 null mice with the TGF-β1-activating peptide KRFK normalizes these abnormalities in the lung and pancreas (24.Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M.F. Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Boivin G.P. Bouck N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of wild-type mice with a peptide (LSKL) that inhibits the ability of TSP-1 to activate TGF-β1 induces lung and pancreas pathologies similar to those seen in the TSP-1 null mice (24.Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M.F. Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Boivin G.P. Bouck N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). These data indicate that constitutive activation of TGF-β1 by TSP-1 contributes to epithelial homeostasis in some organs. It remains possible that TSP-1 is an important activator of TGF-β1 in platelets from wild-type mice and that an alternative pathway is up-regulated in the absence of TSP-1. Since active TGF-β1 is present in the supernatant of thrombin-treated TSP-1 null platelets, alternative mechanisms for TGF-β1 activation must be present in platelets. These mechanisms may involve the association of TGF-β1 with another protein that is present in the α-granules or shed from the platelet membrane after activation. Since the platelets are removed shortly after thrombin-treatment, it is unlikely that the activation of TGF-β1 is due to the release of a constituent of the lysosomal compartment. It is also unlikely that the amount of thrombin used or the duration of exposure to thrombin would be sufficient to activate significant levels of TGF-β1. In fact, human thrombin (0.1, 0.5 and 1 unit/ml) added to both serum and platelet releasate samples for 30 min did not increase the amount of active TGF-β1, as compared with non-thrombin-treated samples, demonstrating that thrombin was not responsible for the active TGF-β1 detected in our assays (data not shown). An alternative interpretation of the data is that TSP-1 is not a significant activator of TGF-β1 in platelets. In wild-type platelets, the majority of TGF-β1 is inactive despite a vast excess in the number of TSP-1 molecules as compared with TGF-β1 molecules (12.Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 28.Lawrence D.A. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). Since the type 1 repeats appear to be important for protein-protein interactions in general, it is possible that TGF-β1 binding to TSP-1 is inhibited by the presence of another protein. It is also possible that post-translational modifications of TSP-1 that occur in megakaryocytes inhibit TGF-β1 binding. The data clearly show that coexpression of TSP-1 and TGF-β1 does not necessarily mean that TGF-β1 will be activated via a TSP-1-dependent mechanism. Because TSP-1 and TGF-β1 are stored and secreted together from platelet α granules, and because active TGF-β1 has a short half-life, an independent spatial and temporal mechanism for regulating TGF-β1 activation may be necessary. This mechanism may not be active in epithelial cells because TGF-β1 and TSP-1 are constitutively secreted and a basal level of activated TGF-β1 is maintained. We also assayed the levels of TGF-β1 in the plasma of wild-type and TSP-1 null mice to determine whether there is a systemic increase in TGF-β1 levels that might compensate for the lack of a TSP-1-dependent activation mechanisms that exist in epithelial tissues (21.Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24.Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

A statistically significant (p < 0.01) increase in the total TGF-β1 was observed in the plasma of the TSP-1 null mice as compared with wild-type mice on the C57BL/6 background (Table I). By contrast, no difference was observed in the plasma levels of TGF-β1 in the TSP-1 null mice and the wild-type mice on the 129Sv background. No active TGF-β1 was found in the plasma of either TSP-1 null and wild-type mice. Free TGF-β1 can interact with and be inactivated by a number of soluble or matrix molecules, including α2-macroglobulin, decorin, betaglycan, and fucoidan (29.Lopez-Casillas T.A. Cheifetz S. Doody J.

Physiol. 1994; 159: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-β1 in plasma is found almost exclusively bound to α2-macroglobulin and presumably represents activated TGF-β1 that will be cleared by the liver (31.O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological mechanisms for the increase in the level of latent TGF-β1 in TSP-1 null C57BL/6 mice is currently unknown.Table IPlasma TGF-β 1 in C57BL/6 and 129Sv miceC57BL/6 mice129Sv miceTSP-1 +/+TSP-1 −/−TSP-1 +/+TSP-1 −/−Total TGF-β1Active TGF-β1Total TGF-β1Active TGF-β1Total TGF-β1Active TGF-β1Total TGF-β1Active TGF-β113.4 ± 1.7020 ± 3ap < 0.01.013 ± 2.2011.2 ± 1.30TGF-β1 levels in the plasma of C57BL/6 and 129Sv mice were determined by a TGF-β1 ELISA kit.

Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of two duplicate determinations of 22–23 separate experiments for C57BL/6 mice and 22–26 separate experiments for 129Sv mice. In this study, we have shown that the levels of latent and active TGF-β1 in the supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets are equivalent in the presence or absence of TSP-1. Thus, TSP-1 does not appear to function as a chaperon for TGF-β1 during platelet production. The lack of correlation between TSP-1 expression and the level of active TGF-β1 indicates that (i) the ability of TSP-1 to activate TGF-β1 is inhibited in wild-type mice and (ii) alternative mechanisms for activation of TGF-β1 are present in platelets. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying each of the observations will have important implications for the regulation of TGF-β1 activationin vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2051710708,"The α-factor pheromone receptor (<i>STE2</i>) activates a G protein signal pathway that induces conjugation of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Previous studies implicated the third intracellular loop of this receptor in G protein activation. Therefore, the roles of transmembrane domains five and six (TMD5 and -6) that bracket the third intracellular loop were analyzed by scanning mutagenesis in which each residue was substituted with cysteine. Out of 42 mutants examined, four constitutive mutants and two strong loss-of-function mutants were identified. Double mutants combining Cys substitutions in TMD5 and TMD6 gave a broader range of phenotypes. Interestingly, a V223C mutation in TMD5 caused constitutive activity when combined with the L247C, L248C, or S251C mutations in TMD6. Also, the L226C mutation in TMD5 caused constitutive activity when combined with either the M250C or S251C mutations in TMD6. The residues affected by these mutations are predicted to fall on one side of their respective helices, suggesting that they may interact. In support of this, cysteines substituted at position 223 in TMD5 and position 247 in TMD6 formed a disulfide bond, providing the first direct evidence of an interaction between these transmembrane domains in the α-factor receptor. Altogether, these results identify an important region of interaction between conserved hydrophobic regions at the base of TMD5 and TMD6 that is required for the proper regulation of receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2128073221,"Gene-specific silencing refers to a phenomenon in which expression of an individual gene can be specifically repressed by different mechanisms on the levels of transcription, RNA splicing, transport, degradation in nuclei or cytoplasm, or blocking of translation.

Several lines of evidence suggest that dsRNA1 is the effector molecule responsible for RNA-mediated silencing or co-suppression. dsRNA is formed by mRNA and antisense RNA, that corresponds to the non-coding strand of the same gene. However, in experiments onCaenorhabditis elegans it was demonstrated that injections of gel-purified antisense RNA corresponding to an abundant transcript is less active at producing interference than in vitroannealed dsRNA samples (1Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The purification was performed to remove the traces of dsRNA from in vitro synthesized RNA preparations because of the nonspecific activity of RNA polymerases.It was concluded that the observation of co-suppression and RNA interference uncovered the existence of a novel cellular mechanisms for regulation of gene expression (2Sharp P.A.

This suggests a evolutionary conservation of the physiological mechanisms involved.The mechanisms of RNAi remain largely unknown. It was concluded that RNAi and co-suppression work by an equivalent core mechanism produces decrease or elimination of a target mRNA transcript (2Sharp P.A.

In experiments on gene silencing (“quelling”) in Neurospora crassa it was shown that in the mutant defective in quelling the gene specifying RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was affected (5Cogoni C. Macino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10233-10238Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The genes involved in RNA degradation also could be connected with RNAi (12Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H.A. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It was considered that RNAi mechanisms might operate at the level of transcription and involve proteins of the polycomb complex (13Pal-Bhadra M.U. Bhadra U. Birchler J.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 479-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). But recently it was clearly demonstrated that this transcriptional cosuppression mechanism is distinct from RNAi and involve homology recognition at the DNA level (14Pal-Bhadra M.U. Bhadra U. Birchler J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The fact demonstrates that although the phenomenology of gene-specific silencing is similar in different taxa, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet understood.The physiological role of mechanisms leading to gene-specific silencing remains mysterious. Genes regulated by antisense transcripts were described in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, and some primitive eukaryotes (15Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). RNAi was not described in prokaryotes. However, antisense control is bacteria is now recognized as an efficient and specific means of gene (16Wagner E.G. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 714-742Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This control occurs at many levels, including premature transcription termination, facilitated RNA decay, and direct or indirect blocking of translation.We had previously reported that RNA molecules are capable of forming parallel RNA-RNA duplexes in vitro (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Yu. B. Chernov B.K. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dynam. 1995; 13: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To address the capacity of parallel double-stranded RNA to induce gene-specific silencing, we have used the construct expressing small RNA that is complementary in a parallel orientation (pRNA) to the endogenouslon mRNA in Escherichia coli cells. To our surprise, we found a potent and specific effect of interference on the expression of the gene. In vitro experiments with pRNA and corresponding sense RNA of the gene have revealed nuclease protection bands after annealing. Our results indicate that parallel double-stranded RNA might be formed in vivo and serve as effector for some mechanisms of gene regulation similarly to regular dsRNA.DISCUSSIONThe only possible explanation of the data on the gene-specific silencing observed in this study is the assumption that a parallel duplex could be formed between the lon mRNA and the parlon transcript. The transcripts coming from mirlon construct or pUC12 vector have two characteristics in common. They do not possess complementary nucleotide texts neither in antiparallel nor in parallel orientation with respect to the mRNA. Also, they do not induce gene-specific silencing. Although both parlon and mirlon RNAs potentially could form 8- or 9-bp long antiparallel stretches with the mRNA, only the parlon transcript demonstrates a potent silencing ability, while mirlon RNA produces no effect at all. Moreover, the antilon transcript can form much longer antiparallel duplex with thelon mRNA (about 340 bp), but reproducibly induces less prominent effect than parlon RNA.The assumption concerning a possibility that the parallel RNA duplex formation was independently confirmed by in vitro studies. Our data show that only after annealing the parlon transcript with the sense lon RNA could partial protection be observed. It was difficult to select the condition for S1 analysis, because in this particular case the interval in which the complete digestion of single-stranded parlon RNA on one hand, and incomplete digestion of protected regions on the other, is narrow. We believe, that this is a case when testing aimed to reveal an object could disrupt it at the same time. Obviously, this is due to a low stability of the duplex formed. However, using a similar in vitro approach recently, we observed clearly more stable and longer duplex formed between a pRNA and a corresponding Drosophila sense RNA. 2N. A. Tchurikov, N. G. Shostak, O. V. Okladnova, and B. K. Chernov, manuscript in preparation. There is one general argument in favor of the capability of RNA to shape a parallel duplex. It is known from the in vitro experiments that DNA molecules are physically capable of forming such structures (25Van de Sande J.H. Ramsing N.B. German M.W. Elhorst B.M. Kitzing E. Pon R.T. Cleg T.M.

Sci. 1988; 303: 1254-1258Google Scholar). There is evidence suggesting that versatile RNA molecules possess a higher plasticity (27Cech T.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 135: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This view on RNA is clearly consistent with our data obtained in vivo and in vitro.The first experimental data demonstrating the possibility of parallel RNA-RNA duplex formation at acidic pH were provided about 40 years ago (28Rich A. Davies D.R. Crick F.H.C. Watson J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the poly(A) duplex is stabilized by protonated symmetrical self-pairs formed by hydrogen bonds between N6 and N7. One more independent argument in favor of formation of parallel RNA duplexes came from EM observations of different viral molecules forming dimers in the physiological condition by joining their non-poly(A) sequences close to the 5′ ends (29Kung H.K. Hu S. Bender W. Baily J.M. Davidson N. Nicolson M.O. McAllister R.M. Cell. 1976; 7: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently the formation of parallel RNA duplexes between the molecules possessing alternating stretches of A and U bases was shownin vitro at neutral pH (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Yu. B. Chernov B.K. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dynam. 1995; 13: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The data suggest that these duplexes could be stabilized either by A-U bonds or A-A and U-U self-pairs, and that the symmetric A-A pair is formed by two hydrogen bonds between N1 and N6.The gene-specific silencing produced by expression of pRNA, described in this paper, strongly suggests that parallel RNA-RNA duplex also could serve as a potent and specific signal for similar factors and mechanisms as the regular dsRNA. It follows that exclusively the involvement of mRNA in any kind of duplex, antiparallel or parallel, is the effector of the interference. Independently the capability of pRNA to serve as a trigger for gene-specific silencing was observed in experiments on Drosophila Kruppelgene.2It was convincingly demonstrated in C. elegans andDrosophila that single stranded molecules of aRNA or sense RNA are substantially less effective at producing interference thanin vitro annealed and injected dsRNA. Clearly, sense RNA could induce the interference only if a preparation is contaminated with dsRNA (1Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, after injections of equal masses of dsRNA or purified aRNA corresponding to abundant mRNA, aRNA exhibits much lower interference than dsRNA. These data could be interpreted as a strong demonstration of the fact that the amount of dsRNA formed in vivo after injection of purified aRNA is low, and that annealing of 0.5–1 kilobase long RNA molecules in vivo is really hampered.Parallel duplexes are less stable and energetically more favorable for apparent regulatory cellular mechanisms then antiparallel ones (30Rippe K. Ramsing N.B. Klement R. Jovin T.M. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dynam. 1990; 7: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thereafter, parallel RNA duplexes could be considered as more probable candidates for physiological interference mechanisms. The data presented here suggest at least two reasons in favor of this conclusion. First, parallel RNA could be more potent in inducing gene-specific silencing. Also, unstable parallel RNA duplex could be readily formed under in vivo conditions. It cannot be excluded that the observed higher activity of parallel RNA at producing interference is due to a higher sensitivity of some cellular factors to parallel RNA duplex than to antiparallel one.Whatever mechanism of gene-specific silencing in E. coli is operating, it does not give rise to degradation of mRNA. This result was not expected essentially because mRNAs in prokaryotes exhibit short half-lives when compared with eukaryotic mRNAs (31Rauhat R. Klug G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 353-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that the block of translation plays a role in the interference described here. Our data are clearly consistent with the view of the important role of RNA duplexes for regulation of gene activity in prokaryotes (16Wagner E.G. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 714-742Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The data on the gradual fading of both types of gene-specific silencing observed by expression of the parlon or antilon RNAs suggest that common physiological mechanisms might be involved. We speculate that fading might reflect the existence of some mechanism of physiological adaptation that gradually switches off a gene silencing. The search of mutants resistant to the detected effect of pRNA and aRNA on thelon expression or to the fading effect, that we perform now, may answer some questions arisen by this study.The data presented in this study raise a question about the possible role of symmetrical sequences in the modulation of gene expression. The analysis of the nucleotide data bases revealed that in different genomes there are a lot of diverged sequences possessing this kind of symmetry (11Tchurikov N.A. Genetica. 1992; 87: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sequences are about 50 bp in length and possess up to 80% symmetric positions of the same bases. These data may indicate that transcripts from symmetric sequences (mirror inversions of nucleotide sequences) could potentially serve as molecules for regulation of gene expression by physiological mechanisms. In any case, the data presented here suggest that mirror inversions of nucleotide sequences do possess biological activity.AcknowlegmentsWe thank Prof. A. A. Krayevsky for discussions; Prof. G. P. Georgiev and Prof. V. A. Gvozdev for support and encouragement; N. A. Ponomarenko for help in preliminary experiments and K. S. Pustovoit for technical assistance. There has been dramatic recent progress in uncovering the gene-specific silencing in a number of organisms (1Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Bosher J.M. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E31-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that dsRNA1 is the effector molecule responsible for RNA-mediated silencing or co-suppression. dsRNA is formed by mRNA and antisense RNA, that corresponds to the non-coding strand of the same gene. However, in experiments onCaenorhabditis elegans it was demonstrated that injections of gel-purified antisense RNA corresponding to an abundant transcript is less active at producing interference than in vitroannealed dsRNA samples (1Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The purification was performed to remove the traces of dsRNA from in vitro synthesized RNA preparations because of the nonspecific activity of RNA polymerases. It was concluded that the observation of co-suppression and RNA interference uncovered the existence of a novel cellular mechanisms for regulation of gene expression (2Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 4Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kotas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar). The phenomenon has been described in fungi, protozoa, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (5Cogoni C. Macino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10233-10238Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests a evolutionary conservation of the physiological mechanisms involved. The mechanisms of RNAi remain largely unknown. It was concluded that RNAi and co-suppression work by an equivalent core mechanism produces decrease or elimination of a target mRNA transcript (2Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Bosher J.M. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E31-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Fire A. Xu S.

A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In experiments on gene silencing (“quelling”) in Neurospora crassa it was shown that in the mutant defective in quelling the gene specifying RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was affected (5Cogoni C. Macino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10233-10238Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The genes involved in RNA degradation also could be connected with RNAi (12Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H.A. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It was considered that RNAi mechanisms might operate at the level of transcription and involve proteins of the polycomb complex (13Pal-Bhadra M.U. Bhadra U. Birchler J.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 479-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). But recently it was clearly demonstrated that this transcriptional cosuppression mechanism is distinct from RNAi and involve homology recognition at the DNA level (14Pal-Bhadra M.U. Bhadra U. Birchler J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The fact demonstrates that although the phenomenology of gene-specific silencing is similar in different taxa, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet understood. The physiological role of mechanisms leading to gene-specific silencing remains mysterious. Genes regulated by antisense transcripts were described in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, and some primitive eukaryotes (15Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). RNAi was not described in prokaryotes. However, antisense control is bacteria is now recognized as an efficient and specific means of gene (16Wagner E.G. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 714-742Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This control occurs at many levels, including premature transcription termination, facilitated RNA decay, and direct or indirect blocking of translation. We had previously reported that RNA molecules are capable of forming parallel RNA-RNA duplexes in vitro (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Yu. B. Chernov B.K. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dynam. 1995; 13: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To address the capacity of parallel double-stranded RNA to induce gene-specific silencing, we have used the construct expressing small RNA that is complementary in a parallel orientation (pRNA) to the endogenouslon mRNA in Escherichia coli cells. To our surprise, we found a potent and specific effect of interference on the expression of the gene. In vitro experiments with pRNA and corresponding sense RNA of the gene have revealed nuclease protection bands after annealing. Our results indicate that parallel double-stranded RNA might be formed in vivo and serve as effector for some mechanisms of gene regulation similarly to regular dsRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2070775838,"Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) is a water channel protein that is selectively expressed in respiratory, salivary, and lacrimal tissues. In order to establish the tissue-specific transcriptional programs that underlie its lung- and salivary-specific expression, a 4.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment encompassing the 5′-flanking region of the rat AQP5 gene has been characterized in detail. A major transcription start site utilized in lung and salivary glands has been localized downstream of a TATAA-like motif. Transient transfection assays of –4.3- and –1.7-AQP5-luciferase constructs in AQP5-expressing lung (MLE-15) and salivary (Pa-4) cells and nonexpressing fibroblast (NIH3T3) and epithelial (HeLa) cells demonstrate preferential transcriptional enhancement of reporter activities in MLE-15 and Pa-4 cells. Transient transfection assays of a series of 5′ → 3′ deletion constructs of –4.3-AQP5-luciferase suggest that a common salivary and lung enhancer is located between nucleotides –274 and –139, and a lung-specific enhancer is located between nucleotides –894 and –710. There is one putative lung-specific repressor located in the region of nucleotides –1003/–894 and a common lung and salivary repressor located at nucleotides –503/–385. Moreover, 3′ → 5′ deletions up to –171 and –127 base pairs almost abolish transcriptional activation in salivary and lung cells, respectively. Together, our findings indicate that the combination of enhancer/repressor elements within the proximal 5′-flanking region of rat AQP5 gene dictates its restricted expression in both lung and salivary cells.

Within the distal lung, AQP5 is restricted to the apical surface of alveolar type I (AT1) cells and is not expressed in alveolar type II (AT2) cells, vascular endothelium, or interstitial cell types (11Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Funaki H. Yamamoto T. Koyama Y. Kondo D. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Kobayashi H. Sawaguchi S.

AQP5 expression in rat lung is developmentally regulated, first appearing just before birth, coincident with the appearance of morphologically recognizable AT1 cells, and continuing to increase through adulthood (4King L.S.

Its restricted spatial and temporal expression patterns have led to the suggestion by us and others that AQP5 transcription is coordinately regulated with AT1 cell differentiation (11Nielsen S.

However, the cis-active elements that are required for AQP5 cell- and tissue-specific expression and its mode of transcriptional control have not yet been characterized. The alveolar epithelium of the mammalian lung is composed of two highly specialized epithelial cell types, AT1 and AT2 cells, that differ markedly in their morphological appearances and presumed functional properties (15Kikkawa Y. Yoneda K. Smith F. Packard B. Suzuki K. Lab. Invest. 1975; 32: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Crystal R.G. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J.

The Lung: Scientific Foundations. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 535-542Google Scholar). AT2 cells have been extensively investigated with regard to their role in surfactant production (18Whitsett J.A. Glasser S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Kalina M. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that AT1 cells cover the majority of the alveolar surface of the lung and their presumptive importance for normal gas exchange, little is known of their biochemical or functional properties. The restricted expression of AQP5 in type I pneumocytes in distal lung (11Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with its ability to confer mercury-sensitive osmotic water permeability when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (7Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), implies a role for AQP5 in transepithelial water movement across the alveolar epithelium. A role for AQP5 in water transport in AT1 cells of the alveolar epithelium is further supported by the recent demonstration that immunoconcentrated populations of AT1 cells exhibit significantly higher mercury-sensitive osmotic permeability than AT2 cells (20Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Matthay M.A. Carter E.P. Allen L. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 17 (6): 2991Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). AT2 cells are believed to serve as the progenitors of AT1 cells for normal maintenance of the alveolar epithelium and during repair following injury (21Evans M.J. Cabral L.J. Stephens R.J. Freeman G. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1975; 22: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22Adamson I.Y.R. Bowden D.H. Lab. Invest. 1974; 30: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies also indicate that isolated AT2 cells in primary culture undergo a process of transdifferentiation toward an AT1 cell-like phenotype over time (23Diglio C.A. Kikkawa Y. Lab. Invest. 1977; 37: 622-631PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheek, J. M., Evans, M. J., and Crandall, E. D. (1989)184, 375–387Google Scholar, 25Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Gonzalez R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1992; 6: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The process of transdifferentiation appears to be reversible under certain culture conditions, with expression of AT2 and AT1 cell characteristics being reciprocally regulated (14Borok Z. Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Zhang X.-L. Zabski S.M. King L.S. Lee D.M. Agre P. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Shannon J.M. Jennings S.D.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L155-L164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional programs responsible for activation or repression of differentiation-related genes in AT2 and AT1 cells are little understood. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the molecular phenotype of AT1 cells and the regulatory processes that lead to distinct patterns of gene expression in AT1 cells in the adult have not been characterized. In the context of the role of AQP5 as a differentiation marker for AT1 cells and in conjunction with its putative role in water transport in AT1 cells, establishment of AQP5 transcriptional control mechanisms and characterization of itscis-elements that underlie its cell- and tissue-specific expression were undertaken. Frozen sections were prepared from unfixed, inflated rat lung, snap-frozen in isopentane at –150 °C, and embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound. 2–4-μm sections were briefly fixed in methanol at –20 °C and incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP5 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) antibody. Sections were then incubated with affinity-purified secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Labeled specimens were viewed with an Olympus BX-60 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Controls include substitution of normal rabbit serum. AT2 cells were isolated from adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by disaggregation with elastase (2.0–2.5 units/ml) (Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ) followed by panning on IgG-coated bacteriologic plates (30Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar, 31Borok Z. Danto S.I. Zabski S.M. Crandall E.D. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 99-104Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The enriched AT2 cells were resuspended in a defined serum-free medium and seeded onto tissue culture-treated polycarbonate (Nuclepore) filter cups (Transwell; Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of 1.0 × 106cells/cm2 as described previously (31Borok Z. Danto S.I. Zabski S.M. Crandall E.D. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 99-104Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. AT2 cell purity (>90%) was assessed by staining freshly isolated cells for lamellar bodies with tannic acid (32Mason R.J. Walker S.R. Shields B.A. Henson J.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 786-788PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability (>90%) was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion. Steady-state levels of AQP5 mRNA increase markedly as a function of time in cultured alveolar epithelial cells (14Borok Z. Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Zhang X.-L. Zabski S.M. King L.S. Lee D.M. Agre P. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the increase in AQP5 that accompanies the transition toward an AT1-like phenotype in vitro, mRNA stability was compared at early (day 3) and at later (day 6) times in culture. Actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) was added to alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) on day 3 or day 6 in culture, and total RNA was harvested at intervals up to 18 h (see below). At a concentration of 1 μg/ml, actinomycin D has been demonstrated to inhibit ∼90% of transcription (33Huang T.H. Ann D.K. Zhang Y.J. Chang A.T. Crabb J.W. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Levels of AQP5 mRNA as a function of time were analyzed by Northern analysis. RNA was isolated by the acid phenol-guanidinium-chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62735) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA (5 or 10 μg) were denatured with formaldehyde, size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed with an AQP5-specific cDNA probe (P. Agre, Baltimore, MD) or with PCR-generated probes that hybridize to discrete regions of theAQP5 5′-flanking region described below. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random-primer method using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blots were washed at high stringency (0.5× SSC (75 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% SDS at 55 °C) and visualized by autoradiography. Differences in RNA loading were normalized using a 24-mer oligonucleotide probe for 18 S rRNA end-labeled with [32P]ATP. Relative amounts of AQP5 mRNA were determined using scanning densitometry. A P1 plasmid rat genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) was screened by PCR using oligonucleotide primers (sense primer nucleotides –2 to +21 and antisense primer nucleotides +198 to +222 relative to the ATG start codon) in order to isolate genomic clones that overlap the 5′-end of the rat AQP5 cDNA (7Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Three genomic clones containing the expected 224-bp fragment were identified. Digestion of these clones and of rat genomic DNA with EcoRI,HindIII, PstI, and BamHI, followed by Southern blotting, yielded fragments of identical size that hybridized to a PCR-generated probe that encompasses the 5′-end of the cDNA. An ∼5-kb HindIII fragment from one clone was gel-purified, further digested with KpnI, and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for further characterization. The proximal 1.5 kbp of this fragment (which spans 164 bp of protein coding sequence and ∼1.4 kbp of 5′-flanking DNA) was manually sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using a combination of restriction digestion and nested deletions. Sequences were aligned and analyzed using McAlign and McVector 6.0 software (Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell, CA). A series of probes specific for contiguous and/or overlapping discrete regions of the 5′-end of the AQP5 cDNA and the adjacent proximal 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR using rat genomic DNA. The location of the oligonucleotide primer pairs used for amplification of each probe is included in Fig. 3 A. The site of initiation of mRNA transcription was first approximated by Northern analysis of lung RNA followed by hybridization with this series of probes. Based on the results of Northern analysis, an oligonucleotide primer complementary to nucleotides –60 to –82 (see Fig. 4 A) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to 30 μg of total rat lung or submandibular gland RNA at 65 °C for 16 h. The primer was extended with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 1 h. The extended products were analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. An accompanying sequencing ladder generated using the same oligonucleotide primer, and the original 4.5-kbp HindIII-KpnI fragment template was used to determine the terminal nucleotide of the extended products.Figure 4Structure of 5′-flanking region of rat AQP5 .

Whitsett, Cincinnati, OH), a mouse lung epithelial cell line derived from tumors in transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T-antigen under control of the human SP-C promoter, were cultivated in HITES medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 nm hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml human transferrin, 10 nmβ-estradiol, 5 μg/ml selenium, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Rat Pa-4 salivary cells (D. O. Quissell, Denver, CO) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1.1 μm hydrocortisone, 5 mm glutamine, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin monosulfate. HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. AnAQP5 genomic fragment extending to –4300 bp relative to the translation initiator ATG was subcloned into the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Orientation of the insert was verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. A series of progressive unidirectional 5′ → 3′AQP5-luciferase deletion constructs beginning at –1716 with an identical 3′-end (starting at –6 bp) was engineered using a combination of ExonucleaseIII (Erase-a-Base system; Promega) and Bal31 nuclease digestion. A series of 3′ → 5′ deletions of the 4300-bp AQP5-luciferase construct were similarly engineered in pGL2-Basic by ExonucleaseIIIdigestion. Transcriptional activation was analyzed in transient transfection assays in AQP5-expressing lung (MLE-15) and salivary (Pa-4) cell lines as well as AQP5-nonexpressing fibroblast (NIH3T3) and epithelial (HeLa) cell lines. Cells were co-transfected with a pRL-TK plasmid comprising herpes simplex virus TK promoter upstream ofRenilla luciferase cDNA to normalize for transfection efficiency. MLE-15 cells were transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Pa-4, HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected at 60–80% confluency and were incubated with DNA-lipid complexes (2 μg of total DNA) for 6 h. Cells were harvested after 48 h for measurement of luciferase activities by detection of luminescence using commercially available kits (Promega and Tropix, Bedford MA). Luciferase activity is normalized for transfection efficiency and expressed relative to that of pGL2-Basic. Data are expressed as the mean of at least three experiments (duplicate or triplicate samples) ± S.E. Statistical significance among data groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc comparisons based on modified Newman-Keuls tests. As shown in Fig. 1, AQP5 is abundantly expressed on the apical surface of AT1 cells of the alveolar epithelium. Phase and immunofluorescence images demonstrate linear staining of the majority of the surface of the alveolar epithelium corresponding to AT1 cells. In contrast, AQP5 protein was not detected in AT2 cells located at the corners of the alveoli, whereas the AT2 cell marker SP-A was clearly detected in these AQP5-negative cells (data not shown). As previously shown, freshly isolated AT2 cells express little or no AQP5 mRNA or protein (14Borok Z. Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Zhang X.-L. Zabski S.M. King L.S. Lee D.M. Agre P. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). AQP5 steady-state mRNA levels increase as a function of time in cultured alveolar epithelial cells, with the maximal increase occurring between days 3 and 5 (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the observed increase in AQP5 mRNA levels that occurs over time is regulated primarily at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level, the stability of AQP5 mRNA was compared on early and later days in culture. The reductions in AQP5 mRNA steady-state levels following exposure to actinomycin D for 18 h were approximately 60% and were not significantly different from each other on early (day 3) and later (day 6) days in culture (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2 B). Because the rate of degradation on day 3 (t 12 = 15.8 ± 2.4 h) was no greater than that on day 6 (t 12 = 15.4 ± 1.8 h), the increment in AQP5 mRNA on later days likely reflects an increase in the rate of transcription on later days in culture. A rat P1 plasmid library was screened by PCR using oligonucleotide primer pairs designed according to the published sequence of the most 5′-end of the rat AQP5 cDNA (7Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Three positive genomic clones were identified and analyzed by restriction digestion and Southern blotting. Based on the results of our Southern analyses, we concluded that rat AQP5 exists as a single copy gene and ruled out the possibility that an AQP5 pseudogene or a closely related AQP5 gene was cloned by our approach. Because all three positive clones harbored the same 5-kbp HindIII fragment, one clone was selected for further characterization. The transcription initiation site (TIS) of rat AQP5 gene was first mapped in AQP5-expressing lung cells by Northern analysis with a set of probes generated by PCR using combinations of primer pairs that span overlapping and/or contiguous regions of the 5′-end of the published rat cDNA sequence and the cloned proximal 5′-flanking region. Total lung RNA was hybridized with each of the four individually radiolabeled probes as shown in Fig.3 A. Both probes a and b yielded a comparable distinct signal corresponding to the published size of 1.6-kb for AQP5 mRNA, whereas probe c was weakly positive, and probe d was negative. The low signal obtained with probe c implies that only a small region of lung AQP5 mRNA was detected by this probe, indicating the putative TIS is located in the vicinity of the 3′-end of this probe. Primer extension localized a major TIS to –128 relative to the ATG within the sequence CCAGGT (Fig.3 B, designated * on the antisense strand) in both lung and salivary gland. In salivary gland, another extended product was reproducibly identified at approximately 150 bases further upstream from the above-identified TIS, suggesting the usage of an additional tissue-specific transcription initiation site. The intensity of the signal for this upstream TIS is relatively less than the product at –128 bp, indicating that the more proximal TIS is the major transcription initiation site in salivary gland in vivo. Through DNA sequence analyses and comparison with the published ratAQP5 sequence, the 3′-end of theHindIII-KpnI genomic fragment was determined to be identical to the first 164 bp of the rat AQP5 protein coding sequence and to extend an additional ∼4.3 kbp 5′-upstream of the previously identified AQP5 translator initiator, methionine. The nucleotide sequence of the proximal 1.4 kbp of AQP55′-flanking region is shown in Fig.4 A. A TATAA-like motif (TATAT) is located at –25 bp relative to the TIS identified at –128 bp in lung and salivary glands, consistent with the notion that transcriptional regulation of AQP5 mRNA is initiated via a TATA-dependent mechanism. The region upstream of this TATAA-like motif is extremely GC-rich, and the exact nature of this GC-rich region in regulating AQP5 expression remains to be determined. Interestingly, no potential TATA box or CCAAT consensus sequence is located immediately upstream of the distal TIS identified in salivary gland. Computer analysis using MatInspector (35Quant K.

The restriction map of the AQP55′-flanking region and the relative arrangement of the TATA-like motif and transcription initiation sites are schematically shown in Fig.4 B. The ability of rat AQP5 5′-flanking elements to direct expression in a cell- and/or tissue-specific fashion was further evaluated in several different epithelial and nonepithelial cell lines. Among five different lung epithelial cell lines (H441, H358, SV40T11, A549, and MLE-15) investigated for endogenous AQP5 mRNA expression, only MLE-15 cells were found to express measurable levels of AQP5 mRNA by Northern analysis (data not shown). MLE-15 cells were therefore used in transient transfection assays to delineate the location of the promoter/enhancer mediating lung-specific AQP5 expression. Rat Pa-4 cells, an immortalized parotid epithelial cell line that expresses abundant amounts of AQP5 mRNA (data not shown), were also used to elucidate transcriptional activation by transient transfection of AQP5 promoter-reporter constructs in salivary cells. As shown in Fig. 5, robust luciferase activities, 220- and 670-fold above that of promoterless pGL2-basic, were detected in transiently transfected AQP5-expressing lung and salivary cells, respectively, using an AQP5-luciferase construct that harbors AQP5 DNA spanning from –4300 to –6. In contrast, only modest activity, 7- and 18-fold above background, was detected in AQP5-nonexpressing NIH3T3 and HeLa cells, respectively. Moreover, the observed preferential transcriptional activation in Pa-4 and MLE-15 cells compared with HeLa and NIH3T3 cells is retained by an AQP5-luciferase construct deleted from the 5′-end to –1716 bp (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region encompasses regulatory elements that can confer preferential lung- and salivary-specific promoter activity. To delineate regions important for regulating AQP5 gene expression, a series of 5′ → 3′ deletion constructs starting at –1716 bp (Fig. 6, construct A) was analyzed by transient transfection assays in Pa-4 and MLE-15 cells. In MLE-15 cells, there was a drastic 90% decrease in normalized luciferase activity with 5′-deletion to –1003 (Fig. 6,construct A versus construct D), indicating the presence of a distal enhancer between –1716 and –1003 bp that may be involved in modulating AQP5 expression in lung cells. An increase in expression with 5′-deletion from –1003 to –894 (Fig. 6, construct D versus construct E) and from –503 to –385 (Fig. 6, construct G versus construct H) suggests the presence of putative repressor elements within these deleted fragments.

At class II FNR-dependent promoters, where the DNA site for FNR overlaps the −35 element, activating region 1 of FNR is proposed to interact with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α-subunit. Using a model class II FNR-dependent promoter, FF(−41.5), we have performed in vivo and in vitroexperiments to investigate the role of this interaction. Our results show that FNR, carrying substitutions in activating region 1, is compromised in its ability to promote open complex formation and thus to activate transcription. Abortive initiation assays were used to assess the contribution of activating region 1 of FNR to open complex formation. A new method for the purification of the FNR protein is also described.

RNA polymerase C-terminal domain of the α-subunit cAMP receptor protein activating region polymerase chain reaction Many bacterial gene regulatory proteins activate transcription by making direct contact with RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP).1 A large number of these activators contact RNAP via the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit (αCTD) (1Ebright R.H. Busby S.J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One of the best studied examples of this type of activator is the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein, CRP (reviewed in Refs. 2Busby S.J.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar and 3Kolb A. Busby S.J.W. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to glucose starvation, CRP is triggered by cAMP and activates transcription initiation at more than 100 different promoters. In its active form, CRP binds as a dimer to specific DNA sequences found at target promoters; the consensus site is a 22-base pair sequence that is organized as an 11-base pair inverted repeat. At CRP-dependent promoters, CRP activates transcription by making several direct contacts with RNAP. One of these contacts involves the interaction of a single surface-exposed β-turn of CRP (residues 156–164) with αCTD. This region in CRP is known as activating region 1 (AR1). The role of AR1 of CRP is to enhance open complex formation at target promoters simply by increasing the initial binding of RNAP (reviewed in Ref. 2Busby S.J.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The FNR protein is another global activator of gene expression inE. coli, which regulates transcription initiation in response to oxygen starvation (4Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 75: 399-428Crossref Google Scholar, 5Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes & Co. Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). FNR belongs to the same family of transcription factors as CRP, and the two proteins have related amino acid sequences (6Shaw D.J. Rice D.W. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the high resolution structure of the FNR protein has not been determined, several crystallographic structures for CRP have been solved (7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 8Schultz S. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 9Parkinson G. Wilson C. Gunasekera A. Ebright Y. Ebright R.H. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and sequence alignments suggest that FNR and CRP have similar three-dimensional structures (4Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 75: 399-428Crossref Google Scholar, 6Shaw D.J. Rice D.W. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Like CRP, FNR regulates transcription as a dimer and recognizes a 22-base pair binding sequence at target promoters. However, dimerization of FNR is triggered by the anaerobic acquisition of a [4Fe-4S]2+center in each FNR subunit (10Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By analogy to CRP, during transcription initiation at FNR-dependent promoters it is proposed that FNR interacts with the αCTD of RNAP. Genetic analysis suggests that the amino acid side chains involved in this interaction are located in three adjacent surface-exposed loops, residues 71–75, 116–121, and 184–192 (13Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These loops form an extended surface of FNR, also known as AR1, which is much larger than AR1 of CRP (although AR1 of FNR and CRP do overlap, the 184–192 loop of FNR is equivalent to the β-turn containing residues 156–164 in CRP). The key residues in AR1 of FNR, which are likely to provide the crucial side chains for the FNR-αCTD interaction, were identified as Thr118 and Ser187 (alanine substitutions at these positions reduce transcription activation by FNR) (13Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Most naturally occurring FNR-dependent promoters contain a DNA site for FNR that overlaps the −35 element (promoters organized in this way are known as class II promoters) (5Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes & Co. Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). Previous studies with class II FNR-dependent promoters showed that AR1 of FNR is functional on the upstream subunit of the FNR dimer, and thus it is this subunit that is thought to contact αCTD (14Wing H.J. Williams S.M. Busby S.J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to investigate the role of AR1 of FNR during transcription activation using in vitro approaches with the model class II FNR-dependent promoter, FF(-41.5)(described in Ref. 14Wing H.J. Williams S.M. Busby S.J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the FNR protein under aerobic conditions in vitro, the D154A variant of FNR (denoted FNR*) (15Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. The D154A substitution stabilizes FNR in its active dimeric form, thereby relieving the need for the [4Fe-4S]2+ center (16Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results show that, as for CRP, substitutions in AR1 of FNR cause clear defects in open complex formation. Kinetic analysis suggests that AR1 of FNR is involved in promoting isomerization from the transcriptionally inactive closed complex to the transcriptionally active open complex. pFNR T118A/S187A was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR with pFNR T118A as template DNA (13Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). pFNR derivatives encoding FNR*, FNR* T118A, FNR* S187A, and FNR* T118A/S187A were also constructed by PCR using pFNR, pFNR T118A, pFNR S187A, and pFNR T118A/S187A, respectively, as templates. PCR products from these reactions were cut with BamHI andHindIII, and the resulting fragments were cloned into purified BamHI-HindIII vector from pFNR. TheNcoI and BglII restriction sites, which were used to clone the different fnr derivatives into the pQE60 C-terminal His tag overexpression vector (supplied by QIAGEN), were created by PCR. The resulting DNA was cut with NcoI andBglII, and fragments were cloned into the purifiedNcoI-BglII vector from pQE60 so that thefnr gene and the C-terminal His tag were in frame. pFNR derivatives were transformed into competent JRG1728 Δlac Δfnr cells (17Spiro S. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) containing theFF(−41.5)::lacZ fusion carried by the plasmid, pRW50 (described in Ref. 18Lodge J. Fear J. Busby S.J.W. Gunasekaran P. Kamini N.-R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar). Transformants were grown either aerobically or anaerobically at 37 °C in L-broth supplemented with final concentrations of 0.4% (v/v) glucose, 80 μg/ml ampicillin, and 35 μg/ml tetracycline. β-Galactosidase levels were determined using the Miller protocol (19Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) to quantify transcription from the FF(−41.5) promoter. As a host background for the overexpression of the FNR* derivatives, the strain M15 (derived from E. coli K12; supplied by QIAGEN) carrying the plasmid pREP4 (derived from pACYC and encoding constitutively expressed LacI; supplied by QIAGEN) was used. Cells were transformed with pQE60 derivatives encoding different C-terminally His-tagged FNR* proteins, and transformants were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of L-broth with appropriate antibiotics until cultures reached an A 600 of 0.5–0.6. Overexpression of the His-tagged proteins was then induced by the addition of 0.1 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Cells were harvested, and pellets were sonicated in 10 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C (1 mg/ml lysozyme, 50 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.75 m NaNO3, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm benzamidine). Sonicates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the amount of each His-tagged FNR* derivative was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Supernatants were applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (supplied by QIAGEN) columns at 4 °C so that the binding capacity of the agarose (5–10 mg/ml) was exceeded (typical column volumes were 0.75–1.0 ml). Columns were then washed with 50 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.75 m NaNO3, 20 mmimidazole), and FNR* derivatives were eluted using elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.75 m NaNO3, 250 mmimidazole). Proteins were stored at 4 °C in elution buffer where they remained stable for up to 6 months. Iron-sulfur clusters were assembled in anaerobic samples of purified FNR* proteins as described previously (20Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S]2+ contents of the reconstituted proteins were monitored by scanning the reconstitution reactions between 240 and 900 nm. The spectra were typical of those obtained with wild-type FNR. When reconstitutions were judged to be complete, the absorbance at 420 nm was measured, and the [4Fe-4S] cluster content was calculated using E420 = 13,300m−1 cm−1 (20Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As the His-tagged FNR* preparations were found to be fully functional (see “Results” below), the hexa-His tag was not removed from the FNR* preparations used in this work. To measure FNR-dependent transcription initiation in vitrowe used the pSR plasmid described by Kolb et al. (21Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The test promoter, FF(−41.5), was cloned into this plasmid upstream of the λ oop terminator, so that transcripts initiating at FF(−41.5) would be a discrete length. The protocol used was based on that described in (22Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P. Busby S. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar): binding reactions (12 μl of final volume) contained 5 nm FF(−41.5)/pSR, 25 nm RNAP (supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 500 nm of each FNR derivative. Labeled RNA products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuant, v3.3. Footprinting studies were performed on32P-end-labeled PstI-HindIII fragments containing the FF(−41.5) promoter, using the protocols described in Ref. 23Savery, N., Belyaeva, T., and Busby, S. (1996) Essential Techniques: Gene Transcription (Docherty, K., ed.) pp. 1–5 and pp. 21–33, BIOS Scientific Publishers, OxfordGoogle Scholar. Each reaction contained a final concentration of 4 nm template DNA, 1.75 μmFNR* or FNR* derivative, and 250–500 nm RNAP (supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding buffer used in these reactions contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The RNAP concentration was lowered to 100–350 nm in the potassium permanganate footprints because of the sensitivity of this assay. Footprinting gels were calibrated with Maxam-Gilbert “A+G” sequencing reactions of the labeled fragments and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuant, v3.3. Template DNA was prepared by PCR amplification of the FF(−41.5) promoter. Binding reactions contained DNA, purified FNR* or mutant derivatives, ApU, and [α-32P]UTP in 15 μl of binding buffer (5% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). After preincubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were started by adding 10 μl of RNAP in binding buffer (this gave final reaction conditions of 2 nm template DNA, 350 nm FNR* derivative, 50–150 nm RNAP, 0.5 mm ApU, 50 μm UTP, and 0.75 μCi [α-32P]UTP). At regular time intervals, 2-μl samples were removed from the reactions and terminated by adding 3 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 80% (v/v) deionized formamide, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The reaction product, ApUpU, and unincorporated UTP were separated on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuant, v3.3 (as described in Ref. 24Busby S. Kolb A. Minchin S. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology: DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 397-411Google Scholar). The kinetic constants for transcription initiation atFF(−41.5) were calculated by measuring the rate of ApUpU production over a range of RNAP concentrations and by plotting the lag time (τ) of these reactions against the reciprocal of RNAP concentration. Template DNA was prepared by PCR amplification of the FF(−41.5) promoter. Binding reactions contained DNA, purified FNR* or mutant derivatives, and RNAP in 20 μl of binding buffer (5% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were preincubated at 37 °C to allow open complexes to form. After 30 min, open complexes were challenged with 10 μl of heparin (three concentrations were used to give final concentrations of 10, 80, or 150 μg/ml). At appropriate time intervals up to 70 min, 3-μl samples were removed from the challenged complexes and 3 μl of ApU and [α-32P]UTP were added (this gave final reaction conditions of 2 nm template DNA, 350 nm FNR* derivative, 100 nm RNAP, 0.5 mm ApU, 50 μm UTP, and 0.75 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). After incubation at 37 °C, 2 μl of each reaction was removed and added to 3 μl of stop buffer. The reaction product, ApUpU, and unincorporated UTP were separated on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuant, v3.3 (as described in Ref. 24Busby S. Kolb A. Minchin S. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology: DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 397-411Google Scholar). The fraction of the open complex remaining was calculated from the amount of ApUpU produced. The decay rate of this fraction was calculated for each heparin concentration, and the backward rate constants for isomerization (k −2) of FF(-41.5) in the presence of FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A were determined by extrapolating these data to a zero heparin concentration. The starting point of this work was the pFNR plasmid that encodes FNR. A derivative of pFNR, pFNR*, encoding FNR with the D154A substitution, known to confer FNR activity in the presence of oxygen (15Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was constructed. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of AR1 in transcription activation by FNR at class II promoters. Thus, three derivatives of pFNR* were constructed that encoded alanine substitutions at either or both of the key residues in AR1: pFNR* T118A, pFNR* S187A, and pFNR* T118A/S187A. To check that FNR* was able to function aerobically and to investigate the effects of the different AR1 substitutions when combined with D154A, transcription activation was measured in vivo at theFF(−41.5) promoter. TheFF(−41.5) promoter is an artificial class II FNR-dependent promoter that contains a consensus DNA site for FNR centered between 41 and 42 base pairs upstream of themelR transcript start site (i.e. at position −41.5). The Δlac Δfnr strain, JRG1728, carrying theFF(−41.5)::lacZ fusion in pRW50 (14Wing H.J. Williams S.M. Busby S.J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with the four different pFNR* derivatives. Levels of transcription from FF(−41.5) were determined by measuring β-galactosidase expression in cells that had been grown aerobically or anaerobically. The data in TableI show that, in the absence of FNR*, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, transcription from theFF(−41.5) promoter is very low. Expression fromFF(−41.5) is clearly activated by FNR* under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but FNR* variants carrying either or both of the alanine substitutions in AR1 are compromised in their ability to activate transcription. Thus, FNR* is able to activate transcription under aerobic conditions and activation is disrupted by the different AR1 substitutions. These data suggest that these FNR derivatives could be used in in vitro studies at theFF(−41.5) promoter.Table IIn vivo activity of FF(−41.5) with FNR* and different derivatives carrying alanine substitutions in AR1FNR derivativeβ-Galactosidase activitiesAerobicAnaerobicFNR*7404340FNR* S187A3603190FNR* T118A3302300FNR* T118A/S187A2501660No FNR50170The β-galactosidase activities (Miller units) were measured in JRG1728 transformants carrying FF(−41.5) in thelac expression vector, pRW50, and expressing different FNR* derivatives.

Open table in a new tab The β-galactosidase activities (Miller units) were measured in JRG1728 transformants carrying FF(−41.5) in thelac expression vector, pRW50, and expressing different FNR* derivatives. Cultures were grown either aerobically or anaerobically. Average values are shown for three independent assays; in each case the S.D. fell within 20% of the mean. To investigate the effects of substitutions in AR1 of FNR in vitro, His-tagged FNR*, FNR* T118A, FNR* S187A, and FNR* T118A/S187A were purified from cell lysates using nickel affinity chromatography. Typically, culture volumes of 100 ml yielded 300–400 mg of soluble protein, of which 20–25% was His-tagged FNR* protein. Affinity chromatography yielded 2–8 mg of the different His-tagged FNR* derivatives, and the protein preparations were estimated to be 90% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of the buffers used throughout this procedure contained 0.75m NaNO3, which was found to improve the solubility and stability of the FNR* proteins. After anaerobic reconstitution by the method of Green et al. (20Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), His-tagged FNR* and His-tagged FNR* T118A/S187A had optical spectra indistinguishable from those of unaltered FNR. Assuming that all the absorbance at 420 nm was because of the [4Fe-4S] form of FNR, the FNR molar extinction co-efficient (E 420 = 13,300m−1 cm−1) was used to calculate that our FNR preparations contained 0.95 clusters/FNR subunit. Exposure of the reconstituted proteins to air caused the loss of the broad absorbance around 420 nm, indicating that cluster disassembly had occurred. Therefore, the estimates of [4Fe-4S] content, the typical shape of the spectra, and the oxygen sensitivity of the clusters provide good evidence to suggest that neither the His tag nor the amino acid replacements in AR1 grossly distort the protein structure. Thus, these studies indicate that the impairment of transcription activation associated with the amino acid substitutions in AR1, observed both aerobically and anaerobically in vivo (Table I), is because of a defective AR1 rather than the failure to acquire a [4Fe-4S]2+ center. In vitrotranscription assays were used to investigate the effects of different substitutions in AR1 of FNR. Fig. 1 shows a typical result using the FF(−41.5) promoter cloned upstream of the λ oop terminator in a supercoiled plasmid, in the presence of purified RNAP and the different purified FNR* variants. Transcription initiation fromFF(−41.5) is clearly activated by FNR*. This activation is reduced by the different alanine substitutions in AR1, confirming the effects observed in vivo, and showing that substitutions in AR1 compromise the ability of FNR* to activate transcription at the FF(−41.5) promoter. To study open complex formation in the presence of FNR* or FNR* carrying substitutions in AR1, we used DNase I and potassium permanganate footprinting. Saturating amounts of FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A (350 nm in both cases) and a range of RNAP concentrations were used to form open complexes at theFF(−41.5) promoter. The DNase I footprints (Fig.2) show that, when either FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A is incubated with the promoter fragment alone, a region centered at position −41.5, relative to the transcription start point, is protected (lanes c and k). Thus both FNR* derivatives recognize and bind to the FNR target site. With FNR*, increasing concentrations of RNAP result in increasing protection of the promoter region both upstream and downstream of the FNR binding site (lanes d–i). Based on footprinting studies of CRP and RNAP at class II CRP-dependent promoters, the upstream protection can be attributed to the αCTD of RNAP (25Kolb A. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Lavigne M. Buckle M. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Footprints with FNR* T118A/S187A also show increasing protection with increasing RNAP concentrations (lanes l–q), although significantly less protection is seen in comparison to the footprints with FNR*. Interestingly, the pattern of protection of ternary complexes containing either FNR* or FNR* T118A/ S187A is the same. This is in contrast to the situation observed at class II CRP-dependent promoters, where substitutions in AR1 of CRP induce changes in the DNase I footprint in the region of the CRP-αCTD interface (26Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in the experiment described here, no protection is seen with RNAP alone, even at 500 nm(lane j), showing that RNAP alone cannot form stable complexes at the FF(−41.5) promoter. Potassium permanganate footprints show the appearance of bands because of unpaired thymine bases that result when the DNA duplex is unwound near the transcript start point during open complex formation. The results in Fig. 3 A show that, at FF(−41.5), bands because of oxidation of these thymine bases appear at positions +1, −2, −8, −9, and −11, with both FNR* (lanes c–h) and FNR* T118A/S187A (lanes j–o), as RNAP is added. However, as the RNAP concentration is increased, the intensity of the bands in lanes containing FNR* T118A/S187A is significantly lower than in the lanes containing FNR* (see Fig. 3 B). Note that thymine-sensitive bands are not seen with RNAP alone (lane i), implying that promoter opening is completely FNR-dependent. The in vitro footprint experiments at FF(−41.5) clearly show that fewer open complexes are formed in the presence of FNR* T118A/S187A than with FNR*. To investigate further the consequences of alterations in AR1, abortive initiation assays were used to attempt to measure the binding constant for RNAP (KB) and the forward rate constant for isomerization from the closed to open complex (k 2) during transcription activation by FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A at FF(−41.5). The rate of ApUpU production at FF(−41.5) was measured in the presence of FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A, and the resulting τ plots are shown in Fig. 4. Although our data are subject to large errors, we can conclude that the alanine substitutions in AR1 of FNR* cause a reduction in k 2. However, the errors involved in calculating KB are so large that no reliable comparison of KB values for FNR* and FNR* T118A/S187A can be made. The interpretation of abortive initiation experiments relies on the formation of stable open complexes. Thus, using heparin challenge experiments (as described in Ref. 27Cech C.L. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we have measured the stability of the FNR-dependent open complexes at FF(−41.5) by determining the backward rate constant for isomerization (k −2). To do this, open complexes were allowed to form in the presence of either FNR* or FNR* T118A/S187A. These open complexes were then challenged with a range of heparin concentrations. At different times after the challenge, the amount of open complex remaining was estimated by measuring ApUpU production following the addition of ApU and UTP. Thus, the decay of open complexes and hencek −2 could be calculated. The results in Fig.5 show that the values ofk −2 are negligible for both FNR* and FNR* T118A/S187A (more than 80-fold lower than k 2). This shows that open complexes formed in the presence of both FNR* and FNR* T118A/S187A are stable. This rules out the possibility that the substitutions in AR1 of FNR affect the stability of the open complex and validates the conclusions drawn from the τ plots (Fig. 4). Many bacterial transcription factors activate transcription by making direct contact with the αCTD of RNAP. For example, at CRP-dependent promoters the AR1-αCTD interaction helps to recruit RNAP to the promoter DNA (2Busby S.J.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that FNR also functions by interacting with αCTD and have identified Thr118 and Ser187 as the crucial side chains of the AR1 equivalent in FNR (13Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Wing H.J. Williams S.M. Busby S.J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have used in vitro studies to show that FNR carrying the T118A and S187A substitutions is indeed defective in transcription activation and is less able to promote the formation of open complexes. Using abortive initiation assays, we have assessed the role of AR1 of FNR. Although the large errors prevent an accurate estimation ofk 2 and KB, the results suggest that AR1 of FNR plays a role in the transition from a closed to an open complex (at least at the FF(−41.5) promoter). This is in contrast to the situation with CRP, where AR1 has been reported to function solely in the initial recruitment of RNAP to promoter DNA (2Busby S.J.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas both CRP and FNR function by interacting directly with αCTD, the consequences of these interactions appear to differ. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that FNR fails to recruit purified α in electromobility shift assays (data not shown), unlike CRP, which binds α cooperatively (28Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J.W. Savery N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the surface of FNR that is responsible for contacting αCTD is much larger than the equivalent surface of CRP (2Busby S.J.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 13Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine the individual contributions of the subregions of AR1 to the process of transcription activation.

https://openalex.org/W1966394734,"Abstract Interleukin (IL)-2, a critical cytokine with indispensable functions in regulating lymphoid homeostasis, induces the activation of several biochemical pathways. Precisely how these pathways are linked and how they relate to the biological action of IL-2 is incompletely understood. We previously identified SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain containing phosphatase 2) as an important intermediate in IL-2-dependent MAPK activation and showed its association with a 98-kDa phosphoprotein in response to IL-2. Here, we demonstrate that Gab2, a recently identified adapter molecule, is the major SHP-2 and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-associated 98-kDa protein in normal, IL-2-activated lymphocytes. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation of both Gab2 and SHP-2 is largely dependent upon tyrosine 338 of the IL-2 receptor β chain. Gab2 can be a substrate of all the three major classes of non-receptor tyrosine kinases associated with the IL-2R, but in terms of IL-2 signaling, JAK3 but not Lck or Syk is essential for Gab2 phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that only IL-2 and IL-15, but not other γc cytokines induce Gab2 phosphorylation; the ability to phosphorylate Gab2 correlates with Shc phosphorylation and ERK1/ERK2 activation. Finally, we also show that Gab2 levels are regulated by T cell activation, and resting T cells express little Gab2. Therefore, up-regulation and activation of Gab2 may be important in linking the IL-2 receptor to activation of MAPK and may be an important means of achieving specificity in cytokine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1990558409,"We have previously identified a point mutation (intervening sequence (IVS) 4: T → C) in the branchpoint consensus sequence of intron 4 of the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene in patients with fish-eye disease. To investigate the possible mechanisms responsible for the defective splicing, we made a series of mutations in the branchpoint sequence and expressed these mutants in HEK-293 cells followed by the analysis of pre-mRNA splicing using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as LCAT activity assay. The results reveal that 1) the mutation of the branchpoint adenosine to any other nucleotide completely abolishes splicing; 2) the insertion of a normal branch site into the intronic sequence of the natural (IVS4-22c) or the branchpoint (IVS4-20t) mutant completely restores splicing; 3) the natural mutation can be partially rescued by making a single nucleotide change (G → A) within the branchpoint consensus sequence; and 4) other single base changes, particularly around the branchpoint adenosine residue, significantly decrease the efficiency of splicing and thus enzyme activity. Surprisingly, the nucleotide transversion at the last position of the branchpoint sequence (i.e. IVS4-25a or -25g) results in a 2.7-fold increase in splicing efficiency. Therefore, these observations clearly establish the functional significance of the branchpoint sequence of intron 4 for the splicing of the human LCAT mRNA precursors."

Ghosh et al. (31Ghosh S. Wolan D. Adak S. Crane B.R. Kwon N.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

They claimed that aromatic stacking interactions influence the dimeric structure of the oxygenase domain of iNOS, the heme environment, and NO synthesis but are not essential for H4B binding and NO formation activity. In the present study, we have mutated the conserved aromatic amino acids Trp676, Trp678, Phe691, His692, and Tyr706 of full-length nNOS and studied the effects on the spectroscopic character, dimer formation, catalytic activity, and electron transfer rate from NADPH to the heme. We also generated mutants at Arg414, which forms hydrogen bonds between Tyr706 and Trp678. Mutation of these residues greatly reduced both the NO formation activity and the electron transfer rate from the reductase domain to the heme active site of nNOS, even if dimer dissociation caused by the mutations was not marked. We will discuss the role of these aromatic amino acids in catalysis and electron transfer in full-length nNOS. A polymerase chain reaction kit for site-directed mutagenesis was obtained from Takara Shuzo (Tokyo, Japan). H4B was purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and CaM-Sepharose were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). The cDNA for rat nNOS was kindly gifted from Dr. S. H. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). Site-directed mutagenesis were performed with the polymerase chain reaction-based strategy using a kit from Takara Shuzo. cDNA fragments containing wild type and the desired mutations were cloned into NdeI and XbaI sites of a vector, pCWori+, and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (32Roman L.J.

Full-length wild type and mutant nNOSs were purified using DEAE-TOYOPEARL, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, and calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatographies as described previously (34Sagami I. Shimizu T. J.

The purified and concentrated enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 μm H4B, 20 μm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. For the preparation of H4B-deficient enzyme,E. coli cells expressing the wild type and mutant enzymes were sonicated in the H4B-deficient buffer, and the enzymes were futher purified in the H4B-deficient buffer. Because H4B was deficient inE. coli cells, the enzymes prepared without addition of exogeneous H4B should be H4B-free. All purified full-length nNOSs were more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The concentration of nNOS was determined optically from the [CO-reduced] − [reduced] difference spectrum using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1 cm−1. This Δε value was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen method (34Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

To examine the dimer contents of the mutants, purified full-length NOSs were incubated with 1 mml-Arg and 0.1 mm H4B overnight at 4 °C and analyzed on a Superose 6 HR10/30 size exclusion chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mml-Arg, and connected to an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The molecular masses of the protein peaks were estimated relative to the molecular mass of standard proteins: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa). The rate of NO formation was determined from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, monitored at 401 nm using a methemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin extinction coefficient of 49 mm−1 cm−1 (2Feelisch, M., and Stamler, J. S. (eds) (1996) Methods in Nitric Oxide Research, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UKGoogle Scholar). The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10 μmoxyhemoglobin, 0.1 mm NADPH, 5 μm each of FAD and FMN, 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μmH4B, 20 μm DTT, and 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS in the presence or absence of 0.1 mml-Arg orN G-hydroxy-l-Arg. Cytochromec reductase activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1. The H2O2 generation rate was measured by the formation of ferric thiocyanate under similar conditions as described for the NO formation activity and NADPH oxidase activity but without catalase and superoxide dismutase. Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C by a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer maintained at 15 °C in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with an O2 concentration of less than 50 ppm. To ensure that the temperature of the solution was appropriate, the cell was incubated for 10 min prior to spectroscopic measurements. Titration experiments were repeated at least three times for each complex. Regression analyses were performed, and lines giving an optimum correlation coefficient were selected. Experimental errors were less than 10%. The crystal structure coordinates of bovine eNOS heme domain (28Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) was obtained through the World Wide Web from the Protein Data Bank. RasMac 2.6-ucb1.0 software was used to make a dimer interface structure of nNOS based on the eNOS structure. The mutants were expressed as full-length enzymes in 1 liter of culture of E. coli cells yielding 100–400 nmol. Purification of the mutants in the absence of H4B resulted in unstable enzymes. Therefore, all buffers used for enzyme preparation except for H4B-deficient enzyme preparation contained 5 μm H4B. The resting Fe(III) form of the W678L mutant had a Soret peak at 438 nm ascribed to the low spin type heme as shown in Fig. 3 A. The position of this peak did not move even after addition of 1 mml-Arg, in contrast to the wild type enzyme. This suggests that the substrate binding site was changed by the mutation in terms of the absorption spectral character. The Fe(II) heme-CO complex of the W678L mutant had a peak at 444 nm, and no absorption band at around 420 nm ascribable to the denatured form, P420. The pyridine hemochromogen spectrum of the W678L mutant was the same as that of the wild type enzyme, and the heme content was 0.7/subunit. The W676L and F691L mutants showed spectral characteristics similar to those of the W678L mutant (not shown). These results suggest that the heme in W676L, W678L, and F691L has the normal internal thiol-axial ligand from Cys415 and that the heme environment is well preserved after the mutations. However, the mutations might have led to very low binding affinities for l-Arg in terms of the optical absorption spectral change in the presence of 5 μm H4B. In contrast, the absorption spectra of the W678H (Fig. 2 B) and H692L, Y706L, and Y706F (not shown) mutants generated in the present study had broad Soret peaks around 400 nm, similar to the wild type (34Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Shimanuki T. Sato H. Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The addition of l-Arg to these mutants resulted in the shift of the Soret peak from 400 to 396 nm, suggesting that their l-Arg binding sites were not altered by the mutations. We next examined the catalytic activities of the mutants by monitoring NO formation, NADPH oxidation, and H2O2 formation rates (TableI). When l-Arg is used as the substrate, the NO formation rates of the W676L, W678L, and F691L mutants were less than 0.1 nmol/min/nmol heme. The rate of the W678H mutant was 17 nmol/min/nmol heme, which is 35% that of the wild type. The H692L mutant had a catalytic activity comparable with that of the wild type enzyme. The mutation of Tyr706 to Leu and Phe decreased the rate of NO formation down to 13 and 29% that of the wild type, respectively. WhenN G-hydroxy-l-Arg, the reaction intermediate, was used as the substrate, the W676L, W678L, and F691L mutants again did not show any detectable NO formation activity. The other mutants had slightly higher NO formation rates withN G-hydroxy-l-Arg compared with that with l-Arg, similar to that observed for the wild type enzyme. Thus, the mutations of aromatic residues in the dimer interface had similar effects on the NO formation with eitherl-Arg orN G-hydroxy-l-Arg.Table IKinetic parameters (nmol/min/nmol heme) of the full-length nNOS mutants in the H4B binding siteMutantsNO formation1-aDetermined at 25 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”NADPH oxidation1-aDetermined at 25 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”H2O2formation1-bDetermined at 25 °C under similar conditions for a except without catalase and superoxide dismutase.+l-Arg+ NHA+ l-Arg+ NHA+l-ArgWild type4851818013W676L<0.1<0.1192427W678L<0.1<0.1465338W678H1722937952F691L<0.1<0.111313983H692L394611813739Y706L69364317Y706F141638487Experiments were repeated at least three times, the averaged values are shown.

Open table in a new tab Experiments were repeated at least three times, the averaged values are shown. Experimental errors were less than 10%. To elucidate how the mutations in the H4B binding site couple electron transfer from NADPH to NO formation activity, we determined the NADPH oxidation rate during catalysis (Table I). The NADPH oxidation rate of the wild type corresponds well with the NO formation rate, indicating close coupling of NADPH consumption with NO formation. However, all the mutants had relatively high NADPH oxidation rates compared with NO formation rates. In these mutants, NO synthesis was not coupled well with NADPH consumption, and the electrons from NADPH appear to be used to generate H2O2 or H2O. In fact, for most of the mutants except for the Y706L and Y706F mutants, the H2O2 formation rates were larger than that of the wild type (Table I). This uncoupling of the electron transfer was more obvious for the W676L, W678L, and F691L mutants, where NO formation activities were undetectable. It is interesting to note that the NADPH oxidation rates with the F691L and H692L mutants were higher than those observed for the wild type enzyme. The cytochromec reductase activity of each mutant was essentially the same as that of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). To understand the electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme active site, we examined the heme reduction rate with NADPH under anaerobic conditions. TableII summarizes the rate of heme reduction with NADPH for all the mutants generated in this study. Fig. 4 shows the Soret absorption spectral changes of the W678L and W678H mutants in the presence of CO caused by addition of NADPH, upon which time-dependent Fe(II)-CO complex formation was monitored. The heme of the W678L mutant was very slowly reduced in the presence ofl-Arg and H4B, and only a small fraction of the Fe(II)-CO complex was observed even after 20 min of incubation with NADPH. The W678H mutant was quickly reduced similar to that of the wild type enzyme (1.2 min−1) under the same conditions. The heme reduction rates of the W676L and F691L mutants were less than 0.01 min−1. Note that complete removal of l-Arg and H4B from the full-length nNOS does not prevent electron transfer to the heme and the enzyme retains a significant heme reduction rate of 0.08 min−1 upon addition of excess NADPH. Thus, the very slow heme reduction rates observed for those Trp and Phe mutants are mostly due to the effects of the mutation but not to the low affinity ofl-Arg and H4B to the aromatic mutants. The mutation of His692 to Leu did not markedly change the heme reduction rate, in accordance with the effect on the NO formation activity. The removal of the hydroxyl group from Tyr706 did not affect the heme reduction rate with NADPH, even though the Y706F mutant had NO formation activity 40% that of the wild type enzyme.Table IIDimer formation, heme reduction rates, and H4B dependence of the full-length nNOS mutantsMutantsDimer formation2-aEstimated by gel filtration chromatography after o"

These FGF1transcripts can be detected in cultured cells as well as in normal and diseased tissues. These transcripts are differentially regulated in a cell-specific manner. To further delineate the biological function of multiple promoter usage by a single gene, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of these promoters by defined signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and cell survival. Here we show a specific association of two of the FGF1 promoters, 1C and 1D, with signaling cascades of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. A serum-response element, comprised of the Ets and CArG motifs, present in promoter 1D was shown to be the target of distinct signaling cascades; the Ets motif target of Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 regulation; and the CArG motif target of de novo protein synthesis-independent cascade. Ras and Rac1 also activated the FGF2 promoter. Further, the transcription factor Ets2 synergistically activated FGF1 gene, but not FGF2, in a Ras- and Rac1-dependent signaling pathway. In support of these conclusions high levels of intracellular FGF1 were detected in cells undergoing cytokinesis.

However, the FGF1 gene organization, spanning more than 100 kbp, as well as expression pattern of FGF1 transcripts, is indeed complex because of the existence of at least four 5′-untranslated exons (2Myers R.L.

High FGF1promoter 1B activity was detected in a glioblastoma cell line U1240MG with promoter construct extending up to nucleotide −540 from the transcription start site. This activity was attributed to a 23-bp cis-element (−489 to −467). A 37-kDa protein, designated p37brn, was found to associate within this sequence and postulated to positively regulate expression of FGF1.Btranscript in the brain (5Myers R.L Ray S.K. Eldridge R.

In this study, we have further dissected the signaling cascades involved in FGF1 gene regulation. Here we report molecular mechanisms that explain the differential regulation of these promoters, particularly promoters 1C and 1D, and further provide insight into the biological role of multiple FGF1 promoters. This analysis was performed using standard protocol (9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 2.9.1-2.9.6Google Scholar). Tissue and cells expressing variant FGF1 mRNAs were used,i.e. high levels of FGF1.A in human kidney and weak levels in human embryonic kidney 293, high levels of FGF1.B in U-1240 MG and FGF1.C and -1.D in saphenous vein smooth muscle cells and embryo lung fibroblast cells (M426; 2–4). Radiolabeled DNA probes specific for the 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D promoters were: 2.4-kbp EcoRI-EcoRI containing the 1A promoter, 0.89-kbp HindIII-XhoI containing the 1B promoter, 1.2-kbp BglII-BglII containing the 1C promoter, and 1.2-kbp EcoRI-BglII containing the 1D promoter. The 1A reporter was constructed by placing the 1A promoter region from −826 to +77 upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (pGL2-Basic vector, Promega Corp, Madison, WI). The FGF1B and -1C luciferase constructs have previously been described (5Myers R.L Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 66: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The previously described FGF1Dminigene (10Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. Genet. Anal. Biomol. Eng. 1996; 12: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was used as DNA template to polymerase chain reaction amplify the FGF1D promoter region −150 to +40, and including 9 bp of the exon 1 sequence. The primers used were vector primer T3 (5′-AAT TAA CCC TCA CTA AAG GG-3′) and gene specific primer HBGF d-1 (5′-CTT TCA AGA CCA GGT CTT AGC CCA A-3′) that overlapped the splice junction of exon −1D and exon 1 and included 16 nucleotides of exon -1D and 9 nucleotides of exon 1. The amplicon was gel-purified (Mermaid®, Bio 101) and ligated upstream of the luciferase gene in a ligation reaction with pGL2-Basic vector that had been initially digested with HindIII, filled-in with dNTPs and Klenow fragment, and subsequently processed to generate 3′-T-overhangs (11Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). This manipulation facilitated ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product, having 3′-A-overhangs, and further recreated the HindIII site. The reporter construct having the 1D fragment in the correct orientation was selected by diagnostic restriction enzyme digestions. The unwanted DNA sequences between the 1D fragment and multicloning site of the vector were removed by further digestion with XhoI and religation. DNA sequencing confirmed the authenticity of this construct. A 1.2-kbp EcoRI-BglII genomic DNA fragment containing the 1D promoter was linearized at EcoRV (present in the vector pBluescript KS(+) upstream of the EcoRI site) and then digested with NcoI to release a 900-bp fragment. This fragment was ligated to the −150 to +40 1D fragment in pGL2-Basic that had been digested with SmaI (present in the multicloning site, upstream of −150) and NcoI (present within the −150 to +40 region of 1D). This generated the −985 to +40 1D luciferase reporter. The −580 to +40 1D luciferase reporter construct was generated by digesting the 1.2-kbp EcoRI-BglII genomic DNA fragment containing the −1D promoter region with HpaI and NcoI (−545 to −82) to release a 460-bp fragment. The gel-purified fragment (Geneclean II, Bio 101) was ligated to the −150 to +40 1D fragment in pGL2-Basic digested with NheI (present in the multicloning site, upstream of −150), blunt-ended with dNTPs and Klenow fragment, and subsequently digested with NcoI (present with the −150 to +40 region). This construct was propagated in STBL2™ cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), as propagation in the routinely used Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) cells resulted in deletion in the plasmid DNA. Utilization of STBL2™, suitable for unstable DNA sequences (12Trinh T. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Focus. 1994; 16: 78-80Google Scholar, 13Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal.

The −545 to +40 construct was linearized at SacI (present in the multicloning region, upstream of HpaI, −545) and subsequently digested with BstXI (−339) or PstI (−277), treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs to generate blunt ends, gel-purified (Geneclean II, Bio 101), and ligated. Again, STBL2™ cells were used for transformation to obtain the correct constructs. The 1D wild type ETS consensus sequence 5′-GGA TG-3′ (−172 to −167) and CArG consensus sequence 5′-CCA AAT AAG G-3′ (−164 to −155) were mutated using the approach described by Deng and Nickoloff (13;CLONTECH). The primers used were: ETS-MUT 5′-TAG GGT TGG Gtt ccG TGT CCA AAT AAG GCT TGC TCG-3′, CArG-MUT 5′-GGT TGG GGG ATG TGT aaA Acg Aat tCT TGC TCG AGG 3-′ and selection primer 5′-GCA GCC ACT aGT AAC AGG ATT-3′. The lowercase letters denote the mutated nucleotides with the underlined sequence denoting an EcoRI site for CArG-MUT and an SpeI site for the selection primer. The single nucleotide change from guanosine to adenosine, converts an AlwNI restriction enzyme site, present once in the wild type pGL2-Basic vector sequence, to a SpeI site. This manipulation allowed enrichment and selection of the mutant clones by AlwNI restriction digestion. The CArG-MUT and ETS-MUT primers were also used in polymerase chain reactions with primer HBGF d-1 (described above), using −277 to +40 1D luciferase supercoiled DNA as template. The gel-purified (Mermaid®, Bio 101) amplicons were subsequently cloned into pGL2-Basic. This generated −182 ETS-MUT/CArG-WT 1D luciferase and -179 ETS-WT/CArG-MUT 1D luciferase constructs. The activated Rho proteins, including RhoA-V14, Rac1-V12, and Cdc42Hs-V12, were expressed via the EFplink vector that contains the human elongation factor 1α promoter (14Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase-expressing vector, used generally in transient transfections as an internal control, comprises the E. coli lacZ gene driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter (15Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). This construct is the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter driven by the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) basal promoter (−80 to +50; 24). This luciferase reporter construct contains five copies of the c-fos promoter region harboring the SRE, comprised of Ets and CArG elements ((5′-AGG ATG TCC ATA TTA GGA CAT CT-3′) pSRE-Luc, Stratagene). pF2.0CAT (−1800 to +179; 16) was digested with SalI, filled in with dNTPs and Klenow fragment, and then digested with XhoI. The FGF2 promoter fragment was ligated into pGL2-Basic digested with SmaI and XhoI. All plasmid DNA for transfections were prepared using Qiagen plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.). NIH/3T3 cells (2 × 105) were seeded on 60-mm plates and allowed to grow for at least 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed using 30 μl of liposomal transfer reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and DNA in a total volume of 200 μl (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). This mixture was allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature to facilitate stable complex formation between DNA and DOTAP. This was followed by transfer to the cells in 1.5 ml of culture medium containing 10% CS. After incubation at 37 °C for at least 20 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% serum. Cells were subsequently treated as follows. Cells were incubated for 34 h followed by a medium change. The fresh medium comprised of either 0.5% serum only, 10% serum only, 0.5% serum plus cycloheximide (10 μg/ml tissue culture grade in ethanol; Sigma), or 10% serum plus cycloheximide. After 12 h of incubation the medium was removed, cells were washed twice with fresh medium containing 0.5% serum only, followed by an additional incubation of 2 h in medium with 0.5% serum (cycloheximide-washout). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently harvested using lysis reagent (Promega). The reporter activity was determined using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, EG &G Berthold, Berthold Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The β-galactosidase activity of the internal control was measured using the same instrument using a chemiluminescent assay (Galacto-Light™, Tropix, Bedford, MA). Transfections were performed in duplicate or in triplicate, and the data were expressed as the ratio of reporter activity versusβ-galactosidase activity. One μg of pCH110 and 4 μg of reporter were used for all experiments. Sera from various companies, including Life Technologies, Inc., BioWhittaker, and Hyclone, were tested. HyClone Cosmic Calf™ serum gave the best results and was used in all subsequent experiments. Cells were incubated in 0.5% serum for a total of 48 h with a medium change once at 24 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were determined. For the Rho protein studies, 1 μg of pCH110, 4 μg of reporter, and 1 or 3 μg of EFRhoA-V14, Rac1-V12, and Cdc42Hs-V12 plasmids each, were co-transfected, and specific dose effects were noted. The truncated promoter constructs Ets WT/CArG MUT (−179 to +40), and Ets MUT/CArG WT (−183 to +40) showed a similar trend compared with the SRE mutations in the context of the (−985 to +40) construct. The expression plasmid EFplink was used to make up the total amount of DNA to 8 μg. Ras responsiveness was initially determined by looking at the difference in reporter activities without and with effector Ras (expression plasmid −/+ Ras gene, pHO6, and pHO6T1; 17). A positive control pRDO53 showed greater than 40-fold Ras responsiveness, whereas the FGF1C and -1D promoters each showed ∼14-fold Ras responsiveness. The FGF1A and -1Bpromoters showed a nonspecific response of 3.5 and 3.1, respectively, which was comparable to the promoter-less vector, pGL2-Basic. Subsequently, the Ras responsiveness was re-examined by titrating the Ras expression plasmid (pDCRRasV12; 18), with similar results. Expression plasmids (0.125 or 0.5 μg) with cDNAs encoding RasV12, RasV12C40, or RasV12S35 were used along with 1 μg of HSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid and 4 μg of reporter plasmid. The expression plasmid pDCR was used to make up the total amount of DNA to 6 μg. Cells were incubated in 0.5% serum for a total of 48 h with a medium change once at 24 h. Ras responsiveness (pDCRRasV12, 0.5 μg) of luciferase reporters (4 μg) was examined in the presence of wild type Mek1 (Mek WT, 0.5 μg; 19) or constitutively active dominant negative Mek1 (Mek MUT, 0.5 μg; 19). HSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid (1 μg) was used in all experiments. Also, the effect of dominant inhibitory Rac1 (Rac1 N17, 0.5 μg; 20) was tested in the presence of Ras. The Mek MUT gave a specific dose effect (inhibitory) when tested with 0.125 and 0.5 μg of expression plasmid, whereas Rac1 N17 showed no such effect. The expression plasmids for Ras (pDCR), Mek1 (pcDNA3), and Rac1 N17 (pEXV MYC) served as controls and were also used to adjust the total amount of DNA to 6 μg. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were determined. Cells were incubated in 0.5% serum for a total of 48 h with medium change once at 24 h. Luciferase reporter constructs (4 μg each) were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of expression plasmid for Ets2 or PEA3 transcription factors (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 6 or 7 μg with empty expression plasmid. The amounts of activated GTPases indicated above showed submaximal promoter responses, which was further increased specifically for FGF1 promoters 1C and 1D by Ets2. The effect of Ets transcription factors on luciferase reporters was also tested in the absence of activated GTPases (4-μg reporter plasmid, 1-μg HSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, expression plasmid for Ets2 or PEA3 (0 μg or 0.5 μg), and pCGN (1.0 μg or 0.5 μg)). Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were determined. For all transfection experiments, at least two independent experiments in duplicate or triplicate were performed. NIH/3T3 cells were synchronized using serum starvation as described previously (23Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 89-96Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on 8-chamber slides at a density of 5 × 103/chamber, and allowed to grow for four days to confluence. On day 5, confluent cells were starved with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% CS for two days. CS was added to a final concentration of 20% on day 7. At indicated intervals after serum stimulation (0, 2, 6, 16, and 24 h), cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone for 2 min and prepared for immunohistochemistry. The slides were treated with 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase followed by phosphate-buffered saline rinses (3 × 5 min). The cells were then incubated in blocking sera for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in anti-FGF1 (R&D, 1:50 dilution) antibody followed by phosphate-buffered saline rinses (3 × 5 min). After incubation with secondary antibody at room temperature for 45 min and phosphate-buffered saline rinses (3 × 5 min), the cells were reacted with the ABC reagent for 45 min at room temperature. The color reaction was performed using AEC chromagen (Vector Labs), and the cells were counterstained with hematoxylin. For each time point, the numbers of FGF1 positive and negative cells during the cytokinesis phase of mitosis were scored by counting five separate fields at 400× magnification. Each field contains ∼400–500 cells. The percentages of FGF1 positive cells as well as the total number of mitotic cells at each time point were thus determined. To rule out the possibility of gene reorganization as a potential mechanism for cell-specific expression and regulation, the critical regulatory regions were examined by Southern blot analysis using probes specific for each of the four FGF1 promoters (Fig. 1). The analysis was performed on genomic DNA from tissues and cells expressing variant FGF1 transcripts. No rearrangement was noted in any of the genomic DNA analyzed (Fig. 1). A polymorphism was noted in the promoter 1D region in DNA isolated from smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1). These data suggested that deletion or rearrangement of regulatory regions, as seen in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, was not the mechanism of regulation. These data further suggested that the differential regulation of FGF1 mRNAs was probably because of cell-specific transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, we pursued our previous observation of FGF1.DmRNA superinduction by serum in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide noted in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (4Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 999-1013PubMed Google Scholar). This superinduction was reminiscent of a phenomenon previously reported for c-fos and γ-actin and was mediated via a cis element identified as the CArG box, also known as the core element of the SRE (24Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Crutchfield III, C.E. Getz M.J. Nature. 1989; 340: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The functionality of promoter 1D was measured using luciferase reporter activity in transient transfection assays. In comparison to FGF1 promoters 1A, 1B, and 1C, promoter 1D was uniquely superinduced and behaved similarly to the endogenous gene (Fig. 2, CS/cycloheximide versus Starved and CS). Furthermore, heat inactivation of serum at 56 °C for 30 min and repeated freezing-thawing of serum stocks dramatically affected the extent of this inducibility (data not shown). The data showed that (i) cycloheximide alone was not the inducing agent, and (ii) cycloheximide inducibility may depend on serum component(s) that are heat labile. Altogether, these observations supported the notion of a transcriptional enhancement of promoter 1D activity with serum in the presence of cycloheximide via a signaling pathway activated by serum component(s) and independent of de novo protein synthesis. Because CS was unable to superinduce promoter 1D, negative factors likely were involved in promoter 1D expression. That these factors were labile was demonstrated by the induction of 1D by cycloheximide alone. Thus, the combination of CS and cycloheximide elicits the phenomenon of superinduction.Figure 2Cycloheximide inducibility of FGF1promoters. Four FGF1 promoters (1A (−826 to +77), 1B (−831 to +31), 1C (−786 to +88), and 1D (−985 to +40)) and HSV-TK basal promoter (TK, −80 to +50) driving the luciferase reporter gene were individually tested using transient transfections. The promoterless pGL2-Basic (pGL2) vector was also used as a control for background activity. The average of triplicate sets with standard error is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the promoter 1D cycloheximide inducible element, reporter constructs with various 5′-truncations were tested in transient transfections. These experiments narrowed down the element to nucleotides −277 and −150, as reflected by a decrease in promoter inducibility by 43% (Fig.3 A). Sequence analysis of promoter 1D revealed a putative SRE comprising a CArG element between −164 and −155, along with an adjacent Ets element between −172 and −167. Thus, the SRE was a good candidate for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis of the SRE was based on previously described contact points of Ets serum response factors with the c-fosSRE (25Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of the CArG element, but not the adjacent Ets site, significantly attenuated (up to 74%) the serum/cycloheximide effect giving activity comparable to the −150 promoter construct (Fig.3). Thus, a signaling pathway independent of de novo protein synthesis was activated by serum component(s) and was linked to FGF promoter 1D via the CArG box component of a serum response element. Consequently, cycloheximide alone leads to increased promoter activity (see Fig. 2, 1D, cycloheximide versus Starved). The CArG element plays an important role in transcription in several muscle-specific promoters (25Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). To test the function of FGF1promoter 1D CArG element in muscle-specific expression, we tested the activity of FGF1 promoter 1D in proliferating myoblasts. The results indicated that promoter 1D was indeed active in this cell type. Promoter 1D mutants showed that the SRE played a significant role in promoter activity, with the CArG element displaying a more significant role than the adjacent Ets site; compared with wild type, there was a 79% drop in promoter activity with CArG MUT/Ets WT versus a 34% drop for Ets MUT/CArG WT. Altogether, these data suggested that the SRE played a crucial role in regulating promoter 1D activity. To further elucidate the signaling circuit for promoter 1D regulation, the involvement of Rho family GTPases was examined. The rationale for this study was based on a report that showed the c-fos SRE was the nuclear target of regulation by Rho family GTPases Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (14Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). These activated small GTPases, along with Ras, were tested in transient co-transfections. The results showed that Rac1 and Cdc42 were involved in the regulation of two FGF1 promoters; Rac1 and Cdc42 activated 1D expression, whereas Rac1 activated 1C (Fig.4 A). Rac1 also activated the FGF2 promoter (Fig. 4 C). The c-fos SRE (five tandem copies) was used as a positive control and showed response to Rac1, Cdc42, and a modest response to RhoA (Fig. 4 C). This response to RhoA was not observed for any FGF1 promoter nor for the FGF2 promoter (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the c-fos SRE in the context of its own promoter showed only a weak response to activated GTPases (Fig. 4 D). The result underscores the robustness of the FGF1 and FGF2promoter responses. Further, Ras was involved in regulation of both promoters 1D and 1C, as well as the FGF2 promoter (Fig.5 A). We also examined the bladder carcinoma cell line J82 overexpressing oncogenic Ras (stable transfections). The results showed a 3–4-fold increase in steady state levels of FGF1.D mRNA compared with control; another bladder carcinoma cell line EJ also expressed detectable levels of 1D mRNA as determined by RNase protection assays (data not shown). High levels of FGF1.C mRNA were not detected in these cells, which is consistent with the kinetics of expression of this transcript, i.e. acute versus transient (4Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 999-1013PubMed Google Scholar). These results supported the involvement of Ras in FGF gene expression. Further analysis revealed that the nuclear target of promoter 1D regulation by Rac1, Cdc42, and Ras was the Ets site, which was indispensable for this signaling (Fig. 4 B and5 B). Notably, compared with the WT, CArG MUT response to Cdc42 and Ras was diminished by 33 and 27%, respectively.Figure 5Involvement of Ras protein in FGF1gene regulation. A, luciferase reporter constructs included FGF1 promoters 1A (−826 to +77), 1B (−540 to +31), Δ1C (−786 to +88), 1C (-1601 to +88), 1D (-985 to +40), and FGF2 (−1800 to +179).

https://openalex.org/W2157946671,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the apoptotic machinery is composed of four basic elements: the caspase CED-3, the Apaf-1 homologue CED-4, and the Bcl-2 family members CED-9 and EGL-1. Theced-9(n1950) gain-of-function mutation prevents most, if not all, somatic cell deaths in C. elegans. It encodes a CED-9 protein with a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at position 169, which is located within the highly conserved Bcl-2 homology 1 domain. We performed biochemical analyses with the CED-9G169E protein to gain insight into the mechanism of programmed cell death. We find that CED-9G169E retains the ability to bind both EGL-1 and CED-4, although its affinity for EGL-1 is reduced. In contrast to the behavior of wild-type CED-9, the interaction between CED-9G169E and CED-4 is not disrupted by expression of EGL-1. Furthermore, CED-4 and CED-9G169E co-localizes with EGL-1 to the mitochondria in mammalian cells, and expression of EGL-1 does not induce translocation of CED-4 to the cytosol. Finally, the ability of EGL-1 to promote apoptosis is impaired by the replacement of wild-type CED-9 with CED-9G169E, and this effect is correlated with the inability of EGL-1 to induce the displacement of CED-4 from the CED-9·CED-4 complex. These studies suggest that the release of CED-4 from the CED-9·CED-4 complex is a necessary step for induction of programmed cell death in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1981338735,"Abstract LytA amidase breaks down theN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Its polypeptide chain has two modules: the NH2-terminal module, responsible for the catalytic activity, and the COOH-terminal module, constructed by six tandem repeats of 20 or 21 amino acids (p1–p6) and a short COOH-terminal tail. The polypeptide chain must contain at least four repeats to efficiently anchor the autolysin to the choline residues of the cell wall. Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency decreases by 90% upon deletion of the final tail. The structural implications of deleting step by step the two last (p5 and p6) repeats and the final COOH-tail and their effects on choline-amidase interactions have been examined by comparing four truncated mutants with LytA amidase by means of different techniques. Removal of this region has minor effects on secondary structure content but significantly affects the stability of native conformations. The last 11 amino acids and the p5repeat stabilize the COOH-terminal module; each increases the module transition temperature by about 6 °C. Moreover, the p5motif also seems to participate, in a choline-dependent way, in the stabilization of the NH2-terminal module. The effects of choline binding on the thermal stability profile of the mutant lacking the p5 repeat might reflect a cooperative pathway providing molecular communication between the choline-binding module and the NH2-terminal region. The three sequence motives favor the choline-amidase interaction, but the tail is an essential factor in the monomer ↔ dimer self-association equilibrium of LytA and its regulation by choline. The final tail is required for preferential interaction of choline with LytA dimers and for the existence of different sets of choline-binding sites. Thep6 repeat scarcely affects the amidase stability but could provide the proper three-dimensional orientation of the final tail."
https://openalex.org/W1980471149,"Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a member of the CXC chemokine family, is the only chemokine to bind to the receptor CXCR4. This receptor is also a co-receptor for syncytia-inducing forms of HIV in CD4+ cells. In addition, SDF-1 is responsible for attracting mature lymphocytes to the bone marrow and can therefore contribute to host versusgraft rejection in bone marrow transplantation. Clearly, by manipulating SDF-1 activity, we could find a possible anti-viral AIDS treatment and aid in bone marrow transplantation. SDF-1 binds to CXCR4 primarily via the N terminus, which appears flexible in the recently determined three-dimensional structure of SDF-1. Strikingly, short N-terminal SDF-1 peptides have been shown to have significant SDF-1 activity. By using NMR, we have determined the major conformation of the N terminus of SDF-1 in a 17-mer (residues 1–17 of SDF-1) and a 9-mer dimer (residues 1–9 of SDF-1 linked by a disulfide bond at residue 9). Residues 5–8 and 11–14 form similar structures that can be characterized as a β-turn of the β-αR type. These structural motifs are likely to be interconverting with other states, but the major conformation may be important for recognition in receptor binding. These results suggest for the first time that there may be a link between structuring of short N-terminal chemokine peptides and their ability to activate their receptor. These studies will act as a starting point for synthesizing non-peptide analogs that act as CXCR4 antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1983458444,"In HepG2 cells, inhibition of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum by an microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor (CP-10447) in the presence ofN-acetyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, a proteasomal inhibitor, results in accumulation of newly synthesized apoB in the translocation channel. Here we demonstrated that such accumulation led to a specific reduction of apoB synthesis. ApoB mRNA levels remained unchanged, but we observed reduced rates of elongation of nascent apoB in puromycin-synchronized cells pretreated with MTP inhibitor. This observation was consistent with a longer half-ribosome transit time for the synthesis of apoB in MTP-inhibited cells. Initiation of translation of apoB mRNA was not impaired by MTP inhibition. Overall, these findings suggest that translocation arrest of apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum channel can exert a selective and negative effect on the synthesis of apoB at the stage of elongation."
