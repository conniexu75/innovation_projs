https://openalex.org/W2059910556,"Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the human retrovirus associated with AIDS in West Africa, HIV-2, shows that it is evolutionarily distant from the previously characterized HIV-1. We suggest that these viruses existed long before the current AIDS epidemics. Their biological properties are conserved in spite of limited sequence homology; this may help the determination of the structure-function relationships of the different viral elements."
https://openalex.org/W1966683022,"We have derived and mated separate strains of transgenic mice that carry either the v-Ha-ras or the c-myc gene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter/enhancer. Mice carrying the MMTV/v-Ha-ras transgene manifest two distinct disturbances of cell growth. The first, a benign hyperplasia of the Harderian lacrimal gland, is diffuse, involves the entire gland, and likely requires only the abnormal action of the v-Ha-ras gene. The second involves the focal development of malignancies of mammary, salivary, and lymphoid tissue and likely requires additional somatic events. When the MMTV/v-Ha-ras and MMTV/c-myc strains are crossed to yield hybrid mice, their joint action results in a dramatic and synergistic acceleration of tumor formation. Since these tumors arise stochastically and are apparently monoclonal in origin, additional somatic events appear necessary for their full malignant progression, even in the presence of activated v-Ha-ras and c-myc transgenes."

https://openalex.org/W2084278833,"We have developed a cell-free system for studying the integration of retroviral DNA. In our assay, amber mutations in a bacteriophage λ genome that serves as the target for integration are suppressed by integration of an MLV derivative that carries the E. coli supF gene. The structure of the reaction products is that expected from an authentic MLV integration reaction. Linear viral DNA from the cytoplasm of infected cells serves as a precursor, though not necessarily the immediate precursor, to the provirus integrated in vitro. The viral DNA in the infected cell appears to be tightly associated with the enzymatic machinery required for its integration. Supercoiling, chromatin structure, transcription, and replication are not required of the target DNA. Since no high-energy cofactor is necessary, the DNA breakage and joining steps in the integration reaction are probably coupled."

https://openalex.org/W2025615787,"The development of Wilms' tumor, a pediatric nephroblastoma, has been associated with a deletion in the p13 region of chromosome 11. The structure and function or functions of this deleted genetic material are unknown. The role of this deletion in the process of malignant transformation was investigated by introducing a normal human chromosome 11 into a Wilms' tumor cell line by means of the microcell transfer technique. These variant cells, derived by microcell hybridization, expressed similar transformed traits in culture as the parental cell line. Furthermore, expression of several proto-oncogenes by the parental cells was unaffected by the introduction of this chromosome. However, the ability of these cells to form tumors in nude mice was completely suppressed. Transfer of other chromosomes, namely X and 13, had no effect on the tumorigenicity of the Wilms' tumor cells. These studies provide support for the existence of genetic information on chromosome 11 which can control the malignant expression of Wilms' tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071618223,"We have characterized 170 kb of DNA around the human α-globin gene cluster to enable a systematic analysis of 12 naturally occurring deletions from this region. In 8 deletions, the 3′ breakpoints lie within a 6–8 kb segment of DNA, identifying a breakpoint cluster region. Members of the Alu family of repetitive sequences are frequently found at the breakpoints and we describe a novel deletion due to homologous recombination between such repeats. In another deletion the breakpoints are separated by 131 bp of DNA, which we have shown to be transposed from a region 36 kb upstream from the 5′ breakpoint where it is present in the inverse orientation. The sizes of these deletions, the nonrandom distribution of their breakpoints, and the nature of the inversion-duplication transposition event suggest that these rearrangements are constrained by the higher-order structure of the α-globin cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2153393494,"To study the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma, we introduced activated c-myc genes into human EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells derived from in vitro infection of normal cord blood or directly from infected peripheral blood from AIDS patients. In both cell types the constitutive expression of exogenous c-myc caused negative regulation of endogenous c-myc expression, changes in growth properties typical of transformed cells, and acquisition of tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. In all myc-transfected populations the degree of malignancy directly correlated with the level of c-myc mRNA. EBV infection and c-myc activation are thus sufficient for the tumorigenic conversion of human B cells in vitro, strongly supporting the hypothesis that these same two pathogenetic steps may be involved in the in vivo development of Burkitt lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2065522326,"Human STS is a microsomal enzyme important in steroid metabolism. The gene encoding STS is pseudoautosomal in the mouse but not in humans, and escapes X inactivation in both species. We have prepared monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to the protein which has been purified and from which partial amino acid sequence data have been obtained. cDNA clones containing the entire coding sequence were isolated, sequenced, and expressed in heterologous cells. Variable length transcripts have been shown to be present and due to usage of alternative poly(A) addition sites. The functional gene maps to Xp22.3-Xpter and there is a pseudogene on Yq suggesting a recent pericentric inversion. Absence of STS enzymatic activity occurs frequently in human populations and produces a visible phenotype of scaly skin or ichthyosis. Ten patients with inherited STS deficiency were studied and eight had complete gene deletions. The possibility that STS deficiency results from aberrant X-Y interchange is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2058885505,"Evidence is presented that virus-induced transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta gene is mediated by repeated sequence units each consisting of 6 bp. The repeated units are present in the region between -65 and -109 relative to the cap site. We chemically synthesized the ""consensus"" DNA sequence units and tested their ability to confer virus inducibility on cognate and noncognate promoters. Most of such sequence units when tandemly repeated indeed mediate virus-induced activation of the promoter sequences. The most efficient sequence unit, AAGTGA, contributes incrementally in virus-induced activation of transcription and manifests properties of an inducible enhancer. Evidence is also provided that suggests that interaction of a positive regulatory factor(s) with this regulatory region."

https://openalex.org/W2063337115,"We report that two types of stable protein-DNA complexes, or transpososomes, are generated in vitro during the Mu DNA strand transfer reaction. The Type 1 complex is an intermediate in the reaction. Its formation requires a supercoiled mini-Mu donor plasmid, Mu A and HU protein, and Mg2+. In the Type 1 complex the two ends of Mu are held together, creating a figure eight-shaped molecule with two independent topological domains; the Mu sequences remain supercoiled while the vector DNA is relaxed because of nicking. In the presence of Mu B protein, ATP, target DNA, and Mg2+, the Type 1 complex is converted into the protein-associated product of the strand transfer reaction. In this Type 2 complex, the target DNA has been joined to the Mu DNA ends held in the synaptic complex at the center of the figure eight. Supercoils are not required for the latter reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1516372175,"Incubation of 3T3 fibroblasts with phosphatidic acid (PA) from egg lecithin or with thrombin resulted in decreases in cellular cAMP due to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, in rapid increases in inositol 1,4,5-tris-,1,4-bis-, and 1-monophosphates probably due to activation of phospholipase C, and in arachidonic acid release. Synthetic PAs consisting of unsaturated fatty acid diesters were as effective as PA from egg lecithin, whereas PAs with saturated fatty acids were only slightly effective and antagonized the effect of active PAs selectively, despite the fact that both types of PA analogues (sodium salts) were apparently dissolved in the incubation medium. PA-induced decreases in cAMP were not affected by omission of Ca2+ from incubation medium but were abolished by prior exposure of cells to islet-activating protein (pertussis toxin). This islet-activating protein treatment of cells was without effect on PA- or thrombin-induced generation of inositol phosphates. Thus, PA-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase was (but activation of phospholipase C was not) mediated by an islet-activating protein substrate GTP-binding protein. Homologous desensitization was observed with thrombin-, bradykinin-, and PA-induced decreases in cAMP in 3T3 cells; prior exposure of the cells to any one of these agents abolished or greatly diminished the subsequent response to the same agent but did not affect the responses to others. The effects of PA were cell-specific; it failed to decrease cAMP in rabbit platelets in which labeled PA rapidly increasing in response to thrombin or A23187 was mostly outside the cells. Based on these results, it is proposed that PA interacts with its own specific membrane receptors, thereby triggering multiple effector systems in 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2153131035,"A cDNA clone, designated 9E3, was isolated from a chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cDNA library. 9E3 mRNA was 20-fold higher in CEF following transformation by Rous sarcoma virus because of increased transcription rate. In CEF infected with temperature-sensitive mutants, increased 9E3 mRNA was found within 2 hr of a shift to permissive temperature. Nucleotide sequence and in vitro translation results indicate that 9E3 mRNA encodes an 11 kd polypeptide that is homologous to human connective tissue activating peptide III (CTAP-III), a mitogenic platelet α-granule protein, and to β-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. The reported biological activities of CTAP-III suggest that elevated expression of 9E3 may play a role in producing some of the phenotypic features of RSV-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486959216,"The binding of labeled erythropoietin (EP) to cell surface receptors and subsequent processing of the hormone within the cell was studied in erythroid cells procured from the spleens of mice infected with the anemia strain of Friend virus. These immature erythroid cells respond to EP in culture to differentiate into reticulocytes and erythrocytes. Radiolabeled EP (both iodinated and tritiated) binds to 800-1000 cell surface receptors on these cells at 4 degrees C. Using 125I-EP, we found that 300 of these cell surface receptors have a higher affinity for EP (Kd = 0.09 nM) than the remaining receptors (Kd = 0.57 nM). The number of molecules of EP bound per cell increased about 2-fold when binding was carried out at 37 degrees C. Treatment of the cell surface with pronase or removal of surface-bound EP with a low pH wash revealed that radiolabeled EP is internalized by the cells at 37 degrees C. Pulse chase experiments showed that degradation products of radiolabeled EP are released into the medium with a corresponding loss of label from the interior of the cell. Inhibitors of lysosomal function greatly reduced this degradation of 125I-EP. Since 180 of the 300 high affinity receptors and very few of the low affinity receptors are occupied at the concentration of EP which elicits the maximum biological response in these cells, we suggest that interaction of EP with the high affinity receptors are necessary for the full biological effect of the hormone. A different murine erythroleukemia cell line which does not differentiate in response to EP was found to have only the lower affinity binding sites for the hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2050856914,"We present results demonstrating that the hobo family of transposable elements can promote high rates of chromosomal instability. Using strains with a hobo element inserted within the decapentaplegic gene complex (DPP-C), we have recovered numerous DPP-C mutations involving chromosomal rearrangements and deletions with one endpoint in the vicinity of the pre-existing hobo element. This hypermutability occurred in the germ lines of hybrid progeny from crosses involving strains containing hobo elements to strains lacking them. In some crosses, the offspring had rudimentary gonads, reminiscent of GD sterility. The germline hypermutability and infertility are similar to those produced by P-element-mediated hybrid dysgenesis. Given the many genetic and molecular similarities of the P and hobo systems, we propose that a system analogous to P-M hybrid dysgenesis has been activated in the hobo+ X hobo- crosses."
https://openalex.org/W1585596487,"Human skin collagenase is secreted by cultured fibroblasts in a proenzyme form and can be activated to a catalytically competent enzyme by a number of processes. All modes of activation studied lead to conversion of the proenzyme to a stable 42-kDa active enzyme, concomitant with removal of an 81-amino acid peptide from the amino-terminal end of the molecule. The sequence of events leading to the formation of this enzyme form has been determined by analyzing the primary structure of the conversion intermediates. Trypsin-induced activation of procollagenase occurs as a result of the initial cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-55 and Asn-56, generating a major intermediate of 46 kDa. Treatment of the proenzyme with organomercurials, which have no intrinsic ability to cleave peptide bonds, initially results in activation of the enzyme without loss of molecular weight. This is followed by conversion to two lower molecular weight species of 44 and 42 kDa, the latter corresponding to the stable active enzyme form. The final cleavage producing this form of collagenase is not restricted to a single polypeptide bond but can occur on the amino-terminal side of any one of three contiguous hydrophobic residues, Phe-100, Val-101, Leu-102. The data suggest that both trypsin and organomercurials activate procollagenase by initiating an intramolecular autoproteolytic reaction resulting in the formation of a stable 42-kDa active enzyme species."
https://openalex.org/W1556317573,"Peroxisomes were purified from livers of clofibrate-treated rats. Permeability measurements on the isolated organelles revealed that peroxisomes are permeable to small solutes, including sucrose and the cofactors for fatty acid oxidation NAD+, CoA, ATP, and carnitine. The intraperoxisomal distribution volume was equal for all solutes. Peroxisomal solute uptake was rapid, not saturable and not visibly influenced by temperature. NAD+ and carnitine uptake in the solute accessible volume was not diminished by a variety of analogs and inhibitors. Subfractionation of peroxisomes and reconstitution of the subfractions into liposomes preloaded with solutes made the liposomes reconstituted with the integral membrane protein fraction, but not those reconstituted with the other subperoxisomal protein fractions, permeable to the same solutes that entered intact peroxisomes. Solute leakage from the preloaded liposomes was rapid and not visibly influenced by temperature. Leakage activity was destroyed by heat treatment of the integral membrane protein fraction and was not present in lipid extracts of the membrane. Separation of the integral membrane proteins on sucrose density gradients and reconstitution of the gradient fractions into liposomes indicated that the leakage activity was caused by a polypeptide of rather low molecular weight. The gradient distribution of leakage activity corresponded most closely to the presence of a 22- and a 28-kDa polypeptide. Our experiments indicate that the nonspecific permeability of the peroxisomal membrane to small solutes is based on the presence in the membrane of a nonselective pore-forming protein."
https://openalex.org/W1619895170,"Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA clones for bovine elastin revealed the occurrence of three mRNAs for elastin in fetal calf nuchal ligament, encoding three forms of elastins (a, b, and c, of 747, 733, and 713 amino acid residues, respectively). These forms arise as the result of the presence, at a single position, of 102 additional nucleotides in the mRNA for elastin a and of 60 of these nucleotides in the mRNA for elastin b as compared to the mRNA for elastin c. As expected, most lysines occur in pairs, separated by two or three small amino acid residues. However, at two places, lysines occur in groups of three. The occurrence of a group of three lysines followed by a hydrophobic residue (lysine 400, 404, and 407) offers an explanation for the formation of lysinonorleucine. The alignment of amino acid sequences of porcine tropoelastin tryptic peptides with the sequence for bovine elastin a results in the ordering of these tryptic peptides. The analysis of the complete primary structures of elastin a, b, and c provides further insight into the structure-function relations of elastin."
https://openalex.org/W2050103669,"The male recombination factor 23.5MRF, isolated ten years ago from a natural Greek population of Drosophila melanogaster, has been shown to induce hybrid dysgenesis when crossed to some M strains, in a fashion slightly different from that of most P strains. Furthermore, it was recently shown that 23.5MRF can also induce GD sterility when crossed to specific P strain females (e.g., Harwich, pi 2 and T-007). In these experiments, the P strains mentioned behaved like M strains in that they did not induce sterility in the reciprocal crosses involving 23.5MRF. We extended the analysis to show that 23.5MRF does not destabilize snW(M) and that a derivative with fewer full-length P elements behaves like an M strain toward the same P strains and still retains its dysgenic properties in the reciprocal crosses. We show that there is a strong correlation between the site of dysgenic chromosomal breakpoints induced by 23.5MRF and the localization of hobo elements on the second chromosome, and also that hobo elements are found associated with several 23.5MRF induced mutations. These results suggest that hobo elements are responsible for the aberrant dysgenic properties of this strain, and that they may express their dysgenic properties independent of the presence of P elements."

https://openalex.org/W1562313265,"Yeast invertase forms a homo-octamer of core glycosylated subunits during assembly in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This form has been purified from mutant cells (sec18) in which transport of secreted proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum is blocked. No heterologous protein subunits are found in the purified material. Analysis of invertase derived from wild type cells or from mutant cells blocked at subsequent stages in secretion demonstrates that invertase remains a homo-octamer throughout the pathway even though the extent of subunit glycosylation increases. Purified octameric invertase is dissociated into dimer units that reassociate in the presence of polyethylene glycol. Negatively stained preparations show the dissociated enzyme as individual spheres, whereas octameric invertase appears as four associated spheres. Assembly of the octamer in vitro and in vivo is facilitated by the presence of N-linked carbohydrate. Selective release of dimeric glycosylated invertase from intact yeast cells suggests that oligomerization helps retain the enzyme in the periplasmic space."
https://openalex.org/W1541818284,"Abstract A cAMP phosphodiesterase with properties of a peripheral membrane protein accounts for approximately 90% of total cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in particulate (100,000 X g) fractions from rat fat cells. Incubation of fat cells with insulin for 10 min increased particulate (but not soluble) cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, with a maximum increase (approximately 100%) at 1 nM insulin. Most of the increase in activity was retained after solubilization (with non-ionic detergent and NaBr) and partial purification (approximately 20-fold) on DEAE-Sephacel. The solubilized enzyme from adipose tissue was purified approximately 65,000-fold to apparent homogeneity (yield approximately 20%) by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-200 and affinity chromatography on aminoethyl agarose conjugated with the N-(2-isothiocyanato)ethyl derivative of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostamide (OPC 3689). A 63,800 +/- 200-Da polypeptide (accounting for greater than 90% of the protein eluted from the affinity column) was identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (with or without reduction). Enzyme activity was associated with the single protein band after electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. On gel permeation, Mr(app) was 100,000-110,000, suggesting that the holoenzyme is a dimer. A pI of 4.9-5.0 was estimated by isoelectric focusing. At 30 degrees C, the purified enzyme hydrolyzed both cAMP and cGMP with normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the pH optimum was 7.5. The Km(app) for cAMP was 0.38 microM and Vmax, 8.5 mumol/min/mg; for cGMP, Km(app) was 0.28 microM and Vmax, 2.0 mumol/min/mg. cGMP competitively inhibited cAMP hydrolysis with a Ki of approximately 0.15 microM. The enzyme was also inhibited by several OPC derivatives and drugs, but not by RO 20-1724. It was very sensitive to inhibition by agents which covalently modify protein sulfhydryls, but not by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The activation by insulin and other findings indicate that the purified enzyme, which seems to belong to a subtype of low Km cAMP phosphodiesterases that is specifically and potently inhibited by cGMP, cilostamide, other OPC derivatives, and certain cardiotonic drugs, is likely to account for the hormone-sensitive particulate low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase activity of rat adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1588342196,"Exogenous diacylglycerols stimulate neutrophil superoxide anion production, suggesting that endogenous diacylglycerols may function as second messengers for this biological response. We have measured the diacylglycerol mass in human neutrophils stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe, ionomycin, and concanavalin A and have correlated the kinetics and magnitude of the diacylglycerol response with those for superoxide anion production. For each stimulus, no increase in diacylglycerol mass was detected prior to the onset of superoxide anion generation. However, large sustained increases in diacylglycerol concentration (260-2000% of basal levels) occurred in parallel with the rise in superoxide anion. The cessation or continuation of diacylglycerol accumulation and superoxide anion production also correlated. The diacylglycerol response was proportional to the stimulus concentration and correlated with the concentration dependence for superoxide anion. Pretreatment of neutrophils with cytochalasin B enhanced both superoxide anion and diacylglycerol responses with all three stimuli. These data support the hypothesis that diacylglycerol functions as a modulator of superoxide anion generation causing a sustained or augmented respiratory burst."
https://openalex.org/W1965783540,We have investigated the functional significance of phosphoserine residues that lie in the L protein-binding domain between amino acids 213 and 247 of the phosphoprotein (NS) of vesicular stomatitis virus. A series of mutant NS proteins were made by cell-free translation of mRNAs transcribed from the cloned gene. Site-directed substitution of alanine for both serine 236 and serine 242 essentially abolished RNA synthesis catalyzed by the NS-L complex. Substitution of either of these serines reduced RNA synthesis by 75%. Serine 218 played no major role in RNA synthesis. Phosphorylation of NS by the L protein was abrogated by substitution of either serine 236 or serine 242. These results indicate that phosphorylation of serines 236 and 242 in the NS protein regulates its binding with the L protein and the N-RNA template and is essential for activation of viral RNA synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W1569526811,"The herpes virus-encoded DNA replication protein, infected cell protein 8 (ICP8), binds specifically to single-stranded DNA with a stoichiometry of one ICP8 molecule/12 nucleotides. In the absence of single-stranded DNA, it assembles into long filamentous structures. Binding of ICP8 inhibits DNA synthesis by the herpes-induced DNA polymerase on singly primed single-stranded DNA circles. In contrast, ICP8 greatly stimulates replication of circular duplex DNA by the polymerase. Stimulation occurs only in the presence of a nuclear extract from herpes-infected cells. Appearance of the stimulatory activity in nuclear extracts coincides closely with the time of appearance of herpes-induced DNA replication proteins including ICP8 and DNA polymerase. A viral factor(s) may therefore be required to mediate ICP8 function in DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1563242526,"The yeast fatty acid synthase is a complex (alpha 6 beta 6) of two multifunctional proteins alpha and beta. The alpha subunit (Mr 212,000) contains two of the seven enzymatic activities required for the synthesis of fatty acids and the site for attachment of the prosthetic group 4'-phosphopantetheine. The beta subunit (Mr 203,000) contains the remaining five activities. Cloning of the genes encoding the alpha and beta proteins has been reported (Kuziora, M. A., Chalmers, J. H., Jr., Hitzeman, R. A., Douglas, M. G., and Wakil, S. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11648-11653). In the present study it is shown that two of the clones containing the beta subunit gene, YEpFAS1 and YEp33F1, are not identical. The clone YEp33F1 contains the gene that codes for the entire beta subunit while YEpFAS1 is missing approximately half of the gene at the 3' end. Despite this loss, YEpFAS1 is still able to complement a fas1 mutation at the enoyl reductase domain. This complementation does not occur by recombination, rather a small mRNA is produced in cells transformed with YEpFAS1 and is translated into a protein of molecular weight of approximately 125,000 which is immunologically reactive with yeast fatty acid synthase antibodies. The data suggest that this truncated beta subunit interacts with the mutant alpha 6 beta 6 complex to restore fatty acid synthesis to the cell. The nucleotide sequence of the FAS1 gene cloned in YEp33F1 DNA, which encodes the beta subunit of fatty acid synthase, was determined. The coding region consists of 5940 base pairs (bp) and could encode a protein of 1980 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 220,077. A major transcriptional start point was mapped to a position of about 330 bp upstream from the first ATG codon. The termination of transcription was mapped at about 300 bp downstream from the first TGA stop codon. The sequence of the beta subunit protein does not appear to be similar to any other sequenced protein. The sites of the active seryl groups for the acetyltransacylase and malonyl/palmitoyl transacylase were identified from known amino acid sequences to be residues 274 and 1808, respectively. Putative binding sites for FMN and NADPH were suggested based on similarities with amino acid sequences of known flavin and pyridine nucleotide enzymes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1498515283,"Thrombin, nucleotides, and chelators elicited a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-P2) phospholipase C activity that was associated with human platelet membranes. Both alpha- and gamma-thrombin enhanced phospholipase C activity, whereas active site-inhibited alpha-thrombin did not stimulate PtdIns-P2 hydrolysis. PtdIns-P2 phospholipase C was also activated by nucleoside triphosphates, citrate, EDTA, and NaF. Magnesium was an inhibitor of PtdIns-P2 hydrolysis stimulated by nucleotides and chelators. Only PtdIns-P2 was degraded by the phospholipase C activated by alpha-thrombin, nucleotides, and chelators. The soluble fraction phospholipase C activity was also stimulated at low protein concentrations by nucleotides; however, soluble fraction phospholipase C activity cleaved both PtdIns-P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and was inhibited by chelators, suggesting the presence of a different enzyme in this compartment. The pH optimum for the membrane-associated phospholipase C in the presence of alpha-thrombin or nucleotides was 6.0, and the PtdIns-P2 phospholipase C was inhibited by neomycin and high detergent concentrations. Guanine nucleotides did not synergistically activate phospholipase C in the presence of alpha-thrombin. The characteristics of the membrane-associated PtdIns-P2 phospholipase C suggest that this enzyme is involved in platelet activation by the low-affinity alpha- or gamma-thrombin-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1515785601,"The receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine lung by a combination of detergent extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography on ANP-Affi-Gel 10. The Mr of the purified receptor is about 140,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After reduction, the protein migrated as a single band with an Mr near 70,000. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the purified material revealed only one sequence, indicating that the ANP receptor is composed of two probably identical subunits held together by disulfide bond(s), although it remains possible that one of the subunits is blocked at the NH2 terminus. Antibody was produced to the nonreduced Mr = 140,000 species and shown to interact with detergent-solubilized forms of the lung and kidney ANP receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1597844740,"ATP influences the kinetics of electron transfer from cytochrome c to mitochondrial oxidase both in the membrane-embedded and detergent-solubilized forms of the enzyme. The most relevant effect is on the so-called high affinity binding site for cytochrome c which can be converted to low affinity by millimolar concentrations of ATP (Ferguson-Miller, S., Brautigan, D. L., and Margoliash, E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1104-1115). This phenomenon is characterized at the molecular level by the following features. ATP triggers a conformational change on the water-exposed surface of cytochrome c oxidase; in this process, carboxyl groups forming the cluster of negative charges responsible for binding cytochrome c change their accessibility to water-soluble protein modifier reagents; as a consequence the electrostatic field that controls the enzyme-substrate interaction is altered and cytochrome c appears to bind differently to oxidase; photolabeling experiments with the enzyme from bovine heart and other eukaryotic sources show that ATP cross-links specifically to the cytoplasmic subunits IV and VIII. Taken together, these data indicate that ATP can, at physiological concentration, bind to cytochrome c oxidase and induce an allosteric conformational change, thus affecting the interaction of the enzyme with cytochrome c. These findings raise the possibility that the oxidase activity may be influenced by the cell environment via cytoplasmic subunit-mediated interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1526230021,"Nucleotide sequences of the cysB region of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli have been determined and compared. A total of 1759 nucleotides were sequenced in S. typhimurium and 1840 in E. coli. Both contain a 972-nucleotide open reading frame identified as the coding region for the cysB regulatory protein on the basis of sequence homology and by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with known physicochemical properties of this protein. The DNA sequence identity for the cysB coding region in the two species is 80.5%. The deduced amino acid sequences are 95% identical. The predicted cysB polypeptide molecular weights are 36,013 for S. typhimurium and 36,150 for E. coli. For both proteins a helix-turn-helix region similar to that found in other DNA-binding proteins is predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. Sequences upstream to cysB contain open reading frames which represent the carboxyl-terminal end of the topA gene product, DNA topoisomerase I. A pattern of highly conserved nucleotide sequences in the 151 nucleotides immediately preceding the cysB initiator codon in both species suggests that this region may contain multiple signals for the regulation of cysB expression."

https://openalex.org/W1501357974,"Abstract The DNA polymerase encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 consists of a single polypeptide of Mr 136,000 that has both DNA polymerase and 3'----5' exonuclease activities; it lacks a 5'----3' exonuclease. The herpes polymerase is exceptionally slow in extending a synthetic DNA primer annealed to circular single-stranded DNA (turnover number approximately 0.25 nucleotide). Nevertheless, it is highly processive because of its extremely tight binding to a primer terminus (Kd less than 1 nM). The single-stranded DNA-binding protein from Escherichia coli greatly stimulates the rate (turnover number approximately 4.5 nucleotides) by facilitating the efficient binding to and extension of the DNA primers. Synchronous replication by the polymerase of primed single-stranded DNA circles coated with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein proceeds to the last nucleotide of available 5.4-kilobase template without dissociation, despite the 20-30 min required to replicate the circle. Upon completion of synthesis, the polymerase is slow in cycling to other primed single-stranded DNA circles. ATP (or dATP) is not required to initiate or sustain highly processive synthesis. The 3'----5' exonuclease associated with the herpes DNA polymerase binds a 3' terminus tightly (Km less than 50 nM) and is as sensitive as the polymerase activity to inhibition by phosphonoacetic acid (Ki approximately 4 microM), suggesting close communication between the polymerase and exonuclease sites."
https://openalex.org/W1604541567,"A protein inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent proteinase has been purified from bovine cardiac muscle by using the following steps in succession: salting out 17,600 X gmax supernatants from muscle homogenates in 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 4 mM EDTA between 25 and 65% ammonium sulfate saturation; eluting between 25 and 120 mM KCl from a DEAE-cellulose column at pH 7.5; salting out between 30 and 60% ammonium sulfate saturation; Ultrogel-22 gel permeation chromatography at pH 7.5; heating to 80 degrees C followed by immediate cooling to 0 degree C; 6% agarose gel permeation chromatography in 4 M urea, pH 7.5; and elution from a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic column between 0.7 and 0.5 M ammonium sulfate. Approximately 1.16-1.69 mg of purified Ca2+-dependent proteinase inhibitor are obtained from 1 kg of bovine cardiac muscle, fresh weight. Bovine cardiac Ca2+-dependent proteinase inhibitor has an Mr of 115,000 as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a pI of 4.85-4.95, very little alpha-helical structure, a very low specific absorbance of 1.647 (A1% 280), and very low contents of histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. Bovine cardiac Ca2+-dependent proteinase inhibitor probably contains a single polypeptide chain in nondenaturing solvents. One 115-kDa inhibitor polypeptide inactivates 10 110-kDa millimolar Ca2+-requiring proteinase (millimolar Ca2+-dependent proteinase) molecules in assays of purified proteins. Inhibition of millimolar proteinase by the proteinase inhibitor did not change in the pH range 6.2-8.6. The inhibitor requires Ca2+ to bind to millimolar Ca2+-dependent proteinase. The Ca2+ concentration required for one-half-maximum binding of millimolar Ca2+-dependent proteinase to the inhibitor was 0.53 mM, compared with a Ca2+ concentration of 0.92 mM required for one-half maximum activity of millimolar Ca2+-dependent proteinase in the absence of the proteinase inhibitor. Unless millimolar Ca2+-dependent proteinase is located subcellularly in a different place than the proteinase inhibitor or unless the proteinase/inhibitor interaction is regulated, millimolar proteinase could never be active in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1585257186,"To clarify the signal transduction mechanism of the erbB gene (virus oncogene) products leading to cell growth and transformation, the alteration of signal transduction induced by enhanced inositol phospholipid metabolism was studied in chick embryo fibroblast cells (CEF cells) transformed by gag-fused erbB gene-carrying virus (GEV cells). The incorporations of 32P into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were markedly increased in GEV cells. In GEV cells, the activities of lipid kinases such as phosphatidylinositol (PI), PIP, and diacylglycerol (DG) kinases were also increased. The activities of other important enzymes involved in inositol phospholipid metabolism, such as CDP-DG:myo-inositol transferase and phospholipase C, were not changed in GEV cells. Increased inositol phospholipid metabolism might lead to the production of second messengers, such as 1,2-DG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Indeed, the 1,2-DG content was also increased in GEV cells. Moreover, the activity of protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), which should be stimulated by 1,2-DG, was elevated in GEV cells; the protein kinase C activity in the membrane fraction of GEV cells was especially high. When CEF cells were treated with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, protein kinase C activator, plus Ca2+ ionophore, [3H]thymidine incorporation was markedly stimulated, and maximal stimulation was observed with 1 nM Ca2+ ionophore A23187 plus 100 nM TPA. On the other hand, when GEV cells were treated with TPA plus Ca2+ ionophore A23187, [3H]thymidine incorporation was consistently inhibited. Next, studies were made to determine whether the erbB gene product itself had kinase activity on PI, PIP, and DG after membranes were mildly solubilized with Triton X-100 to prevent inactivation of these kinases. Immunoprecipitates of a GEV cell lysate with antisera that reacted with the erbB gene product had PI kinase activity, whereas no activity was detected in those of lysates of uninfected CEF cells. However, the activity was very weak compared with the total cellular activity. No difference in the PIP and DG kinase activities of immunoprecipitates of cell lysates of uninfected CEF cells and GEV cells was observed. These results suggest that the erbB gene product enhances inositol phospholipid metabolism and subsequent signal transduction, but that the erbB gene product is not involved directly in lipid kinases, although it is closely associated with lipid kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1536194943,"Analysis of sequence alignments between the recently published sequence of human fibroblast collagenase and a computer file of published protease sequences has revealed a previously unrecognized homology to the 11 amino acids flanking the zinc-binding site of Serratia protease, a bacterial metalloprotease. There is also strong homology among several bacterial metalloproteases at this site. This finding implies that zinc binding by many proteins may have structural requirements which are apparent even in primary structure and which have been evolutionarily conserved or convergently evolved. This consensus sequence could be used as a marker for recognizing other members of the metalloprotease family."
https://openalex.org/W1615114562,"Using an assay based on polypeptide mobility in one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide electropherograms, we purified the Salmonella typhimurium cysB protein from an Escherichia coli strain carrying plasmid pGBK14, in which the S. typhimurium cysB gene is under transcriptional control of the strong promoter PL from phage lambda. cysB protein constitutes approximately 4% of total soluble protein in such cells and was obtained with good yield at a purity of 85% after precipitation of nucleic acids with streptomycin sulfate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and hydrophobic chromatography on methyl agarose. Material with 95% purity was obtained with poor yield by ion-exchange chromatography of native protein and with good yield by size exclusion chromatography of denatured protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Physicochemical studies of the purified cysB protein show that it is a tetramer of identical 36-kDa subunits with a pI, amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, and carboxyl-terminal amino acid content identical to those known from previous studies or deduced from the cysB DNA sequence. Although O-acetyl-L-serine is believed to bind to cysB protein to form a complex that stimulates transcription of genes of the cysteine regulon, we were unable to demonstrate such an interaction using methods that would have detected binding with a Kd of less than 0.1 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1498124219,"Concentrations and rates of synthesis of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) and purine nucleotides were compared in fibroblasts cultured from 5 males with PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity, 3 normal individuals, and 2 children with severe hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency. Although all cell strains with PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity showed increased PP-Rib-P concentration and generation, increased rates of PP-Rib-P-dependent purine synthetic pathways, and increased purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate concentrations, two subgroups were discernible. Three fibroblast strains with isolated catalytic defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase showed milder increases in PP-Rib-P concentration (2.5-fold normal) and generation (1.6- to 2.1-fold) and in rates of purine synthesis de novo (1.6- to 2.2-fold) and purine nucleoside triphosphate pools (1.5-fold) than did cells from 2 individuals with combined kinetic defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase, both with purine nucleotide inhibitor-resistance. Values for these processes in the latter two strains were, respectively, 5- to 6-fold, 2.6- to 3.2-fold, 4- to 7-fold, and 1.7- to 2.2-fold those of normal cells. In contrast to cells with catalytic defects, these cells also excreted an abnormally high proportion of labeled purines and resisted purine base-mediated inhibition of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide synthesis. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells showed normal regulation of PP-Rib-P synthesis and normal nucleoside triphosphate pools despite increased rates of purine synthesis de novo and of purine excretion. Cells with PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity thus synthesize purine nucleotides at increased rates as a consequence of increased PP-Rib-P production, despite increased purine nucleotide concentrations. These and additional findings provide evidence that regulation of purine synthesis de novo is effected at both the PP-Rib-P synthetase and amidophosphoribosyltransferase reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1722041317,"Maximal doses of glucagon increase the phosphorylation state of 12 cytosolic proteins in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats (Garrison, J. C., and Wagner, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13135-13143). Incubation of hepatocytes with lower concentrations of glucagon indicates that a hierarchy of substrates exists with the concentration of glucagon required for half-maximal increases in phosphorylation varying 5-15-fold. The proteins whose phosphorylation state is most sensitive to low concentrations of glucagon are pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, both of which play key roles in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Treatment of hepatocytes with (Sp)-cAMPS, the stimulatory diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate, mimics the response seen with glucagon. When hepatocytes are pretreated with the cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, the phosphorylation response is abolished at low concentrations of glucagon, and the dose of glucagon required for half-maximal stimulation of phosphorylation is increased 5-10-fold. The (Sp)-cAMPS-stimulated increases in phosphorylation state are also blunted by (Rp)-cAMPS. These results provide direct pharmacological evidence for the activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in response to glucagon in the intact cell. Although low doses of glucagon appear to stimulate protein phosphorylation via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, high doses of glucagon also cause a small increase in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ in hepatocytes. The glucagon-stimulated increases in the level of Ca2+ can be mimicked by (Sp)-cAMPS and inhibited by pretreatment with (Rp)-cAMPS. These results suggest that glucagon can elevate intracellular Ca2+ via cAMP and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1599378576,"Escherichia coli NCR91 synthesizes a mutant form of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) in which alanine 144 is replaced by threonine. This mutant, which also lacks adenylate cyclase activity, has a CAP phenotype; in the absence of cAMP it is able to express genes that normally require cAMP. CAP91 has been purified and crystallized with cAMP under the same conditions as used to crystallize the wild type CAP X cAMP complex. X-ray diffraction data were measured to 2.4-A resolution and the CAP91 structure was determined using initial model phases from the wild type structure. A difference Fourier map calculated between CAP91 and wild type showed the 2 alanine to threonine sequence changes in the dimer and also a change in orientation of cysteine 178 in one of the subunits. The CAP91 coordinates were refined by restrained least squares to an R factor of 0.186. Differences in the atomic positions of the wild type and mutant protein structures were analyzed by a vector averaging technique. There were small changes that included concerted motions in the small domains, in the hinge between the two domains and in an adjacent loop between beta-strands 4 and 5. The mutation at residue 144 apparently causes changes in the position of some protein atoms that are distal to the mutation site."
https://openalex.org/W1547357282,"An enzymatic activity associated with intracellular membrane fractions of Merwin plasma cell tumor II, baby hamster kidney, and chicken embryo fibroblast cells and bovine kidney has been characterized which covalently links fatty acids onto the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. Exogenous G protein extracted from native vesicular stomatitis virus particles can be acylated in vitro only after it has been previously deacylated. The fatty acids transferred in vitro are sensitive to treatment with hydroxylamine, indicating an ester linkage. Cell-free acyl transfer was also observed with endogenous G protein present in membrane fractions prepared from vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells. In this case, the fatty acids become linked to a G protein species (G1) which is not terminally glycosylated and therefore has not entered the trans-Golgi compartment. The same G protein species also becomes acylated in infected cells during short pulses with radioactive palmitic acid. Acylation of the G protein in vitro with free palmitic or myristic acid is energy-dependent, and the addition of ATP is specifically required. Other nucleoside triphosphates cannot substitute for ATP in the activation of free acyl chains. Alternatively, activated fatty acids linked in a high energy thioester bond to coenzyme A, e.g. [14C] palmitoyl-CoA, are suitable lipid donors in the in vitro acylation reactions. Palmitic acid transfer onto G protein shows the typical characteristics of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1491673149,"The functional role and topographical orientation in the inner membrane of subunit VII, the ubiquinone-binding protein, of the cytochrome b-c1 complex of yeast mitochondria has been investigated. The apparent molecular weight of this subunit on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gels was calculated to be 15,500, while its amino acid composition was similar to that of the Q-binding proteins present in the cytochrome b-c1 complexes isolated from both beef heart and yeast mitochondria. The specific antibody obtained against subunit VII inhibited 30-47% of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity in the isolated cytochrome b-c1 complex and in submitochondrial particles but had no effect on cytochrome c reductase activity in mitoplasts, mitochondria from which the outer membrane has been removed. Furthermore, the antibody against subunit VII strongly inhibited (74%) the reduction of cytochrome b by succinate in the presence of antimycin, an inhibitor of center i, but had no effect on cytochrome b reduction in the presence of myxothiazol, an inhibitor of center o. These results suggest that subunit VII, the Q-binding protein, is involved in electron transport at center o of the cytochrome b-c1 complex of the respiratory chain and that subunit VII is localized facing the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1586280447,"A cDNA, p1-88, was cloned from a library constructed using rabbit liver mRNA. Sequence analysis indicates that p1-88 is highly similar (congruent to 95%) to the cDNA, p1-8, that encodes rabbit liver cytochrome P-450 1 and that had been isolated from the same library. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by p1-88, P-450 IIC4, differs at 25 of 487 amino acids from that encoded by p1-8. P-450 IIC4 was synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate primed with RNA transcribed from the coding sequence of p1-88 using a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system. P-450 IIC4 reacts with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize P-450 1 and exhibits the same relative electrophoretic mobility as P-450 1. In contrast, the reactivity of a third monoclonal antibody recognizing P-450 1, 1F11, toward P-450 IIC4 synthesized in vitro is greatly diminished. The latter antibody extensively inhibits hepatic progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and recognizes phenotypic differences among rabbits in the microsomal concentration of P-450 1. This difference in the immunoreactivity of P-450 IIC4 and P-450 1 with the 1F11 antibody suggests that P-450 IIC4 does not contribute significantly to hepatic progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity. S1 nuclease mapping demonstrates that the expression of mRNAs corresponding to p1-88 are expressed to equivalent extents in rabbits exhibiting high and low expression of mRNAs corresponding to p1-8. Thus, P-450 1 differs from the protein encoded by p1-88, in its regulation, immunoreactivity, and by inference its catalytic properties although the amino acid sequences of P-450 1 and P-450 IIC4 are highly similar (congruent to 95%)."
https://openalex.org/W1507006251,"Abstract Quantitative S1 nuclease mapping studies were performed with uniformly labeled RNA probes, containing contiguous dihydrofolate reductase exon and intron sequences, and total RNA isolated from KB7B cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil for 5 days. Dihydrofolate reductase RNA containing both exon 1 and intron I, or exon 5 and a portion of intron V, increased up to 5-fold in cells grown in the presence of 2.0 to 3.0 microM 5-fluorouracil. Dihydrofolate reductase RNA containing exon 1 or exon 5, but lacking intron I or intron V, respectively, increased 2-fold in cells grown in the presence of 0.65 to 3.0 microM 5-fluorouracil. Primer extension analysis and S1 mapping studies revealed two major transcriptional start sites at positions -72 and -69 and minor start sites upstream from position -183, for dihydrofolate reductase RNA isolated from methotrexate-resistant KB7B cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that 5-fluorouracil alters the metabolism of dihydrofolate reductase precursor mRNA and/or processing intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1545073393,"An endogenous activator capable of stimulating the gastric H+,K+-ATPase activity has been purified to homogeneity from dog and pig gastric cells and found to be a dimer of two identical 40-kDa subunits in the active state. Identical nature of the activator monomers was revealed by the detection of lysine as the sole N-terminal amino acid. The activator from one species can stimulate the H+,K+-ATPase from another species and vice versa. Such cross-activation is consistent with the striking similarities in the amino acid composition between the two species, suggesting considerable homology in the activator molecules from different species. The activator exhibited several unique features during modulation of the H+,K+-ATPase reaction. It appreciably enhances affinity of the H+,K+-ATPase for K+, known to increase turnover of the enzyme. To complement this K+ affinity, the activator also enhances ability of the H+,K+-ATPase to generate more transition state (E*.ATP) complex by increasing the entropy of activation (delta S++) of the system as revealed from an Arrhenius plot of the data on temperature activation. In addition, the activator shows both positive cooperativity and strong inhibition, depending on its concentration. Thus, up to the ratio of the H+,K+-ATPase and activator of about 1:2 (on the protein basis), the activator shows sigmoidal activation (Hill coefficient = 4.5), but beyond such concentration a strong inhibition was observed. Finally, Ca2+ at low (2-4 microM) concentration strongly inhibits the activator-stimulated H+,K+-ATPase. It is proposed that the activator may be acting as a link in the signal transducing cascade system between the intracellular second messenger (Ca2+) and the physiological response (gastric H+ transport)."
https://openalex.org/W2026567160,"The early events in viral dissemination via the bloodstream were identified by monitoring the fate of 123I-radiolabeled reovirus after it was injected intravenously in rats. Continuous scintillation camera imaging showed that reovirus serotypes 1 and 3 were cleared from the circulation in less than 10 minutes by specific and distinct target organs. Reovirus serotype 1 accumulated predominantly in the lungs and the liver, whereas serotype 3 accumulated in the liver and the spleen with very little virus uptake by the lungs. Incubation of reovirus serotype 1 with a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral hemagglutinin before injection totally inhibited the clearance of the virus by the lungs. Similar results were obtained when viruses biolabeled with 35S were used. These results demonstrate that viruses can be rapidly transported through the bloodstream to specific target organs and that the localization of the viruses depends on the interaction between specific viral surface components and the target organ."
https://openalex.org/W2101939964,"The arg-6 locus of Neurospora crassa encodes two early enzymes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, acetylglutamate kinase and acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase. Previous genetic and biochemical analyses of this locus and its products showed that: 1) strains carrying polar nonsense mutations in the acetylglutamate kinase gene lacked both enzyme activities (Davis, R.H., and Weiss, R.L. (1983) Mol. Gen. Genet. 192, 46-50), and 2) the proteins isolated from mitochondria were completely separable (Wandinger-Ness, A., Wolf, E.C., Weiss, R.L., and Davis, R.H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260,5974-5978). These data suggested that the two enzymes were initially synthesized as a single precursor which was subsequently cleaved into two distinct polypeptides. We report here the identification of a high molecular weight protein, synthesized in vitro from isolated N. crassa RNA, that contains sequences corresponding to acetylglutamate kinase as well as acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase. An analogous precursor was identified in vivo by pulse-labeling experiments. The precursor was similar to other mitochondrial precursors in that its uptake and processing in vivo was rapid and required an intact mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. This represents the first report of a bifunctional protein precursor which gives rise to two mitochondrial enzymes."
