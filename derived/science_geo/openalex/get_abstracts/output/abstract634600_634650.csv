https://openalex.org/W2949194517,"Because sexual orientation concealment can exact deep mental and physical health costs and dampen the public visibility necessary for advancing equal rights, estimating the proportion of the global sexual minority population that conceals its sexual orientation represents a matter of public health and policy concern. Yet a historic lack of cross-national datasets of sexual minorities has precluded accurate estimates of the size of the global closet. We extrapolated the size of the global closet (i.e., the proportion of the global sexual minority population who conceals its sexual orientation) using a large sample of sexual minorities collected across 28 countries and an objective index of structural stigma (i.e., discriminatory national laws and policies affecting sexual minorities) across 197 countries. We estimate that the majority (83.0%) of sexual minorities around the world conceal their sexual orientation from all or most people and that country-level structural stigma can serve as a useful predictor of the size of each country's closeted sexual minority population. Our analysis also predicts that eliminating structural stigma would drastically reduce the size of the global closet. Given its costs to individual health and social equality, the closet represents a considerable burden on the global sexual minority population. The present projection suggests that the surest route to improving the wellbeing of sexual minorities worldwide is through reducing structural forms of inequality. Yet, another route to alleviating the personal and societal toll of the closet is to develop public health interventions that sensitively reach the closeted sexual minority population in high-stigma contexts worldwide. An important goal of this projection, which relies on data from Europe, is to spur future research from non-Western countries capable of refining the estimate of the association between structural stigma and sexual orientation concealment using local experiences of both."
https://openalex.org/W2949819250,"Background Delirium is a common and serious complication in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, with significant adverse outcomes. Successful strategies or therapies to reduce the incidence of delirium are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the role of prehabilitation in reducing the incidence of delirium in elderly patients. Methods A single-center uncontrolled before-and-after study was conducted, including patients aged 70 years or older who underwent elective abdominal surgery for colorectal carcinoma or an abdominal aortic aneurysm between January 2013 and October 2015 (control group) and between November 2015 and June 2018 (prehabilitation group). The prehabilitation group received interventions to improve patients’ physical health, nutritional status, factors of frailty and preoperative anaemia prior to surgery. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium, diagnosed with the DSM-V criteria or the confusion assessment method. Secondary outcomes were additional complications, length of stay, unplanned ICU admission, length of ICU stay, readmission rate, institutionalization, and in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Result A total of 360 control patients and 267 prehabilitation patients were included in the final analysis. The mean number of prehabilitation days was 39 days. The prehabilitation group had a higher burden of comorbidities and was more physically and visually impaired at baseline. At adjusted logistic regression analysis, delirium incidence was reduced significantly from 11.7 to 8.2% (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32–0.98; P = 0.043). No statistically significant effects were seen on secondary outcomes. Conclusion Current prehabilitation program is feasible and safe, and can reduce delirium incidence in elderly patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. This program merits further evaluation. Trial registration Dutch Trial Registration, NTR5932."
https://openalex.org/W2949397371,"Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease characterized by the growth of papillomas in the airway and especially the larynx. The clinical course is highly variable among individuals and there is poor understanding of the factors that drive an aggressive vs an indolent course.A convenience cohort of 339 affected subjects with papillomas positive for only HPV6 or HPV11 and clinical course data available for 1 year or more, from a large multicenter international study were included. Exploratory data analysis was conducted followed by inferential analyses with frequentist and Bayesian statistics.We examined 339 subjects: 82% were diagnosed prior to the age of 18 years, 65% were infected with HPV6, and 69% had an aggressive clinical course. When comparing age at diagnosis with clinical course, the probability of aggressiveness is high for children under five years of age then drops rapidly. For patients diagnosed after the age of 10 years, an indolent course is more common. After accounting for confounding between HPV11 and young age, HPV type was minimally associated with aggressiveness. Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) were utilized to determine which algorithms yield the highest accuracy to classify patients as having an indolent or aggressive clinical course and consistently created a branch for diagnostic age at ~5 years old. There was no reliable strong association between clinical course and socioeconomic or parental factors.In the largest cohort of its type, we have identified a critical age at diagnosis which demarcates a more aggressive from less aggressive clinical course."
https://openalex.org/W2951276669,"Gastric ulcer is sores that form in the stomach mucosal layer because of erosion caused by high acid secretion and excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prodigiosins (PdGs) are red-pigmented secondary metabolites produced by bacteria, including actinomycetes. Butylcycloheptylprodigiosin (1) and undecylprodigiosin (2) were identified and isolated from a crude extract of the actinomycete RA2 isolated from the Red Sea Sponge Spheciospongia mastoidea. Chemical structure of 1 and 2 was determined by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Although their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are known, their effect on gastric lesion is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gastroprotective effects of PdGs against HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesion in rats. Oral pretreatment with PdGs (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) attenuated severity of HCl/ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, as evidenced by decreases in gastric lesion index scores, ulceration area, histopathologic abnormality, and neutrophil infiltration. These effects were comparable to those of omeprazole, a standard anti-gastric ulcer agent. HCl/ethanol-induced gastric erosions was associated with tremendous increases in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (myeloperoxidase, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2), and with significant decreases in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities. However, PdGs ameliorated gastric inflammation and oxidative stress by downregulating nuclear factor kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and upregulating heme oxygenase-1 expression. PdGs prevented gastric mucosal apoptosis by downregulating Bax and caspase-3 expression and upregulating Bcl-2 expression, thereby increasing prostaglandin E2 production. Our results suggested that PdGs exerted gastroprotective effects by decreasing the levels of inflammatory mediators, apoptotic markers, and antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2949289647,"Inappropriate prescribing is a risk factor for adverse drug reactions and hospitalizations in the elderly and places a considerable burden on the healthcare system. Hence, it is imperative to identify irrational prescribing and implement interventions to improve prescribing appropriateness in geriatric clinical practice. This study aimed to determine: (i) the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) according to Beers STOPP, FORTA, and the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) criteria; (ii) the prevalence of potential prescribing omissions (PPOs) according to START criteria; and (iii) the predictors for PIMs and PPOs. A cross-sectional study was performed among elderly outpatients of 10 primary healthcare centers with specialized geriatric clinics in Kuwait. Four-hundred and seventy-eight patients were selected randomly, 420 (87.9%) agreed to participate. Data about chronic diseases and prescribed medications were obtained from the physicians by accessing the patients’ medical records. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression were used for data analysis. A total of 2645 medications were prescribed to all patients; mean (SD) number of medicines per patient was 6.3 (3.0). PIMs were present in 53.1%, 55.7%, and 44.3% of respondents, according to Beers, STOPP, and FORTA criteria, respectively. Almost 74% of respondents had one or more inappropriate ratings among their medications in the MAI criteria. According to START criteria, 19.8% of patients had at least one PPO. Respondents taking ≥ 5 medications were found to be using more PIMs according to Beers (OR: 6.3), STOPP (OR: 3.3), FORTA (OR: 6.0) and MAI (OR: 3.9) criteria in comparison to those taking ≤ 4 medications (p<0.001). The MAI revealed a significantly higher number of medications with inappropriate ratings compared to the Beers, STOPP and FORTA criteria (p<0.001). Taking the MAI as reference standard, STOPP criteria had the highest sensitivity (68.6%) and measure of agreement (Kappa index = 0.40) to detect PIMs compared with Beers and FORTA criteria. Inappropriate prescribing is common among the elderly in the primary geriatric clinics. This necessitates further evaluation of its impact on clinical outcomes and warrants efforts to implement interventions to improve prescribing practice in these settings."
https://openalex.org/W2953107792,"Background Increasing numbers of studies in chronic diseases have been published showing the relationship between body composition (BC) parameters (i.e. skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and adipose tissue (AT)) and outcomes. For patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), BC parameters have rarely been described as a prognostic marker of outcome. The primary objective was to evaluate the relationship between body composition at ICU admission and major clinical outcomes. Secondary objectives were to assess the relationship between BC parameters and other parameters (systemic inflammatory markers, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, albumin level) at ICU admission, and between BC alterations during ICU stay and outcomes. Patients and methods This retrospective study enrolled 25 adult patients who had two abdominal CT scans for clinical indication: first, within 48 hours of ICU admission (initial assessment), and second, 7 to 14 days later (late assessment). Skeletal Muscle radiodensity (SMD), cross-sectional area of SMM, Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) were measured at the third lumbar vertebra. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the association between these parameters and mortality. Results Patients’ mean age was 64.6 years. Their mean BMI was 27.7 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). ICU mortality was 36%. There was no correlation between BC parameters at initial assessment and ICU outcomes. We observed a negative correlation between SMM index and SOFA score at initial assessment (r = -0.458, p = 0.037). There was a significant loss of VAT between two CT assessments which was associated with mortality (-22.34cm2 / m2 in non-survivors versus -6.22 cm2 / m2 in survivors, p = 0.039). Loss of SMD was greater with the occurrence of an infection than without (Delta SMD = -5.642 vs +1.957, p = 0.04). Conclusions Our results show alterations in body composition during ICU stay with a loss of muscle quality (decreased SMD) and adipose tissue. These findings require confirmation in future studies but already show that BC assessments at ICU admission and BC alterations during ICU stay are important factors for outcome in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2949247270,"Our study aimed to evaluate the trends of post retraction citations of articles reporting a radiology-imaging diagnostic method and to find if a different pattern exists between manuscripts reporting an ultrasound method and those reporting other radiology diagnostic methods. This study reviewed retractions stored in PubMed on the subject of radiology-imaging diagnosis to identify the motivation, time from publication to retraction, and citations before and after retraction. The PubMed database was searched on June 2017 to retrieve the retracted articles, and the Scopus database was screened to identify the post-retraction citations. The full text was screened to see the type of post-retraction citation (positive/negative) and whether the cited article appears or not as retracted. One hundred and two retractions were identified, representing 3.5% of the retracted articles indexed by PubMed, out of which 54 were included in the analysis. Half of the articles were retracted in the first 24 months after publication, and the number of post retraction citations was higher than the number of citations before retraction in 30 out of 54 cases (US methods: 9/20, other diagnostic methods 21/34, P-value = 0.2312). The plagiarism was the most common reason for retraction (31%), followed by repetitive publication (26%), and errors in data/manuscript (24%). In less than 2% of cases, the retracted articles appear as retracted in the text or reference list, while the negative citation is observed in 4.84% among manuscripts reporting an US diagnostic method and 0.32% among manuscripts reporting a diagnostic method other than US (P-value = 0.0004). No significant differences were observed when post retraction weighted citation index (WCI, no. of citations weighted by citation window) was compared to WCI prior retraction (P-value = 0.5972). In light of the reported results, we enumerated some recommendations that could potentially minimize the referral to retracted studies as valid."
https://openalex.org/W2952314506,"Preterm birth is a major public health problem, especially in Puerto Rico where the rates are among the highest observed worldwide, reaching 18% in 2011. The Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) study is an ongoing investigation of environmental factors that contribute to this condition. In the present analysis, we sought to examine common risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes which have not been characterized previously in this unique population. Pregnant women from the PROTECT cohort are recruited from the heavily contaminated Northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico and are free of pre-existing conditions like diabetes. We examined associations between basic demographic, behavioral (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), and pregnancy (e.g., season and year of delivery) characteristics as well as municipality of residence in relation to preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), postterm birth (≥41 weeks gestation), and small and large for gestational age in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Between 2011 and 2017, 1028 live singleton births were delivered as part of the PROTECT cohort. Of these, 107 (10%) were preterm. Preterm birth rates were higher among women with low socioeconomic status, as indicated by education level and income, and among women with high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Odds ratios of small for gestational age delivery were higher for women who reported tobacco use in pregnancy and lower for women who delivered in the hurricane and dengue season (July-October). Overall, in pregnant women residing in Puerto Rico, socioeconomic status was associated with preterm birth but few other factors were associated with this or other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Research to understand environmental factors that could be contributing to the preterm birth epidemic in Puerto Rico is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4252613301,"One-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to five treatment groups: basal diet and orally administered sterile saline (negative control, n-control); basal diet challenged with E. coli O78 (positive control, p-control); basal diet supplemented with 1×108 CFU/kg L. plantarum 15-1 and challenged with E. coli O78 (LP); basal diet supplemented with 5 g/kg fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and challenged with E. coli O78 (FOS); and basal diet supplemented with both L. plantarum 15-1 and FOS and challenged with E. coli O78 (LP+FOS). The broilers in the LP, FOS, and LP+FOS groups displayed a decrease of crypt depth at day 14 compared with the control groups. Furthermore, at days 14 and 21, the broilers in the LP group exhibited reduced serum levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) compared with the p-control group (p<0.05), and the broilers in the LP+FOS group showed increased serum concentrations of IgA and IgG relative to both control groups and decreased DAO levels compared with the p-control group (p<0.05). Moreover, the LP group displayed higher levels of acetic acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compared with the p-control group at day 14 (p<0.05), and the FOS group showed higher levels of valeric acid and total SCFAs at day 21 (p<0.05). The LP+FOS group also displayed a higher level of butyric acid at day 14 (p<0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with FOS improved the growth performance, while supplementation with L. plantarum 15-1 and FOS improved intestinal health by increasing the levels of SCFAs and mitigating the damage caused by E. coli O78, thus preventing intestinal damage and enhancing the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2951432469,"Infection control is necessary for improved burn wound regeneration. In this study contact burn wounds were induced on the dorsum of the rats and were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (107cfu/ml of saline) and left overnight (12–14 hours) to establish the infection. After 12 hours, the wounds were treated with PEGylated fibrin hydrogel containing 50 mgs of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) loaded chitosan microsphere (SSD-CSM-FPEG). On day 9, SSD-CSM-FPEG treated burn wounds further received adipose derived stem cell (5×104 ASCs cells/ml) embedded in PEGylated fibrin hydrogel. Wounds were assessed for the healing outcomes such as neovascularization, granulation tissue formation, wound closure and collagen maturation. Analysis of bacterial load in the burn wound biopsies, demonstrated that SSD–CSM-FPEG significantly reduced bacterial infection, while overt infection was still observed in the untreated groups on day 14. Sequential treatment of infected wounds with SSD–CSM-FPEG followed by ASC-FPEGs (SSD-CSM-ASC-FPEG) significantly reduced bacterial colonization (9 log reduction) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression. A significant increase in neovascularization markers; NG2 and vWF was also observed. Histological analysis indicated the wounds treated with SSD-CSM-ASC-FPEG increased amount of dermal collagen matrix deposition, a thicker granulation tissue on day 21 and more mature collagen on day 28. This work demonstrates that the sequential treatment of infected burn wounds with SSD-CSM-FPEG followed by ASC-FPEG reduces bacterial infection as well as promotes neo-vascularization with improved matrix remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2950767499,"Various altitude training regimes, systematically used to improve oxygen carrying capacity and sports performance, have been associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation. We investigated whether increased intake of common antioxidant-rich foods attenuates these processes.In a randomized controlled trial, 31 elite endurance athletes (23 ± 5 years), ingested antioxidant-rich foods (n = 16), (> doubling their usual intake), or eucaloric control foods (n = 15) during a 3-week altitude training camp (2320 m). Fasting blood and urine samples were collected 7 days pre-altitude, after 5 and 18 days at altitude, and 7 days post-altitude. Change over time was compared between the groups using mixed models for antioxidant capacity [uric acid-free (ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP)], oxidative stress (8-epi-PGF2α) and inflammatory biomarkers (IFNγ, IL1α, IL1RA, IL1β, IL2, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL17, TNFα, MCP-1 and micro-CRP). The cytokine response to a stress-test (VO2max ramp test or 100 m swimming) was assessed at pre- and post-altitude.FRAP increased more in the antioxidant compared to the control group (p = 0.034). IL13 decreased in the antioxidant group, while increasing in the controls (p = 0.006). A similar trend was seen for IL6 (p = 0.062). A larger decrease in micro-CRP was detected in the antioxidant group compared to controls (β: -0.62, p = 0.02). We found no group differences for the remaining cytokines. 8-epi-PGF2α increased significantly in the whole population (p = 0.033), regardless group allocation. The stress response was significantly larger post-altitude compared with pre-altitude for IL1β, IL6, IL7, IL13, IL12p70 and TNFα, but we found no group differences.Increased intake of antioxidant-rich foods elevated the antioxidant capacity and attenuated some of the altitude-induced systemic inflammatory biomarkers in elite athletes. The antioxidant intervention had no impact on the altitude-induced oxidative stress or changes in acute cytokine responses to exercise stress-tests."
https://openalex.org/W2951427932,"The outpatient therapeutic feeding program is one dimension of the Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) that provides screening, diagnostic and treatment services for children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). However, little is known about the program outcomes and factors affecting time to recovery.To determine median time of recovery and associated factors among under-five children with SAM treated at outpatient therapeutic feeding unit in Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2016.A facility-based retrospective cohort study supplemented with qualitative inquiry was conducted to analyze the records of 713 under-5 children with SAM that were randomly selected from four health centers and one hospital in Dire Dawa. In-depth interviews were conducted with five health professionals. Data was collected from the nutrition registration log book by using structured check lists. The collected data were entered into EPI-data version 3.1 software and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis using Kaplan Meir and Cox proportional hazard regression.The overall recovery rate was 569 (79.8%). Eighty (11.2%) defaulted, 27 (3.8%) were non-responders, 4 (0.6%) died and 15 (2.1%) were transferred-out. The median recovery time was 8.7 weeks (IQR: 5.0-14 weeks). Children with an admission weight of ≥7kg (AHR = 1.73, 95% CI: (1.41-2.14), children who were dewormed (AHR = 1.44, 95% CI: (1.01-2.06) and children with weight gain of ≥8g/kg/day (AHR = 5.76, 95% CI: (4.51-7.38) had higher probability of recovering faster. However, marasmic children stayed longer in treatment (AHR = 0.51, 95% CI: (0.37-0.71) and a low Plumpy Nut consumption rate (g/day) (AHR = 0.79) was associated with longer time of stay on treatment.The recovery rate was within the level specified in the Sphere International standards which is >75%. A higher weight at admission, taking deworming and a steady weight gain were positively associated with a fast recovery time. Appropriate nutritional therapy and management of SAM as per the national protocol will be helpful to overcome lower weight gain and higher length of stay on treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2952252457,"The Laban Movement Analysis system (LMA) is a widely used system for the description of human movement. Here we present results of an empirical analysis of the reliability of the LMA system. Firstly, we developed a directed graph-based representation for the formalization of LMA. Secondly, we implemented a custom video annotation tool for stimulus presentation and annotation of the formalized LMA. Using these two elements, we conducted an experimental assessment of LMA reliability. In the experimental assessment of the reliability, experts–Certified Movement Analysts (CMA)–were tasked with identifying the differences between a “neutral” movement and the same movement executed with a specific variation in one of the dimensions of the LMA parameter space. The videos represented variations on the pantomimed movement of knocking at a door or giving directions. To be as close as possible to the annotation practice of CMAs, participants were given full control over the number of times and order in which they viewed the videos. The LMA annotation was captured by means of the video annotation tool that guided the participants through the LMA graph by asking them multiple-choice questions at each node. Participants were asked to first annotate the most salient difference (round 1), and then the second most salient one (round 2) between a neutral and gesture and the variation. To quantify the overall reliability of LMA, we computed Krippendorff’s α. The quantitative data shows that the reliability, depending on how the two rounds are integrated, ranges between a weak and an acceptable reliability of LMA. The analysis of viewing behavior showed that, despite relatively large differences at the inter-individual level, there is no simple relationship between viewing behavior and individual performance (quantified as the level of agreement of the individual with the dominant rating). This research advances the state of the art in formalizing and implementing a reliability measure for the Laban Movement Analysis system. The experimental study we conducted allows identifying some of the strengths and weaknesses of the widely used movement coding system. Additionally, we have gained useful insights into the assessment procedure itself."

Due to a paucity of data, the capacity to care for critically ill patients in LMICs is largely unknown. Haiti has the lowest health indices in the Western Hemisphere. In this study, we report results of the first known nationwide survey of critical care capacity in Haiti.Nationwide, cross-sectional survey of Haitian hospitals in 2017-2018.Haiti.All Haitian health facilities with at least six hospital beds.Electronic- and paper-based survey.Of 51 health facilities identified, 39 (76.5%) from all ten Haitian administrative departments completed the survey, reporting 124 reported ICU beds nationally. Of facilities without an ICU, 20 (83.3%) care for critically ill patients in the emergency department. There is capacity to ventilate 62 patients nationally within ICUs and six patients outside of the ICU. One-third of facilities with ICUs report formal critical care training for their physicians. Only five facilities met criteria for a Level 1 ICU as defined by the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine. Self-identified barriers to providing more effective critical care services include lack of physical space for critically ill patients, lack of equipment, and few formally trained physicians and nurses.Despite a high demand for critical care services in Haiti, current capacity remains insufficient to meet need. A significant amount of critical care in Haiti is provided outside of the ICU, highlighting the important overlap between emergency and critical care medicine in LMICs. Many ICUs in Haiti lack basic components for critical care delivery. Streamlining critical care services through protocol development, education, and training may improve important clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2952650001,"Objective To investigate the potency of a hand-held point-of-care electronic-nose to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among those suspected of PTB. Methods Setting: Lung clinics and Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Participants: patients with suspected PTB and healthy controls. Sampling: 5 minutes exhaled breath. Sputum-smear-microscopy, culture, chest-radiography, and follow-up for 1.5–2.5 years, were used to classify patients with suspected PTB as active PTB, probably active PTB, probably no PTB, and no PTB. After building a breath model based on active PTB, no PTB, and healthy controls (Calibration phase), we validated the model in all patients with suspected PTB (Validation phase). In each variable (sex, age, Body Mass Index, co-morbidities, smoking status, consumption of alcohol, use of antibiotics, flu symptoms, stress, food and drink intake), one stratum’s Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-curve indicating sensitivity and specificity of the breath test was compared with another stratum’s ROC-curve. Differences between Area-under-the-Curve between strata (p<0.05) indicated an association between the variable and sensitivity—specificity of the breath test. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA/SE 15. Results Of 400 enrolled participants, 73 were excluded due to extra-pulmonary TB, incomplete data, previous TB, and cancer. Calibration phase involved 182 subjects, and the result was validated in 287 subjects. Sensitivity was 85% (95%CI: 75–92%) and 78% (95%CI: 70–85%), specificity was 55% (95%CI: 44–65%) and 42% (95%CI: 34–50%), in calibration and validation phases, respectively. Test sensitivity and specificity were lower in men. Conclusion The electronic-nose showed modest sensitivity and low specificity among patients with suspected PTB. To improve the sensitivity, a larger calibration group needs to be involved. With its portable form, it could be used for TB screening in remote rural areas and health care settings."
https://openalex.org/W2738515278,"As millions of children continue to live without parental care in under-resourced societies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), it is important for policymakers and practitioners to understand the specific characteristics within different care settings and the extent to which they are associated with outcomes of orphan and separated children (OSC). This study was designed to (1) examine if the psychosocial well-being of OSC in under-resourced societies in LMICs is more dependent on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the care setting itself (i.e. the residential care-based or community family-based setting), and (2) identify the relative significance of certain components of quality of care that are associated with a child’s psychosocial well-being across different OSC care settings. This study drew from 36-month follow-up data from the Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) Study and used a sample population of 2,013 (923 institution- and 1,090 community-based) OSC among six diverse study sites across five LMICs: Cambodia, India (Hyderabad and Nagaland), Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Analyses showed that all four components of quality of care significantly predicted child psychosocial well-being. Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care. Practical and policy implications and future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2952468090,"Health literacy is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of health outcomes, but definition, measurement tools, and interventions are lacking. Conceptual frameworks must include both individual and health-systems domains which, in combination, determine an individual's health literacy. Validated tools lack applicability in marginalized populations with very low educational levels, such as migrant worker communities on the Myanmar-Thailand border. We undertake a comprehensive health literacy assessment following a case study of a recent public health campaign promoting preconceptual folic acid uptake in this community. A mixed-methods design utilized quantitative analysis of the prevalence and predictors of low Health literacy, and focus group discussions to gather qualitative data from women about proposed and actual posters used in the campaign. Health literacy was measured with a locally developed tool that has been used in surveys of the population since 1995. Health literacy was low, with 194/525 (37.0%) of tested women demonstrating adequate health literacy, despite 63.1% (331/525) self-reporting being literate. Only one third of women had completed 4th grade or above and reported grade level attained in school was more predictive of health literacy than self-reported literacy. Focus group discussions revealed that low literacy, preconceived associations, and traditional health beliefs (individual domain) interacted with complex images, subtle concepts, and taboo images on posters (health-systems domain) to cause widespread misunderstandings of the visuals used in the campaign. The final poster still required explanation for clarity. Low health literacy is prevalent among pregnant women from this migrant community and barriers to communication are significant and complex. Public health posters need piloting prior to implementation as unanticipated misperceptions are common and difficult to overcome. Verbal communication remains a key method of messaging with individuals of low health literacy and educational system strengthening and audiovisual messaging are critical for improvement of health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2951873366,"Background Limited data is available about the etiology of influenza like illnesses (ILIs) in Qatar. Objectives This study aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in Qatar. Methods We retrospectively collected data of about 44,000 patients who visited Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Qatar between 2012 and 2017. All samples were tested for influenza viruses, whereas about 38,000 samples were tested for influenza and a panel of respiratory viruses using Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) RT-PCR kit. Results Among all ILIs cases, 20,278 (46.5%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Influenza virus was predominating (22.6%), followed by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (9.5%), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (5%). A detection rate of 2–3% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (>50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%). While males had higher rates of HRVs (11.9%), enteroviruses (1.1%) and MERS CoV (0.2%), females had higher proportions of influenza (26.3%), HPIVs (3.2%) and RSV (3.6%) infections. Conclusion This report provides a comprehensive insight about the epidemiology of ILIs among adults in the Qatar, as a representative of Gulf States. These results would help in improvement and optimization of diagnostic procedures, as well as control and prevention of the respiratory infections."
https://openalex.org/W2948755023,"Background In recent years, criticism of the percentage range approach for individualised exercise prescription has intensified and we were concerned that sub-optimal exercise dose (especially intensity) may be in part responsible for the variability in the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes in the United Kingdom (UK). The aim was to investigate the fidelity of a structured Phase III CR programme, by monitoring and quantifying exercise training intensity. Design Observational study. Methods The programme comprised 16 sessions over 8 weeks, where patients undertook an interval, circuit training approach within national guidelines for exercise prescription (40–70% heart rate reserve [HRR]). All patients wore an Apple Watch (Series 0 or 2, Watch OS2.0.1, Apple Inc., California, USA). We compared the mean % heart rate reserve (%HRR) achieved during the cardiovascular training component (%HRR-CV) of a circuit-based programme, with the %HRR during the active recovery phases (%HRR-AR) in a randomly selected cohort of patients attending standard CR. We then compared the mean %HRR-CV achieved with the minimal exercise intensity threshold during supervised exercise (40% HRR) recommended by national governing bodies. Results Thirty cardiac patients (83% male; mean age [SD] 67 [10] years; BMI 28.3 [4.6] kg∙m-2) were recruited. We captured 332 individual training sessions. The mean %HRR-CV and %HRR-AR were 37 (10) %, and 31 (13) %, respectively. There was weak evidence to support the alternative hypothesis of a difference between the %HRR-CV and 40% HRR. There was very strong evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis that the mean %HRR-AR was lower than the mean %HRR-CV, median standardised effect size 1.1 (95%CI: 0.563 to 1.669), with a moderate to large effect. Conclusion Mean exercise training intensity was below the lower limit of the minimal training intensity guidelines for a Phase III CR programme. These findings may be in part responsible for previous reports highlighting the significant variability in effectiveness of UK CR services and poor CRF improvements observed from several prior investigations."

Certain elements of antipsychotic treatment can only be examined in large population, thus the need for population-based real-world analyses has been increasing.Hungarian National Health Fund database includes all healthcare data of the population of Hungary. All patients diagnosed with schizophrenia between 01.01.2006 and 31.12.2015 were included in the study. We analyzed all patients with newly initiated second-generation antipsychotic during the inclusion period (01.01.2012-31.12.2013). Patients were followed for 2 years. All-cause treatment discontinuation served as the primary outcome of the study. Patients with newly initiated long-acting injectable treatments were further investigated in stratified analyses based on their previous treatment.106,624 patients had schizophrenia diagnosis during the study period. 12,232 patients met the inclusion criteria for newly initiating second-generation antipsychotic during the inclusion period. The proportion of patients still on treatment after 1 year for oral treatments varied between 17% (oral risperidone) and 31% (oral olanzapine) while the analogous data for long acting injectables were between 32% (risperidone long acting) and 64% (paliperidone long acting one monthly). The 2-year data were similarly in favor of long-actings. Median time to discontinuation in the oral group varied between 57 days (clozapine) and 121 days (olanzapine). The median time to discontinuation for long-actings was significantly longer: between 176 and 287 days; in case of paliperidone long acting, median was not reached during the observation period. Patients receiving long-acting treatment switched from another long-acting remained on the newly initiated treatment significantly longer than those switched from orals.Our results indicate the superiority of second generation long-acting antipsychotics with regard to rates of treatment discontinuation and periods of persistence to the assigned medication."
https://openalex.org/W2952264458,"Calciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening disease that classically manifests with painful skin lesions. It occurs mainly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with dialysis, has poor outcomes, and has no FDA-approved treatment. Our cohort study aims to examine the clinical and pathological features of calciphylaxis and investigates the correlation between cutaneous clinical manifestations and histopathological findings. Data from 70 calciphylaxis patients who were evaluated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between January 2014 and April 2018 were collected from the institutional electronic database. The median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 49-69 years), 60% were women, and 73% were of white race. Most (74%) patients reported severe pain at the time of calciphylaxis diagnosis with a median pain intensity score of 8/10 (IQR: 6-10) on a 0-10 pain scale. The median time from symptom onset to clinical diagnosis was 9 weeks (IQR: 6-16 weeks). The majority (87%) of patients presented with open necrotic wounds (advanced stage lesion) at the time of diagnosis. Common cutaneous clinical features included ulceration (79%), induration (57%), and erythema (41%), while common pathological features included cutaneous microvascular calcification (86%) and necrosis (73%). The presence of fibrin thrombi in skin biopsies was associated with pain severity (p = 0.04). The stage of a skin lesion positively correlated with the presence of necrosis on histological analyses (p = 0.02). These findings have implications for improving understanding of calciphylaxis origins and for developing novel treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2949405920,"Study objective Anesthesiologists at our hospital commonly administer spinal anesthesia for routine lumbar spine surgeries. Anecdotal impressions suggested that patients received fewer anesthesia–administered intravenous medications, including vasopressors, during spinal versus general anesthesia. We hypothesized that data review would confirm these impressions. The objective was to test this hypothesis by comparing specific elements of spinal versus general anesthesia for 1–2 level open lumbar spine procedures. Design Retrospective single institutional study. Setting Academic medical center, operating rooms. Patients Consecutive patients (144 spinal and 619 general anesthesia) identified by automatic structured query of our electronic anesthesia record undergoing lumbar decompression, foraminotomy or microdiscectomy by one surgeon under general or spinal anesthesia. Interventions Spinal or general anesthesia. Measurements Numbers of medications administered during the case. Main results Anesthesiologists administered in the operating room a total of 10 ± 2 intravenous medications for general anesthetics and 5 ± 2 medications for spinal anesthetics (-5, 95% CI -5 to -4, p<0.001, univariate analysis). Multivariable analysis supported this finding (spinal versus general anesthesia: -4, 95% CI -5 to -4, p<0.001). Spinal anesthesia patients were less likely to receive ephedrine, or phenylephrine (by bolus or by infusion) (all p<0.001, Chi-squared test). Spinal anesthesia patients were also less likely to receive labetolol or esmolol (both p = 0.002, Fishers’ Exact test). No neurologic injuries were attributed to, or masked by, spinal anesthesia. Three spinal anesthetics failed. Conclusions For routine lumbar surgery in our cohort, spinal compared to general anesthesia was associated with significantly fewer drugs administered during a case and less frequent use of vasoactive agents. Safety implications include greater hemodynamic stability with spinal anesthesia along with reduced risks for medication error and transmission of pathogens associated with medication administration."

However, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has also gained acceptance, but only in Japan. We explored the role of body composition as a factor affecting the survival benefit of HAIC compared to sorafenib for the treatment of advanced HCC.We conducted a retrospective study using the clinical records of 133 patients with advanced HCC treated either with HAIC or sorafenib. Prior to treatment induction, skeletal muscle index and visceral fat area (VFA) were measured at the third lumbar vertebral and umbilical levels, respectively, using computed tomography. Muscle depletion and high-VFA (H-VFA) were defined using published cut-offs. We analyzed clinical parameters, including body composition as prognostic factors.In the HAIC group, multivariate analysis identified a positive response to HAIC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.438; p = 0.022), and conversion from HAIC to sorafenib (HR, 0.374; p = 0.008) as favorable prognostic factors for survival. In contrast, tumor number < 7 (HR, 0.475; p = 0.008), absence of extra-hepatic spread (HR, 0.511; p = 0.015), absence of muscle depletion (HR, 0.555; p = 0.044), and H-VFA (HR, 0.483; p = 0.015) were studied in the sorafenib group.Body composition was identified as a prognostic factor for patient survival after treatment with sorafenib, but not for HAIC, and may be used as a biomarker when selecting between HAIC or sorafenib treatment of patients with advanced HCC. Additionally, conversion to sorafenib in patients receiving HAIC could improve survival regardless of response status."
https://openalex.org/W2952596733,"The importance of nest characteristics for birds breeding in the extreme climate conditions of polar regions, has been greatly understudied. Nest parameters, like nest orientation, exposure and insulation, could strongly influence microclimate and protection against precipitation of the nest, thereby affecting breeding success. A burrow nesting seabird, the Wilson’s storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) is an excellent model species to investigate the importance of nest characteristics, as it is the smallest endotherm breeding in the Antarctic. Here, we investigated the effects of nest parameters such as internal nest dimensions, nest micro-topography and thermal properties of the nest burrow and the influence of weather conditions on breeding output, measured as hatching success, chick survival, and chick growth. We collected data during the austral summers of 2017 and 2018, on King George Island, maritime Antarctica. Our results showed that the thermal microclimate of the nest burrow was significantly improved by a small entrance size, a low nest height, and insulation and tended to be enhanced by a low wind exposition index and an eastern nest site orientation. In addition, an eastern nest site orientation significantly reduced the chance of snow blocking. However, the relationships between nest characteristics and breeding output were complex and might be affected by other parameters like food availability and parental quality. The relation between chick growth and nest air temperature remained especially indistinct. Nevertheless, our results indicate that nest characteristics that enhance the thermal microclimate and reduce the risk of snow blocking favoured both hatching success and chick survival. Due to climate change in the Antarctic, snowfall is expected to increase in the future, which will likely enhance the importance of nest characteristics that determine snow blocking. Additionally, despite global warming, thermally favourable nest burrows will likely still be advantageous in the highly variable and challenging Antarctic climate."
https://openalex.org/W2944976875,"The construction of large renewable energy projects is characterized by the great uncertainties associated with their administrative complexity and their constructive characteristics. For proper management, it is necessary to undertake a thorough project risk assessment prior to construction. The work presented in this paper is based on a hierarchical risk structure identified by a group of experts, from which a Probabilistic Fuzzy Sets with Analysis Hierarchy Process (PFSAHP) was applied. This probabilistic analysis approach used expert opinion based on the Monte Carlo Method that allows for extracting more information from the original data. In addition, the coherence of the experts’ opinions is assessed using a novel parameter known as Confidence Level, which allows for adjusting the opinions of experts and weighting their judgments regarding impact and probability according to their coherence. This model has the advantage of offering a risk analysis in the early stages of the management of renewable energy projects in which there is no detailed information. This model is also more accurate than the classic fuzzy methodology when working with complete distribution functions, whilst it avoids the loss of information that results from the traditional mathematical operations with Fuzzy numbers. To test the model, it was applied to a 250 MW photovoltaic solar plant construction project located in southeast of Spain (Region of Murcia). As a result of the application of the proposed method, risk rankings are obtained with respect to the cost, the time, the scope and from a general point of view of the project."
https://openalex.org/W2950703594,"In this study, we perform a full genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify statistically significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with three red blood cell (RBC) components and follow it with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between phenotypic data (case-control status of diagnoses or disease), significant SNPs, and RBC component levels. We first identified associations between the three RBC components: mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet counts (PC), and the genotypes of approximately 500,000 SNPs on the Illumina Infimum DNA Human OmniExpress-24 BeadChip using a single cohort of 4,673 Northern Nevadans. Twenty-one SNPs in five major genomic regions were found to be statistically significantly associated with MPV, two regions with MCV, and one region with PC, with p<5x10-8. Twenty-nine SNPs and nine chromosomal regions were identified in 30 previous GWASs, with effect sizes of similar magnitude and direction as found in our cohort. The two strongest associations were SNP rs1354034 with MPV (p = 2.4x10-13) and rs855791 with MCV (p = 5.2x10-12). We then examined possible associations between these significant SNPs and incidence of 1,488 phenotype groups mapped from International Classification of Disease version 9 and 10 (ICD9 and ICD10) codes collected in the extensive electronic health record (EHR) database associated with Healthy Nevada Project consented participants. Further leveraging data collected in the EHR, we performed an additional PheWAS to identify associations between continuous red blood cell (RBC) component measures and incidence of specific diagnoses. The first PheWAS illuminated whether SNPs associated with RBC components in our cohort were linked with other hematologic phenotypic diagnoses or diagnoses of other nature. Although no SNPs from our GWAS were identified as strongly associated to other phenotypic components, a number of associations were identified with p-values ranging between 1x10-3 and 1x10-4 with traits such as respiratory failure, sleep disorders, hypoglycemia, hyperglyceridemia, GERD and IBS. The second PheWAS examined possible phenotypic predictors of abnormal RBC component measures: a number of hematologic phenotypes such as thrombocytopenia, anemias, hemoglobinopathies and pancytopenia were found to be strongly associated to RBC component measures; additional phenotypes such as (morbid) obesity, malaise and fatigue, alcoholism, and cirrhosis were also identified to be possible predictors of RBC component measures."
https://openalex.org/W2953197092,"Recent studies have highlighted the implications of genetic variations in the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beam irradiation over conventional X-ray irradiation. Proton beam radiotherapy is a reasonable radiotherapy option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the impact of genetic difference on the HCC RBE remains unknown. Here, we determined proton RBE in human HCC cells by exposing them to various doses of either 6-MV X-rays or 230-MeV proton beams. Clonogenic survival assay revealed variable radiosensitivity of human HCC cell lines with survival fraction at 2 Gy ranging from 0.38 to 0.83 and variable proton RBEs with 37% survival fraction ranging from 1.00 to 1.48. HCC cells appeared more sensitive to proton irradiation than X-rays, with more persistent activation of DNA damage repair proteins over time. Depletion of a DNA damage repair gene, DNA-PKcs, by siRNA dramatically increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to proton beams with a decrease in colony survival and an increase in apoptosis. Our findings suggest that there are large variations in proton RBE in HCC cells despite the use of a constant RBE of 1.1 in the clinic and targeting DNA-PKcs in combination with proton beam therapy may be a promising regimen for treating HCC."

Until now, most studies have been limited to varroa-honey bee or virus-honey bee interactions. The aim of this study is to bridge the important research gap of varroa-virus interactions by correlating varroa behavior with viral load. Ten-minute video recordings of 200 varroa mites were analyzed, and average speeds of the mites were compared to individual qPCR viral loads for deformed wing virus (DWV) and sacbrood virus (SBV). Statistically significant models reveal that colony, DWV, and SBV all might play a role in mite behavior, suggesting that the varroa-virus interaction needs to be an integral part of future studies on honey bee pathogens."

While some terms are promoted as more sensitive than others, empirical research exploring the views of people affected by suicide to inform academic and media guidelines is lacking.An anonymous, cross-sectional online survey was promoted opportunistically via online channels. Participation was requested from adults affected by suicide. Participants were asked to rate descriptors pertaining to suicidal behaviour according to perceived acceptability. A descriptive analysis of quantitative data was conducted alongside thematic content analysis of free-text data.There were 2,719 responses, of which 1,679 (61·8%) were complete. Of phrases describing non-fatal suicidal behaviour, ""attempted suicide"" had the highest median acceptability score. Of phrases describing fatal suicidal behaviour, ""took their own life"" and ""died by suicide"" had the highest median acceptability scores. The scores for ""commit suicide"" were most variable and spanned the range of acceptability scores. Free text data illustrated the nuances in decision-making.Variation in opinion exists amongst people affected by suicide regarding most phrases, often depending on contextual factors. ""Attempted suicide"", ""took their own life"", ""died by suicide"" and ""ended their life"" were however considered most acceptable. We argue that academic and media guidelines should promote use of these phrases."

Using an equity lens, this study aimed to investigate the social determinants of child health in one particularly vulnerable district as a means of informing the health policy decision-making process. An exploratory qualitative study design was adopted, combining focus group discussions and qualitative interviews. Seven Focus Group Discussions with mothers of young children, and 21 qualitative interviews with health workers were conducted in Wolkayit district in May-June 2015. Data were subjected to thematic analysis. Mothers’ knowledge regarding the major causes of child mortality appeared to be good, and they also knew about and trusted the available child health interventions. However, utilization and practice of these interventions was limited by a range of issues, including cultural factors, financial shortages, limited female autonomy on financial resources, seasonal mobility, and inaccessible or unaffordable health services. Our findings pointed to the importance of a multi-sectoral strategy to improve child health equity and reduce under-5 mortality in Wolkayit. Recommendations include further decentralizing child health services to local-level Health Posts, and increasing the number of Health Facilities based on local topography and living conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2949372319,"Introduction Long-term head-down bed rest (HDBR) results in musculoskeletal losses similar to those observed during long-term space flight. Agents such as testosterone, in addition to regular exercise, are effective countermeasures for reducing loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Objective We investigated the skeletal muscle proteome of healthy men in response to long term HDBR alone (CON) and to HDBR with exercise (PEX) or exercise plus testosterone (TEX) countermeasures. Method Biopsies were performed on the vastus lateralis before (pre) HDBR and on HDBR days 32 (mid) and 64 (post). Extracted proteins from these skeletal muscle biopsies were subjected to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), stained for phosphoproteins (Pro-Q Diamond dye) and total proteins (Sypro Ruby dye). Proteins showing significant fold differences (t-test p ≤ 0.05) in abundance or phosphorylation state at mid or post were identified by mass spectroscopy (MS). Results From a total of 932 protein spots, 130 spots were identified as potentially altered in terms of total protein or phosphoprotein levels due to HDBR and/or countermeasures, and 59 unique molecules emerged from MS analysis. Top canonical pathways identified through IPA included calcium signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, integrin linked kinase (ILK) signaling, and epithelial adherens junction signaling. Data from the pre-HDBR proteome supported the potential for predicting physiological post-HDBR responses such as the individual’s potential for loss vs. maintenance of muscle mass and strength. Conclusions HDBR resulted in alterations to skeletal muscle abundances and phosphorylation of several structural and metabolic proteins. Inclusion of exercise alone or in combination with testosterone treatment modulated the proteomic responses towards cellular reorganization and hypertrophy, respectively. Finally, the baseline proteome may aid in the development of personalized countermeasures to mitigate health risks in astronauts as related to loss of muscle mass and function."

https://openalex.org/W2950962063,"Background Non-malarial febrile illnesses comprise of almost half of all fever presenting morbidities, among under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies have reported cases of prescription of antimalarial medications to these febrile under-fives who were negative for malaria. The treatment of these children with antimalarial medications increases incidences of antimalarial drug resistance as well as further morbidities and mortalities, due to failure to treat the actual underlying causes of fever. Aim To identify clinical and demographic factors associated with treatment type (malarial/non-malarial) of non-malarial febrile illnesses (NMFI) in children aged ≤5 at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A positivist epistemological approach, cross sectional descriptive study design was used. A structured questionnaire was used on a sample of 341 medical records of children aged ≤5 years to extract data on clinical examinations (recorded as yes or no), diagnostic test results, and demographic data on the child’s sex and age. Descriptive and inferential analysis was applied to the data. Results Prescription of antimalarial drugs despite negative microscopy results was found in 44 (12.9%) of the children, with mortality reported in 48 (14.1%). Assessment of respiratory distress was 0.13 (0.03,0.58) times associated with less likelihood of prescribing an antimalarial in those with a negative microscopy. A male patient was 0.21 (0.05,0.89) times less likely to receive an intravenous antimalarial after a negative microscopy. Patients aged ˂1 with a negative microscopy result were more likely to receive an antimalarial than older children. Conclusion There is a need to eliminate incorrect treatment of NMFI with antimalarial medication, while ensuring correct diagnosis and treatment of the specific illness occurs. This requires strengthening and adherence to diagnostic and treatment guidelines of febrile illnesses in under-fives, consequently reducing morbidities and mortalities associated with inadequate management of NMFIs."
https://openalex.org/W2951086575,"Climate change has altered the global distribution of many species. Accordingly, we have assessed here the potential shift in the distribution of Gypsophila bermejoi G. López under distinct scenarios of future climate change, this being a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. For strict gypsophiles, climatic changes affecting their potential area of distribution could be critical if the new range is not overlapped with suitable soils. Thus, the narrow bioclimatic niche and the endemic nature of this plant could make this species particularly vulnerable to climate change. We used the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method to study the potential distribution of this taxon under four different scenarios of climate change, pin-pointing relevant changes in the potential distribution of this plant and enabling possible future areas of refuge to be assessed. Such scenarios are defined according to four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) [, which represent different trends in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. As a result, we predict notable changes in the potential distribution of G. bermejoi, and the overlap between soil and bioclimatic suitability would be affected. We also used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to model the bioclimatic niche of this species, comparing it with that of its parental taxa. The evolution of bioclimatic suitability was assessed at the current locations of G. bermejoi and as this plant is a strict gypsophile, we generated suitability maps for sites with gypsum soils. Ultimately, this study identifies relevant changes in the potential distribution of G. bermejoi under specific climatic scenarios, observing remarkable differences in the outcomes of the different climate change scenarios. Interestingly, in some scenarios the bioclimatic suitability of G. bermejoi will be enhanced at many locations and even in the worst scenario some possible refuge areas were identified. G. bermejoi behaves more like a hardy survivor than as early victim."
https://openalex.org/W2951539873,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ) is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system as two transmembrane receptor isoforms PTPRZ-A/B and one secretory isoform PTPRZ-S. Ptprz-knockout mice lacking the expression of all three isoforms show behavioral, learning, and neurological abnormalities, including increased exploratory activities to novelty, deficits in spatial and contextual learning, and reduced responses to methamphetamine, relative to wild-type mice. To investigate whether PTPRZ isoforms play distinct physiological roles, we herein performed behavioral studies on two knock-in mouse lines: One expresses the catalytically inactive Cys-1930 to Ser (CS) mutants of PTPRZ-A/B, while the other generated in the present study expresses catalytically active mutants of PTPRZ-A/B lacking the negative regulatory PTP-D2 domain and C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (ΔD2) instead of wild-type PTPRZ-A/-B. In contrast to Ptprz-knockout mice, neither increased responses to novelty in the open field nor memory impairments in the inhibitory-avoidance task were observed in Ptprz-CS or Ptprz-ΔD2 mice. However, the effects of methamphetamine on locomotor activity were significantly weaker in Ptprz-KO mice and CS mutant mice than in wild-type mice, but were normal in ΔD2 mutant mice. Furthermore, microdialysis experiments revealed that methamphetamine-evoked dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in Ptprz-KO mice and CS mutant mice. These results suggest that the extracellular region of PTPRZ, including the secretory isoform, is crucial for behavioral responses to novelty and the formation of aversive memories, whereas the PTPase activities of PTPRZ receptor isoforms are involved in regulating the dopaminergic system."
https://openalex.org/W2952018718,"This paper explores how personality factors affect substance use disorders (SUDs) using explanatory item response modeling (EIRM). A total of 606 Chinese illicit drug users participated in our study. After removing the cases with missing values on the covariate measures, a final sample of 573 participants was used for data analysis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was used to measure the illicit drug users’ SUD level. Four personality factors–anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, sensation seeking and hopelessness–along with gender and alcohol use were included in EIRM as person covariates. The results indicated that gender, alcohol use, and their interaction significantly predicted the SUD level. The only personality factor that strongly predicted the SUD level was sensation seeking. In addition, the interaction between gender and hopelessness was also found to be a significant predictor of the SUD level, indicating that the negative effect of hopelessness on SUD is stronger for women than for men. The findings suggest that sensation seeking plays an important role in influencing SUDs, and thus, it should be considered when designing intervention or screening procedures for potential illicit drug users. In addition, several DSM-5 SUD symptoms were found to exhibit differential effects by gender, alcohol use, and personality factors. The possible explanations were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2950201844,"Uniting diverse stakeholders through communication, education or building a collaborative 'common vision' for biodiversity management is a recommended approach for enabling effective conservation in regions with multiple uses. However, socially focused strategies such as building a collaborative vision can require sharing scarce resources (time and financial resources) with the on-ground management actions needed to achieve conservation outcomes. Here we adapt current prioritisation tools to predict the likely return on the financial investment of building a stakeholder-led vision along with a portfolio of on-ground management strategies. Our approach brings together and analyses expert knowledge to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a common vision strategy and on-ground management strategies, before any investments in these strategies are made. We test our approach in an intensively-used Australian biodiversity hotspot with 179 threatened or at-risk species. Experts predicted that an effective stakeholder vision for the region would have a relatively low cost and would significantly increase the feasibility of on-ground management strategies. As a result, our analysis indicates that a common vision is likely to be a cost-effective investment, increasing the expected persistence of threatened species in the region by 9 to 52%, depending upon the strategies implemented. Our approach can provide the maximum budget that is worth investing in building a common vision or another socially focused strategy for building support for on-ground conservation actions. The approach can assist with decisions about whether and how to allocate scarce resources amongst social and ecological actions for biodiversity conservation in other regions worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2950842261,"Glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium is currently the most popular biomaterial utilized in the creation of bioprosthetic heart valves. However, recent studies indicate that glutaraldehyde fixation results in calcification and structural valve deterioration, limiting the longevity of bioprosthetic heart valves. Additionally, glutaraldehyde fixation renders the tissue incompatible with constructive recipient cellular repopulation, remodeling and growth. Use of unfixed xenogeneic biomaterials devoid of antigenic burden has potential to overcome the limitations of current glutaraldehyde-fixed biomaterials. Heart valves undergo billion cycles of opening and closing throughout the patient’s lifetime. Therefore, understanding the response of unfixed tissues to cyclic loading is crucial to these in a heart valve leaflet configuration. In this manuscript we quantify the effect of cyclic deformation on cycle dependent strain, structural, compositional and mechanical properties of fixed and unfixed tissues. Glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium underwent marked cyclic dependent strain, resulting from significant changes in structure, composition and mechanical function of the material. Conversely, unfixed bovine pericardium underwent minimal strain and maintained its structure, composition and mechanical integrity. This manuscript demonstrates that unfixed bovine pericardium can withstand cyclic deformations equivalent to 6 months of in vivo heart valve leaflet performance."
https://openalex.org/W2951609865,"Pneumonia is the most common bacterial infection in children at the emergency department (ED). Clinical prediction models for childhood pneumonia have been developed (using chest x-ray as their reference standard), but without implementation in clinical practice. Given current insights in the diagnostic limitations of chest x-ray, this study aims to validate these prediction models for a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and to explore their potential to guide decisions on antibiotic treatment at the ED.We systematically identified clinical prediction models for childhood pneumonia and assessed their quality. We evaluated the validity of these models in two populations, using a clinical reference standard (1. definite/probable bacterial, 2. bacterial syndrome, 3. unknown bacterial/viral, 4. viral syndrome, 5. definite/probable viral), measuring performance by the ordinal c-statistic (ORC). Validation populations included prospectively collected data of children aged 1 month to 5 years attending the ED of Rotterdam (2012-2013) or Coventry (2005-2006) with fever and cough or dyspnoea.We identified eight prediction models and could evaluate the validity of seven, with original good performance. In the Dutch population 22/248 (9%) had a bacterial infection, in Coventry 53/301 (17%), antibiotic prescription was 21% and 35% respectively. Three models predicted a higher risk in children with bacterial infections than in those with viral disease (ORC ≥0.55) and could identify children at low risk of bacterial infection.Three clinical prediction models for childhood pneumonia could discriminate fairly well between a clinical reference standard of bacterial versus viral infection. However, they all require the measurement of biomarkers, raising questions on the exact target population when implementing these models in clinical practice. Moreover, choosing optimal thresholds to guide antibiotic prescription is challenging and requires careful consideration of potential harms and benefits."

Wistar Kyoto rats are a common model for the study of cardiovascular diseases, but we lack a profile of the baseline transcriptomic and neurochemical characteristics of their cardiac sympathetic neurons. Most studies of cardiovascular disease have used male animals only, but in the future both male and female animals will be used for these types of studies; therefore, we sought to characterize the transcriptome of male and female stellate ganglia and to correlate that with catecholamine and acetylcholine content in the heart. We have generated a dataset of baseline RNA expression in male and female Wistar Kyoto rat stellate ganglia using RNA-seq, and have measured neurotransmitter levels in heart and stellate ganglia using HPLC and mass spectrometry. We identified numerous gene expression differences between male and female stellates, including genes encoding important developmental factors, receptors and neuropeptides. Female hearts had significantly higher neurotransmitter content than male hearts; however, no significant differences were detected in expression of the genes encoding neurotransmitter synthetic enzymes. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were identified between the sexes in cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase levels."
https://openalex.org/W2949585116,"Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) methylation is a well-known epigenetic mark that is involved in gene regulation and may impact genome stability. To investigate a possible role of 5hmC in cancer development and progression, one must be able to detect and quantify its level first. In this paper, we address the issue of 5hmC detection at a single base resolution, starting with consideration of the well-established 5hmC measure Δβ and, in particular, with an analysis of its properties, both analytically and empirically. Then we propose several alternative hydroxymethylation measures and compare their properties with those of Δβ. In the absence of a gold standard, the (pairwise) resemblance of those 5hmC measures to Δβ is characterized by means of a similarity analysis and relative accuracy analysis. All results are illustrated on matched healthy and cancer tissue data sets as derived by means of bisulfite (BS) and oxidative bisulfite converting (oxBS) procedures."

We developed and implemented a survey tool aiming to assess the knowledge of urogenital schistosomiasis (treatment, transmission, prevention, symptoms) among science teaches and primary and junior high school students in the Eastern Region of Ghana.We developed a 22-question knowledge survey tool and administered it to 875 primary and 938 junior high school students from 74 schools in 37 communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Teachers (n = 57) answered 20 questions matched to student questions. We compared knowledge scores (as percent of correct answers) across topics, gender, and class year and assessed associations with teacher's knowledge scores using t-tests, chi-squared tests, univariate, and multivariate linear regression, respectively.Students performed best when asked about symptoms (mean±SD: 76±21% correct) and prevention (mean±SD: 69±25% correct) compared with transmission (mean±SD: 50±15% correct) and treatment (mean±SD: 44±23% correct) (p<0.0005). Teachers performed best on prevention (mean±SD: 93±12% correct, p<0.0005) and poorest on treatment (mean±SD: 69±16% correct, p<0.001). When listing five facts about urogenital schistosomiasis, teachers averaged 2.9±1.2 correct. Multiple regression models suggest that gender, class year, teacher score, and town of residency explain ~27% of variability in student scores. On average, junior high school students outperformed primary school students by 10.2 percentage points (CI95%: 8.6-11.8); boys outperformed girls by 3.5 percentage points (CI95%: 2.3-4.7).Our survey parsed four components of student and teacher knowledge. We found strong knowledge in several realms, as well as knowledge gaps, especially on transmission and treatment. Addressing relevant gaps among students and science teachers in UGS-endemic areas may help high-risk groups recognize risky water contact activities, improve participation in mass drug administration, and spark interest in science by making it practical."
https://openalex.org/W2952833246,"Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) genes encode receptors, which are mainly expressed on, and control functional activities of, Natural Killer (NK) cells. There exist six distinct activating KIR genes in humans, who differ from one another with respect to the repertoire of these genes. Because activated NK cells can potentially cause tissue destruction, we hypothesized that variation in the inherited activating KIR genes in humans is associated with their innate susceptibility/resistance to developing Crohn disease (CD).We performed case control studies on three independent Canadian CD patient cohorts (all of the Western European descent): two comprising children (Montreal having 193 cases and 245 controls, and Ottawa having 93 cases and 120 controls) and the third one comprising predominantly adults (Winnipeg having 164 cases and 200 controls). We genotyped cases and controls for activating KIR genes by PCR with gene-specific primers and investigated associations between the genes and cases using unconditional logistic regression.We observed strong associations between all the six KIR genes and CD in Ottawa children, with the strongest risk observed for the KIR2DS1 (p = 1.7 x10-10). Associations between all but the KIR2DS2 were replicated in the Montreal cohort with the strongest association evident for the KIR2DS5 (8.0 x 10-10). Similarly associations between five genes were observed in the adult Winnipeg cohort. In this cohort, strongest associations were evident with the KIR2DS5 (8.75 x 10-8). An overall analysis for all cohorts showed strong associations with four of the genes, with the strongest association evident for the KIR2DS5 (p = 1.35 x 10-17). In the combined analysis for four KIR genes, individuals carrying one or more of the KIR genes were at significantly higher risks for acquiring CD (p = 3.5 x 10-34).Activating KIR genes are associated with risk for developing CD in both children and adults."
https://openalex.org/W2953236183,"In this paper, a new prediction approach is proposed for ocean vessel heave compensation based on echo state network (ESN). To improve the prediction accuracy and enhance the robustness against noise and outliers, a generalized similarity measure called correntropy is introduced into ESN training, which is referred as corr-ESN. An iterative method based on half-quadratic minimization is derived to train corr-ESN. The proposed corr-ESN is used for the heave motion prediction. The experimental results verify its effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2949494331,"The reuse of business processes (BPs) requires similarities between them to be suitably identified. Various approaches have been introduced to address this problem, but many of them feature a high computational cost and a low level of automation. This paper presents a clustering algorithm that groups business processes retrieved from a multimodal search system (based on textual and structural information). The algorithm is based on Incremental Covering Arrays (ICAs) with different alphabets to determine the possible number of groups to be created for each row of the ICA. The proposed algorithm also incorporates Balanced Bayesian Information Criterion to determine the optimal number of groups and the best solution for each query. Experimental evaluation shows that the use of ICAs with strength four (4) and different alphabets reduces the number of solutions needed to be evaluated and optimizes the number of clusters. The proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in various measures (precision, recall, and F-measure) by between 12% and 88%. Friedman and Wilcoxon non-parametric tests gave a 90-95% significance level to the obtained results. Better options of repository search for BPs help companies to reuse them. By thus reusing BPs, managers and analysts can more easily get to know the evolution and trajectory of the company processes, a situation that could be expected to lead to improved managerial and commercial decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2951888019,"Following years of controversy regarding screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen, evidence evolves towards a more restrained and preference-based use. This study reports the impact of landmark trials and updated recommendations on the incidence rate of prostate cancer screening by Swiss general practitioners.We performed a retrospective analysis of primary care data, separated in 3 time periods based on dates of publications of important prostate-specific antigen screening recommendations. 1: 2010-mid 2012 including 2 updates; 2: mid 2012-mid 2014 including a Smarter Medicine recommendation; 3: mid-2014-mid-2017 maintenance period. Period 2 including the Smarter Medicine recommendation was defined as reference period. We further assessed the influence of patient's age and the number of prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) tests, by the patient and within each time period, on the mean PSA concentration. Uni- and multivariable analyses were used as needed.36,800 men aged 55 to 75 years were included. 14.6% had ≥ 2 chronic conditions, 11.7% had ≥ 1 prostate-specific antigen test, (mean 2.60 ng/ml [SD 12.3]). 113,921 patient-years were covered. Data derived from 221 general practitioners, 33.5% of GP were women, mean age was 49.4 years (SD 10.0), 67.9% used prostate-specific antigen testing. Adjusted incidence rate-ratio (95%-CI) dropped significantly over time periods: Reference Period 2: incidence rate-ratio 1.00; Period 1: incidence rate-ratio 1.74 (1.59-1.90); Period 3: incidence rate-ratio 0.61 (0.56-0.67). A higher number of chronic conditions and a patient age between 60-69 years were significantly associated with higher screening rate. Increasing numbers of PSA testing per patient, as well as increasing age, were independently and significantly associated with an increase in the PSA value.Swiss general practitioners adapted screening behavior as early as evidence of a limited health benefit evolved, while using a risk-adapted approach whenever performing multiple testing. Updated recommendations might have helped to maintain this decrease. Further recommendations and campaigns should aimed at older patients with multimorbidity, to sustain a further decline in prostate-specific antigen screening practices."
https://openalex.org/W2952727870,"In this study, we propose a method for predicting the supporting pressure required for shallow tunnels in layered soils, based on a curved roof collapse mechanism with multi-failure surfaces. In this method, the effect of the number and thickness of soil layers, pore water pressure, arbitrary roof profile, and ground additional load is considered simultaneously. A nonlinear power-law failure criterion is employed to describe the failure characteristics of the roof soils. The internal energy dissipation rate and the work rates produced by external forces are obtained based on the associated flow rule and plasticity potential theory. The analytical expressions of the required supporting pressure and roof collapse surfaces are obtained with the upper bound method. Furtherly, a shallow rectangular tunnel in two soil layers is selected for parametric investigation. The change laws of the required supporting pressure and collapse curves under varying parameters are obtained. Furthermore, the corresponding engineering recommendations are given, which may potentially provide references for the support design and construction of shallow tunnels in layered strata."
