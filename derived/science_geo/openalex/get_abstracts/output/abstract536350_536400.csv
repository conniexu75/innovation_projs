https://openalex.org/W2104281360,"We experimentally observe many-body localization of interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-random optical lattice. We identify the many-body localization transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially-prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all remnants of the initial order. In contrast, above a critical disorder strength a significant portion of the initial ordering persists, thereby serving as an effective order parameter for localization. The stationary density wave order and the critical disorder value show a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, in agreement with numerical simulations. We connect this dependence to the ubiquitous logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy characterizing the generic many-body localized phase."

The evolved gas analyzer Cometary Sampling and Composition (COSAC) experiment aboard Rosetta's Philae lander was designed for in situ analysis of organic molecules on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Twenty-five minutes after Philae's initial comet touchdown, the COSAC mass spectrometer took a spectrum in sniffing mode, which displayed a suite of 16 organic compounds, including many nitrogen-bearing species but no sulfur-bearing species, and four compounds—methyl isocyanate, acetone, propionaldehyde, and acetamide—that had not previously been reported in comets."
https://openalex.org/W2141137078,"Estimating bacterial growth dynamics The pattern of sequencing read coverage of bacteria in metagenomic samples reflects the growth rate. This pattern is predictive of growth because bacterial genomes are circular, with a single origin of replication. So during growth, copies of the genome accumulate at the origin. Korem et al. use the ratio of copy number at the origin to the copy number at the terminus to detect the actively growing species in a microbiome (see the Perspective by Segre). They could spot the difference between virulent and avirulent strains, population diurnal oscillations, species that are growing in irritable bowel disease, and what happens when a host's diet changes. Results were consistent in chemostats, in mice, and in human fecal samples. Science , this issue p. 1101 ; see also p. 1058"

https://openalex.org/W1933048492,"Infected cells detect viruses through a variety of receptors that initiate cell-intrinsic innate defense responses. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic sensor for many DNA viruses and HIV-1. In response to cytosolic viral DNA, cGAS synthesizes the second messenger 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates antiviral signaling pathways. We show that in cells producing virus, cGAS-synthesized cGAMP can be packaged in viral particles and extracellular vesicles. Viral particles efficiently delivered cGAMP to target cells. cGAMP transfer by viral particles to dendritic cells activated innate immunity and antiviral defenses. Finally, we show that cell-free murine cytomegalovirus and Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus contained cGAMP. Thus, transfer of cGAMP by viruses may represent a defense mechanism to propagate immune responses to uninfected target cells."

Here we report the precise circumstances of the multiple landings of Philae, including the bouncing trajectory and rebound parameters, based on engineering data in conjunction with operational instrument data. These data also provide information on the mechanical properties (strength and layering) of the comet surface. The first touchdown site, Agilkia, appears to have a granular soft surface (with a compressive strength of 1 kilopascal) at least ~20 cm thick, possibly on top of a more rigid layer. The final landing site, Abydos, has a hard surface."
https://openalex.org/W2102164310,"Viruses pack antiviral mediators Viruses often hijack host proteins for their own use, turning host cells into virion-spewing machines. However, Bridgeman et al. and Gentili et al. now report a sneaky way that the host can fight back (see the Perspective by Schoggins). Host cells that expressed the enzyme cGAS, an innate immune receptor that senses cytoplasmic DNA, packaged the cGAS-generated second messenger cGAMP into virions. Virions could then transfer cGAMP to neighboring cells, triggering an antiviral gene program in these newly infected cells. Such transfer of an antiviral mediator may help to speed up the immune response to put the brakes on viral spread. Science , this issue pp. 1228 and 1232 ; see also p. 1166"
https://openalex.org/W2101429257,"Microbiota can mislead antibodies Unlike the response to many viral infections, most people do not produce antibodies capable of clearing HIV-1. Non-neutralizing antibodies that target HIV-1's envelope glycoprotein (Env) typically dominate the response, which is generated by B cells that cross-react with Env and the intestinal microbiota. Williams et al. analyzed samples from individuals who had received a vaccine containing the Env protein, including the gp41 subunit. Most of the antibodies were non-neutralizing and targeted gp41. The antibodies also reacted to intestinal microbiota, suggesting that preexisting immunity to microbial communities skews vaccineinduced immune responses toward an unproductive target.

However, Yoon et al. now describe a previously unrecognized function of p53 (see the Perspective by Zitvogel and Kroemer). p53 induces expression of the gene encoding DD1α, a receptor-like transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In conditions of stress, p53 activation can lead to cell death. p53-induced expression of DD1α also promotes the clearance of dead cells by promoting engulfment by macrophages. Furthermore, expression of DD1α on T cells inhibits T cell function. Thus, p53 offers protection from inflammatory disease caused by the accumulation of apoptotic cells, and its suppression of T cells might help cancer cells to escape immune detection.

The properties of cometary material thus provide insight into the physical and chemical conditions during their formation. We present mass spectra taken by the Ptolemy instrument 20 minutes after the initial touchdown of the Philae lander on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Regular mass distributions indicate the presence of a sequence of compounds with additional -CH 2 - and -O- groups (mass/charge ratios 14 and 16, respectively). Similarities with the detected coma species of comet Halley suggest the presence of a radiation-induced polymer at the surface. Ptolemy measurements also indicate an apparent absence of aromatic compounds such as benzene, a lack of sulfur-bearing species, and very low concentrations of nitrogenous material."
https://openalex.org/W1725838051,"The Three-Factor-Eating-Questionnaire (TFEQ) is an established instrument to assess eating behaviour. Analysis of the TFEQ-factor structure was based on selected, convenient and clinical samples so far. Aims of this study were (I) to analyse the factor structure of the German version of the TFEQ and (II)—based on the refined factor structure—to examine the association between eating behaviour and the body mass index (BMI) in a general population sample of 3,144 middle-aged and older participants (40–79 years) of the ongoing population based cohort study of the Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE Health Study). The factor structure was examined in a split-half analysis with both explorative and confirmatory factor analysis. Associations between TFEQ-scores and BMI values were tested with multiple regression analyses controlled for age, gender, and education. We found a three factor solution for the TFEQ with an ‘uncontrolled eating’, a ‘cognitive restraint’ and an ‘emotional eating’ domain including 29 of the original 51 TFEQ-items. Scores of the ‘uncontrolled eating domain’ showed the strongest correlation with BMI values (partial r = 0.26). Subjects with scores above the median in both ‘uncontrolled eating’ and ‘emotional eating’ showed the highest BMI values (mean = 29.41 kg/m²), subjects with scores below the median in all three domains showed the lowest BMI values (mean = 25.68 kg/m²; F = 72.074, p<0.001). Our findings suggest that the TFEQ is suitable to identify subjects with specific patterns of eating behaviour that are associated with higher BMI values. Such information may help health care professionals to develop and implement more tailored interventions for overweight and obese individuals."

Among the AREB/ABF genes, AREB1 and ABF2 showed up-regulation in response to drought stress in leaf and root tissues of all varieties while AREB2 and ABF1 showed down-regulation in both leaf and root tissues of the sensitive variety 'Bidane Sefid' in response to drought and salt stress. Among the DREB/CBF genes, CBF4 was the most responsive to drought stress in both leaf and root tissues. CBF2 and CBF3 showed up-regulation in all varieties in response to drought stress in leaf except in 'Bidane Sefid'. Under salinity stress, AREB2 and ABF2 showed up-regulation in response to the increasing level of salinity in the leaf tissues but in the root tissues ABF2 was up-regulated in response to increasing NaCl concentration while AREB2 was down-regulated. Therefore, it seems AREB2 has tissue-specific response to salinity stress. All CBF genes were up-regulated in response to salinity stress in the leaf and root tissues. Expression data suggested that CBF2 is more responsive to NaCl stress. Among all four promising and stress tolerant varieties 'Siah Zarghan' and 'Kaj Angoor' were more tolerant than 'Qalati' and 'Sabz Angoor' to drought and salinity."
https://openalex.org/W2139647261,"European hares of both sexes rely on fat reserves, particularly during the reproduc-tive season. Therefore, hares should select dietary plants rich in fat and energy. However, hares also require essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to reproduce and survive. Although hares are able to absorb PUFA selectively in their gastrointestinal tract, it is unknown whether this mechanism is sufficient to guarantee PUFA supply. Thus, diet selection may involve a trade-off between a preference for energy versus a preference for crucial nutrients, namely PUFA. We compared plant and nutrient availability and use by hares in an arable landscape in Austria over three years. We found that European hares selected their diet for high energy content (crude fat and crude protein), and avoided crude fibre. There was no evidence of a preference for plants rich in LA and ALA. We conclude that fat is the limiting resource for this herbivorous mammal, whereas levels of LA and ALA in forage are sufficiently high to meet daily requirements, especially since their uptake is enhanced by physiological mechanisms. Animals selected several plant taxa all year round, and preferences did not simply correlate with crude fat content. Hence, European hares might not only select for plant taxa rich in fat, but also for high-fat parts of preferred plant taxa. As hares preferred weeds/grasses and various crop types while avoiding cereals, we suggest that promoting heterogeneous habitats with high crop diversity and set-asides may help stop the decline of European hares throughout Europe."

https://openalex.org/W1922342700,"Withaferin A (WA), a major bioactive component of the Indian herb Withania somnifera, induces cell death (apoptosis/necrosis) in multiple types of tumor cells, but the molecular mechanism underlying this cytotoxicity remains elusive. We report here that 2 μM WA induced cell death selectively in androgen-insensitive PC-3 and DU-145 prostate adenocarcinoma cells, whereas its toxicity was less severe in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells and normal human fibroblasts (TIG-1 and KD). WA also killed PC-3 cells in spheroid-forming medium. DNA microarray analysis revealed that WA significantly increased mRNA levels of c-Fos and 11 heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in PC-3 and DU-145, but not in LNCaP and TIG-1. Western analysis revealed increased expression of c-Fos and reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP(L). Expression of HSPs such as HSPA6 and Hsp70 was conspicuously elevated; however, because siRNA-mediated depletion of HSF-1, an HSP-inducing transcription factor, reduced PC-3 cell viability, it is likely that these heat-shock genes were involved in protecting against cell death. Moreover, WA induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PC-3 and DU-145, but not in normal fibroblasts. Immunocytochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy revealed that WA disrupted the vimentin cytoskeleton, possibly inducing the ROS generation, c-Fos expression and c-FLIP(L) suppression. These observations suggest that multiple events followed by disruption of the vimentin cytoskeleton play pivotal roles in WA-mediated cell death."

Human ABC transporters are classified into seven families (ABC-A to -G), and among them, CFTR, a member of the ABC-C subfamily (ABC-C7), is the only ABC protein known to function as an ion channel rather than as an active transporter.

Two highly conserved cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) can form a “head-to-tail” dimer, forming two composite binding sites for ATP at their interface. For CFTR, as for a number of other eukaryotic ABC transporters (asymmetric ABC transporters, e.g. all other ABC-C members, TAP1/TAP2), these ATP sites are asymmetric (17Procko E. O'Mara M.L.

A unique CFTR domain, the so-called regulatory domain (R-domain), connects NBD1 to TMD2 and must be phosphorylated (mainly by PKA) to allow CFTR channel activity (20Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.

Although the NBD dimerization for the majority of ABC transporters (exporters) is thought to induce the formation of a TMD cavity that opens toward the extracellular side for release of the transported compound (allocrite) (14Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Structure of a bacterial multidrug ABC transporter.Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), in the case of CFTR it is associated with channel opening; thus the TMDs adopt a conformation that allows selective anion flow (21Vergani P.

It is generally accepted that phosphorylated, wild-type CFTR operates mainly through an irreversible nonequilibrium gating mechanism. Within this framework, the most frequent transitions that occur during gating involve several closed channel states and two distinct open states (21Vergani P. Lockless S.W. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C.

After ATP binding at site 2, NBD dimerization induces opening of the channel (state O1). The transition from O1 to a second open state (O2) corresponds to the hydrolysis of ATP at site 2, followed by NBD dissociation and channel closure (transition O2 to C). The latter two transitions (hydrolysis and channel closing) constitute the hydrolytic closure pathway. In wild type, the rate of the “backward” transition O1 to C (also described as nonhydrolytic closure) is negligible compared with the rate of hydrolytic closure, due to the stability of the ATP-bound pre-hydrolytic state O1 (22Csanády L.

Modeling the conformational changes underlying channel opening in CFTR.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e74574 Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In most cases, molecular dynamics simulations showed considerable changes in the CFTR-modeled structure in a relatively short time scale (a few tens of nanoseconds). Results of molecular dynamics simulations applied on homology models should be carefully interpreted, as structural changes in a given model could derive from the instability of the model itself, especially if, as occurs for CFTR TMDs, sequence identity between modeled protein and template is low. Homology models of putative closed state conformations of CFTR have been built using the structures of mouse P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (32Rahman K.S. Cui G. Harvey S.C. McCarty N.A. Modeling the conformational changes underlying channel opening in CFTR.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e74574 Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or Vibrio cholerae MsbA (34Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Molecular models of the open and closed states of the whole human CFTR protein.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3469-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The P-gp structure (Protein Data Bank code 3G5U, resolution 3.8 Å) shows a large inward-facing opening of the transmembrane cavity, and no contacts are detected at the NBD level (42Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Structure of P-glycoprotein reveals a molecular basis for poly-specific drug binding.Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). This structure was recently modified as the original database entry revealed registry shifts in several transmembrane helices (43Li J. Jaimes K.F. Aller S.G. Refined structures of mouse P-glycoprotein.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, homology models of CFTR derived from the original structure might have incorporated the same errors. In the V. cholerae MsbA structure (Protein Data Bank code 3B5X), the NBDs are not engaged in a tight dimer but form contacts between residues of specific conserved motifs located at the NBD interface (15Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Flexibility in the ABC transporter MsbA: alternating access with a twist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The MsbA structure is a low resolution structure (5.5 Å) for which only the α-carbon atoms were resolved. Open state channels of CFTR have so far been modeled using the structure of Sav1866 (14Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Structure of a bacterial multidrug ABC transporter.Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) as a template. However, tight interactions on the intracellular side of the TMDs that are present in this structure might be incompatible with CFTR's channel function, blocking anion access to the cytoplasm (38Norimatsu Y. Ivetac A. Alexander C. Kirkham J. O'Donnell N. Dawson D.C. Sansom M.S.

Life Sci. 2015; 72: 1377-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The limitations associated with these templates highlight the need of new models for the closed and open states of CFTR. Here, we applied molecular modeling techniques to build new CFTR models, and we analyzed them in the context of the CFTR gating mechanism without applying unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations. We used structural templates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been employed before for CFTR. TM(287–288), like CFTR, is an asymmetric ABC transporter, with a degenerate and a consensus ATP-binding site. Its crystal structure (resolution = 2.9 Å) features an ATP analog bound at the degenerate site (16Hohl M. Briand C. Grütter M.G. Seeger M.A. Crystal structure of a heterodimeric ABC transporter in its inward-facing conformation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). ABC-B10 is a homodimeric ABC transporter crystallized in different nucleotide-bound states (resolution ranges from 2.85 to 3.30 Å) (44Shintre C.A. Pike A.C. Li Q. Kim J.I. Barr A.J. Goubin S. Shrestha L. Yang J. Berridge G. Ross J. Stansfeld P.J. Sansom M.S. Edwards A.M. Bountra C. Marsden B.D. et al.Structures of ABCB10, a human ATP-binding cassette transporter in apo- and nucleotide-bound states.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with different interactions at the NBD interface compared with TM(287–288). We also built a new CFTR model using the structure of McjD (resolution = 2.7 Å), a homodimeric ABC transporter crystallized with the TMDs forming an occluded cavity that could accommodate its substrate, MccJ25, a 21-amino acid-long lasso peptide (45Choudhury H.G. Tong Z. Mathavan I. Li Y. Iwata S. Zirah S. Rebuffat S. van Veen H.W. Beis K. Structure of an antibacterial peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter in a novel outward occluded state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Finally, we used the structure of Sav1866 as a template for an outward-facing conformation of the channel, for comparison with previously published models. Little is known about the physiological substrates of these ABC transporters, with the exception of McjD. The natural substrates of TM(287–288), ABC-B10, and Sav1866 are not known, but they all can transport a variety of molecules of different sizes and appear to have different binding sites for different molecules (16Hohl M.

The analysis of the transmembrane cavity of the four models suggests that only the one based on the TM(287–288) structure corresponds to a fully closed state channel. Unlike previously published closed state conformations, this CFTR model shows contacts between the two NBDs at the degenerate site, in agreement with experimental data suggesting movement (53Csanády L.

https://openalex.org/W1944426035,"Ergothioneine (EGT) is synthesized in mycobacteria, but limited knowledge exists regarding its synthesis, physiological role, and regulation. We have identified Rv3701c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis to encode for EgtD, a required histidine methyltransferase that catalyzes first biosynthesis step in EGT biosynthesis. EgtD was found to be phosphorylated by the serine/threonine protein kinase PknD. PknD phosphorylates EgtD both in vitro and in a cell-based system on Thr213. The phosphomimetic (T213E) but not the phosphoablative (T213A) mutant of EgtD failed to restore EGT synthesis in a ΔegtD mutant. The findings together with observed elevated levels of EGT in a pknD transposon mutant during in vitro growth suggests that EgtD phosphorylation by PknD negatively regulates EGT biosynthesis. We further showed that EGT is required in a nutrient-starved model of persistence and is needed for long term infection of murine macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W955247251,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, homodimeric [kinesin family (KIF) 17, osmotic avoidance abnormal-3 (OSM-3)] and heterotrimeric (KIF3) kinesin-2 motors are required to establish sensory cilia by intraflagellar transport (IFT) where KIF3 and KIF17 cooperate to build the axoneme core and KIF17 builds the distal segments. However, the function of KIF17 in vertebrates is unresolved. We expressed full-length and motorless KIF17 constructs in mouse rod photoreceptors using adeno-associated virus in Xenopus laevis rod photoreceptors using a transgene and in ciliated IMCD3 cells. We found that tagged KIF17 localized along the rod outer segment axoneme when expressed in mouse and X. laevis photoreceptors, whereas KIF3A was restricted to the proximal axoneme. Motorless KIF3A and KIF17 mutants caused photoreceptor degeneration, likely through dominant negative effects on IFT. KIF17 mutant lacking the motor domain translocated to nuclei after exposure of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. Germ-line deletion of Kif17 in mouse did not affect photoreceptor function. A rod-specific Kif3/Kif17 double knockout mouse demonstrated that KIF17 and KIF3 do not act synergistically and did not prevent rhodopsin trafficking to rod outer segments. In summary, the nematode model of KIF3/KIF17 cooperation apparently does not apply to mouse photoreceptors in which the photosensory cilium is built exclusively by KIF3."

Data were collected from 201 women who underwent cervical cytology screening in the Barretos Cancer Hospital and their results were categorized as ASC-US (n=96) or LSIL (n=105). All patients underwent colposcopy with or without cervical biopsy for diagnosis of CIN2/CIN3. The hr-HPV test (Cobas 4800 test) and immunocytochemistry were performed to detect biomarkers p16/Ki-67 (CINtec PLUS test). Two samples (1 ASC-US/1 LSIL) were excluded from the analysis due to inconclusive results of the histologic examination. There were 8 cases of CIN2/CIN3 among 95 women with ASC-US (8.4%), and 23 cases of CIN2/CIN3 among 104 women with LSIL (22.1%). In the group of women with ASC-US, the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing CIN2/CIN3 were 87.5% and 79.5% for the HPV test and 62.5% and 93.1% for p16/Ki-67. Among women with LSIL, the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of CIN2/CIN3 were 87% and 34.7% for the HPV test and 69.6% and 75.3% for immunocytochemistry. Superior performance was observed for p16/Ki-67 double staining, especially among women under 30 for whom the test had an area under the ROC curve of 0.762 (p<0.001). Both p16/Ki-67 double staining and the hr-HPV DNA test had similar performance in predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among women with ASC-US. The best performance was observed in women aged >30 years. In younger women (≤30 years) with LSIL, p16/Ki-67 had greater accuracy in identifying precursor lesions. Among women >30 years diagnosed with LSIL, the two methods showed similar performance."
https://openalex.org/W966070641,"IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are produced predominantly by epithelial cells and are known to induce Th2-type cytokines. Th2-type cytokines are involved not only in host defense against nematodes, but also in the development of Th2-type allergic diseases. TSLP was reported to be crucial for development of allergic airway inflammation in mice after inhalation of allergens to which they had been sensitized epicutaneously (EC) beforehand. However, the roles of IL-25 and IL-33 in the setting remain unclear.Mice deficient in IL-25 and IL-33 were sensitized EC with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged intranasally with OVA. Airway inflammation, the number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in the mice were determined, respectively, by histological analysis, with a hemocytometer, and by using plethysmograph chambers with a ventilator. Expression of mRNA in the skin and lungs was determined by quantitative PCR, while the BALF levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and the serum levels of IgE were determined by ELISA.Normal OVA-specific Th2- and Th17-cell responses of lymph nodes and spleens were observed in IL-25-deficient (IL-25-/-) and IL-33-/- mice after EC sensitization with OVA. Nevertheless, the number of eosinophils, but not neutrophils, in the BALFs, and the levels of Th2 cytokines, but not Th17 cytokines, in the lungs were significantly decreased in the IL-25-/- and IL-33-/- mice pre-sensitized EC with OVA, followed by inhalation of OVA, whereas their levels of AHR and OVA-specific serum IgE were normal.Both IL-25 and IL-33 are critical for induction of Th2-type cytokine-mediated allergic airway eosinophilia, but not Th17-type cytokine-mediated airway neutrophilia, at the local sites of lungs in the challenge phase of mice sensitized EC with OVA. They do not affect OVA-specific T-cell induction in the sensitization phase."

Considering that GluN2B is the predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (13Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. The major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the postsynaptic density fraction is N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating GluN2B function. With the development of mass spectroscopy and phosphorylation-specific antibodies over the last two decades, several tyrosine sites within the carboxyl terminus of the GluN2B subunit have been identified as substrates of Src family kinases (14Ali D.W.

A major tyrosine site on GluN2B, Tyr-1472, has been reported to control the trafficking of GluN2B-containing NMDARs and may be involved in such processes as synaptic plasticity, memory, and pain (17Lavezzari G.

However, the roles of other tyrosine sites on GluN2B remain to be explored. In the present study we report a novel mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2B Tyr-1070 (Tyr(P)-1070) facilitates the surface expression of GluN2B-containing NMDARs through its interaction with Fyn and regulating the phosphorylation of GluN2B Tyr-1472 during neuronal activity. pMe-FynWT and pMe-FynR176K were kind gifts from Tadashi Yamamoto (Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Kunigami, Okinawa) and were described previously (21Tezuka T.

The Y1070F mutant of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GluN2B (tagged with extracellular amino-terminal GFP) was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions and verified by DNA sequencing. Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and subcellular fractionation were performed as described previously (22Wang Y.B. Wang J.J. Wang S.H. Liu S.S. Cao J.Y. Li X.M. Qiu S. Luo J.H.

All experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with Zhejiang University Animal Experimentation Committee guidelines (the guidelines conform to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals). The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experiments of Zhejiang University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used. Wild-type (WT) GluN1 and GluN2B tagged with extracellular amino-terminal GFP (GFP-GluN2BWT) in the pRK5 vector were described previously (24Yang W. Zheng C. Song Q. Yang X. Qiu S. Liu C. Chen Z.

The primary antibodies used were: Tyr(P)-1472 GluN2B (1:500; Millipore, Lake Placid, NY), mouse GluN2B (1:2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Ser(P)-845-GluA1 (1:1000; Millipore), GluA1 (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit monoclonal Fyn (1:2000; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), mouse monoclonal PSD-95 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), β-actin (1:20000; Sigma), and rabbit monoclonal GFP (1:2000; Epitomics). The secondary antibodies for Western blot were HRP-conjugated, and all were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). The secondary antibodies for immunostaining were from Life Technologies. Tetrodotoxin, the Src family kinase inhibitors PP2, PP3, and Su6656, forskolin, and rolipram were all from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). NMDA, glycine, and picrotoxin were from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine 1070 rabbit monoclonal antibody was generated using a protocol described previously (25Spieker-Polet H. Sethupathi P. Yam P.C. Knight K.L. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies: generating a fusion partner to produce rabbit-rabbit hybridomas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9348-9352Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In brief, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 0.2 mg of peptide (ISTHTVTpYGNIEGN, pY is phosphotyrosine) in TiterMaxTM Gold Adjuvant (Sigma). After the initial immunization, animals were boosted 3 times at 3-week intervals. Hybridoma fusion was performed according to the established protocol with minor modifications. Hybridoma supernatants were collected and screened for antigen peptide (ISTHTVTpYGNIEGN) and control peptide (ISTHTVTYGNIEGN) by ELISA assays and characterized by immunoblotting using rat brain tissue. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by cervical dislocation. Briefly, cortical tissues were collected from rats of either sex on embryonic day 18. The tissues were chopped and digested in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. For biochemical analyses, the density of cortical cells was set to 1 × 106/dish in 60-mm dishes precoated overnight with poly-l-lysine. Half of the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium twice per week. The neurons were used at 14–16 days in vitro (DIV) unless otherwise noted. pFUGW-Fyn-shRNA-eGFP lentiviral vector targeted against rat Fyn (5′-GCAGGACAGAAGATGACCT-3′) and EGFP control were from Shanghai GeneChem. Cortical cultures were infected with lentivirus at 7–8 DIV. Seven days after infection, neurons were processed for Western blot analysis. To induce chemical long term potentiation (LTP), we followed a protocol reported previously (26Szepesi Z. Bijata M. Ruszczycki B. Kaczmarek L. Wlodarczyk J. Matrix metalloproteinases regulate the formation of dendritic spine head protrusions during chemically induced long-term potentiation.PloS ONE. 2013; 8e63314 Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were transferred from Neurobasal medium to extracellular solution (ECS) for the indicated times. The ECS contained 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, 50 μm forskolin, 0.1 μm rolipram, and 50 μm picrotoxin, pH 7.4. The chemical long term depression (LTD) protocol followed that of a previous study (27Behnisch T. Yuanxiang P. Bethge P. Parvez S. Chen Y. Yu J. Karpova A. Frey J.U. Mikhaylova M. Kreutz M.R. Nuclear translocation of jacob in hippocampal neurons after stimuli inducing long-term potentiation but not long-term depression.PloS ONE. 2011; 6e17276 Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cortical cultures (14–16 DIV) were incubated with prewarmed extracellular solution (ECS: 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 33 mm glucose, 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4) for 10 min, then 20 μm NMDA and 20 μm glycine were added for the indicated times. Inhibition of Src family kinase activity in cortical cultures was achieved by application of the specific inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) or Su6656 (2 μm). Before drug incubation, the volume of culture medium was adjusted to 2 ml, then the drugs were added to the medium and left for 30 min at 37 °C. Behavioral experiments were performed as described with modification (28Fowler S.W. Chiang A.C. Savjani R.R. Larson M.E. Sherman M.A. Schuler D.R. Cirrito J.R. Lesné S.E. Jankowsky J.L.

Mice were handled for at least 1 week before training. Then they were trained in a near-infrared video fear-conditioning system (Med Associates) with a stainless-steel grid floor. Movement of mice during training was monitored and recorded by a video camera inside the chamber and analyzed using Video Freeze software (Med Associates). During training, each mouse was allowed to freely explore the chambers for 2 min before receiving a 1-s 0.7-mA foot-shock. Subsequently, the mouse received another two foot-shocks at an interval of 1 min. After the foot-shocks, the mouse remained in the chamber for another 1 min before being returned to its home cage. One hour later mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The hippocampi were isolated and immediately stored at −80 °C until use. The in vivo protocol from our previous study was used (22Wang Y.B. Wang J.J. Wang S.H. Liu S.S. Cao J.Y. Li X.M. Qiu S. Luo J.H.

Cultured neurons (14–16 DIV) or HEK293 cells were solubilized in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) with fresh addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitor (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF) at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The antibodies were mixed with the supernatant after centrifugation at 4 °C for 6 h. After 6 h of incubation of antibody and proteins, ∼30 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose was added to the mixture, and the preparation was further incubated at 4 °C overnight. On the following day the beads were extensively washed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and eluted with 2× sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Biotinylation assays were conducted as reported previously (30Cao M. Xu J. Shen C. Kam C. Huganir R.L. Xia J.

In brief, the cortex was dissected in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid and then homogenized in chilled buffer A (0.32 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was constituted the crude membrane fraction (P2). The P2 was rinsed with buffer B (4 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to precipitate the pellet. The pellet was again rinsed with buffer B and centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Afterward, the pellet was incubated with buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.2) for 15 min at 4 °C with continuous rotation. Subsequently, the preparation was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was considered to be the non-postsynaptic density (non-PSD) membrane fraction. The pellet in this step was further solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C with buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% SDS, pH 7.5). Finally, the preparation was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected and considered to be the PSD membrane fraction. All the above buffers contained protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (22Wang Y.B. Wang J.J. Wang S.H. Liu S.S. Cao J.Y. Li X.M.

After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred from gel to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, GE Healthcare) that were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature with constant shaking. Next, the membranes were divided into two groups; one was incubated with CIP buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) with fresh addition of protease inhibitor only (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and the other was incubated with CIP and CIP buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After this step, the membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and used for conventional Western blot analysis. Anti-phosphotyrosine 1070 rabbit monoclonal antibody was preincubated with a 2-fold mass excess of the blocking peptide (ISTHTVTpYGNIEGN) for 30 min before immunoblotting. The immunoblotting was conducted as described above. Surface-staining of HEK293 cells and cortical neurons was performed as described previously (24Yang W. Zheng C. Song Q. Yang X. Qiu S. Liu C.

On DIV 10, the neurons were rinsed twice in ECS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then incubated with rabbit GFP primary antibody (1:500) for 15 min at room temperature. After primary antibody application, the neurons were washed 3 times with ECS and incubated with Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. After three rinses in ECS, the neurons were mounted. Images were captured on the Olympus confocal microscope equipped with a 60×, 1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective using Fluoview 1000. The images were analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In brief, quantification was performed using the ratio of surface intensity to total intensity. The data from at least three independent experiments are presented as the mean ± S.E. The electrophysiological methods have been described previously (24Yang W. Zheng C. Song Q. Yang X. Qiu S. Liu C.

The extracellular recording solution contained 147 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 8 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2 (305 mosm, pH adjusted to 7.30 with NaOH). Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing 136.5 mm potassium gluconate, 17.5 mm KCl, 9 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA (300 mosm, pH adjusted to 7.20 with KOH). Recordings were made at −60 mV during the application of 100 μm glutamate and 10 μm glycine to HEK293 cells. Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). All values are shown as the mean ± S.E.

Previous mass spectral analysis has provided evidence that GluN2B is phosphorylated at several tyrosine sites, including Tyr-1070 (15Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. Characterization of Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation sites on GluRϵ2 (NR2B) subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which lies in the conserved sequence VTYGNI within the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). To determine the potential function of Tyr-1070, a rabbit monoclonal antibody was generated and shown to target to the conserved domain around phosphorylated Tyr-1070 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first verified the specificity of the antibody against Tyr(P)-1070 on GluN2B using CIP assays in vitro (35Kornhauser J.M. Cowan C.W. Shaywitz A.J. Dolmetsch R.E. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Haddad C. Xia Z. Greenberg M.E. CREB transcriptional activity in neurons is regulated by multiple, calcium-specific phosphorylation events.Neuron. 2002; 34: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our data showed a strong signal of phosphorylated GluN2B by its Tyr(P)-1070 antibody, and phosphatase treatment eliminated this signal (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the antibody was phosphorylation-specific. Besides CIP treatment, immunizing peptide blocking experiments also demonstrated that the peptide used for generation of anti-Tyr-1070 antibody completely abolished the immunoreactivity of GluN2B phosphorylated at Tyr-1070 to the antibody, indicating competitive binding of the peptide to the Tyr(P)-1070 antibody (Fig. 1C). However, the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated GluN2B at Tyr-1472 was unchanged between the untreated group and the peptide treatment group (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, in the GluN2BY1070F (tyrosine 1070 to phenylalanine) mutant, the band signal detected by the Tyr(P)-1070 antibody was abolished in GluN2B-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1E), confirming that the antibody was Tyr-1070 phosphorylation-specific. Subsequently, the distribution pattern of Tyr(P)-1070 was detected in various rat brain regions, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, and cerebellum (Fig. 1F). Our data indicated that the pattern of GluN2B phosphorylated at the Tyr-1070 site (Tyr(P)-1070-GluN2B) was consistent with that of GluN2B in vivo, suggesting that it functions broadly throughout the brain. To further determine the subcellular fraction of Tyr(P)-1070 in vivo, the P2, non-PSD, and PSD fractions were separated and subjected to Western blot analysis. Our data showed that Tyr(P)-1070-GluN2B was enriched in the PSD fraction compared with the non-PSD fraction (Fig. 1G), similar to the distribution pattern of Tyr(P)-1472-GluN2B but not Tyr(P)-1336-GluN2B reported previously (36Goebel-Goody S.M. Davies K.D. Alvestad Linger R.M. Freund R.K. Browning M.D. Phospho-regulation of synaptic and extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in adult hippocampal slices.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 1446-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Given that Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 of GluN2B are phosphorylated by Fyn, to determine whether Tyr-1070 was phosphorylated by Fyn, two widely accepted inhibitors of Src family kinases, PP2 and Su6656, were applied to cultured neurons. As expected, the Tyr(P)-1070 level was largely reduced by these inhibitors (27.3 ± 7.1% for PP2, 43.87 ± 8.4% for Su6656, compared with vehicle; Fig. 2, A and B), but not by PP3, which is a PP2 analog that does not affect Fyn activity (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Fyn is responsible for regulating the Tyr(P)-1070 level. To confirm this result, we controlled the expression of Fyn in cortical neurons by lentivirus (LV)-Fyn shRNA infection, which significantly reduced Fyn expression (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, Tyr(P)-1070 and Tyr(P)-1472 levels were markedly decreased in the LV-Fyn shRNA-treated gr"
https://openalex.org/W1910005677,"In rehabilitation, rhythmic acoustic cues are often used to improve gait. However, stride-time fluctuations become anti-persistent with such pacing, thereby deviating from the characteristic persistent long-range correlations in stride times of self-paced walking healthy adults. Recent studies therefore experimented with metronomes with persistence in interbeat intervals and successfully evoked persistent stride-time fluctuations. The objective of this study was to examine how participants couple their gait to a persistent metronome, evoking persistently longer or shorter stride times over multiple consecutive strides, without wandering off the treadmill. Twelve healthy participants walked on a treadmill in self-paced, isochronously paced and non-isochronously paced conditions, the latter with anti-persistent, uncorrelated and persistent correlations in interbeat intervals. Stride-to-stride fluctuations of stride times, stride lengths and stride speeds were assessed with detrended fluctuation analysis, in conjunction with an examination of the coupling between stride times and stride lengths. Stride-speed fluctuations were anti-persistent for all conditions. Stride-time and stride-length fluctuations were persistent for self-paced walking and anti-persistent for isochronous pacing. Both stride times and stride lengths changed from anti-persistence to persistence over the four non-isochronous metronome conditions, accompanied by an increasingly stronger coupling between these gait parameters, with peak values for the persistent metronomes. These results revealed that participants were able to follow the beat of a persistent metronome without falling off the treadmill by strongly coupling stride-length fluctuations to the stride-time fluctuations elicited by persistent metronomes, so as to prevent large positional displacements along the treadmill. For self-paced walking, in contrast, this coupling was very weak. In combination, these results challenge the premise that persistent metronomes in gait rehabilitation would evoke stride-to-stride dynamics reminiscent of self-paced walking healthy adults. Future studies are recommended to include an analysis of the interrelation between stride times and stride lengths in addition to the correlational structure of either one in isolation."

https://openalex.org/W1013133777,"Adult skeletal muscles can regenerate after injury, due to the presence of satellite cells, a quiescent population of myogenic progenitor cells. Once activated, satellite cells repair the muscle damage by undergoing myogenic differentiation. The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) coordinate the process of progenitor differentiation in cooperation with other families of transcription factors (TFs). The Six1 and Six4 homeodomain TFs are expressed in developing and adult muscle and Six1 is critical for embryonic and adult myogenesis. However, the lack of a muscle developmental phenotype in Six4-null mice, which has been attributed to compensation by other Six family members, has discouraged further assessment of the role of Six4 during adult muscle regeneration. By employing genome-wide approaches to address the function of Six4 during adult skeletal myogenesis, we have identified a core set of muscle genes coordinately regulated in adult muscle precursors by Six4 and the MRF MyoD. Throughout the genome of differentiating adult myoblasts, the cooperation between Six4 and MyoD is associated with chromatin repressive mark removal by Utx, a demethylase of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27. Among the genes coordinately regulated by Six4 and MyoD are several genes critical for proper in vivo muscle regeneration, implicating a role of Six4 in this process. Using in vivo RNA interference of Six4, we expose an uncompensated function of this TF during muscle regeneration. Together, our results reveal a role for Six4 during adult muscle regeneration and suggest a widespread mechanism of cooperation between Six4 and MyoD."

It is unknown whether these convulsants act as negative allosteric modulators by binding to the intersubunit anesthetic-binding sites in the GABAAR transmembrane domain (Chiara, D. C., Jayakar, S. S., Zhou, X., Zhang, X., Savechenkov, P. Y., Bruzik, K. S., Miller, K. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 19343–19357) or to known convulsant sites in the ion channel or extracellular domains. Here, we show that S-1-methyl-5-propyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl) barbituric acid (S-mTFD-MPPB), a photoreactive analog of the convulsant barbiturate S-MPPB, inhibits α1β3γ2 but potentiates α1β3 GABAAR responses. In the α1β3γ2 GABAAR, S-mTFD-MPPB binds in the transmembrane domain with high affinity to the γ+-β− subunit interface site with negative energetic coupling to GABA binding in the extracellular domain at the β+-α− subunit interfaces. GABA inhibits S-[3H]mTFD-MPPB photolabeling of γ2Ser-280 (γM2–15′) in this site. In contrast, within the same site GABA enhances photolabeling of β3Met-227 in βM1 by an anesthetic barbiturate, R-[3H]methyl-5-allyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl)barbituric acid (mTFD-MPAB), which differs from S-mTFD-MPPB in structure only by chirality and two hydrogens (propyl versus allyl). S-mTFD-MPPB and R-mTFD-MPAB are predicted to bind in different orientations at the γ+-β− site, based upon the distance in GABAAR homology models between γ2Ser-280 and β3Met-227. These results provide an explanation for S-mTFD-MPPB inhibition of α1β3γ2 GABAAR function and provide a first demonstration that an intersubunit-binding site in the GABAAR transmembrane domain binds negative and positive allosteric modulators."

Trained interviewers having necessary medical knowledge conducted face-to-face interviews with the participants. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI).A total number of 3618 effective respondents were got from 4319 participants (83.77%) and the mean age of the participants was 41.5 years with the standard deviation of 8.65. Significant crude odds ratios were observed for all factors considered except for marital status, education, work duration, BMI, EPQ-RSC(P) scale and EPQ-RSC(L) scale. Results from multivariable logistic regression model showed significant adjusted odds ratios for risk factors including gender (female vs male 0.275, 0.094-0.800), age (≥55 vs ≤25yr 0.169, 0.032-0.900), work type (light physical labor vs heavy physical labor 0.504, 0.328-0.774), workplace (underground auxiliary vs underground front-line 0.595, 0.385-0.919), length of shiftwork experience (0~5yr vs no shift 2.075, 1.287-3.344 and ≥15yr vs no shift 2.076, 1.230-3.504) and EPQ-RSC(E) score (extraversion vs introversion 0.538, 0.334-0.867).Several risk factors of nonfatal occupational injury were identified including male, age, heavy physical labor, underground front-line, length of shiftwork experience and introversion. The coal mining enterprises should pay attention to controlling the hazards associated with frontline physical work. Workers' behaviors, life styles and personality traits should also be considered, so that the enterprises could set achievable targets for workers and lessen the exposed period to the risky underground workstation."
https://openalex.org/W1503076745,"Clostridium difficile infections are associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and result in an exuberant inflammatory response, leading to nosocomial diarrhea, colitis and even death. To better understand the dynamics of mucosal immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through expansion to resolution, we built a computational model of the mucosal immune response to the bacterium. The model was calibrated using data from a mouse model of C. difficile infection. The model demonstrates a crucial role of T helper 17 (Th17) effector responses in the colonic lamina propria and luminal commensal bacteria populations in the clearance of C. difficile and colonic pathology, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells responses are associated with the recovery phase. In addition, the production of anti-microbial peptides by inflamed epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C. difficile infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial commensal bacterial species. Computational simulations suggest that the removal of neutrophil and epithelial cell derived anti-microbial inhibitions, separately and together, on commensal bacterial regrowth promote recovery and minimize colonic inflammatory pathology. Simulation results predict a decrease in colonic inflammatory markers, such as neutrophilic influx and Th17 cells in the colonic lamina propria, and length of infection with accelerated commensal bacteria re-growth through altered anti-microbial inhibition. Computational modeling provides novel insights on the therapeutic value of repopulating the colonic microbiome and inducing regulatory mucosal immune responses during C. difficile infection. Thus, modeling mucosal immunity-gut microbiota interactions has the potential to guide the development of targeted fecal transplantation therapies in the context of precision medicine interventions."
https://openalex.org/W996772106,"Background Cardiac sympathetic denervation is found in various cardiac pathologies; however, its relationship with myocardial injury has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods Twenty-four rats were assigned to the normal control group (NC), sympathectomy control group (SC), and a sympathectomy plus mecobalamin group (SM). Sympathectomy was induced by injection of 6-OHDA, after which, the destruction and distribution of sympathetic and vagal nerve in the left ventricle (LV) myocardial tissue were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA. Heart rate variability (HRV), ECG and echocardiography, and assays for myocardial enzymes in serum before and after sympathectomy were examined. Morphologic changes in the LV by HE staining and transmission electron microscope were used to estimate levels of myocardial injury and concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were used to reflect the inflammatory reaction. Results Injection of 6-OHDA decreased NE (933.1 ± 179 ng/L for SC vs. 3418.1± 443.6 ng/L for NC, P < 0.01) and increased NGF (479.4± 56.5 ng/mL for SC vs. 315.85 ± 28.6 ng/mL for NC, P < 0.01) concentrations. TH expression was reduced, while ChAT expression showed no change. Sympathectomy caused decreased HRV and abnormal ECG and echocardiography results, and histopathologic examinations showed myocardial injury and increased collagen deposition as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in the cardiac tissue of rats in the SC and SM groups. However, all pathologic changes in the SM group were less severe compared to those in the SC group. Conclusions Chemical sympathectomy with administration of 6-OHDA caused dysregulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and myocardial injuries. Mecobalamin alleviated inflammatory and myocardial damage by protecting myocardial sympathetic nerves."

However, the mechanism of the feedback loop is poorly understood in cancers. We had reported previously that the oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) is a key oncoprotein in the development of cancer. Thus, we supposed that HBXIP might be involved in the event. Here, we observed that the expression levels of HBXIP were positively correlated to those of MDM2 in clinical breast cancer tissues. Interestingly, HBXIP was able to up-regulate MDM2 at the levels of mRNA and protein in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Mechanically, HBXIP increased the promoter activities of MDM2 through directly binding to p53 in the P2 promoter of MDM2. Strikingly, we identified that the acetyltransferase p300 was recruited by HBXIP to p53 in the promoter of MDM2. Moreover, we validated that HBXIP enhanced the p53 degradation mediated by MDM2. Functionally, the knockdown of HBXIP or/and p300 inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, and the depletion of MDM2 or overexpression of p53 significantly blocked the HBXIP-promoted growth of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we concluded that highly expressed HBXIP accelerates the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 in breast cancer through modulating the feedback loop of MDM2/p53, resulting in the fast growth of breast cancer cells.

Methods The Iraq Mental Health Survey is a nationally representative face-to-face survey of 4,332 non-institutionalized adults aged 18+ interviewed in 2006–2007 as part of the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Prevalence and correlates of DSM-IV MDE were determined with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Findings Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of MDE were 7.4% and 4.0%, respectively. Close to half (46%) of the 12-month MDE cases were severe/very severe. MDE was more common among women and those previously married. Median age of onset was 25.2. Only one-seventh of 12-month MDE cases received treatment despite being associated with very substantial role impairment (on average 70 days out of role in the past year). Conclusions MDE is a commonly occurring disorder in the Iraqi general population and is associated with considerable disability and low treatment. Efforts are needed to decrease the barriers to treatment and to educate general medical providers in Iraq about the recognition and treatment of depression."
https://openalex.org/W1646597569,"Wetland ecosystems are represented as a significant reservoir of organic carbon and play an important role in mitigating the greenhouse effect. In order to compare the compositions and distribution of organic carbon in constructed and natural river wetlands, sediments from the Xinxue River Constructed Wetland and the Xinxue River, China, were sampled at two depths (0–15 cm and 15–25 cm) in both upstream and downstream locations. Three types of organic carbon were determined: light fraction organic carbon, heavy fraction organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. The results show that variations in light fraction organic carbon are significantly larger between upstream and downstream locations than they are between the two wetland types; however, the opposite trend is observed for the dissolved organic carbon. There are no significant differences in the distribution of heavy fraction organic carbon between the discrete variables (e.g., between the two depths, the two locations, or the two wetland types). However, there are significant cross-variable differences; for example, the distribution patterns of heavy fraction organic carbon between wetland types and depths, and between wetland types and locations. Correlation analysis reveals that light fraction organic carbon is positively associated with light fraction nitrogen in both wetlands, while heavy fraction organic carbon is associated with both heavy fraction nitrogen and the moisture content in the constructed wetland. The results of this study demonstrate that the constructed wetland, which has a relatively low background value of heavy fraction organic carbon, is gradually accumulating organic carbon of different types, with the level of accumulation dependent on the balance between carbon accumulation and carbon decomposition. In contrast, the river wetland has relatively stable levels of organic carbon."

The effects of the combined pollution on the antioxidant enzyme system of plant roots have not been reported. Here, the combined effects of lanthanum ion (La3+), one type of REE, and AR on the antioxidant enzyme system of soybean roots were investigated. In the combined treatment of La3+ (0.08 mM) and AR, the cell membrane permeability and the peroxidation of cell membrane lipid of soybean roots increased, and the superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and reduced ascorbic acid served as scavengers of reactive oxygen species. In other combined treatments of La3+ (0.40 mM, 1.20 mM) and AR, the membrane permeability, malonyldialdehyde content, superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity and reduced ascorbic acid content increased, while the catalase activity decreased. The increased superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity and reduced ascorbic acid content were inadequate to scavenge the excess hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, leading to the damage of the cell membrane, which was aggravated with the increase in the concentration of La3+ and the level of AR. The deleterious effects of the combined treatment of La3+ and AR were stronger than those of the single treatment of La3+ or AR. Moreover, the activity of antioxidant enzyme system in the combined treatment group was affected directly and indirectly by mineral element content in soybean plants."

Stem I alone is capable of specific tRNA binding, and the terminal region of Stem I was shown to form an additional interaction with the elbow region of tRNAGly (13Grigg J.C. Chen Y. Grundy F.J.

An RNA element containing only the bottom portion of Stem I, including the Specifier Loop, also is capable of specific tRNA recognition (11Nelson A.R. Henkin T.M.

Based on these results, it was proposed that the Specifier Sequence-tRNA anticodon pairing is crucial for discrimination between cognate and non-cognate tRNA. Because the correct tRNA must be selected from a pool of incorrect tRNAs in vivo, it is likely that the Specifier Sequence is “probed” by both matching and non-matching tRNAs by analogy with aminoacyl-tRNA selection during translation, but only the matching tRNA is capable of a productive interaction. It is unclear, however, whether simple base-pairing stability is sufficient for this discrimination. The residue 3′ to the Specifier Sequence is conserved as a purine (A or G); this residue was predicted to form a fourth pairing interaction with the conserved U33 tRNA residue based on structural mapping results (8Yousef M.R.

However, structural studies demonstrated that this purine residue stacks underneath the Specifier Sequence and stabilizes the Specifier Sequence-anticodon helix (14Zhang J. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Co-crystal structure of a T-box riboswitch stem I domain in complex with its cognate tRNA.Nature. 2013; 500: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Previous analyses of T box gene expression in vivo using the B. subtilis tyrS gene, which encodes tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, showed that induction occurs only in response to increased levels of uncharged tRNATyr (5Grundy F.J.

Accumulation of a noncognate uncharged tRNA, which results from limitation for an amino acid different from that corresponding to the Specifier Sequence, has little effect on expression. Substitution of a different Specifier Sequence in conjunction with the appropriate change in the antiterminator to provide a match at the tRNA 3′-end sometimes allows a response to the corresponding tRNA, but the resulting efficiency of antitermination is generally lower than that observed with the cognate tRNA (9Grundy F.J. Hodil S.E. Rollins S.M. Henkin T.M. Specificity of tRNA-mRNA interactions in Bacillus subtilis tyrS antitermination.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo studies are complicated by the fact that the cognate and noncognate tRNAs vary at many positions in addition to the anticodon loop and the 3′-end. These results suggest that tRNA features other than the anticodon contribute to interaction with the leader RNA, although the relative contribution of these other structural differences is unclear (9Grundy F.J. Hodil S.E. Rollins S.M. Henkin T.M. Specificity of tRNA-mRNA interactions in Bacillus subtilis tyrS antitermination.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of the cognate tRNA within the cell could affect availability of the leader RNA for noncognate tRNA binding. The goal of this study was to analyze the codon-anticodon interaction during recognition of tRNAGly by the glyQS leader RNA. The glyQS Specifier Sequence (Fig. 1A) and tRNAGly anticodon (Fig. 1B) were mutated to introduce all possible base pair combinations at each of the three positions (Table 1), and effects on tRNA binding affinity and tRNA-directed antitermination activity were measured in vitro to avoid complications from noncognate tRNAs or competition with other tRNA classes. We found that some features of tRNA recognition in the T box system mimic those of translation, whereas others are significantly different, indicating a pattern of tRNA recognition properties in this RNA-based regulatory system that follows rules that differ from those imposed by the ribosome.TABLE 1Mutations in the glyQS leader RNA and tRNAGlySet of mutantsaMutants are categorized according to position in the Specifier Sequence.glyQS leader variantsbMutations are underlined and named based on the position in tRNAGly.

Open table in a new tab Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used for purification of PCR products, and Wizard columns (Promega) were used for plasmid preparation. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to generate glyQS leader sequence variants (Table 1). The template DNA was plasmid pFG328 containing the glyQS promoter and leader sequence (7Grundy F.J. Winkler W.C. Henkin T.M. tRNA-mediated transcription antitermination in vitro: codon-anticodon pairing independent of the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11121-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in which the T at position +2 relative to the transcription start point was substituted with C to allow initiation with the dinucleotide ApC in vitro. The resulting plasmid variants were sequenced and used as templates for PCR to generate 440-bp products for use as templates for in vitro transcription by B. subtilis RNA polymerase (7Grundy F.J. Winkler W.C. Henkin T.M. tRNA-mediated transcription antitermination in vitro: codon-anticodon pairing independent of the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11121-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Templates for T7 RNA polymerase transcription (200 bp) were generated by using a 5′-primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter initiating with tandem G residues fused to position +1 of the glyQS leader RNA and a 3′-primer ending at glyQS position +183 (3′ of the antiterminator helix). DNA templates for generation of variants of tRNAGly (Table 1) were generated as described previously (7Grundy F.J. Winkler W.C. Henkin T.M. tRNA-mediated transcription antitermination in vitro: codon-anticodon pairing independent of the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11121-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using appropriate oligonucleotides to obtain the desired sequence changes. T7 RNA polymerase transcription was carried out with an Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies). 32P-Labeled tRNA was generated by addition of [α-32P]UTP (GE Healthcare; 800 Ci/mmol) at 0.63 μm final concentration. RNA products were purified by electrophoresis in a denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and refolded by incubation at 80 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. RNA concentration was determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). Quantitation of [32P]tRNAGly was carried out by spotting 1-μl samples of dilutions of labeled tRNA onto a 1% agarose slab gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml); dilutions of a tRNA preparation of known concentration was used as a standard. The Bio Doc-It Imaging System (UVP, Upland, CA) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) were used to compare fluorescence intensities and estimate tRNA concentrations. Binding assays were performed by mixing a 50 nm concentration of each 32P-labeled tRNAGly variant with different concentrations of the leader RNA variants in 1× transcription buffer as described previously (8Yousef M.R. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Structural transitions induced by the interaction between tRNAGly and the Bacillus subtilis glyQS T box leader RNA.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and slow cooled to 40 °C. Samples (100 μl) were filtered through a Nanosep 30,000 molecular weight cutoff Omega filter microconcentrator (Life Sciences) and washed six times with 1× transcription buffer (150 μl/wash). Material retained by the filter was mixed with Packard BioScience Ultima Gold scintillation fluid and counted in a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment was repeated twice with the experimental points run in duplicate. The specific activity (cpm/pmol) of each [32P]tRNAGly variant was used to calculate the picomoles retained. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). The Kd (μm) was calculated using the following equation. Kd=[glyQS leader RNA]×([tRNA]total−[tRNA]bound)/[tRNA]bound(Eq. 1) Single round in vitro transcription assays were carried out with B. subtilis RNA polymerase as described previously (7Grundy F.J. Winkler W.C. Henkin T.M. tRNA-mediated transcription antitermination in vitro: codon-anticodon pairing independent of the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11121-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The initiation reaction included template DNA (3 nm), B. subtilis RNA polymerase (6 nm), ApC (150 μm, Sigma), ATP and GTP (2.5 μm each), UTP (0.75 μm), and [α-32P]UTP (0.25 μm; 800 Ci/mmol); omission of CTP from the initiation reaction resulted in a halt at position +17. The initiation mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, heparin (25 nm; Sigma) was added to block reinitiation, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 40 mm. The tRNAGly variants were added to the reaction mixture as indicated, and elongation was restarted by the addition of NTPs to 10 μm final concentration. Transcription reactions were terminated by extraction with phenol, and the products were resolved by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (GE Healthcare). Antitermination efficiency was calculated from the fraction of product at the position of the readthrough band relative to the total of the terminated and readthrough products. Each experimental point was a result of three independent experiments. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0. The K1/2 was calculated using the following equation. K1/2=[tRNA]×(RTmax−[%RT])/[%RT](Eq. 2) The RTmax (%) is defined as the maximum amount of percent readthrough estimated by extrapolation of a hyperbolic curve, and the K1/2 (μm) is defined as the tRNA concentration that is required to reach half of the maximum readthrough. K1/2 is used as a parameter to evaluate the antitermination efficiency. Codon-anticodon recognition in the T box system was tested by generation of all single change Specifier Sequence variants in the glyQS leader and tRNAGly anticodon and testing leader RNA/tRNA combinations in binding and in vitro transcription antitermination assays. Each set of variants was compared with the wild-type combination (GGC Specifier Sequence/GCC anticodon), which showed the highest activity in both tRNA binding and antitermination. Binding was quantitated by measurement of the dissociation constant (Kd; Fig. 2, A and C), and antitermination efficiency (K1/2) was determined as the amount of tRNA required for half-maximal antitermination (Fig. 2, B and D). An example of this analysis is shown in Fig. 2. Introduction of a 34G→A mutation in tRNAGly resulted in a C·A mismatch at position 3 of the Specifier Sequence, which reduced the binding affinity and antitermination efficiency by 3.8- and 3.4-fold, respectively (see supplemental Table S1). The 34G→C and 34G→U mutations caused a more dramatic reduction in activity, particularly in antitermination efficiency (11–12-fold reduction). The combinations of variants were grouped according to the position of the mismatch in the Specifier Sequence (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental Table S1). The binding and antitermination activity patterns were complex, and the effect of different mismatches depended on the position and type of mismatch. For both assays, mismatches at position 2 of the Specifier Sequence resulted in the most severe reduction in activity. Mismatches at positions 1 and 3 in general behaved similarly in the binding assay, whereas larger differences were observed in the antitermination assay. The magnitude of the reduction in function also was more extreme in the antitermination assay, indicating that this is a more sensitive measurement of tRNA interaction. This is consistent with the observation that glyQS leader RNA-tRNAGly binding is strongly dependent on the Stem I-tRNA interaction, whereas antitermination is dependent not only on that interaction but also on proper positioning of the acceptor end of the tRNA for pairing with the antiterminator bulge (8Yousef M.R. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Structural transitions induced by the interaction between tRNAGly and the Bacillus subtilis glyQS T box leader RNA.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the fact that antitermination requires the interaction of the ligand to occur during transcription, whereas the binding assay allows a longer time for interaction. In translation, mismatches at the third position of the codon are often tolerated, allowing a particular tRNA to decode more than one codon; in particular, wobble pairs (U·G or G·U) are efficiently recognized at this position. Recognition of a UAU tyrosine codon in B. subtilis in vivo utilizes a U·G pair at this position as B. subtilis lacks a variant of tRNATyr with an AUA anticodon (17Kanaya S. Yamada Y. Kudo Y. Ikemura T.

Phylogenetic analysis of T box leader sequences revealed a strong preference for a C residue at position 3 of the Specifier Sequence (the “C rule”); this preference is independent of codon preferences in the overall genome (2Gutiérrez-Preciado A.

Substitution of a U for the C at position 3 of the UAC Specifier Sequence in the B. subtilis tyrS leader sequence resulted in decreased expression in vivo (18Rollins S.M. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M.

In glyQS, the GGG/CCC combination in which the position 3 pairing is switched from the wild-type C-G to G-C was the only position 3 combination that resulted in binding affinity similar to that of the wild-type combination (GGC/CCG) (Fig. 2C). The other combinations that retained Watson-Crick (W-C) 3The abbreviations used are: W-CWatson-CrickYpyrimidineRpurine. pairing (A-U and U-A) showed reduced binding (3.0- and 3.4-fold relative to wild-type, respectively). The remaining combinations (with the exception of the pyrimidine-pyrimidine (Y·Y) pairs) exhibited a 2.2–4.2-fold reduction of binding. The wobble pairs (G·U and U·G) were slightly more effective than the W-C A-U and U-A pairings, and G·G, A·G, and G·A purine-purine (R·R) pairings exhibited binding similar to that of the A-U and U-A W-C pairings. The remaining non-W-C pairings exhibited more substantial defects in binding (3.8–6.4-fold) with the Y·Y combinations exhibiting the largest effects. These results show that R·R pairings are surprisingly well tolerated at position 3. Watson-Crick pyrimidine purine. Although the Kd values for binding varied over a 6.4-fold range relative to the wild-type pairing, the K1/2 obtained by measurement of antitermination activity had a much broader range of effects to over 20-fold (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the binding assays, replacement of the wild-type C-G pair with the G-C W-C pair was the most efficient (2.0-fold reduction); however, the A-U pair was now more efficient than U-A (2.2- versus 5.2-fold reduction) and the wobble pairs (3.8-fold reduction for G·U and 5.8-fold for U·G). The A·G and G·G pairings, which had a modest effect on binding, resulted in a more serious defect in antitermination (11- and 14-fold reduction) similar to that of the Y·Y pairings, which had the greatest defect in activity. The remaining R·R pairs (A·A and G·A) together with C·A had a modest effect on antitermination. C at position 3 hada greater defect in antitermination versus binding suchthat C·A and C·U exhibited higher activity than A·C and U·C, respectively. The relative efficiencies for each of the position 3 pairings in binding and antitermination are shown in Table 2. The general order follows a similar pattern in the two assays with notable differences in the defects for Y·R pairings (U·G and U-A), which are better tolerated for binding than for antitermination (2.4–3.4-"
https://openalex.org/W2198040437,"To understand the mechanisms underlying the discordance between normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and significant alterations in liver histology of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with persistent normal ALT (PNALT) or minimally elevated ALT. A total of 300 treatment-naive chronic HBV-infected patients with PNALT (ALT ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN, 40 U/ml]) or minimally elevated ALT (1-2×ULN) were retrospectively enrolled. All patients underwent liver biopsy and histological changes were analyzed along with biochemical and HBV markers. Among 300 participants, 177 were HBeAg-positive and 123 HBeAg-negative. Significant histologic abnormalities were found in 42.9% (76/177) and 52.8% (65/123) of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, respectively. Significant fibrosis, which is a marker of prior injury, was more frequently detected than significant necroinflammation (suggesting active liver injury) in both HBeAg-positive and -negative groups, suggesting that liver injury occurred intermittently in our cohort. No significant differences were noticed in the percentage of patients with severe fibrosis between HBeAg-positive and negative phases or between ages 30 and 40 and over 40, suggesting that the fibrosis was possibly carried over from an early phase. Finally, lowering ALT ULN (30 U/L for men, 19 U/L for women) alone was not adequate to increase the sensitivity of ALT detection of liver injury. However, the study was limited to a small sample size of 13 HBeAg-positive patients with ALT in the revised normal range. We detected significant liver pathology in almost 50% of chronic HBV infected patients with PNALT (ALT ≤ 40 U/ml) or minimally elevated ALT. We postulated that small-scale intermittent liver injury was possibly responsible for the discordance between normal serum ALT and significant liver changes in our cohort."
https://openalex.org/W1500409864,"Abstract The 14-3-3 family of proteins is widely distributed in the CNS where they are major regulators of essential neuronal functions. There are seven known mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms (ζ, γ, τ, ϵ, η, β and σ), which generally function as adaptor proteins. Previously, we have demonstrated that 14-3-3ϵ isoform dynamically regulates forward trafficking of GluN2C-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in cerebellar granule neurons, that when expressed on the surface, promotes neuronal survival following NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Here, we report 14-3-3 isoform-specific binding and functional regulation of GluN2C. In particular, we show that GluN2C C-terminal domain (CTD) binds to all 14-3-3 isoforms except 14-3-3σ, and binding is dependent on GluN2C serine 1096 phosphorylation. Co-expression of 14-3-3 (ζ and ϵ) and GluN1/GluN2C promotes the forward delivery of receptors to the cell surface. We further identify novel residues serine 145, tyrosine 178, and cysteine 189 on α-helices 6, 7 and 8, respectively, within ζ-isoform as part of the GluN2C binding motif and independent of the canonical peptide binding groove. Mutation of these conserved residues abolishes GluN2C binding and has no functional effect on GluN2C trafficking. Reciprocal mutation of alanine 145, histidine 180 and isoleucine 191 on 14-3-3σ isoform promotes GluN2C binding and surface expression. Moreover, inhibiting endogenous 14-3-3 using a high-affinity peptide inhibitor, difopein, greatly diminishes GluN2C surface expression. Together, these findings highlight the isoform-specific structural and functional differences within the 14-3-3 family of proteins which determine GluN2C binding and its essential role in targeting the receptor to the cell surface to facilitate glutamatergic neurotransmission."

We estimated the averted costs due to influenza vaccination, taking into account the seasonal economic burden of the disease.We used recently published values for averted outcomes due to influenza vaccination for influenza seasons 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09, and age cohorts 6 months-4 years, 5-19 years, 20-64 years, and 65 years and above. Costs were calculated according to a payer and societal perspective (in 2009 US$), and took into account medical costs and productivity losses.When taking into account direct medical costs (payer perspective), influenza vaccination was cost saving only for the older age group (65≥) in seasons 2005-06 and 2007-08. Using the same perspective, influenza vaccination resulted in total costs of $US 1.7 billion (95%CI: $US 0.3-4.0 billion) in 2006-07 and $US 1.8 billion (95%CI: $US 0.1-4.1 billion) in 2008-09. When taking into account a societal perspective (and including the averted lost earnings due to premature death) averted deaths in the older age group influenced the results, resulting in cost savings for all ages combined in season 07-08.Influenza vaccination was cost saving in the older age group (65≥) when taking into account productivity losses and, in some seasons, when taking into account medical costs only. Averted costs vary significantly per season; however, in seasons where the averted burden of deaths is high in the older age group, averted productivity losses due to premature death tilt overall seasonal results towards savings. Indirect vaccination effects and the possibility of diminished case severity due to influenza vaccination were not considered, thus the averted burden due to influenza vaccine may be even greater than reported."
https://openalex.org/W1867046937,"Cranial kinesis refers to movements of skeletal sub-units relative to one another at mobile sutures within the skull. The presence and functional significance of cranial kinesis has been investigated in various vertebrates, with much of our understanding coming from comparative studies and manipulation of ligamentous specimens. Drawing on these studies, cranial kinesis in lizards has been modeled as a four-bar linkage system involving streptostyly (rotation of the quadrate), hypokinesis (dorsoventral flexion and extension of the palato-maxillary sub-unit), mesokinesis (dorsoventral flexion and extension of the snout at the fronto-parietal suture) and metakinesis (sliding movements between parietal and supraocciptal bones). In vivo studies, although limited, suggest that cranial kinesis serves an important role during routine behaviors such as feeding. Here, we use X-ray Reconstruction Of Moving Morphology to further quantify mesokinesis in vivo in Gekko gecko during three routine behaviors: gape display, biting and post-ingestion feeding. During gape display, the snout rotates dorsally above rest position, with mesokinesis accounting for a 10% increase in maximum gape over that achieved solely by the depression of the lower jaw. During defensive biting, the snout rotates ventrally below rest position to participate in gape closure. Finally, ventroflexion of the snout also occurs during post-ingestion feeding, accounting for 42% of gape closure during intra-oral transport, 86% during puncture-crushing, and 61% during pharyngeal packing. Mesokinesis thus appears to facilitate prey puncturing by allowing the snout to rotate ventrally so that the upper teeth pierce the prey item, thus limiting the need for large movements of the lower jaw. This is suggested to maintain a firm grip on the prey and reduce the possibility of prey escape. More generally, this study demonstrates that mesokinesis is a key component of defensive biting and gape display behaviors, as well as post-ingestion feeding, all of which are linked to organismal fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1637114285,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause serious infections and usually coexists with other pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Virulence factors are important for maintaining a presence of the organisms in these multispecies environments, and DesB plays an important role in P. aeruginosa virulence. Therefore, we investigated the effect of DesB on S. aureus reduction under competitive situation. Liquid cultures of P. aeruginosa wild type (WT) and its desB mutant were spotted on agar plates containing S. aureus, and the size of the clear zones was compared. In addition, interbacterial competition between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was observed over time during planktonic coculture. The transcriptional profiles of the WT and desB mutant were compared by qRT-PCR and microarray to determine the role of DesB in S. aureus reduction at the molecular level. As a result, the clear zone was smaller for the desB mutant than for P. aeruginosa PAO1 (WT), and in planktonic coculture, the number of S. aureus cells was reduced in the desB mutant. qRT-PCR and microarray revealed that the expression of MvfR-controlled pqsA-E and phnAB operons was significantly decreased, but the mexEF-oprN operon was highly expressed. The results indicate that intracellular levels of 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ), a ligand of MvfR, are reduced due to MexEF-OprN-mediated efflux in desB mutant, resulting in the decrease of MvfR binding to pqsA-E promoter and the reduction of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) synthesis. Overexpression of mexEF-oprN operon in desB mutant was phenotypically confirmed by observing significantly increased resistance to chloramphenicol. In conclusion, these results suggest that DesB plays a role in the inhibition of S. aureus growth by controlling HAQ synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1845606241,"Background Control strategies for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are most effective when targeting people at highest risk. We assessed test acceptance of home-collection test kits offered by short messaging services (SMS) texts, in high-risk young people, i.e. those who had previously tested CT positive (positive indices), or negative reporting more than 3 sex partners (negative indices), and their sexual and social networks. Methods Young (16 to 25 years old) heterosexuals who previously tested positive (n=536) or negative (n=536) in our STI clinic received, 3 to 20 months after their initial screening, an SMS inviting them to re-test. They were offered a free home-collection test kit including a genital (men and women) and anorectal (women only) test, and a test kit to pass on to a friend or sex partner (peer). SMS reminders were sent in case of non-response. We assessed proportions of tests requested and returned, peers tested, and positivity. Associations with the individual’s initial screening result and other factors were explored using logistic regression. Results Of 1072 people invited to retest, 34.4% (n=369) requested a test. Of these, 55.8% (n=206) retested. Overall, retest participation was higher in positive (22%) than in negative indices (16%) (p<0.001); it was also higher in women and in those aged >22 years. Positivity was 13% and 7% in positive and negative indices, respectively. One in 3 retesters also had a peer tested. Of tested peers (n=87), 84% were friends, 31% were first-time testers, and 7% tested positive. Conclusion Acceptance of a relatively low-cost strategy for genital and anorectal testing, i.e. using SMS and home-collection test kits, was highest in individuals who previously tested CT positive suggesting that implementation for this group may be considered. By further including a peer-led testing component, undetected CT positives can be identified in the social networks surrounding a high-risk individual."
https://openalex.org/W1673417261,"In humans, CXCR1 and CXCR2 are two homologous proteins that bind ELR+ chemokines. Both receptors play fundamental roles in neutrophil functions such as migration and reactive oxygen species production. Mouse Cxcr1 and Cxcr2 genes are located in an insulin-dependent diabetes genetic susceptibility locus. The non obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a spontaneous well-described animal model for insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes. In this disease, insulin deficiency results from the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells by autoreactive T lymphocytes. This slow-progressing disease is dependent on both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we report descriptive data about the Cxcr1 gene in NOD mice. We demonstrate decreased expression of mRNA for Cxcr1 in neutrophils and CD4+ lymphocytes isolated from NOD mice compared to other strains, related to reduced NOD Cxcr1 gene promoter activity. Looking for Cxcr1 protein, we next analyze the membrane proteome of murine neutrophils by mass spectrometry. Although Cxcr2 protein is clearly found in murine neutrophils, we did not find evidence of Cxcr1 peptides using this method. Nevertheless, in view of recently-published experimental data obtained in NOD mice, we argue for possible Cxcr1 involvement in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis."

Dicer enzymes are complex, multi-domain RNaseIII proteins, however structural minimalism of this protein has recently emerged in parasitic and fungal systems.

In the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica 27nt small RNAs are abundant and mediate silencing, yet no canonical Dicer enzyme has been identified. Although EhRNaseIII does not exhibit robust dsRNA cleavage in vitro, it can process dsRNA in the RNAi-negative background of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in conjunction with S. castellii Argonaute1 can partially reconstitute the RNAi pathway. Thus, although EhRNaseIII lacks the domain architecture of canonical or minimal Dicer enzymes, it has dsRNA processing activity that contributes to gene silencing via RNAi. Our data advance the understanding of small RNA biogenesis in Entamoeba as well as broaden the spectrum of non-canonical Dicer enzymes that contribute to the RNAi pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1886880236,"The propeptides of proprotein convertases (PCs) regulate activation of cognate protease domains by sensing pH of their organellar compartments as they transit the secretory pathway. Earlier experimental work identified a conserved histidine-encoded pH sensor within the propeptide of the canonical PC, furin. To date, whether protonation of this conserved histidine is solely responsible for PC activation has remained unclear because of the observation that various PC paralogues are activated at different organellar pH values. To ascertain additional determinants of PC activation, we analyzed PC1/3, a paralogue of furin that is activated at a pH of ∼5.4. Using biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based methods, we mimicked the protonation status of various histidines within the propeptide of PC1/3 and examined how such alterations can modulate pH-dependent protease activation. Our results indicate that whereas the conserved histidine plays a crucial role in pH sensing and activation of this protease an additional histidine acts as a gatekeeper that fine-tunes the sensitivity of the PC1/3 propeptide to facilitate the release inhibition at higher proton concentrations when compared with furin. Coupled with earlier analyses that highlighted the enrichment of the amino acid histidine within propeptides of secreted eukaryotic proteases, our work elucidates how secreted proteases have evolved to exploit the pH of the secretory pathway by altering the spatial juxtaposition of titratable groups to regulate their activity in a spatiotemporal fashion."

A necessary step for knowledge to be utilized in these contests is for that knowledge to be disclosed. Knowledge disclosure, however, is paradoxical in nature: in order for the value of knowledge to be assessed, inventors must disclose their knowledge, but then the person who receives that knowledge does so at no cost and may use it opportunistically. This risk of potential opportunistic behavior in turn makes the inventor fearful of disclosing knowledge, and this is a major psychological barrier to knowledge disclosure. In this project, we investigated this fear of opportunism in global prize-based science contests by surveying 630 contest participants in the InnoCentive online platform for science contests. We found that participants in these science contests experience fear of opportunism to varying degrees, and that women and older participants have significantly less fear of disclosing their scientific knowledge. Our findings highlight the importance of taking differences in such fears into account when designing global prize-based contests so that the potential of the contests for reaching solutions to important and challenging problems can be used more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W1882262706,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion diseases carry a significant inflammatory component. The astrocytic overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPD) in prion- and AD-affected brain tissue prompted us to study the role of this transcription factor in murine model systems of these diseases. Ablation of C/EBPD had neither in the AD model (APP/PS1double transgenic mice) nor in the prion model (scrapie-infected C57BL/6 mice) an influence on overt clinical symptoms. Moreover, the absence of C/EBPD did not affect the extent of the disease-related gliosis. However, C/EBPD-deficient APP/PS1 double transgenic mice displayed significantly increased amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque burdens while amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and expression of genes involved in beta amyloid transport and turnover remained unchanged. Gene expression analysis in mixed glia cultures demonstrated a strong dependency of complement component C3 on the presence of C/EBPD. Accordingly, C3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in brain tissue of C/EBPD-deficient mice. Vice versa, C3 expression in U-373 MG cells increased upon transfection with a C/EBPD expression vector. Taken together, our data indicate that a C/EBPD-deficiency leads to increased Abeta plaque burden in AD model mice. Furthermore, as shown in vivo and in vitro, C/EBPD is an important driver of the expression of acute phase response genes like C3 in the amyloid-affected CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1645140942,"The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) can cause acute or chronic infection it is also associated with the development of liver cancer, thousands of new infections occur on a yearly basis, and many of these cases are located in certain areas of the Caribbean and Latin America. In these areas, the HBV prevalence is still high which makes this virus a serious public health concern to the entire region. Studies performed in Panama suggest a complex pattern in the distribution of HBV among the country's different risk groups. We use phylogenetic analysis in order to determine which HBV genotypes were circulating in these specific groups; for this we used a fragment of the PreS2/2 region of the HBV genome. Subsequently whole HBV genome sequences were used for Bayesian analysis of phylodynamics and phylogeography. Two main genotypes were found: genotype A (54.5%) and genotype F (45.5%). There was a difference in the distribution of genotypes according to risk groups: 72.9% of high risk groups were associated to genotype A, and 55.0% of samples of genotype F were associated to the low risk group (p<0.002). The Bayesian analysis of phylogeny-traits association revealed a statistically significant geographical association (p<0.0001) with both genotypes and different regions of the country. The Bayesian time of most recent common ancestor analysis (tMRCA) revealed a recent tMRCA for genotype A2 circulating in Panama (1997, 95% HPD: 1986-2005), when it is compared with Panamanian genotype F1c sequences (1930, 95% HPD: 1810 - 2005). These results suggest a possible change in the distribution of HBV genotypes in Panama and Latin America as a whole. They also serve to encourage the implementation of vaccination programs in high-risk groups, in order to prevent an increase in the number of new HBV cases in Latin America and worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2151138053,"Background HIV surveillance requires monitoring of new HIV diagnoses and differentiation of incident and older infections. In 2008, Switzerland implemented a system for monitoring incident HIV infections based on the results of a line immunoassay (Inno-Lia) mandatorily conducted for HIV confirmation and type differentiation (HIV-1, HIV-2) of all newly diagnosed patients. Based on this system, we assessed the proportion of incident HIV infection among newly diagnosed cases in Switzerland during 2008-2013. Methods and Results Inno-Lia antibody reaction patterns recorded in anonymous HIV notifications to the federal health authority were classified by 10 published algorithms into incident (up to 12 months) or older infections. Utilizing these data, annual incident infection estimates were obtained in two ways, (i) based on the diagnostic performance of the algorithms and utilizing the relationship ‘incident = true incident + false incident’, (ii) based on the window-periods of the algorithms and utilizing the relationship ‘Prevalence = Incidence x Duration’. From 2008—2013, 3’851 HIV notifications were received. Adult HIV-1 infections amounted to 3’809 cases, and 3’636 of them (95.5%) contained Inno-Lia data. Incident infection totals calculated were similar for the performance- and window-based methods, amounting on average to 1’755 (95% confidence interval, 1588—1923) and 1’790 cases (95% CI, 1679—1900), respectively. More than half of these were among men who had sex with men. Both methods showed a continuous decline of annual incident infections 2008—2013, totaling -59.5% and -50.2%, respectively. The decline of incident infections continued even in 2012, when a 15% increase in HIV notifications had been observed. This increase was entirely due to older infections. Overall declines 2008—2013 were of similar extent among the major transmission groups. Conclusions Inno-Lia based incident HIV-1 infection surveillance proved useful and reliable. It represents a free, additional public health benefit of the use of this relatively costly test for HIV confirmation and type differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2428016481,"Sense and antisense transcripts produced from convergent gene pairs could interfere with the expression of either partner gene. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found that the iss1+ gene produces two transcript isoforms, including a long antisense mRNA that is complementary to the meiotic cum1+ sense transcript, inhibiting cum1+ expression in vegetative cells. Inhibition of cum1+ transcription was not at the level of its initiation because fusion of the cum1+ promoter to the lacZ gene showed that activation of the reporter gene occurs in response to low copper conditions. Further analysis showed that the transcription factor Cuf1 and conserved copper-signaling elements (CuSEs) are required for induction of cum1+-lacZ transcription under copper deficiency. Insertion of a multipartite polyadenylation signal immediately downstream of iss1+ led to the exclusive production of a shorter iss1+ mRNA isoform, thereby allowing accumulation of cum1+ sense mRNA in copper-limited vegetative cells. This finding suggested that the long iss1+ antisense mRNA could pair with cum1+ sense mRNA, thereby producing double-stranded RNA molecules that could induce RNAi. We consistently found that mutant strains for RNAi (dcr1Δ, ago1Δ, rdp1Δ, and clr4Δ) are defective in selectively eliminating cum1+ sense transcript in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these results describe the first example of a copper-regulated meiotic gene repressed by an antisense transcription mechanism in vegetative cells."

https://openalex.org/W1961944665,"Post-reproductive lifespan is a common trait among mammals and is usually considered to be neutral; i.e. with no influence on population dynamics. Here, we explore the role of post-reproductive lifespan in the fixation probability of beneficial genetic variation. We compare two separate, stationary populations living in a constant environment that are equivalent except for the average time their respective members spend in the post-reproductive stage of life. Using a recently derived approximation, we show that fixation of a beneficial mutation is more likely in the population with greater post-reproductive longevity. This finding is surprising, as the population with more prolonged post-reproductive lifespan has smaller effective size and the classic population-genetic model would suggest that decreasing effective size reduces fixation chances of beneficial mutations. Yet, as we explain, in the age-structured case, when effective size gets smaller because of longer post-reproductive lifespan but census size is kept equal, a beneficial mutation has a higher likelihood to get fixed because it finds itself at higher initial frequency."
