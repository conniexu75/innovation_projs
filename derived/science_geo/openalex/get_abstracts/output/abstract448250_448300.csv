https://openalex.org/W1984538960,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are devastating neurodegenerative disorders with clinical, genetic, and neuropathological overlap. Hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansions in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the major genetic cause of FTD and ALS (c9FTD/ALS). The RNA structure of GGGGCC repeats renders these transcripts susceptible to an unconventional mechanism of translation-repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Antibodies generated against putative GGGGCC repeat RAN-translated peptides (anti-C9RANT) detected high molecular weight, insoluble material in brain homogenates, and neuronal inclusions throughout the CNS of c9FTD/ALS cases. C9RANT immunoreactivity was not found in other neurodegenerative diseases, including CAG repeat disorders, or in peripheral tissues of c9FTD/ALS. The specificity of C9RANT for c9FTD/ALS is a potential biomarker for this most common cause of FTD and ALS. These findings have significant implications for treatment strategies directed at RAN-translated peptides and their aggregation and the RNA structures necessary for their production."
https://openalex.org/W2053293102,"A class of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with enhancer-like activity is found to associate with the co-activator complex Mediator and promote its genomic association and enzymatic activity; together with Mediator, the lncRNAs also help to maintain the chromosomal architecture of active regulatory elements. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can both repress and activate gene expression. Here, a class of lncRNAs with enhancer-like activity is found to associate with the translational co-activator complex Mediator. Termed ncRNA-activating (ncRNA-a), these molecules promote the genomic association and enzymatic activity of Mediator, and acting together with Mediator, they also help to maintain the chromosomal architecture of active regulatory elements. Importantly, Mediator complexes containing disease-linked mutant MED12 proteins fail to associate with ncRNA-a. The MED12 gene encodes a Mediator complex subunit, and MED12 mutations have been linked to FG syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with symptoms including intellectual disability. This work suggests that the loss of Mediator–ncRNA-a interactions might be a possible contributing factor in such developmental diseases. Recent advances in genomic research have revealed the existence of a large number of transcripts devoid of protein-coding potential in multiple organisms1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Although the functional role for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been best defined in epigenetic phenomena such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting, different classes of lncRNAs may have varied biological functions8,9,10,11,12,13. We and others have identified a class of lncRNAs, termed ncRNA-activating (ncRNA-a), that function to activate their neighbouring genes using a cis-mediated mechanism5,14,15,16. To define the precise mode by which such enhancer-like RNAs function, we depleted factors with known roles in transcriptional activation and assessed their role in RNA-dependent activation. Here we report that depletion of the components of the co-activator complex, Mediator, specifically and potently diminished the ncRNA-induced activation of transcription in a heterologous reporter assay using human HEK293 cells. In vivo, Mediator is recruited to ncRNA-a target genes and regulates their expression. We show that ncRNA-a interact with Mediator to regulate its chromatin localization and kinase activity towards histone H3 serine 10. The Mediator complex harbouring disease-17,18 displays diminished ability to associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed the presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci and its targets. Importantly, depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a reduced the chromatin looping between the two loci. Our results identify the human Mediator complex as the transducer of activating ncRNAs and highlight the importance of Mediator and activating ncRNA association in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2058570690,"Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the respiratory chain and has a central role in cellular energy production through the coupling of NADH:ubiquinone electron transfer to proton translocation. It is also implicated in many common human neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the entire, intact complex I (from Thermus thermophilus) at 3.3 Å resolution. The structure of the 536-kDa complex comprises 16 different subunits, with a total of 64 transmembrane helices and 9 iron–sulphur clusters. The core fold of subunit Nqo8 (ND1 in humans) is, unexpectedly, similar to a half-channel of the antiporter-like subunits. Small subunits nearby form a linked second half-channel, which completes the fourth proton-translocation pathway (present in addition to the channels in three antiporter-like subunits). The quinone-binding site is unusually long, narrow and enclosed. The quinone headgroup binds at the deep end of this chamber, near iron–sulphur cluster N2. Notably, the chamber is linked to the fourth channel by a ‘funnel’ of charged residues. The link continues over the entire membrane domain as a flexible central axis of charged and polar residues, and probably has a leading role in the propagation of conformational changes, aided by coupling elements. The structure suggests that a unique, out-of-the-membrane quinone-reaction chamber enables the redox energy to drive concerted long-range conformational changes in the four antiporter-like domains, resulting in translocation of four protons per cycle. The atomic-resolution structure of the entire respiratory complex I is reported, with the resolution high enough to map out the locations and orientations of nearly all amino-acid side chains—some of which link to human neurodegenerative diseases—and reveals which amino-acid interactions take place at the hydrophilic domain–membrane domain interface. Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and until now it was the only component of the respiratory chain without a fully known structure. In this manuscript, the authors present the atomic structure of the entire complex I. The enzyme facilitates the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, coupled to the translocation of four protons across the bacterial or inner-mitochondrial membrane. The structure reveals several unexpected features, including a long reaction chamber that accommodates the hydrophobic substrate quinone, allowing the enzyme to harness its redox energy. The unusual mechanism of this large protein machine involves long-range mechanical coupling between the chemical energy source and four molecular pumps, storing energy in the form of a proton gradient across the cellular membrane."

However, specific molecular mechanisms by which liquid-liquid unmixing and signal transduction are coupled remain unknown. Here, we show that during cellular stress the dual specificity kinase DYRK3 regulates the stability of P-granule-like structures and mTORC1 signaling. DYRK3 displays a cyclic partitioning mechanism between stress granules and the cytosol via a low-complexity domain in its N terminus and its kinase activity. When DYRK3 is inactive, it prevents stress granule dissolution and the release of sequestered mTORC1. When DYRK3 is active, it allows stress granule dissolution, releasing mTORC1 for signaling and promoting its activity by directly phosphorylating the mTORC1 inhibitor PRAS40. This mechanism links cytoplasmic compartmentalization via liquid phase transitions with cellular signaling.

Well-known among these are different types of RNA granules, microscopically visible accumulations of messenger ribonucleo-protein (mRNP) (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009Anderson P. Kedersha N.

A complex repertoire of mRNP-associated proteins determines whether mRNP complexes remain silent, become translationally active, or are degraded (Buchan and Parker, 2009Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: the ins and outs of translation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 932-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Particularly during stressful conditions such as heat, oxidative and osmotic stress, virus infection, and UV irradiation, translationally silenced mRNPs accumulate into stress granules (SGs) (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008Anderson P. Kedersha N. Stress granules: the Tao of RNA triage.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that the accumulation of RNA granules is reminiscent of concentration-dependent liquid-liquid unmixing of complexes consisting of mRNA and proteins with low complexity domains (Hyman and Simons, 2012Hyman A.A.

Although this may be a unifying principle of compartmentalization without membranes (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P. Eckmann C.R. Courson D.S. Rybarska A. Hoege C. Gharakhani J. Jülicher F. Hyman A.A. Germline P granules are liquid droplets that localize by controlled dissolution/condensation.Science. 2009; 324: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), many fundamental questions remain unanswered. For instance, are there specific molecular regulators of this type of compartmentalization? Is such compartmentalization utilized to control signal transduction, analogous to membrane-bound compartments? These questions become apparent during cellular stress, when cells have to coordinate SG condensation and dissolution with the control of signaling pathways that initiate mRNA translation (Buchan and Parker, 2009Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: the ins and outs of translation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 932-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Among these, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway takes a prominent role (Loewith and Hall, 2011Loewith R. Hall M.N.

Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in S. cerevisiae, TORC1 partitions in heat-induced SGs, suggesting a coupling of SG condensation and dissolution with TORC1 signaling and indicating a physiological role of SGs in the spatiotemporal regulation of TORC1 activity during stress (Takahara and Maeda, 2012Takahara T. Maeda T. Transient sequestration of TORC1 into stress granules during heat stress.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 242-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). How the regulation of SG condensation and TORC1 signaling is organized is, however, unclear. Here, we identify the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3) as a protein with the ability to condense P-granule-like speckles in the cytosol and to prevent SG dissolution via its N-terminal domain when it is in a kinase-inactive form. DYRK3 couples this to the control of mTORC1 signaling by keeping mTORC1 sequestered in SGs when inactive and by phosphorylating PRAS40, a negative regulator of mTORC1 (Sancak et al., 2007Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R. Lindquist R.A. Kang S.A. Spooner E. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M. PRAS40 is an insulin-regulated inhibitor of the mTORC1 protein kinase.Mol.

Insulin signalling to mTOR mediated by the Akt/PKB substrate PRAS40.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), when active. DYRK3 dynamically regulates its own partitioning between SGs and the cytosol through its kinase activity, suggesting a cyclic partitioning mechanism that couples compartmentalization through liquid phase transition with cellular signaling. To study the regulation of SG dissolution, we screened a custom library of 246 small compound kinase inhibitors for their ability to prolong the presence of SGs in HeLa cells during recovery from arsenite-induced oxidative stress. We first exposed cells to arsenite for 45 min, after which we allowed recovery for 240 min in the presence of small compound inhibitors at two different concentrations (Figure 1A and Table S1 available online). To monitor the occurrence of SGs, we used immunofluorescence staining against polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP1), which gets recruited to SGs upon stress, resulting in bright and easily detectable granules (Kedersha et al., 1999Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR link the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha to the assembly of mammalian stress granules.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Compounds that were able to block SG dissolution for at least three standard deviations above the mean of all treatments were considered as significant hits (Z score ≥ 3; red dots). At 1 μM concentration, GSK-626616 and Jak3 inhibitor IV were potent in blocking SG dissolution (Figure 1B, left side), whereas at 10 μM concentration, harmine, Wee1/Chk1 inhibitor, CDK4 inhibitor III, CDK2 inhibitor IV, HMS3229I17, and GSK-626616 were potent in blocking SG dissolution (Figure 1B, right side). GSK-626616 was the most potent in delaying SG dissolution at 1 μM, whereas harmine was present in the top 4% of compounds that delayed SG dissolution at low concentrations (Figure 1B, left side), and was most potent in delaying SG dissolution at 10 μM. To validate the seven identified compounds, we performed a second stress recovery assay using time-lapse imaging of U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-tagged Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), another marker for SGs (Ohn et al., 2008Ohn T. Kedersha N. Hickman T. Tisdale S. Anderson P. A functional RNAi screen links O-GlcNAc modification of ribosomal proteins to stress granule and processing body assembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress for 45 min caused a rapid increase of SG-positive cells, followed by a rapid decline in the subsequent recovery phase after arsenite washout (Figure 1C and Movie S1). The time-lapse imaging confirmed that five compounds, GSK-626616, harmine, CDK2 inhibitor IV, CDK4 inhibitor III, and Wee1/Chk1 inhibitor, reduced the decline rate of the fraction of cells with G3BP1-positive SGs during recovery. We further excluded compounds that induce SG condensation in the absence of oxidative stress. Treatment of cells for 240 min with compounds revealed that CDK2 inhibitor IV, and to a lesser extent Wee1/Chk1 inhibitor, induced SGs in the absence of stress (Figure 1D). CDK4 inhibitor III, GSK-626616, and harmine did not cause significant SG formation in HeLa cells during 240 min of treatment. Finally, we analyzed whether the compounds have an effect on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) at Ser51, which is induced by arsenite treatment and causes a translational arrest and rapid appearance of SGs (Anderson and Kedersha, 2002Anderson P. Kedersha N. Stressful initiations.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of the compounds could trigger the phosphorylation of eIF2α to levels comparable with those induced by arsenite, but the Wee1/Chk1 inhibitor and HMS3229I17 prevented full dephosphorylation of eIF2α after recovery from oxidative stress (Figure 1D). Of the three compounds, which were able to reduce the rate of SGs dissolution without evoking de novo SG condensation or affecting the phosphorylation state of eIF2α, two, GSK-626616 and harmine, are known inhibitors of DYRK family kinases (Erickson-Miller et al., 2007Erickson-Miller, C.L., Creasy, C., Chadderton, A., Hopson, C.B., Valoret, E.I., Gorczyca, M., Elefante, L., Wojchowski, D.M., Chomo, M., Fitch, D.M., et al.

Harmine specifically inhibits protein kinase DYRK1A and interferes with neurite formation.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6324-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). GSK-626616 has a reported IC50 of 0.7 nM for DYRK3, but the overall kinase specificity is unclear. To obtain a kinome-wide view on the specificity of GSK-626616, we profiled the inhibitory effect of GSK-626616 on 451 kinases in vitro (Karaman et al., 2008Karaman M.W. Herrgard S. Treiber D.K. Gallant P. Atteridge C.E. Campbell B.T. Chan K.W. Ciceri P. Davis M.I. Edeen P.T. et al.A quantitative analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). At 0.1 μM, GSK-626616 primarily inhibits DYRK family kinases (Figure S1A and Table S2 available online) with a good selectivity (S score (35) = 0.07), comparable to well-studied and highly specific kinase inhibitors (Karaman et al., 2008Karaman M.W. Herrgard S. Treiber D.K. Gallant P. Atteridge C.E. Campbell B.T. Chan K.W. Ciceri P. Davis M.I. Edeen P.T. et al.A quantitative analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). At 1 μM, GSK-626616 displays some off-target effects in vitro but still has reasonable selectivity against DYRK family kinases (S score (35) = 0.12). Harmine was previously tested on 67 kinases in vitro, and also shows a specific inhibition of DYRK family kinases at 1 μM (Bain et al., 2007Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. The selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors: a further update.Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), in particular of DYRK1A, DYRK2, and DYRK3 (Göckler et al., 2009Göckler N. Jofre G. Papadopoulos C. Soppa U. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. Harmine specifically inhibits protein kinase DYRK1A and interferes with neurite formation.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6324-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Taken together, specific inhibitors of DYRK family kinases delay the dissolution of SGs during recovery from stress in a manner that does not involve classical SG condensation pathways via eIF2α. To investigate the subcellular localization of DYRKs, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged versions in HeLa cells. Consistent with a previous classification of DYRK family kinases by their subcellular localization (Aranda et al., 2011Aranda S. Laguna A. de la Luna S. DYRK family of protein kinases: evolutionary relationships, biochemical properties, and functional roles.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we found that GFP-DYRK1A and GFP-DYRK1B localized to the nucleus (Figure S2A). Interestingly, GFP-DYRK3 localized predominantly on distinct speckles distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell (Figure 2A). This subcellular localization of GFP-DYRK3 was not seen for GFP-DYRK2 or GFP-DYRK4, the two other class 2 DYRK family members (Figure S2A).Figure 2DYRK3 Condenses in Speckles and Partitions in Stress GranulesShow full caption(A) A confocal image stack of a HeLa cell transiently expressing GFP-DYRK3 that condensed into distinct speckles distributed throughout the cytoplasm.(B) GFP-DYRK3 condenses P-granule-like speckles in a concentration-dependent manner.

At low levels of expression, however, GFP-DYRK3 displayed a homogeneous distribution throughout the cytoplasm and did not condense in speckles (Figure 2B). When we correlated GFP-DYRK3 condensation with its level of expression, we discovered that it occurs in every cell when a certain threshold expression level is reached (Figure 2B). Furthermore, following GFP-DYRK3 speckles by time-lapse microscopy revealed that the speckles move and merge in a liquid droplet-like manner (Figure S2B and Movie S2). These observations are reminiscent of P granule behavior in C. elegans (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P. Eckmann C.R. Courson D.S. Rybarska A. Hoege C. Gharakhani J. Jülicher F. Hyman A.A. Germline P granules are liquid droplets that localize by controlled dissolution/condensation.Science. 2009; 324: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). To test whether DYRK3 condenses RNA granule components, we coexpressed myc-DYRK3 with GFP-GW182, a scaffold protein of mRNA processing bodies (P bodies) in C. elegans, as well as in vertebrates (Eulalio et al., 2007Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. P bodies: at the crossroads of post-transcriptional pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar; Eystathioy et al., 2003Eystathioy T. Jakymiw A. Chan E.K. Séraphin B. Cougot N. Fritzler M.J. The GW182 protein colocalizes with mRNA degradation associated proteins hDcp1 and hLSm4 in cytoplasmic GW bodies.RNA. 2003; 9: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When c-expressed, myc-DYRK3 and GFP-GW182 condense in granules that were larger than formed by GFP-DYRK3 expression alone (Figure 2C). Importantly, we observed that during oxidative and osmotic stress, endogenous DYRK3, as well as GFP-DYRK3, localizes to SGs (Figures 2D and 2E). Furthermore, DEAD box p54 protein 6 (DDX6)-positive P bodies, often in close proximity to SGs, were found docked on GFP-DYRK3-positive granules (Figure S2C). Moreover, endogenous DYRK3 remained localized to SGs after 240 min of stress recovery in the presence of DYRK inhibitors (Figures 2F and S2D). Thus, DYRK3 has the potential to condense granules in the cytosol of human cells to which the mRNA-binding protein GW182 can be recruited, and DYRK3 localizes to SGs during oxidative and osmotic stress. We next explored how inhibition of DYRK3 prevents SG dissolution. We observed that RNAi-mediated depletion of DYRK3, or of the other DYRKs (not shown), did not disturb the condensation of SGs during oxidative stress (not shown) or dissolution of SGs after oxidative stress (Figure 3A). Instead, we discovered that DYRK3 depletion, but not that of the other DYRKs (not shown), reduced the block in SG dissolution caused by GSK-626616 treatment. This suggests that inhibited DYRK3 is in a state that specifically prevents the dissolution of SGs. In support of this, we observed that expression of the kinase-deficient point mutant DYRK3-K218M is sufficient to cause the appearance of large cytoplasmic structures positive for mRNA granule markers, on which GFP-DYRK3-K218M accumulated, even in the absence of stress (Figure 3B). To test whether a specific domain of DYRK3 mediates partitioning to RNA granules, we generated a series of DYRK3 truncations (Figure 3C). Expression of DYRK3-NT, which consists of the N-terminal residues 1–188 and contains a predicted low-complexity sequence (Figure S2E) but which excludes the kinase domain and C-terminal end, induced the appearance of large granules at high expression levels (Figure 3D). Similar to SGs, these large granules had P bodies in close proximity and stained positive for PABP1 (Figure 3E). Conversely, overexpression of DYRK3 without the N-terminal domain (DYRK3-ΔNT) did not induce cytoplasmic granules and did not partition in SGs induced by oxidative stress (Figure 3F). Thus, inhibition of DYRK3 affects SG dissolution through a specific state of DYRK3 when its kinase activity is compromised. This state depends on the N-terminal domain of DYRK3, which, when expressed alone or as part of kinase-deficient DYRK3, is able to induce the appearance of SGs in the absence of stress. To obtain insight into how cells couple SG condensation and dissolution to signal transduction, we next studied which signaling pathways are affected by the inhibition of DYRKs. To reveal this, we studied changes in the phosphoproteome of cells after GSK-626616 treatment, using a quantitative label-free phosphoproteomic approach (Bodenmiller et al., 2010Bodenmiller B. Wanka S. Kraft C. Urban J. Campbell D. Pedrioli P.G. Gerrits B. Picotti P. Lam H.

At two different time points, 30 min and 12 hr of treatment respectively, we monitored the abundance of phosphorylated peptides (Bodenmiller et al., 2007Bodenmiller B. Mueller L.N. Mueller M. Domon B. Aebersold R. Reproducible isolation of distinct, overlapping segments of the phosphoproteome.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Of the overall 1,194 peptides identified, only those peptides that were identified in three independent replicate experiments and which were significantly enriched or depleted in the GSK-626616-treated samples compared to control (DMSO) samples (t test p value: < 0.1), where taken into account (Table S3). These criteria yielded a total of 44 regulated phosphorylated peptides: 26 after short-term treatment and 18 after long-term treatment with GSK-626616, respectively (Figure 4B). Six phosphorylated peptides were found to be significantly enriched or depleted at both time points. Eighteen out of the 22 and 7 out of the 15 corresponding proteins that were affected by short- and long-term treatment with GSK-626616, respectively, were recently reported to associate with mRNA or RNA granules (Baltz et al., 2012Baltz A.G.

In addition, mTORC1 signaling regulates five of the proteins affected in each treatment (Hsu et al., 2011Hsu P.P. Kang S.A. Rameseder J. Zhang Y. Ottina K.A. Lim D. Peterson T.R. Choi Y. Gray N.S.

Both eIF4E-BP1 and PDCD4 are translational repressors known to act downstream of the mTORC1-ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) pathway (Brunn et al., 1997Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulić A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T.

Similar changes in the phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP1 and PDCD4 were detected by immunoblotting using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, confirming our findings (Figure S3A). Thus, the DYRK kinase inhibitor GSK-626616 affects, among others, the phosphorylation of mRNA-associated proteins and proteins downstream of mTORC1 signaling. To validate the impact of inhibitors targeting DYRK family kinases on mTORC1 signaling, we evaluated the phosphorylation state of Thr389 of S6K1, which is considered a direct and appropriate readout for mTORC1 activity (Burnett et al., 1998Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. RAFT1 phosphorylation of the translational regulators p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). GSK-626616 treatment abolished the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 in nonstimulated HeLa cells, indicating a reduction in basal mTORC1 activity (Figure 4C). A variety of stimuli, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin addition, can increase mTORC1 activity above basal levels (Zoncu et al., 2011Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). GSK-626616 treatment reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 in EGF- and insulin-stimulated HeLa cells, showing that mTORC1 activity is impaired (Figure 4D). The extent to which low concentrations of GSK-626616 inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation in cells was similar to the effect of a rapamycin derivative (RAD-001), a well-known inhibitor of mTORC1 (Boulay et al., 2004Boulay A.

Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy has documented striking dynamics of opposed T6SS organelles in adjacent sister cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Such cell-cell interactions have been termed ""T6SS dueling"" and likely reflect a biological process that is driven by T6SS antibacterial attack. Here, we show that T6SS dueling behavior strongly influences the ability of P. aeruginosa to prey upon heterologous bacterial species. We show that, in the case of P. aeruginosa, T6SS-dependent killing of either Vibrio cholerae or Acinetobacter baylyi is greatly stimulated by T6SS activity occurring in those prey species. Our data suggest that, in P. aeruginosa, T6SS organelle assembly and lethal counterattack are regulated by a signal that corresponds to the point of attack of the T6SS apparatus elaborated by a second aggressive T6SS(+) bacterial cell.

Research on event perception has focused on transient elevations in predictive uncertainty or surprise as the primary signal driving event segmentation. We present human behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence in favor of a different account, in which event representations coalesce around clusters or 'communities' of mutually predicting stimuli. Through parsing behavior, fMRI adaptation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of event representations in a domain containing such community structure, but in which transition probabilities (the basis of uncertainty and surprise) are uniform. We present a computational account of how the relevant representations might arise, proposing a direct connection between event learning and the learning of semantic categories."
https://openalex.org/W1990060260,"Efforts to improve the production of a compound of interest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have mainly involved engineering or overexpression of cytoplasmic enzymes. We show that targeting metabolic pathways to mitochondria can increase production compared with overexpression of the enzymes involved in the same pathways in the cytoplasm. Compartmentalization of the Ehrlich pathway into mitochondria increased isobutanol production by 260%, whereas overexpression of the same pathway in the cytoplasm only improved yields by 10%, compared with a strain overproducing enzymes involved in only the first three steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Subcellular fractionation of engineered strains revealed that targeting the enzymes of the Ehrlich pathway to the mitochondria achieves greater local enzyme concentrations. Other benefits of compartmentalization may include increased availability of intermediates, removing the need to transport intermediates out of the mitochondrion and reducing the loss of intermediates to competing pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2142053177,"The functional potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) declines during aging, and in doing so, significantly contributes to hematopoietic pathophysiology in the elderly. To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2048378800,"To use microRNAs to downregulate mRNA targets, cells must first process these ~22 nt RNAs from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). These transcripts form RNA hairpins important for processing, but additional determinants must distinguish pri-miRNAs from the many other hairpin-containing transcripts expressed in each cell. Illustrating the complexity of this recognition, we show that most Caenorhabditis elegans pri-miRNAs lack determinants required for processing in human cells. To find these determinants, we generated many variants of four human pri-miRNAs, sequenced millions that retained function, and compared them with the starting variants. Our results confirmed the importance of pairing in the stem and revealed three primary-sequence determinants, including an SRp20-binding motif (CNNC) found downstream of most pri-miRNA hairpins in bilaterian animals, but not in nematodes. Adding this and other determinants to C. elegans pri-miRNAs imparted efficient processing in human cells, thereby confirming the importance of primary-sequence determinants for distinguishing pri-miRNAs from other hairpin-containing transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W1984512854,"Codon-usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes. Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure. Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but, unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2117279934,"The microtubules that comprise mitotic spindles in animal cells are nucleated at centrosomes and by spindle assembly factors that are activated in the vicinity of chromatin. Indirect evidence has suggested that microtubules also might be nucleated from pre-existing microtubules throughout the spindle, but this process has not been observed directly. Here, we demonstrate microtubule nucleation from the sides of existing microtubules in meiotic Xenopus egg extracts. Daughter microtubules grow at a low branch angle and with the same polarity as mother filaments. Branching microtubule nucleation requires γ-tubulin and augmin and is stimulated by factors previously implicated in chromatin-stimulated nucleation, guanosine triphosphate(GTP)-bound Ran and its effector, TPX2. Because of the rapid amplification of microtubule numbers and the preservation of microtubule polarity, microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation is well suited for spindle assembly and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2052390712,"Chronic stress and depression induce structural and functional plasticity; however, the mechanisms responsible for these alterations remain incompletely characterized. Here Scott J Russo and colleagues demonstrate that the Rac1 promoter is epigenetically modified, and its expression is reduced in the nucleus accumbens of mice after chronic defeat stress and in subjects with major depressive disorders. Reduced Rac1 expression is sufficient to induce depression-related behavior and stubby spine formation in mice. Depression induces structural and functional synaptic plasticity in brain reward circuits, although the mechanisms promoting these changes and their relevance to behavioral outcomes are unknown. Transcriptional profiling of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) for Rho GTPase–related genes, which are known regulators of synaptic structure, revealed a sustained reduction in RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) expression after chronic social defeat stress. This was associated with a repressive chromatin state surrounding the proximal promoter of Rac1. Inhibition of class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) with MS-275 rescued both the decrease in Rac1 transcription after social defeat stress and depression-related behavior, such as social avoidance. We found a similar repressive chromatin state surrounding the RAC1 promoter in the NAc of subjects with depression, which corresponded with reduced RAC1 transcription. Viral-mediated reduction of Rac1 expression or inhibition of Rac1 activity in the NAc increases social defeat–induced social avoidance and anhedonia in mice. Chronic social defeat stress induces the formation of stubby excitatory spines through a Rac1-dependent mechanism involving the redistribution of synaptic cofilin, an actin-severing protein downstream of Rac1. Overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 in the NAc of mice after chronic social defeat stress reverses depression-related behaviors and prunes stubby spines. Taken together, our data identify epigenetic regulation of RAC1 in the NAc as a disease mechanism in depression and reveal a functional role for Rac1 in rodents in regulating stress-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2090031443,"PD-1, a receptor expressed by T cells, B cells, and monocytes, is a potent regulator of immune responses and a promising therapeutic target. The structure and interactions of human PD-1 are, however, incompletely characterized. We present the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based structure of the human PD-1 extracellular region and detailed analyses of its interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 has typical immunoglobulin superfamily topology but differs at the edge of the GFCC' sheet, which is flexible and completely lacks a C"" strand. Changes in PD-1 backbone NMR signals induced by ligand binding suggest that, whereas binding is centered on the GFCC' sheet, PD-1 is engaged by its two ligands differently and in ways incompletely explained by crystal structures of mouse PD-1 · ligand complexes. The affinities of these interactions and that of PD-L1 with the costimulatory protein B7-1, measured using surface plasmon resonance, are significantly weaker than expected. The 3-4-fold greater affinity of PD-L2 versus PD-L1 for human PD-1 is principally due to the 3-fold smaller dissociation rate for PD-L2 binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is entropically driven, whereas PD-1/PD-L2 binding has a large enthalpic component. Mathematical simulations based on the biophysical data and quantitative expression data suggest an unexpectedly limited contribution of PD-L2 to PD-1 ligation during interactions of activated T cells with antigen-presenting cells. These findings provide a rigorous structural and biophysical framework for interpreting the important functions of PD-1 and reveal that potent inhibitory signaling can be initiated by weakly interacting receptors."

These histone tails are largely dispensable for nucleosome formation per se (Ausio et al., 1989Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E.

Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) but can serve as platforms for a variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) (Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8062) Google Scholar). These PTMs have the potential to govern chromatin function, according to the “histone code” hypothesis (Strahl and Allis, 2000Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Whereas the function of histone tails as highly modified “signaling platforms” is generally accepted, the globular domains have long been seen as simple structural scaffolds. However, PTMs have also been detected within the globular domains (Cocklin and Wang, 2003Cocklin R.R. Wang M.

(Schol. Ed.). 2009; 1: 142-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these PTMs map to residues located on the lateral surface of the histone octamer and are in direct or water-mediated contact with the nucleosomal DNA (Freitas et al., 2004Freitas M.A. Sklenar A.R. Parthun M.R. Application of mass spectrometry to the identification and quantification of histone post-translational modifications.J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on their critical location, Cosgrove et al., 2004Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Regulated nucleosome mobility and the histone code.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar proposed a model of “regulated nucleosome mobility” according to which modifications on the lateral surface could, in contrast to most PTMs in the histone tails, directly affect nucleosome and chromatin dynamics without depending on recognition by effector proteins. Within the globular domain of H3, four lysine residues map to the lateral surface: K56, K64, K115, and K122. All four lysines can potentially be acetylated (Tropberger and Schneider, 2010Tropberger P. Schneider R. Going global: Novel histone modifications in the globular domain of H3.Epigenetics. 2010; 5: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). H3K122 is located on the dyad axis of the nucleosome, which is the part of the lateral surface where histone-DNA binding reaches its maximum strength (Hall et al., 2009Hall M.A. Shundrovsky A. Bai L. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Wang M.D. High-resolution dynamic mapping of histone-DNA interactions in a nucleosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Replacing H3K122 with an acetyllysine-mimicking glutamine residue results in the loss of a water-mediated salt bridge between H3K122 and the DNA in the dyad axis (Iwasaki et al., 2011Iwasaki W. Tachiwana H. Kawaguchi K. Shibata T. Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Comprehensive structural analysis of mutant nucleosomes containing lysine to glutamine (KQ) substitutions in the H3 and H4 histone-fold domains.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that potential acetylation of H3K122 could act to destabilize histone-DNA binding. In line with this, it was found that in vitro acetylation in the dyad axis can enhance the rate of nucleosome disassembly upon mechanical stress (Simon et al., 2011Simon M. North J.A. Shimko J.C. Forties R.A. Ferdinand M.B. Manohar M. Zhang M. Fishel R. Ottesen J.J. Poirier M.G. Histone fold modifications control nucleosome unwrapping and disassembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 12711-12716Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In vivo first evidence for acetylation of H3K122 has been detected on bovine and human histones by mass spectrometry (Tan et al., 2011Tan M. Luo H. Lee S. Jin F. Yang J.S. Montellier E. Buchou T. Cheng Z. Rousseaux S.

Freitas M.A. Identification of novel histone post-translational modifications by peptide mass fingerprinting.Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the role of H3K122ac in chromatin has not yet been addressed. We therefore set out to functionally characterize acetylation of H3K122 in vitro and in vivo. We show that in vivo H3K122ac is enriched at genetic elements associated with transcriptional activation genome wide. In line with a role for promoting transcription, acetylation of H3K122 is dependent on the transcriptional coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) and is dynamically regulated by estrogen receptor signaling. Despite the coexistence of H3K122ac with other H3 tail acetylations in the same nucleosome, we found that H3K122ac—in contrast to a single H3 tail acetylation—can be sufficient to stimulate transcription and histone eviction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutation of K122 can result in impaired gene induction in vivo. To address the functional importance of modifications on the lateral surface of the histone octamer, we focused on acetylation of H3K122, located close to the dyad symmetry axis (Figure 1A), which is a region of major importance for nucleosome stability (Hall et al., 2009Hall M.A. Shundrovsky A. Bai L. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Wang M.D. High-resolution dynamic mapping of histone-DNA interactions in a nucleosome.Nat. Struct. Mol.

By mass spectrometric analysis, we confirmed acetylation of H3K122 in cells of human and murine origin (Figure S1A available online).Figure S1Detection of H3K122ac in MCF-7 Cells by Mass Spectrometry and in Different Organisms by Immunoblotting, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) CID tandem MS spectra of the tryptic histone H3 peptide VTIMPK122DIQLAR in both its unmodified and acetylated form, the m/z values of the peptides are shown in the upper right corner.

Virtually identical data were obtained for mouse ES cells (data not shown).(B) Immunodot blot assay with H3K122ac antibody. Peptides with acetylations at indicated residues within H3, unmodified H3K122 (H3K122un) and tetra-acetylated H4 at K5/8/12/16 (H4ac) were spotted in serial dilutions and detected with the H3K122ac antibody.(C) Peptide competition experiment with H3K122ac antibody in immunoblot on MCF-7 histones.

Two amounts of acid extracted histones (as indicated by triangle) from Schneider 2 cells (Drosophila m.), embryonic stem cells (mouse) and MCF-7 cells (human) were immunoblotted with antibody against H3K122ac. Ponceau serves as loading control.(E) H3K122ac is present in multiple mouse tissues. Acid extracted histones from the indicated mouse tissues were immunoblotted with antibodies against H3K122ac and general H3 as a loading control.

H3K122ac signal in histones from asynchronously growing MCF-7 cells is 80% from 1 in 200 dilution as determined by densitometry (ImageJ). We hence estimate that one in 250 H3 is acetylated at K122.

The high mass accuracy of ∼2ppm allowed unambiguous discrimination of tri-methyl from H3K122 acetyl modification. Virtually identical data were obtained for mouse ES cells (data not shown). (B) Immunodot blot assay with H3K122ac antibody. Peptides with acetylations at indicated residues within H3, unmodified H3K122 (H3K122un) and tetra-acetylated H4 at K5/8/12/16 (H4ac) were spotted in serial dilutions and detected with the H3K122ac antibody. (C) Peptide competition experiment with H3K122ac antibody in immunoblot on MCF-7 histones. The H3K122ac-specific antibody was pre-absorbed with 100pmol/ml of the same peptides as in (B). Competition is specific for the H3K122ac peptide. (D) H3K122 is acetylated in histones from Drosophila, mouse and human cell lines. Two amounts of acid extracted histones (as indicated by triangle) from Schneider 2 cells (Drosophila m.), embryonic stem cells (mouse) and MCF-7 cells (human) were immunoblotted with antibody against H3K122ac. Ponceau serves as loading control. (E) H3K122ac is present in multiple mouse tissues. Acid extracted histones from the indicated mouse tissues were immunoblotted with antibodies against H3K122ac and general H3 as a loading control. Note that in general the H3K122ac signal follows the H3 signal. (F) Approximation to level of H3K122ac in MCF-7 cells. Immunoblot of histones from untreated MCF-7 cells, and a mixture of recombinant H3 wt histone octamers and recombinant H3K122ac octamers (0.25% and 0.125% or 1 in 200 and 1 in 400 nucleosomes with K122ac, respectively). H3K122ac signal in histones from asynchronously growing MCF-7 cells is 80% from 1 in 200 dilution as determined by densitometry (ImageJ). We hence estimate that one in 250 H3 is acetylated at K122. For more details on H3K122ac octamers see also Figures 3 and S3. To gain insight into the function of H3K122ac, we first performed an exhaustive characterization of an antibody raised against acetylated H3K122. This antibody specifically recognizes histone H3 in nuclear extract from human MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Figure 1B). This signal can be increased by treatment of cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, demonstrating that, indeed, acetylation is detected (Figure 1C). The antibody is highly specific for synthetic peptides with H3K122ac over peptides with previously described acetyl marks in histone tails and globular domains, both in dot-blot and in competition assays (Figures S1B and S1C). To further exclude potential cross-reactivity with histone tail modifications, we digested native nucleosomes with a limited amount of trypsin to remove the tails. Removal of the H3 tail did not reduce the signal detected by the H3K122ac antibody (Figure 1D). Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the antibody used recognizes H3K122ac with high specificity. By immunoblot, we detected H3K122ac in histones from different higher eukaryotes, including human, mouse, and fly, as well as in different mouse tissues (Figures S1D and S1E), suggesting a rather ubiquitous presence of H3K122ac. We estimate that, on average, 1 out of 250 nucleosomes is acetylated at H3K122ac in untreated cells (Figure S1F). To gain insight in the nuclear distribution of H3K122ac, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. H3K122ac appeared uniformly distributed within the nucleus but excluded from DAPI-rich pericentromeric heterochromatic regions (Figure 1E). This localization pattern is euchromatic and suggests a localization of H3K122ac to “active” chromatin. To study the distribution of H3K122ac within chromatin, we first asked whether H3K122ac co-occurs with specific histone marks on the same nucleosome. We purified mononucleosomes from MCF-7 cells (Figures S2A–S2C), immunoprecipitated them with the H3K122ac antibody, and probed with antibodies recognizing other histone modifications (Figure 2A). H3K122ac-containing nucleosomes were globally enriched for acetyl marks on both histone H3 and H4 (Figure 2A, right). Additionally, H3K122ac co-occurred with a number of methyl marks, such as H3K4me1, which is enriched mainly at distal enhancers, and with H3K4me3, which predominantly locates to active promoters (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D.

See Figure S2 for preparation of mononucleosomes and validation of ChIP-seq experiments. In addition to histone marks, the distribution of histone variants differs between distinct chromatin states. The histone variant H2A.Z is generally present at promoters and enhancers (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K. High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome.Cell. 2007; 129: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar), and acetylated H2A.Z (H2A.Zac) is strongly enriched at active promoters (Valdés-Mora et al., 2012Valdés-Mora F. Song J.Z. Statham A.L. Strbenac D. Robinson M.D. Nair S.S. Patterson K.I. Tremethick D.J. Stirzaker C. Clark S.J. Acetylation of H2A.Z is a key epigenetic modification associated with gene deregulation and epigenetic remodeling in cancer.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found that H2A.Z and H2A.Zac co-occur with H3K122ac (Figure 2B). The histone variant H3.3 is enriched in specific genomic regions, including enhancers and transcribed genes (Goldberg et al., 2010Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.-M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M. Guo X. Li X. et al.Distinct factors control histone variant H3.3 localization at specific genomic regions.Cell. 2010; 140: 678-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Immunoblot for H3K122ac on ectopically expressed HA/FLAG-H3.1 and -H3.3 revealed significant enrichment of H3K122ac on the “active” variant H3.3 compared to H3.1 (Figures 2C and S2D). Altogether, these results suggest a global association of H3K122ac with marks and features of euchromatin and a preferred localization to active gene promoters and potentially to enhancers. To determine the genome-wide distribution of H3K122ac, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with next-generation sequencing. Sites of H3K122ac enrichment showed overall reduced nucleosome density (Figure S2E), which is in line with enrichment of H3K122ac in “open” euchromatin. We found H3K122ac enriched in distinct peaks or small regions of multiple peaks (Figure 2D), of which 43% percent map to gene promoters (Figure 2E). The distribution of H3K122ac at individual promoters (Figure 2F) suggests that H3K122ac is enriched close to the transcription start site (TSS). To further analyze this, we aligned all coding genes by their TSS (for TSS of noncoding transcripts, see Figure S2F) and plotted the average read distribution for H3K122ac. H3K122ac is globally enriched in two main peaks flanking the TSS (Figure 2G) with a relatively high level of enrichment upstream of the TSS. This H3K122ac pattern is overall more similar to H2A.Zac and H3K27ac distribution rather than to H3K9ac and H3K4me3 and does not extend far into the gene body, which is in agreement with the low levels of H3K36me3 on H3K122ac nucleosomes (Figure 2A). The levels of H3K122ac at the TSS correlate highly with the levels of gene expression (Figures 2G and S2F). Quantitative comparison of H3K122ac with other chromatin modifications revealed a high correlation for H3K122ac with H2A.Zac (Figure 2H) and H3K27ac, whereas, for example, H3K4me3 enrichment showed only modest correlation with H3K122ac. Because H2A.Zac is a strong indicator of transcriptional output (Valdés-Mora et al., 2012Valdés-Mora F. Song J.Z. Statham A.L. Strbenac D. Robinson M.D. Nair S.S. Patterson K.I. Tremethick D.J. Stirzaker C. Clark S.J. Acetylation of H2A.Z is a key epigenetic modification associated with gene deregulation and epigenetic remodeling in cancer.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), this points again toward a role of H3K122ac in transcription. Having established H3K122ac as a histone modification that is associated with chromatin marks and genetic elements of active transcription, we next aimed to directly test whether H3K122ac contributes functionally to transcription. To this end, we developed an in vitro transcription (IVT) assay with recombinant chromatin containing a single acetylation on H3. We produced recombinant H3 acetylated at either H3K122 or H3K18 (in the middle of the H3 tail as a control) in Escherichia coli using site-specific genetically directed incorporation of acetyllysine (Neumann et al., 2009Neumann H. Hancock S.M. Buning R. Routh A. Chapman L. Somers J. Owen-Hughes T. van Noort J. Rhodes D. Chin J.W. A method for genetically installing site-specific acetylation in recombinant histones defines the effects of H3 K56 acetylation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because IVT assays with chromatin require a step of acetylation for efficient transcription (Figure 3A), we included an H3K122R mutant as a nonacetylatable H3K122 control. We refolded and purified recombinant histone octamers with one of four different H3s (wild-type [WT] H3, H3K122R, H3K122ac, or H3K18ac) (Figures 3B and S3A) and assembled chromatin with the histone chaperone NAP1 and the ACF (ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor) remodeling complex (Figure S3B) on the pG5-MLP plasmid. We then compared successfully assembled (Figure S3C) and purified chromatin in IVT assays. Interestingly, we found that (under conditions permissive for efficient transcription of chromatin) H3K122ac is sufficient to cause an increase in transcription compared to chromatin with H3wt, H3K122R, and, importantly, H3K18ac histones (Figure 3C). On average, acetylation of H3K122 stimulates transcription by ∼1.7-fold (p = 0.02) (Figure 3D). Because only H3K122ac, but not the H3K122R mutation, enhanced transcription, this experiment demonstrates that stimulation of transcription by H3K122ac is not a general phenomenon due to alteration of H3K122.Figure S3Assembly of Chromatin with Site-Specific Acetylation at H3K122 and Histone Eviction Assay, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The site-specific acetylation of histone octamers (lanes 1-4) used in Figure 3B was validated by immunoblot with H3K9ac, H3K18ac and H3K122ac- specific antibodies in comparison to endogenous histone from MCF-7 cells treated with 10mM NaB (lane 5).(B) dNAP1 histone chaperone and ACF chromatin remodeling complex. The purity of recombinant dNAP1 and Acf1 and ISWI polypeptides of the ACF complex used for chromatin assembly reaction was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining.(C) Chromatin assembly with histone octamers containing either WT H3 (wt), H3K122ac, H3K122R or H3K18ac. For each octamer three different octamer to DNA (pG5-MLP plasmid) ratios were tested for dNAP1/ACF-mediated chromatin assembly by limited micrococcal nuclease digestion (Mnase, upper panel) and topoisomerase I relaxation (Topo I, bottom panel). Based on this an octamer to DNA ratio was chosen that resulted in a ladder of well-positioned nucleosomes and supercoiled plasmid DNA (for wt: 1.15:1, K122ac: 1.15:1, K122R: 0.95:1, K18ac: 1.1:1). Efficient relaxation of naked DNA by topoisomerase is shown in the lower panel on the left. For IVT, chromatin was purified by 10%–40% sucrose gradient centrifugation and only the peak fractions were used (same fractions for all four chromatin preparations, data not shown).(D) H3K122ac does not change chromatin compaction in a detectable manner.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive PKC that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm TRPA-1 in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for TRP channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures."

Here the authors find that a region of medial prefrontal cortex contains a distributed goal-value code that is independent of stimulus category. However, in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, they also find unique category-dependent distributed value codes. To choose between manifestly distinct options, it is suggested that the brain assigns values to goals using a common currency. Although previous studies have reported activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) correlating with the value of different goal stimuli, it remains unclear whether such goal-value representations are independent of the associated stimulus categorization, as required by a common currency. Using multivoxel pattern analyses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we found a region of medial prefrontal cortex to contain a distributed goal-value code that is independent of stimulus category. More ventrally in the vmPFC, we found spatially distinct areas of the medial orbitofrontal cortex to contain unique category-dependent distributed value codes for food and consumer items. These results implicate the medial prefrontal cortex in the implementation of a common currency and suggest a ventral versus dorsal topographical organization of value signals in the vmPFC."
https://openalex.org/W1987112627,"Using the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, we describe a mechanism by which transposons are initially targeted for RNAi-mediated genome defense. We show that intron-containing mRNA precursors template siRNA synthesis. We identify a Spliceosome-Coupled And Nuclear RNAi (SCANR) complex required for siRNA synthesis and demonstrate that it physically associates with the spliceosome. We find that RNAi target transcripts are distinguished by suboptimal introns and abnormally high occupancy on spliceosomes. Functional investigations demonstrate that the stalling of mRNA precursors on spliceosomes is required for siRNA accumulation. Lariat debranching enzyme is also necessary for siRNA production, suggesting a requirement for processing of stalled splicing intermediates. We propose that recognition of mRNA precursors by the SCANR complex is in kinetic competition with splicing, thereby promoting siRNA production from transposon transcripts stalled on spliceosomes. Disparity in the strength of expression signals encoded by transposons versus host genes offers an avenue for the evolution of genome defense."
https://openalex.org/W2069320301,"Circadian rhythms are oscillations in biological processes that function as a key adaptation to the daily rhythms of most environments. In the model cyanobacterial circadian clock system, the core oscillator proteins are encoded by the gene cluster kaiABC. Genes with high expression and functional importance, such as the kai genes, are usually encoded by optimal codons, yet the codon-usage bias of the kaiBC genes is not optimized for translational efficiency. We discovered a relationship between codon usage and a general property of circadian rhythms called conditionality; namely, that endogenous rhythmicity is robustly expressed under some environmental conditions but not others. Despite the generality of circadian conditionality, however, its molecular basis is unknown for any system. Here we show that in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongate, non-optimal codon usage was selected as a post-transcriptional mechanism to switch between circadian and non-circadian regulation of gene expression as an adaptive response to environmental conditions. When the kaiBC sequence was experimentally optimized to enhance expression of the KaiB and KaiC proteins, intrinsic rhythmicity was enhanced at cool temperatures that are experienced by this organism in its natural habitat. However, fitness at those temperatures was highest in cells in which the endogenous rhythms were suppressed at cool temperatures as compared with cells exhibiting high-amplitude rhythmicity. These results indicate natural selection against circadian systems in cyanobacteria that are intrinsically robust at cool temperatures. Modulation of circadian amplitude is therefore crucial to its adaptive significance. Moreover, these results show the direct effects of codon usage on a complex phenotype and organismal fitness. Our work also challenges the long-standing view of directional selection towards optimal codons, and provides a key example of natural selection against optimal codons to achieve adaptive responses to environmental changes."

https://openalex.org/W2028903026,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo dramatic rearrangements to their methylome during embryogenesis, including initial genome-wide DNA demethylation that establishes the germline epigenetic ground state.

Using PGCs differentiated from either control or Tet2(-/-); Tet1 knockdown embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we show that in vitro PGC (iPGC) formation and genome-wide DNA demethylation are unaffected by the absence of Tet1 and Tet2, and thus 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). However, numerous promoters and gene bodies were hypermethylated in mutant iPGCs, which is consistent with a role for 5hmC as an intermediate in locus-specific demethylation. Altogether, our results support a revised model of PGC DNA demethylation in which the first phase of comprehensive 5mC loss does not involve 5hmC. Instead, Tet1 and Tet2 have a locus-specific role in shaping the PGC epigenome during subsequent development."

Enhanced fetal γ-globin synthesis alleviates symptoms of β-globinopathies such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, but current γ-globin–inducing drugs offer limited beneficial effects. We show here that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition by RNAi in human erythroid cells or by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine in human erythroid cells or β-type globin–transgenic mice enhances γ-globin expression.

https://openalex.org/W2006630981,"The role of DNA methylation in the regulation of catabolic genes such as MMP13 and IL1B, which have sparse CpG islands, is poorly understood in the context of musculoskeletal diseases. We report that demethylation of specific CpG sites at -110 bp and -299 bp of the proximal MMP13 and IL1B promoters, respectively, detected by in situ methylation analysis of chondrocytes obtained directly from human cartilage, strongly correlated with higher levels of gene expression. The methylation status of these sites had a significant impact on promoter activities in chondrocytes, as revealed in transfection experiments with site-directed CpG mutants in a CpG-free luciferase reporter. Methylation of the -110 and -299 CpG sites, which reside within a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) consensus motif in the respective MMP13 and IL1B promoters, produced the most marked suppression of their transcriptional activities. Methylation of the -110 bp CpG site in the MMP13 promoter inhibited its HIF-2α-driven transactivation and decreased HIF-2α binding to the MMP13 proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In contrast to HIF-2α, MMP13 transcriptional regulation by other positive (RUNX2, AP-1, ELF3) and negative (Sp1, GATA1, and USF1) factors was not affected by methylation status. However, unlike the MMP13 promoter, IL1B was not susceptible to HIF-2α transactivation, indicating that the -299 CpG site in the IL1B promoter must interact with other transcription factors to modulate IL1B transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data reveal that the methylation of different CpG sites in the proximal promoters of the human MMP13 and IL1B genes modulates their transcription by distinct mechanisms."

While generally assumed to be pro-tumorigenic, it is unclear to what extent dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling impacts tumor progression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the present study, Wnt/β-catenin activity was characterized across a spectrum of PDAC cell lines and primary tumors. Reporter and gene expression-based assays revealed wide heterogeneity in Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity across PDAC cell lines and patient tumors, as well as variable responsiveness to exogenous Wnt ligand stimulation. An experimentally generated, pancreas-specific gene expression signature of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activation was used to stratify pathway activation across a cohort of resected, early-stage PDAC tumors (N=41). In this cohort, higher Wnt/β-catenin activation was found to significantly correlate with lymphvascular invasion and worse disease-specific survival (median survival time 20.3 versus 43.9 months, log-rank P=0.03). Supporting the importance of Wnt ligand in mediating autocrine Wnt signaling, Wnt/β-catenin activity was significantly inhibited in PDAC cell lines by WLS gene silencing and the small-molecule inhibitor IWP-2, both of which functionally block Wnt ligand processing and secretion. Transcriptional profiling revealed elevated expression of WNT7B occurred in PDAC cell lines with high levels of cell autonomous Wnt/β-catenin activity. Gene-knockdown studies in AsPC-1 and HPAF-2 cell lines confirmed WNT7B-mediated cell autonomous Wnt/β-catenin activation, as well as an anchorage-independent growth phenotype. Our findings indicate WNT7B can serve as a primary determinant of differential Wnt/β-catenin activation in PDAC. Disrupting the interaction between Wnt ligands and their receptors may be a particularly suitable approach for therapeutic modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PDAC and other cancer contexts where Wnt activation is mediated by ligand expression rather than mutations in canonical pathway members."
https://openalex.org/W2022342259,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic inflammatory metabolic disease, the key point being insulin resistance. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Previously, we found that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Here, we hypothesized that HHcy induces ER stress, which in turn promotes insulin resistance. In the present study, the direct effect of Hcy on adipose ER stress was investigated by the use of primary rat adipocytes in vitro and mice with HHcy in vivo. The mechanism and the effect of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) were also investigated. We found that phosphorylation or expression of variant ER stress markers was elevated in adipose tissue of HHcy mice. HHcy activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the downstream signal of ER stress in adipose tissue, and activated JNK participated in insulin resistance by inhibiting Akt activation. Furthermore, JNK activated c-Jun and p65, which in turn triggered the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. Both in vivo and in vitro assays revealed that Hcy-promoted macrophage infiltration aggravated ER stress in adipose tissue. Chemical chaperones PBA and TUDCA could reverse Hcy-induced inflammation and restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and Akt activation. Activation of GPR120 reversed Hcy-induced JNK activation and prevented inflammation but not ER stress. Therefore, HHcy inhibited insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue by inducing ER stress, activating JNK to promote proinflammatory cytokine production and facilitating macrophage infiltration. These findings reveal a new mechanism of HHcy in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2166722832,"p11, through unknown mechanisms, is required for behavioral and cellular responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We show that SMARCA3, a chromatin-remodeling factor, is a target for the p11/annexin A2 heterotetrameric complex. Determination of the crystal structure indicates that SMARCA3 peptide binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the heterotetramer. Formation of this complex increases the DNA-binding affinity of SMARCA3 and its localization to the nuclear matrix fraction. In the dentate gyrus, both p11 and SMARCA3 are highly enriched in hilar mossy cells and basket cells. The SSRI fluoxetine induces expression of p11 in both cell types and increases the amount of the ternary complex of p11/annexin A2/SMARCA3. SSRI-induced neurogenesis and behavioral responses are abolished by constitutive knockout of SMARCA3. Our studies indicate a central role for a chromatin-remodeling factor in the SSRI/p11 signaling pathway and suggest an approach to the development of improved antidepressant therapies.PaperClip/cms/asset/3c6d70a4-5c6f-4e57-9bc7-a020267f46ab/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.14 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2084979946,"Emerging lineage-tracing data support the existence of several pools of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the adult mouse. The +4 location is known to harbor proliferative cells undergoing robust apoptosis in response to irradiation, but their relationship with recently reported ISC models is unclear. Here, we found that tamoxifen, at doses commonly used to induce lineage tracing, mimics the irradiation-induced apoptotic response of the +4 cells. We found that about 40% of apoptotic cells were Lgr5-positive whereas Bmi1-positive ISCs became sensitive to tamoxifen upon entering a proliferative state. In turn, when we suppressed apoptosis by either Bcl2 overexpression or Chk2 deletion, we found that lineage tracing of Lgr5-positive cells was efficiently reduced. In contrast, lineage tracing from Bmi1-positive ISCs was substantially increased in apoptosis-deficient backgrounds. We propose that apoptosis plays an important role in controlling lineage tracing from different ISC populations in the mouse intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1969171489,"The development of neuronal networks in the neocortex depends on control mechanisms for mitosis and migration that allow newborn neurons to find their accurate position. Multiple mitogens, neurotrophic factors, guidance molecules and their corresponding receptors are involved in this process, but the mechanisms by which these signals are integrated are only poorly understood. We found that TrkB and TrkC, the receptors for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), are activated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling rather than by BDNF or NT-3 in embryonic mouse cortical precursor cells. This transactivation event regulated migration of early neuronal cells to their final position in the developing cortex. Transactivation by EGF led to membrane translocation of TrkB, promoting its signaling responsiveness. Our results provide genetic evidence that TrkB and TrkC activation in early cortical neurons do not depend on BDNF and NT-3, but instead on transactivation by EGFR signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2142783700,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can instruct the conversion of differentiated cells toward pluripotency following cell-to-cell fusion by a mechanism that is rapid but poorly understood. Here, we used centrifugal elutriation to enrich for mouse ESCs at sequential stages of the cell cycle and showed that ESCs in S/G2 phases have an enhanced capacity to dominantly reprogram lymphocytes and fibroblasts in heterokaryon and hybrid assays. Reprogramming success was associated with an ability to induce precocious nucleotide incorporation within the somatic partner nuclei in heterokaryons. BrdU pulse-labeling experiments revealed that virtually all successfully reprogrammed somatic nuclei, identified on the basis of Oct4 re-expression, had undergone DNA synthesis within 24 hr of fusion with ESCs. This was essential for successful reprogramming because drugs that inhibited DNA polymerase activity effectively blocked pluripotent conversion. These data indicate that nucleotide incorporation is an early and critical event in the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells in experimental ESC-heterokaryons."
https://openalex.org/W1973441562,"Cancer stroma has a profound influence on tumor development and progression. The conversion of fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts is a hallmark of reactive tumor stroma. Among a number of factors involved in this conversion, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β has emerged as a major regulator. CLIC4, an integral protein in TGF-β signaling, is highly upregulated in stroma of multiple human cancers, and overexpression of CLIC4 in stromal cells enhances the growth of cancer xenografts. In this study, we show that conditioned media from tumor cell lines induces expression of both CLIC4 and the myofibroblast marker alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in stromal fibroblasts via TGF-β signaling. Genetic ablation of CLIC4 in primary fibroblasts prevents or reduces constitutive or TGF-β-induced expression of α-SMA and extracellular matrix components that are markers of myofibroblasts. CLIC4 is required for the activation of p38 map kinase by TGF-β, a pathway that signals myofibroblast conversion in stromal cells. This requirement involves the interaction of CLIC4 with PPM1a, the selective phosphatase of activated p38. Conditioned media from fibroblasts overexpressing CLIC4 increases tumor cell migration and invasion in a TGF-β-dependent manner and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition indicating that high stromal CLIC4 serves to enhance tumor invasiveness and progression. Thus, CLIC4 is significantly involved in the development of a nurturing tumor microenvironment by enhancing TGF-β signaling in a positive feedback loop. Targeting CLIC4 in tumor stroma should be considered as a strategy to mitigate some of the tumor enhancing effects of the cancer stroma."

We aimed to determine whether specific miRNAs and their target mRNAs contribute to head and neck cancer pathogenesis and progression. To identify miRNAs associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), we analyzed HNSCC cell lines, normal head and neck tissues and normal keratinocytes by miRNA profiling; a group of differentially expressed miRNAs was identified, which includes miR-125b. Decreased expression of miR-125b is known to occur in epithelial cancers and many target mRNAs for this miR have been reported. We found decreased expression of miR-125b-1 and hypermethylation of its promoter in HNSCC compared with its non-malignant counterpart. The TACSTD2 (also known as TROP2) gene was identified and validated as a direct target of miR-125b-1. Abnormal expression of TACSTD2 cell-surface glycoprotein has been reported in most epithelial tumors, and the overexpressions of this mRNA and protein product has been considered a useful tumor marker. We report that miR-125b-1 causes mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway dysfunction through regulation of TACSTD2 expression. Thus, loss of miR-125b-1 may have a key role in the pathogenesis and progression of squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck and possibly of other tumors."

Spt16-M therefore appears to make important contacts with histones during nucleosome reorganization by FACT, but more detailed mechanistic insights have been unavailable due to the lack of structural information. Here, we report a crystal structure of Spt16-M from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 1.95 Å resolution. Surprisingly, this domain adopts a double pleckstrin homology architecture similar to the Pob3-M and Rtt106 PH domains. We map the published genetic data to the structure, revealing features of Spt16-M that are important for the physiological functions of FACT. We also show that Spt16-M binds to H3-H4, although this binding does not fully recapitulate the stronger interaction between FACT and H3-H4. Our results therefore support the model that Spt16-M contributes to the FACT-histone interaction and that FACT uses multiple independent contacts to bind the components of nucleosomes. S. cerevisiae Spt16-M was inserted into the pET-151DTOPO vector and verified by DNA sequencing. This vector encodes an N-terminal 6× histidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, such that processing by TEV protease leaves Spt16 residues Gly-675–Asp-958 preceded by 8 non-native residues (GIDPFTHM) and missing the predicted flexible loop residues Gly-775–Ser-780, inclusive. Spt16 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-RIL CodonPlus cells (Stratagene) using the autoinduction method (19Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4121) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by sonication, and protein was purified by nickel chelation nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with histidine-tagged TEV protease followed by reincubation with nitrilotriacetic acid resin to remove the His-tagged TEV protease and uncleaved Spt16-M. Spt16 was further purified by anion exchange (HiTrap Q HP) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex SD200). Spt16-M was crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops against a well solution containing 0.1 m sodium potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 40% PEG-400, and 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl.

Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Secondary structure elements are named according to the canonical PH domain scheme (26Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Petros A.M.

Although PH domains often form independent structural units, the PH1 and PH2 domains of Spt16-M associate with each other through an extensive interaction interface to form a single, apparently rigid double PH structural unit, an arrangement also found in Pob3-M and Rtt106 (9VanDemark A.P.

The impression of a rigid association is reinforced by the observation that the PH1-PH2 interface buries several hydrophobic residues, including Ile-728, Val-739, Met-846, Val-853, Leu-855, Ile-856, and Phe-860. Moreover, although they share only ∼14% sequence identity, Spt16-M overlaps with Pob3-M (PDB code 2GCL, Ref. 9VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T.

The most striking differences among Spt16-M, Pob3-M, and Rtt106 map to PH1. Pob3-M and Rtt106 each have an additional helix (H2), and loops that extend above PH1 that are not found in Spt16-M or in canonical PH domains (Fig. 2A). Spt16-M also includes features not found in Pob3-M, Rtt106, or canonical PH domains, including an unusually long helix (HA1) in PH1 (3.5 turns longer than the equivalent helix in Pob3 or Rtt106) and an additional helix (HB2) near the C terminus of PH2. To the best of our knowledge, Pob3-M and Rtt106 are the only other double PH domain structures determined, and both are reported to bind to histones H3-H4 (13Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G.

We therefore used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine that Spt16-Pob3 binds to yeast H3-H4 histones with an apparent affinity of ∼150 nm (Fig. 2C) and to Xenopus laevis H3-H4 somewhat less tightly, at ∼600 nm (data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies using a fluorescence shift assay that showed that human FACT binds to Xenopus laevis histones with an affinity of 685 nm (5Winkler D.D. Muthurajan U.M. Hieb A.R. Luger K. Histone chaperone FACT coordinates nucleosome interaction through multiple synergistic binding events.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41883-41892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We also examined the binding of Spt16-Pob3 to H2A-H2B and, consistent with a report that human FACT binds Xenopus laevis H2A-H2B with an affinity of 31 nm (5Winkler D.D. Muthurajan U.M. Hieb A.R. Luger K. Histone chaperone FACT coordinates nucleosome interaction through multiple synergistic binding events.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41883-41892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we determined that yeast Spt16-Pob3 binds yeast H2A-H2B with an affinity of ∼15 nm and binds to Xenopus laevis H2A-H2B with an affinity of ∼50 nm. Intact Spt16-Pob3 therefore has measurable affinity for both H2A-H2B and H3-H4 histones. To test whether Spt16-M contributes to the binding of Spt16-Pob3 to histones, we attempted to quantify the interaction with recombinant Spt16-M proteins in the EMSA, but did not observe complex formation with either yeast or X. laevis H3-H4 histones (data not shown). We therefore developed a more sensitive fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay, which demonstrated that Spt16-M binds X. laevis H3-H4 with an affinity of ∼2.5 μm (Fig. 2D), at least 4-fold weaker than the Spt16-Pob3 interaction with the same histones determined by EMSA. Yeast H3-H4 did not yield interpretable results using the FA assay, and we have been unable to achieve adequate concentrations of full-length Spt16-Pob3 to test the interaction with X. laevis H3-H4 by FA, so we cannot compare the affinities directly using the same assay. However, the failure of Spt16-M to form complexes by EMSA and the weaker binding to H3-H4 detected by FA indicate that Spt16-M contributes to H3-H4 binding but is responsible for only part of the binding affinity of Spt16-Pob3 for H3-H4. We also asked whether Spt16-M contributes to the binding of Spt16-Pob3 to H2A-H2B, but were unable to detect binding with either yeast or X. laevis H2A-H2B by EMSA. No reliable binding signal was observed by FA with yeast H2A-H2B, although signs of a weak interaction with X. laevis H2A-H2B were detected at the highest concentrations of Spt16-M we could achieve, suggesting the potential for binding with an affinity weaker than 50 μm. Even if this interaction is physiologically relevant, it is much weaker than the ∼15–50 nm interactions detected by EMSA or fluorescence shift with Spt16-Pob3 or human FACT. We conclude that Spt16-M does not contribute significantly to the binding of Spt16-Pob3 to H2A-H2B. Our results are consistent with reports that the Spt16-N (12Stuwe T. Hothorn M. Lejeune E. Rybin V.

Notably, Rtt106 forms a homodimer through association of two N-terminal domains, which suggests that the two double PH domains in an Rtt106 homodimer might bind the same H3-H4 tetramer cooperatively (13Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G.

It is attractive to speculate that this inferred architecture also promotes affinity in the Spt16-Pob3 heterodimer. Although co-crystal structures of histones bound to a double PH domain have not yet been reported, important binding determinants on Rtt106 and Pob3 have been identified. These include basic surfaces in Rtt106 and Pob3 that are important for binding dsDNA (28Liu Y. Huang H. Zhou B.O. Wang S.S. Hu Y. Li X. Liu J. Zang J. Niu L. Wu J. Zhou J.Q. Teng M. Shi Y.

Chem. 2010; 285: 4251-4262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and histones (14Zunder R.M. Antczak A.J. Berger J.M. Rine J. Two surfaces on the histone chaperone Rtt106 mediate histone binding, replication, and silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E144-E153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and a loop in Rtt106 that enables it to recognize acetylated H3K56 (13Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G. Structural basis for recognition of H3K56-acetylated histone H3-H4 by the chaperone Rtt106.Nature. 2012; 483: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Spt16-M lacks the basic patch described in Rtt106 and Pob3-M, but instead has a prominent acidic patch in PH2 that is less apparent in Pob3-M or Rtt106 (Fig. 2B). Thus, although these related chaperones use similar architectures to bind H3-H4, the detailed mechanisms may differ. Published genetic data are consistent with the functional importance of the Spt16-M-H3-H4 interaction (Fig. 3, A–D). The L61W mutation in histone H3 disturbs the structure of nucleosomes, presumably by destabilizing the interface between H3 and H4 (29Duina A.A. Winston F. Analysis of a mutant histone H3 that perturbs the association of Swi/Snf with chromatin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Growth defects caused by this mutation can be suppressed by mutations in SPT16 (15Myers C.N. Berner G.B. Holthoff J.H. Martinez-Fonts K. Harper J.A. Alford S. Taylor M.N. Duina A.A. Mutant versions of the S. cerevisiae transcription elongation factor Spt16 define regions of Spt16 that functionally interact with histone H3.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20847Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Duina A.A. Winston F. Analysis of a mutant histone H3 that perturbs the association of Swi/Snf with chromatin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that map to Spt16-M. Although the suppression mechanism is not known, these observations indicate a functional link between Spt16-M and histones H3-H4. Similarly, most of the mutations in SPT16 that were found to cause derepression of SER3, and are therefore implicated in reassembly of nucleosomes after passage of RNA polymerase, also mapped to Spt16-M (18Hainer S.J. Charsar B.A. Cohen S.B. Martens J.A. Identification of mutant versions of the Spt16 histone chaperone that are defective for transcription-coupled nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.G3 (Bethesda). 2012; 2: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This further supports an important role for this domain in restraining dispersal of nucleosomal components during transcription, presumably by binding directly to those components. Four previously identified mutants that display the Spt− phenotype, and in some cases are temperature-sensitive and/or hydroxyurea-sensitive (16Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Spt16-Pob3 and the HMG protein Nhp6 combine to form the nucleosome-binding factor SPN.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), map to Spt16-M (Fig. 1C). Of these, the spt16-11 allele has been used extensively for genetic analysis because strains with this mutation display the full range of defects associated with FACT mutations (30Clark-Adams C.D. Norris D. Osley M.A. Fassler J.S. Winston F. Changes in histone gene dosage alter transcription in yeast.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). spt16-11 includes two mutations, T828I and P859S, which are both necessary to produce these phenotypes. Thr-828 is located in the loop connecting PH1 and PH2. The threonine side chain methyl group projects into a hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 3E), whereas the side chain hydroxyl lies in a depression on the surface of Spt16 that is lined by polar side chains, where it forms H-bonds with ordered water molecules. Simple modeling suggests that isoleucine, which substitutes for Thr-828 in the Spt16-11 mutant, will destabilize the local protein structure by disrupting both packing of the hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen-bonding interactions near the protein surface. Substitution of Pro-859 for serine, which is the other mutation that occurs in Spt16-11, is also expected to destabilize the protein structure. This residue is highly conserved from yeasts to human. It is located in the loop connecting SB3 and SB4 and adopts a cis conformation (Fig. 3F), which indicates that its substitution, including by serine, will destabilize the local protein structure. Inspection of the structure suggests that the T828I and P859S substitutions are unlikely to be catastrophic for the overall protein conformation, but that they will each cause some structural instability by disrupting the local conformation. Their locations, on opposite sides of the waist of the double PH fold at the interface between PH1 and PH2, suggest at least two possible mechanisms by which they might perturb Spt16 function. One possibility is that in combination they might destabilize the overall structure to the extent that its functions are substantially impaired. A reduction in conformational stability in Spt16-11 is consistent with the observation that the level of Spt16 protein is reduced to about 20% of wild type after 3 h at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C and is about 70% of wild type in cells growing at 24 °C (11VanDemark A.P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 5058-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that all of the spt16-11 phenotypes result from reduced protein levels because similar levels are observed for an Spt16-G132D mutant, which does not cause a phenotype under conditions where spt16-11 strain display hydroxyurea sensitivity (11VanDemark A.P. Xin H. McCullough L. Rawlins R. Bentley S. Heroux A. Stillman D.J. Hill C.P. Formosa T.

Spt16-Pob3 and the HMG protein Nhp6 combine to form the nucleosome-binding factor SPN.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, an attractive second possibility is that the Spt16-11 mutations perturb a specific function such as a binding interaction. Consistent with this possibility, purified FACT with the Spt16-11 (T828I, P859S) mutations is functional, but less effective than WT FACT at promoting restriction endonuclease accessibility of nucleosomal DNA (17McCullough L. Rawlins R. Olsen A. Xin H. Stillman D.J. Formosa T. Insight into the mechanism of nucleosome reorganization from histone mutants that suppress defects in the FACT histone chaperone.Genetics. 2011; 188: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This defect was corrected by an H2B-A84D mutation that weakens the interface between H2B and H3-H4 in nucleosomes. This suggests that Spt16-11 protein does not efficiently induce or trap reorganized nucleosomes, and this defect can be compensated by a second mutation that makes nucleosomes more prone to being reorganized (17McCullough L. Rawlins R. Olsen A. Xin H. Stillman D.J. Formosa T. Insight into the mechanism of nucleosome reorganization from histone mutants that suppress defects in the FACT histone chaperone.Genetics. 2011; 188: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Together, the data suggest that proper juxtaposition of PH1 and PH2 of Spt16-M is important for maintaining both the stability and the appropriate functioning of Spt16. Similarly to Spt16-11, inspection of the structure suggests that all of the mutations illustrated in Fig. 1C will be slightly destabilizing but are unlikely to have a catastrophic effect on the overall protein conformation. The most innocuous-appearing of these mutations is P920L, which may destabilize the structure by placing a large hydrophobic side chain in a solvent-exposed environment, modestly disrupting interactions with other residues at the protein surface, and perhaps by destabilizing a kink in the protein chain that is stabilized by a proline. For this mutant in particular, it is tempting to speculate that the phenotype results from disruption of a functional interaction because it is close to a loop that has been implicated in H3-H4 binding by Pob3 (13Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: E144-E153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and near residues that display a change in chemical shift upon interaction with H3-H4 by Rtt106 (13Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G. Structural basis for recognition of H3K56-acetylated histone H3-H4 by the chaperone Rtt106.Nature. 2012; 483: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An obvious hypothesis to explain the defects observed in spt16-11 mutants was that this mutation disturbs the interaction between FACT and H3-H4. We tested this idea using the EMSA to quantify binding of (Spt16-11)-Pob3 to H3-H4. However, the results showed instead that the mutant version of FACT retains affinity for histones H3-H4 and even seems to increase it slightly (Fig. 2E). We do not favor the possibility that the increased affinity, which is small but reproducible, is the primary defect caused by the spt16-11 mutation because this gain of function should lead to genetic dominance of this allele, whereas all phenotypes it causes have been found to be fully recessive. We also note that, consistent with the previous conclusion that Spt16-M does not contribute substantially to the interaction between Spt16-Pob3 and H2A-H2B, (Spt16-11)-Pob3 bound to H2A-H2B with the same ∼15 nm affinity observed with WT Spt16-Pob3. The physiological defects caused by spt16-11 therefore do not appear to involve loss of binding affinity between Spt16-Pob3 and H3-H4, but may instead be related to a defect in inducing or stabilizing the reorganized form of nucleosomes, as suggested previously (17McCullough L. Rawlins R. Olsen A. Xin H. Stillman D.J. Formosa T. Insight into the mechanism of nucleosome reorganization from histone mutants that suppress defects in the FACT histone chaperone.Genetics. 2011; 188: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our finding that Spt16-M adopts a double PH domain structure and binds histones H3-H4 reveals a striking similarity to Pob3-M and Rtt106. Despite the overall similarity, differences among the three structures, including the additional secondary structural elements and distribution of surface electrostatic potential, confound efforts to propose a common mechanism of binding. The extent to which common binding modes are deployed, and the extent to which the recognition of lysine acetylation that has been characterized for Rtt106 is mirrored or missing in Pob3 and Spt16, are important questions for future studies. In addition to understanding how the individual double PH domains bind histones H3-H4, it will be important to understand how the two halves of the homodimeric structure of Rtt106 and the heterodimeric structure of Spt16-Pob3 collaborate to bind histones H3-H4. Relevant questions include: do the dimers make bidentate interactions with the same (H3-H4)2 tetramer while it is in a canonical nucleosome structure, do they promote disassembly of the tetramer from other nucleosomal components, or do they promote disassembly of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer into dimers? The locations of residues identified as important in various genetic screens (15Myers C.N. Berner G.B. Holthoff J.H. Martinez-Fonts K. Harper J.A. Alford S. Taylor M.N. Duina A.A.

Beyond the H3-H4 interactions, it will also be important to understand how Spt16-Pob3 interacts with other nucleosomal components. In particular, Spt16-Pob3 binds histones H2A-H2B (see above and Refs. 5Winkler D.D. Muthurajan U.M. Hieb A.R. Luger K.

Understanding how interactions with H2A-H2B and H3-H4 are coordinated will likely be central to understanding the biological mechanism of Spt16-Pob3/FACT."
https://openalex.org/W2018769559,"Pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG), the index mammalian securin, is abundantly expressed in several tumors and regulates tumor growth and progression. Molecular mechanisms elucidating PTTG regulation and actions remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that PTTG acts as a signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) target gene. Total STAT3 and Tyr705 phosphorylated STAT3 were concordantly expressed with PTTG in human colorectal tumors (n=97 and n=95, respectively, P<0.001). STAT3 specifically bound the human PTTG promoter and induced PTTG transcriptional activity (twofold) as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. STAT3 transfection increased PTTG mRNA and protein abundance twofold in HCT116 human colon cancer cells, and induction was further enhanced (threefold) by constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3-C), whereas strongly abrogated by dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3-DN). Attenuating PTTG expression by siRNA in STAT3 HCT116 stable transfectants suppressed cell growth and colony formation in vitro, and PTTG cell knockout also constrained activated STAT3-induced explanted murine tumor growth in vivo. STAT3 increased HCT116 cell migration and invasion up to fivefold, whereas cell mobility was abolished by STAT3-DN (>85%). Impairing PTTG expression by siRNA also strongly suppressed STAT3-faciliated cell migration and invasion by up to 90%. Knocking out PTTG in STAT3-C HCT116 stable transfectants strongly decreased tumor metastases in nude mice, indicating the requirement of PTTG for STAT3-promoted metastasis. These results elucidate a mechanism for tumor cell PTTG regulation, whereby STAT3 induces PTTG expression to facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, and further support the rationale for targeting PTTG to abrogate colorectal cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W2120225787,"HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene frequently epigenetically silenced in human cancers. HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of growth control and DNA damage response. We previously demonstrated that HIC1 can be either acetylated or SUMOylated on lysine 314. This deacetylation/SUMOylation switch is governed by an unusual complex made up of SIRT1 and HDAC4 which deacetylates and thereby favors SUMOylation of HIC1 by a mechanism not yet fully deciphered. This switch regulates the interaction of HIC1 with MTA1, a component of the NuRD complex and potentiates the repressor activity of HIC1. Here, we show that HIC1 silencing in human fibroblasts impacts the repair of DNA double-strand breaks whereas ectopic expression of wild-type HIC1, but not of nonsumoylatable mutants, leads to a reduced number of γH2AX foci induced by etoposide treatment. In this way, we demonstrate that DNA damage leads to (i) an enhanced HDAC4/Ubc9 interaction, (ii) the activation of SIRT1 by SUMOylation (Lys-734), and (iii) the SUMO-dependent recruitment of HDAC4 by SIRT1 which permits the deacetylation/SUMOylation switch of HIC1. Finally, we show that this increase of HIC1 SUMOylation favors the HIC1/MTA1 interaction, thus demonstrating that HIC1 regulates DNA repair in a SUMO-dependent way. Therefore, epigenetic HIC1 inactivation, which is an early step in tumorigenesis, could contribute to the accumulation of DNA mutations through impaired DNA repair and thus favor tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020736116,"A conjugate generated by expressed protein ligation between an antibody targeting dendritic cells (DCs) and an immune-stimulating double-stranded DNA reveals that DCs can mediate both innate and adaptive immunity and represents its potential utility as a vaccine adjuvant. Targeted delivery of antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) is a promising vaccination strategy. However, to ensure immunity, the approach depends on coadministration of an adjuvant. Here we ask whether targeting of both adjuvant and antigen to DCs is sufficient to induce immunity. Using a protein ligation method, we develop a general approach for linking the immune stimulant, poly dA:dT (pdA:dT), to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for DEC205 (DEC). We show that DEC-specific mAbs deliver pdA:dT to DCs for the efficient production of type I interferon in human monocyte-derived DCs and in mice. Notably, adaptive T-cell immunity is elicited when mAbs specific for DEC–pdA:dT are used as the activation stimuli and are administered together with a DC-targeted antigen. Collectively, our studies indicate that DCs can integrate innate and adaptive immunity in vivo and suggest that dual delivery of antigen and adjuvant to DCs might be an efficient approach to vaccine development."

Here, we focused our analysis on a specific subset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that play a dominant role in regulating immune responses in health and disease, so-called CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). We isolated both human and murine Treg and non-Treg counterparts and analyzed TRIB1 and Foxp3 mRNA expression by quantitative PCR on the freshly isolated cells or following 24 h of activation. Physical interaction between the human TRIB1 and Foxp3 proteins was analyzed in live cell lines by protein complementation assay using both flow cytometry and microscopy and confirmed in primary freshly isolated human CD4+CD25hiCD127− Tregs by co-immunoprecipitation. Both TRIB1 and Foxp3 were expressed at significantly higher levels in Tregs than in their CD4+CD25− counterparts (p < 0.001). Moreover, TRIB1 and Foxp3 mRNA levels correlated tightly in Tregs (Spearman r = 1.0; p < 0.001, n = 7), but not in CD4+CD25− T cells. The protein complementation assay revealed a direct physical interaction between TRIB1 and Foxp3 in live cells. This interaction was impaired upon deletion of the TRIB1 N-terminal but not the C-terminal domain, suggesting an interaction in the nucleus. This direct interaction within the nucleus was confirmed in primary human Tregs by co-immunoprecipitation. These data show a direct relationship between TRIB1 and Foxp3 in terms of their expression and physical interaction and highlight Tribbles-1 as a novel binding partner of Foxp3 in Tregs.

Biomarkers, as defined by the Biomarkers Definitions Working Group, are characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to therapeutic intervention (1Biomarkers Definitions Working GroupBiomarkers and surrogate endpoints: preferred definitions and conceptual framework.Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 69: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (4650) Google Scholar). Biomarkers have been the subject of intense interest over the past decade, with the hope of moving personalized medicine strategies into clinical practice. Our team previously identified Tribbles-1 (for Tribbles homolog 1, also called TRIB1) as a peripheral blood biomarker of chronic antibody-mediated rejection of human kidneys (2Ashton-Chess J. Giral M. Mengel M. Renaudin K. Foucher Y. Gwinner W. Braud C. Dugast E. Quillard T. Thebault P. Chiffoleau E. Braudeau C. Charreau B. Soulillou J.P. Brouard S.

TRIB1 is one of three Tribbles homologs first identified in the Drosophila (3Hegedus Z. Czibula A. Kiss-Toth E. Tribbles: novel regulators of cell function; evolutionary aspects.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the latter species, Tribbles act as a mitotic inhibitor by blocking the G2 phase of mitosis and facilitating degradation by the proteasome of the String phosphatase, thus impacting the ventral furrow formation (4Mata J.

In mammals, TRIB1 is a serine-threonine kinase-like molecule (7Kiss-Toth E. Bagstaff S.M. Sung H.Y. Jozsa V. Dempsey C. Caunt J.C. Oxley K.M. Wyllie D.H. Polgar T. Harte M. O'neill L.A.

However, contrary to most kinase proteins, this highly conserved and regulated protein appears to lack catalytic activity but acts rather like a scaffold protein by interacting with other molecules (8Sung H.Y.

For example, TRIB1 interacts with MEK1, and this interaction leads to the phosphorylation of ERK, resulting in cell survival or proliferation (7Kiss-Toth E. Bagstaff S.M. Sung H.Y. Jozsa V.

In addition to its potential as a biomarker in transplantation, TRIB1 has also been implicated in several diseases, primarily in cancer (9Yokoyama T. Nakamura T.

To further explore the role of TRIB1 in the immune system, we analyzed its expression in human peripheral blood and found it to be expressed by lymphocytes and more particularly in resting B cells and activated monocytes and dendritic cells (2Ashton-Chess J. Giral M. Mengel M. Renaudin K. Foucher Y. Gwinner W. Braud C. Dugast E. Quillard T. Thebault P. Chiffoleau E. Braudeau C. Charreau B. Soulillou J.P. Brouard S.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared by lymphosep-lymphozyte separation media (BioWest, Nuaille, France) gradient centrifugation. CD25high cells were isolated using a CD25 MicoBeads II kit for humans (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and an autoMACS® separator. Half of the recommended beads were used to select only the CD25high cell population. The CD25high cells were then labeled with anti-CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Pharmingen, Mountain View, CA), anti-CD127-PE (BD Pharmingen), and anti-CD25-Alexa Fluor 647 (anti-CD25 from Immunotech, Marseille, France) coupled to the fluorochrome using a molecular probe kit from Invitrogen) and sorted using a BD FACSAriaTM Flow Cytometer cell sorter and with FACSDivaTM software (BD Pharmingen). The negative fraction containing the CD25low cells was then labeled with anti-CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD25-Alexa Fluor 647 (anti-CD25 from Immunotech coupled to the fluorochrome using a molecular probe kit from Invitrogen) and sorted using the BD FACSAriaTM Flow Cytometer cell sorter with FACSDivaTM software. Sort gates for CD4+CD25− and CD4+CD25+CD127− human T cells are shown in Fig. 1A. The purity was systematically >97% for regulatory CD4+CD25+CD127− T cells and 96% for CD4+CD25− T cells. Splenocytes were prepared by using collagenase D and EDTA on a C57Bl6 mouse spleen. CD4+ T cells were isolated using the biotinylated mouse CD4 T lymphocyte enrichment mixture (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4+ T cells were then labeled with anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD25-PE (BD Biosciences) and sorted using the BD FACSAriaTM Flow Cytometer cell sorter with BD FACSDivaTM software. Sort gates for CD4+CD25− and CD4+CD25high mouse T cells are shown in Fig. 1B. Purity was systematically >93% for CD4+CD25high T cells and 98% for CD4+CD25− T cells. Splenocytes were prepared from C57Bl6 mice. Untouched CD4+ T cells were isolated using the CD4+ T cell isolation kit II, (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and Automacs pro separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). 1 × 105 Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127−) were cultured in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% AB serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin in each well of a round-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate. For activation of CD4+CD25+CD127− Tregs, 500 units/ml of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), and 20 μl of beads coated with monoclonal antibodies against the CD3 and CD28 cell surface molecules (Dynabeads Human Treg expander kit; Invitrogen) were added per well. Cells were cultured for 0 to 24 h in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2, 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and conserved at −80 °C until use. RNA isolation of T cells was performed using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an RT-Omniscript kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an Applied Biosystems 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using commercially available primer and probe sets for human TRIB1, FOXP3, and HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) (Applied Biosystems: Hs00179769_m1; Hs00203958_m1, and Hs99999909_m1, respectively) and for mouse TRIB1, Foxp3, and HPRT (Applied Biosystems; Mn00454875_m1, Mn00475156_m1, and Mn01545399_m1, respectively). HPRT was used as the endogenous reference gene to normalize RNA starting quantity. Relative expression between a given sample and a reference sample (fabricated using PBMC from a healthy volunteer or with mouse splenocytes) was calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt method after normalization to HPRT, with results expressed in arbitrary units. The protein complementation assay (PCA) can be used to determine whether two proteins directly and physically interact with each other (23Remy I. Michnick S.W.

One plasmid contains the gene of the first protein of interest followed by the first part of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The second plasmid contains the gene of the second protein of interest followed by the complementary part of the GFP gene. The transfected cells express the two proteins associated with the two GFP fragments. In the case of a direct physical interaction between the two proteins, the two complementary fragments of the GFP protein become in close proximity to one another, causing activation of the GFP and emission of fluorescence. Potential interaction between TRIB1 and Foxp3 was analyzed in HeLa and HEK 293 cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The V1 plasmid was a eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA 3.1(+) with a 3′-GFP (1) fragment of the GFP gene (amino acids 1–158), and the V2 plasmid was a similar expression vector with a 5′-GFP (2) fragment of the GFP gene (amino acids 159–239) as described previously (8Sung H.Y.

On day 0, HEK293 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 75,000 cells per well in 500 μl of complete medium. On day 1, cells were transfected with PolyFect (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Each transfection was performed in triplicate. For each well, there were 250 ng of V1 plasmid and 250 ng of V2 plasmid in a final volume of 25 μl of serum-free media. 5 μl of PolyFect were added, and the complexes were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. 25 μl of complete medium were added, and then 55 μl of each complex solution were transferred to relevant wells of the cells and incubated overnight for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On day 2, cells were washed with PBS, and GFP expression was analyzed by FACS. Several concentrations of Foxp3V1 or TRIB1V2 plasmids (100 or 400 ng) were tested. For microscopy analysis, the experiment was repeated with HeLa cells at a density of 10,000 cells per well in eight-well culture slides. 25 ng of each plasmid, 5 μl of serum-free media, 5 μl of PolyFect were mixed, and then 7.5 μl of complete medium were added. 18.5 μl of the complex solution were transferred to each well. The transfection was made in duplicate. After 24 h of incubation, cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy. The co-IP was performed on freshly isolated human Tregs, with the nuclear complex co-IP kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protocol was run in two parts, with the first part for the isolation of the nuclear proteins and the second part for the co-immunoprecipitation itself. For the isolation of the nuclear proteins, the cells were washed with phosphatase inhibitor and centrifuged, and the pellet was frozen at −80 °C until use, and then the nuclei were isolated, and finally the nuclear fraction was digested and collected following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Interchim, Montluçon, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the co-immunoprecipitation, on day 1, 120 μg of protein extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 5 μg of mouse anti-Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (clone ab450, Abcam, Paris, France), or with mouse IgG as a negative control, in low IP incubation buffer (without NaCl or detergent). On day 2, protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (GE Healthcare) was added to the protein/antibody mix and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The proteins were then immunoprecipitated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C and washed with low IP wash buffer. The bead pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 2× reducing loading buffer and boiled at 95–100 °C for 5 min. The co-IP samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and run at 200 V. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P membrane) (Millipore) at 200 mA for 2 h using a tank transfer. The membrane was blocked by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking in 2% bovine gelatin (in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated with the anti-TRIB1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (AP7726b, Abgent, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The next day, the membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking with an HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). This antibody was used as the secondary antibody in chemiluminescent Western blot assays using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). The revelation was made by using a Luminescent image analyzer (Fujifilm) and the Image Reader LAS-4000 and multigauge software (version 3.0; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The pUltra lentiviral vector was obtained from Addgene (plasmid 24129). The human Trib1 cDNA was cloned into the XbaI-BamHI sites, downstream of the 2a peptide coding sequence, in frame with the enhanced GFP sequence, allowing for the bicistronic expression of enhanced GFP and TRIB1 from the human ubiquitin C promoter. To obtain virus, 293T cells were cotransfected with the vector plasmid (pUltra or pUltra Trib1), the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelop plasmid pMD2G (addgene plasmids 12259, 12260), as described previously (48Pichard V. Couton D. Desdouets C. Ferry N. Polyploidization without mitosis improves in vivo liver transduction with lentiviral vectors.Hum. Gene. Ther. 2013; 24: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The titers of viral supernatants were determined by infecting 293T cells, and FACS analysis was performed based on detection of GFP expression. Freshly isolated mouse CD4+ T cells were plated in a 24-well plate at 300,000 cells per well in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. 30 units/ml of recombinant IL-2 was added, and Dynabeads® Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Invitrogen) was also added at a ratio of one bead for one cell. On day 2, the medium was replaced by fresh medium and new Dynabeads® mouse T-activator CD3/CD28 at a 1:1 ratio. CD4+ T cells were infected by spinoculation for 2 h at room temperature at 1000 rpm with various lentiviruses at different multiplicities of infection (MOI). On day 2 after infection, CD4+ T cells were activated using PMA and ionomycin for 5 h, and then the viability of cells was analyzed using BD horizon 450 (BD Biosciences) labeling. One day after infection, Dynabeads® mouse T-activator CD3/CD28 were removed, and the medium was replaced by new medium. On day 4 after infection, the medium was replaced by fresh medium with 30 units/ml of IL2 and Dynabeads® mouse T-activator CD3/CD28 was added at a 1:1 ratio. Cells were then labeled with CellTraceTM violet cell proliferation kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. On day 7, proliferation of cells was analyzed by cytometry using LSR II (BD Biosciences) and FACS DIVA software (BD Biosciences). The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison between two groups, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for comparison of more than two groups. The nonparametric Spearman test was used for correlation analysis of <30 samples, and the parametric Pearson test was used for correlation analysis of >30 samples. Values of p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***) were considered significant. We isolated CD4+CD25+CD127− Tregs and CD4+CD25− non-Treg counterparts from human PBMC using flow cytometry and a cell sorter (Fig. 1A) and measured the level of TRIB1 by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of the well known Treg marker, Foxp3, was analyzed in parallel. We found TRIB1 mRNA, similar to of Foxp3, to be expressed at significantly higher levels in human CD4+CD25+CD127− Tregs compared with their CD4+CD25− T cells counterparts (Fig. 2A) (p < 0.001 for TRIB1 and Foxp3). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between TRIB1 and Foxp3 mRNA expression in human regulatory T cells (r = 1.0; p = 0,0004; Fig. 2A) but not in CD4+CD25− T cells, suggesting a strong link between the regulation of TRIB1 and Foxp3 expression in the Tregs. Moreover, these results were confirmed in C57Bl6 mice where, again, an increase in TRIB1 and Foxp3 levels was observed in CD4+CD25+ Tregs compared with CD4+CD25− cells (p < 0.05 for TRIB1 and p < 0.01 for Foxp3) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2B). We also analyzed the protein level of TRIB1 and Foxp3 in Tregs by Western blot and unlike the mRNA level in Tregs, we observed no correlation between the protein level (data not shown). Given the correlation between TRIB1 and Foxp3 mRNA in Tregs, we wanted to know whether these two molecules are regulated in the same way during Treg activation. This was not the case as human Tregs activated with IL-2 and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads displayed only a transient increase in TRIB1 expression after 1 to 2 h of activation, and then the level of TRIB1 returned definitively to a basal level.

https://openalex.org/W1967157615,"H2B ubiquitylation is carried out by Bre1p, an E3 ligase, along with an E2 conjugase, Rad6p. H2B ubiquitylation has been previously implicated in promoting the association of RNA polymerase II with the coding sequence of the active GAL1 gene, and hence transcriptional elongation. Intriguingly, we find here that the association of RNA polymerase II with the active GAL1 coding sequence is not decreased in Δbre1, although it is required for H2B ubiquitylation. In contrast, the loss of Rad6p significantly impairs the association of RNA polymerase II with GAL1. Likewise, the point mutation of lysine 123 (ubiquitylation site) to arginine of H2B (H2B-K123R) also lowers the association of RNA polymerase II with GAL1, consistent with the role of H2B ubiquitylation in promoting RNA polymerase II association. Surprisingly, unlike the Δrad6 and H2B-K123R strains, complete deletion of BRE1 does not impair the association of RNA polymerase II with GAL1. However, deletion of the RING domain of Bre1p (that is essential for H2B ubiquitylation) impairs RNA polymerase II association with GAL1. These results imply that a non-RING domain of Bre1p counteracts the stimulatory role of the RING domain in regulating the association of RNA polymerase II with GAL1, and hence RNA polymerase II occupancy is not impaired in Δbre1. Consistently, GAL1 transcription is impaired in the absence of the RING domain of Bre1p, but not in Δbre1. Similar results are also obtained at other genes. Collectively, our results implicate both the stimulatory and repressive roles of Bre1p in regulation of RNA polymerase II association with active genes (and hence transcription) in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2093845272,"The most significant complication for patients with severe cases of congenital or acquired hemophilia A is the development of inhibitor antibodies against coagulation factor VIII (fVIII). The C2 domain of fVIII is a significant antigenic target of anti-fVIII antibodies. Here, we have utilized small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and biochemical techniques to characterize interactions between two different classes of anti-C2 domain inhibitor antibodies and the isolated C2 domain. Multiple assays indicated that antibodies 3E6 and G99 bind independently to the fVIII C2 domain and can form a stable ternary complex. SAXS-derived numerical estimates of dimensional parameters for all studied complexes agree with the proportions of the constituent proteins. Ab initio modeling of the SAXS data results in a long kinked structure of the ternary complex, showing an angle centered at the C2 domain of ∼130°. Guided by biochemical data, rigid body modeling of subunits into the molecular envelope of the ternary complex suggests that antibody 3E6 recognizes a C2 domain epitope consisting of the Arg(2209)-Ser(2216) and Leu(2178)-Asp(2187) loops. In contrast, antibody G99 recognizes the C2 domain primarily through the Pro(2221)-Trp(2229) loop. These two epitopes are on opposing sides of the fVIII C2 domain, are consistent with the solvent accessibility in the context of the entire fVIII molecule, and provide further structural detail regarding the pathogenic immune response to fVIII."

https://openalex.org/W2006226993,"Cervical cancer is the most common genital malignancy and the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV type 16, 18 and 31, and so on) are major agents for its cause. A key switch for the onset of cervical cancers by HPVs is the cellular degradation of the tumor-suppressor p53 that is mediated by the HPV-generated E6 protein. E6 forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin-ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) leading to p53 degradation. The components that control E6 expression and the mechanisms for regulation of the expression in host cells remain undefined. Here we show that the nuclear noncanonical poly(A) polymerase (PAP) speckle targeted PIPKIα regulated PAP (Star-PAP) controls E6 mRNA polyadenylation and expression and modulates wild-type p53 levels as well as cell cycle profile in high-risk HPV-positive cells. In the absence of Star-PAP, treatment of cells with the chemotherapeutic drug VP-16 dramatically reduced E6 and increased p53 levels. This diminished both cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth required for cancer progression, indicating a synergism between VP-16 treatment and the loss of Star-PAP. This identifies Star-PAP as a potential drug target for the treatment of HPV-positive cancer cells. These data provide a mechanistic basis for increasing the sensitivity and efficiency of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancers that have low levels of wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W2016014488,"Interrogating specific cellular activities often entails the dissection of posttranslational modifications or functional redundancy conferred by protein families, which demands more sophisticated research tools than simply eliminating a specific gene product by gene targeting or RNA interference. We have developed a novel methodology that involves engineering a single SCF(βTrCP)-based ubiquitin ligase that is capable of not only simultaneously targeting the entire family of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases for ubiquitination and degradation, but also selectively recruiting only activated ErbBs. The engineered SCF(βTrCP) ubiquitin ligase effectively blocked ErbB signaling and attenuated oncogenicity in breast cancer cells, yet had little effect on the survival and growth of non-cancerous breast epithelial cells. Therefore, engineering ubiquitin ligases offers a simple research tool to dissect the specific traits of tumorigenic protein families, and provides a rapid and feasible means to expand the dimensionality of drug discovery by assessing protein families or posttranslational modifications as potential drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2082134867,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome associated with susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) caused by inactivating mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. The precise functions of the FLCN gene product are still under investigation but RCC from BHD patients show loss of the wild-type allele consistent with a tumor suppressor gene function. In a search for potential synthetic-lethal targets for FLCN using a phosphatase siRNA library screening approach, we found that knockdown of SSH2 serine phosphatase (one of the three members of Slingshot family and previously implicated in actin reorganization) specifically induced Caspase3/7 activity in a dose-dependent manner (up to six-fold increase, 10 nM, 72 h) in two human FLCN-deficient cell lines (BHD-origin renal cell carcinoma UOK257 and thyroid carcinoma FTC133) but not in their folliculin expressing isogenic cell lines. SSH2 siRNA-induced knockdown was accompanied by increased expression of SSH1 and SSH3 (suggesting a compensatory regulatory mechanism among members of SSH family). FLCN-null cells exhibited evidence of dysregulated cofilin de/phosphorylation pathways. Knockdown of SSH2 in FLCN-null cells was associated with an alteration in cell cycle kinetics (20% increase in G1, 30% and 40% decrease in S and G2M, respectively). Combination treatment of multiple SSH family (SSH2 plus SSH1 and/or SSH3) siRNAs potentiated induction of Caspase3/7 activity and changes in the cell cycle kinetics. These data indicate that: (a) apoptotic cell death in FLCN-null cells can be triggered by SSH2 knockdown through cell cycle arrest; (b) SSH2 represents a potential therapeutic target for the development of agents for the treatment of BHD syndrome and, possibly, related tumors."
