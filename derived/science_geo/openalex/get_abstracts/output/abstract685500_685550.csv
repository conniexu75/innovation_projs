https://openalex.org/W4200420340,"Abstract Although myocarditis and pericarditis were not observed as adverse events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials, there have been numerous reports of suspected cases following vaccination in the general population. We undertook a self-controlled case series study of people aged 16 or older vaccinated for COVID-19 in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021 to investigate hospital admission or death from myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias in the 1–28 days following adenovirus (ChAdOx1, n = 20,615,911) or messenger RNA-based (BNT162b2, n = 16,993,389; mRNA-1273, n = 1,006,191) vaccines or a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test ( n = 3,028,867). We found increased risks of myocarditis associated with the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines and the first and second doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine over the 1–28 days postvaccination period, and after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We estimated an extra two (95% confidence interval (CI) 0, 3), one (95% CI 0, 2) and six (95% CI 2, 8) myocarditis events per 1 million people vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively, in the 28 days following a first dose and an extra ten (95% CI 7, 11) myocarditis events per 1 million vaccinated in the 28 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273. This compares with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1 million patients in the 28 days following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We also observed increased risks of pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Similar associations were not observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines, apart from an increased risk of arrhythmia following a second dose of mRNA-1273. Subgroup analyses by age showed the increased risk of myocarditis associated with the two mRNA vaccines was present only in those younger than 40."
https://openalex.org/W4200537820,"The present study is related to the analytical investigation of the magnetohydrodynamic flow of Ag − MgO / water hybrid nanoliquid with slip conditions via an extending surface. The thermal radiation and Joule heating effects are incorporated within the existing hybrid nanofluid model. The system of higher-order partial differential equations is converted to the nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations by interpreting the similarity transformations. With the implementation of a strong analytical method called HAM, the solution of resulting higher-order ordinary differential equations is obtained. The results of the skin friction coefficient, Nusselt number, velocity profile, and temperature profile of the hybrid nanofluid for varying different flow parameters are attained in the form of graphs and tables. Some important outcomes showed that the Nusselt number and skin friction are increased with the enhancement in Eckert number, stretching parameter, heat generation parameter and radiation parameter for both slip and no-slip conditions. The thermal profile of the hybrid nanofluid is higher for suction effect but lower for Eckert number, stretching parameter, magnetic field, heat generation and radiation parameter. For both slip and no-slip conditions, the hybrid nanofluid velocity shows an upward trend for both the stretching and mixed convection parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4220739643,"Selectivity of cortical neurons for sensory stimuli can increase across days as animals learn their behavioral relevance and across seconds when animals switch attention. While both phenomena occur in the same circuit, it is unknown whether they rely on similar mechanisms. We imaged primary visual cortex as mice learned a visual discrimination task and subsequently performed an attention switching task. Selectivity changes due to learning and attention were uncorrelated in individual neurons. Selectivity increases after learning mainly arose from selective suppression of responses to one of the stimuli but from selective enhancement and suppression during attention. Learning and attention differentially affected interactions between excitatory and PV, SOM, and VIP inhibitory cells. Circuit modeling revealed that cell class-specific top-down inputs best explained attentional modulation, while reorganization of local functional connectivity accounted for learning-related changes. Thus, distinct mechanisms underlie increased discriminability of relevant sensory stimuli across longer and shorter timescales."
https://openalex.org/W4200373694,"The tumor suppressive transcription factor p53 is frequently inactivated in cancer cells by missense mutations that cluster in the DNA binding domain. 30% hit mutational hotspot residues, resulting in a complete loss of transcriptional activity and mutant p53-driven chemotherapy resistance. Of the remaining 70% of non-hotspot mutants, many are partial loss-of-function (partial-LOF) mutants with residual transcriptional activity. The therapeutic consequences of a partial-LOF have remained largely elusive. Using a p53 mutation engineered to reduce DNA binding, we demonstrate that partial-LOF is sufficient to enhance oncogene-driven tumorigenesis in mouse models of lung and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, mouse and human tumors with partial-LOF mutations showed mutant p53 protein accumulation similar as known for hotspot mutants. Different from the chemotherapy resistance caused by p53-loss, the partial-LOF mutant sensitized to an apoptotic chemotherapy response and led to a survival benefit. Mechanistically, the pro-apoptotic transcriptional activity of mouse and human partial-LOF mutants was rescued at high mutant protein levels, suggesting that accumulation of partial-LOF mutants enables the observed apoptotic chemotherapy response. p53 non-hotspot mutants with partial-LOF, therefore, represent tumorigenic p53 mutations that need to be distinguished from other mutations because of their beneficial impact on survival in a therapy context."

https://openalex.org/W4200369118,"To date, there is limited information about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen especially in the acute phase of the infection. While available data from cohort studies including a total of 342 patients in the acute or recovery phase of the infection are reassuring, one study mentioned detecting virus in the semen of 6/38 COVID-19 patients. Here we assessed SARS-CoV-2 presence in the semen of COVID-19 positive patients in the acute stage of infection, within 24 hours of the positive nasopharyngeal swabs. Semen, seminal plasma and spermatozoa pellet were screened for SARS-CoV-2 and manual or airborne contamination during semen sampling. Among the 32 COVID-19 volunteers, the median interval from the onset of symptoms to semen collection was 4 days [IQR: 0-8]. Only one presented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in semen and seminal plasma fractions, although the spermatozoa pellet was negative. Viral cultures were all negative. We observed slightly higher concentrations of bacterial DNA in the SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen than in all negative samples. The bacteria identified neither confirm nor rule out contamination by oropharyngeal secretions during collection. SARS-CoV-2 was rarely present in semen during the acute phase of the disease. This very rare situation could be connected to oral or manual contamination during semen collection. The possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen calls for nasopharyngeal viral testing and strict hygiene protocols during semen collection before assisted reproductive attempts."
https://openalex.org/W4200088842,"In recent years the tumor suppressor p53 has been increasingly recognized as a potent regulator of the cell metabolism and for its ability to inhibit the critical pro-survival kinases AKT and mTOR. The mechanisms through which p53 controls AKT and mTOR, however, are largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that p53 activates the metabolic regulator DDIT4 indirectly through the regulatory factor X 7 (RFX7). We provide evidence that DDIT4 is required for p53 to inhibit mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent AKT activation. Most strikingly, we also find that the DDIT4 regulator RFX7 is required for p53-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 and AKT. Our results suggest that AMPK activation plays no role and p53-mediated AKT inhibition is not critical for p53-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. Moreover, using recently developed physiological cell culture media we uncover that basal p53 and RFX7 activity can play a critical role in restricting mTORC1 activity under physiological nutrient conditions, and we propose a nutrient-dependent model for p53-RFX7-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. These results establish RFX7 and its downstream target DDIT4 as essential effectors in metabolic control elicited by p53."
https://openalex.org/W4225679452,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the ongoing pandemic with multitude of manifestations and association of ABO blood group in South-East Asian population needs to be explored. Methods It was a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19. Blood group A, B, O, and AB were identified in every participant, irrespective of their RH type and allotted groups 1, 2,3, and 4, respectively. Correlation between blood group and lab parameters was presented as histogram distributed among the four groups. Multivariate regression and logistic regression were used for inferential statistics. Results The cohort included 1067 patients: 521 (48.8%) participants had blood group O as the prevalent blood type. Overall, 10.6% COVID-19-related mortality was observed at our center. Mortality was 13.9% in blood group A, 9.5% in group B, 10% in group C, and 10.2% in AB blood group (p = 0.412). IL-6 was elevated in blood group A (median [IQR]: 23.6 [17.5,43.8]), Procalcitonin in blood group B (median [IQR]: 0.54 [0.3,0.7]), D-dimers and CRP in group AB (median [IQR]: 21.5 [9,34]; 24 [9,49], respectively). Regarding severity of COVID-19 disease, no statistical difference was seen between the blood groups. Alteration of the acute phase reactants was not positively associated with any specific blood type. Conclusion In conclusion, this investigation did not show significant association of blood groups with severity and of COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-associated mortality."

It was also a year when policymakers started to prepare for the next inevitable pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200388284,"Novel strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) harboring nucleotide changes (mutations) in the spike gene have emerged and are spreading rapidly. These mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, virulence, or resistance to some neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the accurate detection of spike mutants is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and identifying neutralizing antibody-resistance caused by amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain. Here, we developed five SARS-CoV-2 spike gene primer pairs (5-SSG primer assay; 69S, 144S, 417S, 484S, and 570S) and verified their ability to detect nine key spike mutations (ΔH69/V70, T95I, G142D, ΔY144, K417T/N, L452R, E484K/Q, N501Y, and H655Y) using a Sanger sequencing-based assay. The 5-SSG primer assay showed 100% specificity and a conservative limit of detection with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) values of 1.4 × 102 TCID50/mL. The accuracy of the 5-SSG primer assay was confirmed by next generation sequencing. The results of these two approaches showed 100% consistency. Taken together, the ability of the 5-SSG primer assay to accurately detect key SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants is reliable. Thus, it is a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike gene mutants in a clinical setting, thereby helping to improve the management of patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225964756,"Antibiotic treatment in early life influences gastrointestinal (GI) microbial composition and function. In humans, the resultant intestinal dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk for certain diseases later in life. The objective of this study was to determine the temporal effects of antibiotic treatment on the GI microbiome of young cats. Fecal samples were collected from cats randomly allocated to receive either amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 mg/kg q12h) for 20 days (AMC group; 15 cats) or doxycycline (10 mg/kg q24h) for 28 days (DOX group;15 cats) as part of the standard treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, feces were collected from healthy control cats (CON group;15 cats). All cats were approximately two months of age at enrolment. Samples were collected on days 0 (baseline), 20 or 28 (AMC and DOX, respectively; last day of treatment), 60, 120, and 300. DNA was extracted and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and qPCR assays were performed. Fecal microbial composition was different on the last day of treatment for AMC cats, and 1 month after the end of antibiotic treatment for DOX cats, compared to CON cats. Species richness was significantly greater in DOX cats compared to CON cats on the last day of treatment. Abundance of Enterobacteriales was increased, and that of Erysipelotrichi was decreased in cats of the AMC group on the last day of treatment compared to CON cats. The abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria was increased in cats of the DOX group on days 60 and 120 compared to cats of the CON group. Only minor differences in abundances between the treatment groups and the control group were present on day 300. Both antibiotics appear to delay the developmental progression of the microbiome, and this effect is more profound during treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and one month after treatment with doxycycline. Future studies are required to determine if these changes influence microbiome function and whether they have possible effects on disease susceptibility in cats."
https://openalex.org/W4200103521,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis that is now impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known how COVID-19 risks influence people to consume antibiotics, particularly in contexts like Bangladesh where these pharmaceuticals can be purchased without a prescription. This paper identifies the social drivers of antibiotics use among home-based patients who have tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 or have COVID-19-like symptoms. Using qualitative telephone interviews, the research was conducted in two Bangladesh cities with 40 participants who reported that they had tested positive for coronavirus (n = 20) or had COVID-19-like symptoms (n = 20). Our analysis identified five themes in antibiotic use narratives: antibiotics as ‘big’ medicine; managing anxiety; dealing with social repercussions of COVID-19 infection; lack of access to COVID-19 testing and healthcare services; and informal sources of treatment advice. Antibiotics were seen to solve physical and social aspects of COVID-19 infection, with urgent ramifications for AMR in Bangladesh and more general implications for global efforts to mitigate AMR."
https://openalex.org/W4200153816,"We investigated the prevalence of ECG abnormalities and their association with mortality, organ dysfunction and cardiac biomarkers in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).This cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in Sweden. ECG, clinical data and laboratory findings during ICU stay were extracted from medical records and ECGs obtained near ICU admission were reviewed by two independent physicians.Eighty patients had an acceptable ECG near ICU-admission. In the entire cohort 30-day mortality was 28%. Compared to patients with normal ECG, among whom 30-day mortality was 16%, patients with ECG fulfilling criteria for prior myocardial infarction had higher mortality, 63%, odds ratio (OR) 9.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02-55.6) adjusted for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and patients with ST-T abnormalities had 50% mortality and OR 6.05 (95% CI 1.82-21.3) in univariable analysis. Both prior myocardial infarction pattern and ST-T pathology were associated with need for vasoactive treatment and higher peak plasma levels of troponin-I, NT-pro-BNP (N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide), and lactate during ICU stay compared to patients with normal ECG.ECG with prior myocardial infarction pattern or acute ST-T pathology at ICU admission is associated with death, need for vasoactive treatment and higher levels of biomarkers of cardiac damage and strain in severely ill COVID-19 patients, and should alert clinicians to a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200472485,"A high prevalence of disrespectful and abusive behaviour by health workers towards women during labour and delivery has been widely described in health facilities, particularly in Africa, and is a worldwide public health concern. Such behaviours are barriers to care-seeking, and are associated with adverse outcomes for mothers and newborns. This paper reports experiences of disrespectful care among informal working women in three public health facilities in Durban, South Africa.A qualitative longitudinal study was conducted among a cohort of informal working women recruited during pregnancy in two clinics in Durban. The study comprised a series of in-depth interviews conducted at different time points from pregnancy until mothers had returned to work, followed by focus group discussions (FGDs) with cohort participants. We present data from participatory FGDs, known as 'Journey with my Baby', conducted at the end of the study, during which women's experiences from pregnancy until returning to work were reviewed and explored. Thematic analysis was used with NVIVO v12.4.Three 'Journey with my Baby' FGDs were conducted with a total of 15 participants between March and October 2019. Many participants narrated experiences of disrespectful behavior from nurses during labour and childbirth, with several women becoming very distressed as a result. Women described experiencing rudeness and verbal abuse from nurses, lack of privacy and confidentiality, nurses refusing to provide care, being denied companionship and being left unattended for long periods during labour. Women described feeling anxious and unsafe while in the labour ward because of the behaviour they experienced directly and observed other patients experiencing. Such experiences created bad reputations for health facilities, so that women in the local community were reluctant to attend some facilities.Disrespect and abuse continues to be a serious concern in public health facilities in South Africa. We challenge the health system to effectively address the underlying causes of disrespectful behavior among health workers, initiate robust monitoring to identify abusive behavior when it occurs, and take appropriate actions to ensure accountability so that women receive the high-quality maternity care they deserve."
https://openalex.org/W4200252277,"Tuberculosis is a communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which primarily infects macrophages and establishes intracellular parasitism. A mycobacterial virulence factor Zn2+ metalloprotease 1 (Zmp1) is known to suppress interleukin (IL)-1β production by inhibiting caspase-1 resulting in phagosome maturation arrest. However, the molecular mechanism of caspase-1 inhibition by Zmp1 is still elusive. Here, we identified GRIM-19 (also known as NDUFA13), an essential subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, as a novel Zmp1-binding protein. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated GRIM-19 knockout murine macrophage cell line J774.1 and found that GRIM-19 is essential for IL-1β production during mycobacterial infection as well as in response to NLRP3 inflammasome-activating stimuli such as extracellular ATP or nigericin. We also found that GRIM-19 is required for the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1. Loss of GRIM-19 or forced expression of Zmp1 resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Our study revealed a previously unrecognized role of GRIM-19 as an essential regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome and a molecular mechanism underlying Zmp1-mediated suppression of IL-1β production during mycobacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W4200269135,"The association between lifestyle factors and mental health has been evaluated in isolation; however, there has been a lack of information about lifestyle patterns and Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in adolescents. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the association between sets of lifestyle patterns and the occurrence of CMD in Brazilian adolescents evaluated in a national school-based cross-sectional survey. The outcome variable considered was presence of CMD. Lifestyle patterns were identified from the Principal Component Analysis. Consumption of foods, water and alcoholic beverages, sleep, physical activity, and smoking were used to identify patterns as explanatory variables. Sociodemographic characteristics, administrative dependence of the school and, nutritional status, were considered adjustment factors in the regression model. A total of 70,427 adolescents were evaluated. The principal component analysis identified three lifestyle patterns: high consumption of ultra-processed foods and low consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods (pattern 1); high consumption of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in the last 30 days (pattern 2); and high consumption of water and high level of physical activity (pattern 3). In the adjusted model, in patterns 1 and 2, the third tertile presented greater chance of CMD (OR 1.68; CI 95% 1.51-1.87 and OR 1.38; CI 95% 1.19-1.60, respectively). In pattern 3, the second (OR 0.88; CI 95% 0.80-0.96) and the third (OR 0.80; CI 95% 0.72-0.88) tertiles presented lower chances of CMD among the adolescents evaluated. Therefore, we suggest that health-promoting practices aimed at adolescents include multiple behaviors, with the objective of ensuring physical, mental, and social well-being."

The main element of novelty is that the dataset is split into three sub-categories based on the pre-season fans' expectations to verify whether the impact of attendance determinants varies depending on teams' expected performance. Our results-based on Tobit model regressions-identify some significant differences across the three subsets. However, the difference that seems to be the most significant revealed a common preference of Italian fans towards higher quality opponents."
https://openalex.org/W4200437349,"Parkinson's disease (PD) can produce postural abnormalities of the standing body position such as kyphosis. We investigated the effects of PD, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), vision and adaptation on body position in a well-defined group of patients with PD in quiet standing and during balance perturbations. Ten patients with PD and 25 young and 17 old control participants were recruited. Body position was measured with 3D motion tracking of the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and head. By taking the ankle as reference, we mapped the position of the joints during quiet standing and balance perturbations through repeated calf muscle vibration. We did this to explore the effect of PD, DBS in the STN, and vision on the motor learning process of adaptation in response to the repeated stimulus. We found that patients with PD adopt a different body position with DBS ON vs. DBS OFF, to young and old controls, and with eyes open vs. eyes closed. There was an altered body position in PD with greater flexion of the head, shoulder and knee (p≤0.042) and a posterior position of the hip with DBS OFF (p≤0.014). With DBS ON, body position was brought more in line with the position taken by control participants but there was still evidence of greater flexion at the head, shoulder and knee. The amplitude of movement during the vibration period decreased in controls at all measured sites with eyes open and closed (except at the head in old controls with eyes open) showing adaptation which contrasted the weaker adaptive responses in patients with PD. Our findings suggest that alterations of posture and greater forward leaning with repeated calf vibration, are independent from reduced movement amplitude changes. DBS in the STN can significantly improve body position in PD although the effects are not completely reversed. Patients with PD maintain adaptive capabilities by leaning further forward and reducing movement amplitude despite their kyphotic posture."
https://openalex.org/W4200564486,"The scandals in publicly listed companies have highlighted the large losses that can result from financial statement fraud and weak corporate governance. Machine learning techniques have been applied to automatically detect financial statement fraud with great success. This work presents the first application of a Bayesian inference approach to the problem of predicting the audit outcomes of financial statements of local government entities using financial ratios. Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) with automatic relevance determination (BLR-ARD) is applied to predict audit outcomes. The benefit of using BLR-ARD, instead of BLR without ARD, is that it allows one to automatically determine which input features are the most relevant for the task at hand, which is a critical aspect to consider when designing decision support systems. This work presents the first implementation of BLR-ARD trained with Separable Shadow Hamiltonian Hybrid Monte Carlo, No-U-Turn sampler, Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms. Unlike the Gibbs sampling procedure that is typically employed in sampling from ARD models, in this work we jointly sample the parameters and the hyperparameters by putting a log normal prior on the hyperparameters. The analysis also shows that the repairs and maintenance as a percentage of total assets ratio, current ratio, debt to total operating revenue, net operating surplus margin and capital cost to total operating expenditure ratio are the important features when predicting local government audit outcomes using financial ratios. These results could be of use for auditors as focusing on these ratios could potentially speed up the detection of fraudulent behaviour in municipal entities, and improve the speed and quality of the overall audit."
https://openalex.org/W4226432135,"The global consumption of highly processed, calorie-dense foods has contributed to an epidemic of overweight and obesity, along with negative consequences for metabolic dysfunction and disease susceptibility. As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3203460037,"In this work, a novel idea is presented for combinatorial optimization problems, a hybrid network, which results in a superior outcome. We applied this method to graph pointer networks [1], expanding its capabilities to a higher level. We proposed a hybrid pointer network (HPN) to solve the travelling salesman problem trained by reinforcement learning. Furthermore, HPN builds upon graph pointer networks which is an extension of pointer networks with an additional graph embedding layer. HPN outperforms the graph pointer network in solution quality due to the hybrid encoder, which provides our model with a verity encoding type, allowing our model to converge to a better policy. Our network significantly outperforms the original graph pointer network for small and large-scale problems increasing its performance for TSP50 from 5.959 to 5.706 without utilizing 2opt, Pointer networks, Attention model, and a wide range of models, producing results comparable to highly tuned and specialized algorithms.

https://openalex.org/W4200148915,"Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI) occur when the motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is reduced by the delivery of a preceding peripheral nerve stimulus. The intra-individual variability in SAI and LAI is considerable, and the influence of sample demographics (e.g., age and biological sex) and testing context (e.g., time of day) is not clear. There are also no established normative values for these measures, and their reliability varies from study-to-study. To address these issues and facilitate the interpretation of SAI and LAI research, we pooled data from studies published by our lab between 2014 and 2020 and performed several retrospective analyses. Patterns in the depth of inhibition with respect to age, biological sex and time of testing were investigated, and the relative reliability of measurements from studies with repeated baseline SAI and LAI assessments was examined. Normative SAI and LAI values with respect to the mean and standard deviation were also calculated. Our data show no relationship between the depth of inhibition for SAI and LAI with either time of day or age. Further, there was no significant difference in SAI or LAI between males and females. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for repeated measurements of SAI and LAI ranged from moderate (ICC = 0.526) to strong (ICC = 0.881). The mean value of SAI was 0.71 ± 0.27 and the mean value of LAI was 0.61 ± 0.34. This retrospective study provides normative values, reliability estimates, and an exploration of demographic and testing influences on these measures as assessed in our lab. To further facilitate the interpretation of SAI and LAI data, similar studies should be performed by other labs that use these measures."
https://openalex.org/W4200196366,"Despite many advances in infection control practices, including prophylactic antibiotics, surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a significant cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and death worldwide. Our innate immune system possesses a multitude of powerful antimicrobial strategies which make it highly effective in combating bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. However, pathogens use various stealth mechanisms to avoid the innate immune system, which in turn buy them time to colonize wounds and damage tissues at surgical sites. We hypothesized that immunomodulators that can jumpstart and activate innate immune responses at surgical sites, would likely reduce infection at surgical sites. We used three immunomodulators; fMLP (formyl-Methionine-Lysine-Proline), CCL3 (MIP-1α), and LPS (Lipopolysaccharide), based on their documented ability to elicit strong inflammatory responses; in a surgical wound infection model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to evaluate our hypothesis. Our data indicate that one-time topical treatment with these immunomodulators at low doses significantly increased proinflammatory responses in infected and uninfected surgical wounds and were as effective, (or even better), than a potent prophylactic antibiotic (Tobramycin) in reducing P. aeruginosa infection in wounds. Our data further show that immunomodulators did not have adverse effects on tissue repair and wound healing processes. Rather, they enhanced healing in both infected and uninfected wounds. Collectively, our data demonstrate that harnessing the power of the innate immune system by immunomodulators can significantly boost infection control and potentially stimulate healing. We propose that topical treatment with these immunomodulators at the time of surgery may have therapeutic potential in combating SSI, alone or in combination with prophylactic antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4200243927,"The degree of attention individuals pay to olfactory cues (called odor awareness) influences the role of odors in everyday life. Particularly, odors produced by the human body (i.e., social odors) are able to carry a wide variety of information and to elicit a broad spectrum of emotional reactions, making them essential in interpersonal relationships. Hence, despite the assessment of awareness toward social odors is crucial, a proper tool is still lacking. Here, we designed and initially validated the Social Odor Scale (SOS), a 12-item scale designed to measure the individual differences in awareness towards different social odors. In Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; KMO test: MSA = 0.78; Bartlett's test: χ2(78) = 631.34, p < 0.001; Chi-squared test: χ2(42) = 71.84, p = 0.003) suggests that the three factors structure was the model that best fit with the Italian version of the scale. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supports a second-order model with one higher-order factor representing social odor awareness in general and three lower-order factors representing familiar, romantic partner, and stranger social odors. The final version of the scale presented a good fit (RMSEA = 0.012, SRMR = 0.069, CFI = 0.998, TLI = 0.997). In Study 2, CFA was performed in the German version of the scale confirming the validity of scale structure. Study 3 and 4 revealed that SOS total score and its subscales were positively correlated with other validated olfactory scales, but not with olfactory abilities. Moreover, SOS was found to be related to the gender of the participants: women reported to be more aware to social odors and, specifically, to familiar social odors than men. Overall, the results indicated that SOS is a valid and reliable instrument to assess awareness toward social odors in everyday life."

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 1,600 treatment-naïve patients (1,777 eyes) with exudative AMD. The 10 years were divided into 2-year phases I to V. Results Of the 1,600 patients, 720 (45.0%), 733 (45.8%), 98 (6.1%), and 49 (3.1%) were diagnosed with typical AMD, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), retinal angiomatous proliferation, and combined subtypes, respectively. The prevalence of PCV decreased from 54.7% in phase I to 46.0% at phase V. Of the 1,777 eyes, the mean baseline logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) in phases I, II, III, IV, and V were 0.70, 0.66, 0.55, 0.50, and 0.48, respectively. Phases III, IV, and V had significantly (P = 0.0012, P&lt;0.0001, P&lt;0.0001, respectively) better baseline VAs compared with phase I. The mean lesion sizes in phases I, II, III, IV, and V were 8.6, 6.7, 5.3, 5.7, and 5.7 Macular Photocoagulation Study disc areas, respectively. The sizes were significantly (P&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons) smaller in phases III, IV, and V compared with phase I. Conclusions Although the prevalence of PCV decreased from 54.7% in phase I to 46.0% at phase V, PCV has nevertheless been highly prevalent in Japanese patients with AMD compared with Caucasian patients. The annual better baseline VAs and smaller lesion sizes over time might be related to development of treatment and better concerns about AMD."

In a pilot study, botanical collections of the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities (CETAF) have therefore begun to semantically annotate their collection data, starting with data on people, and to link them via a central index system. As a result, it is now possible to query data on collectors across different collections and automatically link them to a variety of external resources. The system is being continuously developed and is already in production use in an international collection portal."
https://openalex.org/W4200604542,"Small cryptic invertebrates (the cryptofauna) are extremely abundant, ecologically important, and species rich on coral reefs. Ongoing ocean acidification is likely to have both direct effects on the biology of these organisms, as well as indirect effects through cascading impacts on their habitats and trophic relationships. Naturally acidified habitats have been important model systems for studying these complex interactions because entire communities that are adapted to these environmental conditions can be analyzed. However, few studies have examined the cryptofauna because they are difficult to census quantitatively in topographically complex habitats and are challenging to identify. We addressed these challenges by using Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) for sampling reef-dwelling invertebrates >2 mm in size and by using DNA barcoding for taxonomic identifications. The study took place in Papua New Guinea at two reef localities, each with three sites at varying distances from carbon dioxide seeps, thereby sampling across a natural gradient in acidification. We observed sharp overall declines in both the abundance (34-56%) and diversity (42-45%) of organisms in ARMS under the lowest pH conditions sampled (7.64-7.75). However, the overall abundance of gastropods increased slightly in lower pH conditions, and crustacean and gastropod families exhibited varying patterns. There was also variability in response between the two localities, despite their close proximity, as one control pH site displayed unusually low diversity and abundances for all invertebrate groups. The data illustrate the complexity of responses of the reef fauna to pH conditions, and the role of additional factors that influence the diversity and abundance of cryptic reef invertebrates."

Analyzing the contact network of patients can help clarify the path of virus transmission. Based on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in two major tourist provinces in southern China (Hainan and Yunnan), this study analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and dynamic contact network structure of patients in these two places. Results show that: (1) There are more female patients than males in these two districts and most are imported cases, with an average age of 45 years. Medical measures were given in less than 3 days after symptoms appeared. (2) The whole contact network of the two areas is disconnected. There are a small number of transmission chains in the network. The average values of degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank index are small. Few patients have a relatively high contact number. There is no superspreader in the network."
https://openalex.org/W4200181791,"The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill profoundly impacted the health of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) in Barataria Bay, LA (BB). To comprehensively assess the cardiac health of dolphins living within the DWH oil spill footprint, techniques for in-water cardiac evaluation were refined with dolphins cared for by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in 2018 and applied to free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in BB ( n = 34) and Sarasota Bay, Florida (SB) ( n = 19), a non-oiled reference population. Cardiac auscultation detected systolic murmurs in the majority of dolphins from both sites (88% BB, 89% SB) and echocardiography showed most of the murmurs were innocent flow murmurs attributed to elevated blood flow velocity [1]. Telemetric six-lead electrocardiography detected arrhythmias in BB dolphins (43%) and SB dolphins (31%), all of which were considered low to moderate risk for adverse cardiac events. Echocardiography showed BB dolphins had thinner left ventricular walls, with significant differences in intraventricular septum thickness at the end of diastole ( p = 0.002), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness at the end of diastole ( p = 0.033). BB dolphins also had smaller left atrial size ( p = 0.004), higher prevalence of tricuspid valve prolapse ( p = 0.003), higher prevalence of tricuspid valve thickening ( p = 0.033), and higher prevalence of aortic valve thickening ( p = 0.008). Two dolphins in BB were diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension based on Doppler echocardiography-derived estimates and supporting echocardiographic findings. Histopathology of dolphins who stranded within the DWH oil spill footprint showed a significantly higher prevalence of myocardial fibrosis ( p = 0.003), regardless of age, compared to dolphins outside the oil spill footprint. In conclusion, there were substantial cardiac abnormalities identified in BB dolphins which may be related to DWH oil exposure, however, future work is needed to rule out other hypotheses and further elucidate the connection between oil exposure, pulmonary disease, and the observed cardiac abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W4200480372,"The effects of treadmill workstation use on kinematic gait symmetry and computer work performance remain unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the effects of treadmill workstation use on lower body motion symmetry while performing a typing task when compared to overground and treadmill walking. The lower body motion of ten healthy adults (6 males and 4 females) was recorded by a motion capture system. Hip, knee, and ankle joint rotations were computed and compared for each condition. Despite comparable lower body kinematic gait asymmetries across conditions, asymmetric knee flexion motions at early gait cycle were only found in treadmill workstation users (left knee significantly more flexed than the right one). This demonstrates that the interaction between walking and another task is dependent on the task cognitive content. Our findings suggest that lower body kinematic gait symmetry may be influenced by the use of treadmill workstations."
https://openalex.org/W4200564555,"Vietnam is one of countries with the highest number of smokers in the world and the high smoking prevalence among men in the region. Although the real cigarette prices increased by around 4% during the 2010-2015 period, the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking among men decreased slightly from 31.3% to 30.7% during this period. This raises the question of whether cigarette consumption is sensitive to price. In this study, we estimated the effect of cigarette prices on smoking participation and tobacco expenditure in Vietnam. We found that a one-percent increase in the real cigarette price reduced the probability of cigarette smoking among males by 0.08 percentage points (95% CI from -0.06 to -0.10), equivalent to the price elasticity of the smoking prevalence at -0.26 (95% CI from -0.16% to -0.33%). Using this estimate, we predict that if the cigarette price is increased by 10%, the daily cigarette smoking prevalence among men would decrease from 30.7% to 29.9% and the number of male smokers would decline by around 270 thousand. Higher cigarette prices also reduced per capita tobacco expenditure of households. A one-percent increase in the cigarette price decreased per capita expenditure on tobacco consumption expenditure of households by 0.43 percent (the 95% CI from -0.029 to 0.822). This finding suggests that raising tobacco taxes and prices can be an effective measure to reduce tobacco use."
https://openalex.org/W4200139873,"The traits of two subspecies of western honey bees, Apis mellifera scutellata and A . m . capensis , endemic to the Republic of South Africa (RSA), are of biological and commercial relevance. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of important phenotypes found in these subspecies remains poorly understood. We performed a genome wide association study on three traits of biological relevance in 234 A . m . capensis , 73 A . m . scutellata and 158 hybrid individuals. Thirteen markers were significantly associated to at least one trait ( P ≤ 4.28 × 10 −6 ): one for ovariole number, four for scutellar plate and eight for tergite color. We discovered two possible causative variants associated to the respective phenotypes: a deletion in GB46429 or Ebony (NC_007070.3:g.14101325G&gt;del) (R69Efs*85) and a nonsense on GB54634 (NC_007076.3:g.4492792A&gt;G;p.Tyr128*) causing a premature stop, substantially shortening the predicted protein. The mutant genotypes are significantly associated to phenotypes in A . m . capensis . Loss-of-function of Ebony can cause accumulation of circulating dopamine, and increased dopamine levels correlate to ovary development in queenless workers and pheromone production. Allelic association ( P = 1.824 x 10 −5 ) of NC_007076.3:g.4492792A&gt;G;p.Tyr128* to ovariole number warrants further investigation into function and expression of the GB54634 gene. Our results highlight genetic components of relevant production/conservation behavioral phenotypes in honey bees."
https://openalex.org/W4200483699,"Working memory is a cognitive system devoted to storage and retrieval processing of information. Numerous studies on the development of working memory have investigated the processing of visuo-spatial and verbal non-spatialized information; however, little is known regarding the refinement of acoustic spatial and memory abilities across development. Here, we hypothesize that audio-spatial memory skills improve over development, due to strengthening spatial and cognitive skills such as semantic elaboration. We asked children aged 6 to 11 years old (n = 55) to pair spatialized animal calls with the corresponding animal spoken name. Spatialized sounds were emitted from an audio-haptic device, haptically explored by children with the dominant hand's index finger. Children younger than 8 anchored their exploration strategy on previously discovered sounds instead of holding this information in working memory and performed worse than older peers when asked to pair the spoken word with the corresponding animal call. In line with our hypothesis, these findings demonstrate that age-related improvements in spatial exploration and verbal coding memorization strategies affect how children learn and memorize items belonging to a complex acoustic spatial layout. Similar to vision, audio-spatial memory abilities strongly depend on cognitive development in early years of life."

https://openalex.org/W4200060227,"The use of ""belly scoring"" can offer a novel, non-invasive objective management tool to gauge food intake between individuals, groups, and populations, and thus, population fitness. As food availability is increasingly affected by predation, ecological competition, climate change, habitat modification, and other human activities, an accurate belly scoring tool can facilitate comparisons among wildlife populations, serving as an early warning indicator of threats to wildlife population health and potential population collapse. In social species, belly scores can also be a tool to understand social behavior and ranking. We developed and applied the first rigorous quantitative photogrammetric methodology to measure belly scores of wild painted dogs (Lycaon pictus). Our methodology involves: (1) Rigorous selection of photographs of the dorso/lateral profile of individuals at a right angle to the camera, (2) photogrammetrically measuring belly chord length and ""belly drop"" in pixels, (3) adjusting belly chord length as a departure from a standardized leg angle, and (4) converting pixel measurements to ratios to eliminate the need to introduce distance from the camera. To highlight a practical application, this belly score method was applied to 631 suitable photographs of 15 painted dog packs that included 186 individuals, all collected between 2004-2015 from allopatric painted dog populations in and around Hwange (n = 462) and Mana Pools National Parks (n = 169) in Zimbabwe. Variation in mean belly scores exhibited a cyclical pattern throughout the year, corresponding to biologically significant patterns to include denning demand and prey availability. Our results show significant differences between belly scores of the two different populations we assessed, thus highlighting food stress in the Hwange population. In the face of growing direct and indirect anthropogenic disturbances, this standardised methodology can provide a rapid, species-specific non-invasive management tool that can be applied across studies to rapidly detect emergent threats."
https://openalex.org/W4200166313,"Advances in genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and computational drug discovery have caused the identification of drug targets at the system-level and inhibitors to combat bacterial infection and drug resistance. Here we report a structural systems pharmacology framework that integrates the GEM and structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) method to identify drugs effective for Escherichia coli infection. The most complete genome-scale metabolic reconstruction integrated with protein structures (GEM-PRO) of E . coli , iML1515_GP, and FDA-approved drugs have been used. FBA was performed to predict drug targets in silico . The 195 essential genes were predicted in the rich medium. The subsystems in which a significant number of these genes are involved are cofactor, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis that are necessary for cell growth. Therefore, some proteins encoded by these genes are responsible for the biosynthesis and transport of LPS which is the first line of defense against threats. So, these proteins can be potential drug targets. The enzymes with experimental structure and cognate ligands were selected as final drug targets for performing the SBVS method. Finally, we have suggested those drugs that have good interaction with the selected proteins as drug repositioning cases. Also, the suggested molecules could be promising lead compounds. This framework may be helpful to fill the gap between genomics and drug discovery. Results show this framework suggests novel antibacterials that can be subjected to experimental testing soon and it can be suitable for other pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W4200352125,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive impairment, massive cell death, and reduced life expectancy. Pathologically, accumulated beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates and hyperphosphorylated tau protein is the hallmark of the disease. Although changes in cellular function and protein accumulates have been demonstrated in many different AD animal models, the molecular mechanism involved in different cellular functions and the correlation and causative relation between different protein accumulations remain elusive. Our in vivo genetic studies revealed that the molecular mechanisms involved in memory loss and lifespan shortening are different and that tau plays an essential role in mediating Aβ-induced early death. We found that when the first deacetylase (DAC) domain of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) activity was increased, it regulated cortactin deacetylation to reverse Aβ-induced learning and memory deficit, but with no effect on the lifespan of the Aβ flies. On the other hand, an increased amount of the second DAC domain of HDAC6 promoted tau phosphorylation to facilitate Aβ-induced lifespan shortening without affecting learning performance in the Aβ flies. Our data also confirmed decreased acetylation in two major HDAC6 downstream proteins, suggesting increased HDAC6 activity in Aβ flies. Our data established the double-edged sword effect of HDAC6 activity in Aβ-induced pathologies. Not only did we segregate memory loss and lifespan shortening in Aβ flies, but we also provided evidence to link the Aβ with tau signaling."

It is of practical and theoretical significance to choose urban public parks as the entry point to explore the changing trends and supply paths of urban residents' daily ecosystem service consumption. Based on the government 's research? of urban public parks in Beijing from 1993 to 2018, this study explores the residents' ecosystem services consumption demands and the contributions of park constructions to these demands. The results show that: (1) in the past 25 years, the frequency, duration, participation rate, and evaluation of people's daily ecosystem service consumption have increased significantly. In other words, the ecosystem services demands are increasing. (2) different constructions of a park have distinct contributions to the increasing demands of ecosystem service consumption. The contributions from constructions of the natural landscape and the infrastructure have been in decline since 1993, yet they contribute the most to the demands of residents' ecosystem services consumption until 2018. The contributions made by constructions of management and maintenance, and transportation around urban public parks have been on the rise and the significant points occurring after the 2008 Olympic Games. Our research proposes a method to determine the relation between the demands of residents' ecosystem services consumption and the contributions of park constructions to these demands, which has significant implications for optimizing the constructions of urban public parks to better meet the demands of ecosystem services consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4200533854,"As oesophageal cancer has short survival, it is likely pre-diagnosis health behaviours will have carry-over effects on post-diagnosis survival times. Cancer registry data sets do not usually contain pre-diagnosis health behaviours and so need to be augmented with data from external health surveys. A new algorithm is introduced and tested to augment cancer registries with external data when one-to-one data linkage is not available.The algorithm is to use external health survey data to impute pre-diagnosis health behaviour for cancer patients, estimate misclassification errors in these imputed values and then fit misclassification corrected Cox regression to quantify the association between pre-diagnosis health behaviour and post-diagnosis survival. Data from US cancer registries and a US national health survey are used in testing the algorithm.It is demonstrated that the algorithm works effectively on simulated smoking data when there is no age confounding. But age confounding does exist (risk of death increases with age and most health behaviours change with age) and interferes with the performance of the algorithm. The estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) of pre-diagnosis smoking was HR = 1.32 (95% CI 0.82,2.68) with HR = 1.93 (95% CI 1.08,7.07) in the squamous cell sub-group and pre-diagnosis physical activity was protective of survival with HR = 0.25 (95% CI 0.03, 0.81). But the method failed for less common behaviours (such as heavy drinking).Further improvements in the I2C2 algorithm will permit enrichment of cancer registry data through imputation of new variables with negligible risk to patient confidentiality, opening new research opportunities in cancer epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W4200592455,"Patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) have elevated levels of leucocyte elastase (LE) released from the activation of leucocytes. In acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), LE can degrade fibrin from the thrombus resulting in cross-linked fibrin degradation products (E-XDP) being released into the bloodstream. In patients with CVD the levels and significance of circulating E-XDP are unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between plasma E-XDP concentration and severity of CVD. Levels of E-XDP were quantified with a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma from 142 consecutively recruited CVD patients (mean age 64 years, (range 23-89), 81 were females and 61 males). Patients were also divided into three groups based on CVD severity using the C-class of the Clinical-Etiological-Anatomical-Pathophysiological (CEAP) classification, with C 0-1 class as the reference group, C 2-3 as the second group and C 4-6 as the third group with the most severely affected patients. We found significantly elevated levels of E-XDP in patients with C 4-6 compared with patients with C 0-1 (p = 0.007) and increased with increasing disease severity across the groups (p = 0.02). Significant independent association was observed between levels of E-XDP and the classes C 4-6 after adjustment for age and sex (p < 0.05), but the association was no longer significant after further adjustment for use of statins, use of anticoagulants and history of DVT (p = 0.247). This exploratory study shows that E-XDP levels are elevated in patients with CVD, encouraging further studies on the role of E-XDP in CVD."
https://openalex.org/W4225526316,"To evaluate the image quality of intraocular lenses (IOLs) using field-tracing optical simulation and then compare it with the image quality using conventional ray-tracing simulation.We simulated aspheric IOLs with a decenter, tilt, and no misalignment using an aspheric corneal eye model with a positive spherical aberration. The retinal image, Strehl ratio, and modulation transfer function (MTF) were compared between the ray-tracing and field-tracing optical simulation and confirmed by the results reported in an in vitro experiment using the same eye model.The retinal image showed interference fringes from target due to diffraction from the object in a field-tracing simulation. When compared with the experimental results, the field tracing represented the experimental results more precisely than ray tracing after passing over 400 μm of the decentration and 4 degrees of the tilt of the IOLs. The MTF values showed similar results for the case of no IOL misalignment in both the field tracing and ray tracing. In the case of the 200-μm decentration or 8-degree tilt of IOL, the field-traced MTF shows lower values than the ray-traced one.The field-tracing optical bench simulation is a reliable method to evaluate IOL performance according to the IOL misalignment. It can provide retinal image quality close to real by taking into account the wave nature of light, interference and diffraction to explain to patients having the IOL misalignment."

This study's aim was to compare trends in the consumption of single products versus fixed-dose combinations for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.We analyzed the Korean national health insurance claims database from January 2015 through December 2019. Consumption of medicines was calculated using the defined daily dose per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DIDs) and expenditures over time. During 2015-2019, the use of antihypertensive drugs increased with an annual growth rate (AGR) of 0.9% for single products and with an AGR of 35.6% for fixed-dose combinations. A notable increase was observed for antihyperlipidemic combination drugs with an AGR of 268.1% compared to single products with 35.7%. For older adults (65+ years), the consumption of drugs for hypertension and hyperlipidemia was 3-4.5 and about 3 times higher, respectively, than in adults aged 20-64 years, and a sharp increase was found in antihyperlipidemic fixed-dose combinations among older adults. A large increase was seen for C09 (agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system) with an AGR of 36.5%, especially C09DB (angiotensin II receptor blockers + calcium channel blockers) was widely used and steeply increased with 114.2%. For antihyperlipidemic drugs, C10AA (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) accounted for a large share and sharply increased, with 52.1 DIDs in 2019 and with an AGR of 78.4%, whereas C10BA (combinations of various lipid modifying agents) increased 9.6 times from 2.9 DIDs (96 million USD) in 2015 to 27.7 DIDs (912 million USD) in 2019.The findings of increased consumption and drug spending among older adults underscores the need for real-world evidence about health outcomes of fixed-dose combinations in this population."

In December 2020, the outbreak of variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) in the United Kingdom defined a turning point during the pandemic, immediately posing a worldwide threat on the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. Here, we reported the evolution of B.1.1.7 lineage-related infections, analyzing samples collected from January 1st 2021, until April 15th 2021, in Friuli Venezia Giulia, a northeastern region of Italy. A cohort of 1508 nasopharyngeal swabs was analyzed by High Resolution Melting (HRM) and 479 randomly selected samples underwent Next Generation Sequencing analysis (NGS), uncovering a steady and continuous accumulation of B.1.1.7 lineage-related specimens, joined by sporadic cases of other known lineages (i.e. harboring the Spike glycoprotein p.E484K mutation). All the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been analyzed in order to highlight all the rare mutations that may eventually result in a new variant of interest.

https://openalex.org/W4200176512,"The determination of the relation between a number and a numerical interval is one of the core problems in the scientific calculation of privacy protection. The calculation of the relationship between two numbers and a numerical interval to protect privacy is also the basic problem of collaborative computing. It is widely used in data queries, location search and other fields. At present, most of the solutions are still fundamentally limited to the integer level, and there are few solutions at the real number level. To solve these problems, this paper first uses Bernoulli inequality generalization and a monotonic function property to extend the solution to the real number level and designs two new protocols based on the homomorphic encryption scheme, which can not only protect the data privacy of both parties involved in the calculation, but also extend the number domain to real numbers. In addition, this paper designs a solution to the confidential cooperative determination problem between real numbers by using the sign function and homomorphism multiplication. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed solution is safe and efficient. Finally, some extension applications based on this protocol are given."
https://openalex.org/W4200479082,"India achieved elimination of leprosy nationally in 2005, but since then the number of patients with grade 2 disability at diagnosis increased steadily indicating delay in diagnosis. Therefore, there was a need for public health interventions which can increase case finding in their earlier stage. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three such community-based interventions; 1) Enhancement of community awareness on leprosy; 2) Education and motivation of ""Index"" leprosy cases; and 3) Involvement of Non-Formal Health Practitioners (NFHPs) to promote early detection of new cases of leprosy.Three community-based interventions were implemented between April 2016 and March 2018, embedded within the National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP) of India. Interventions were 1) increasing awareness through involvement of Gram Panchayat (local government) in the community regarding early signs of leprosy (Awareness), 2) providing health education and motivating newly diagnosed leprosy patients to bring suspects from their contacts (Index) and 3) training local non-formal health practitioners (NFHP). Each intervention was implemented in a group of ten blocks (sub-division of district) with an additional ten blocks as control (with no intervention). The main outcomes were number of new cases detected and number of grade 2 disability among them. They were obtained from the routine NLEP information system and compared between these interventions. On an average, there was an addition of 1.98 new cases in Awareness blocks, 1.13 in NFHP blocks and 1.16 cases in Index intervention blocks per month per block after adjusting for changes in control blocks during the same period. In terms of ratio, there was a 61%, 40% and 41% increase in case notification in awareness, Index and NFHP intervention, respectively. Overall, the percentage of grade 2 disability across intervention blocks declined.The Awareness intervention appears to be more effective in detection of new cases, compared to Index case motivation and sensitization of NFHPs. However, it is important to stress that while selecting strategies to increase early diagnosis it is important to determine, which is the most appropriate for each context or area and must be decided depending on the local context."

Funnel plots will be used to reflect reporting bias and the Begg's test will be used to test the symmetry of the funnel plots. When publication bias occurs, ""cut-and-fill"" method will be adopted to adjust publication bias. And sensitivity analysis will be performed for all outcome indicators.This meta-analysis will evaluate the prevalence of FA and factors associated with these occurrences in different populations from different regions on the basis of existing evidences. Our study may be crucial to analyze similarities and differences regarding FA between different individuals from diverse regions and eventually define preventive or diagnostic approaches specifically tailored to certain populations and regions.OSF registration number: 10.17605/OSF.IO/VQXU9."
