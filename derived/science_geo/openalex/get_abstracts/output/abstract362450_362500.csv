Multiplication, in turn, can result from changes in the slope - or gain - of such input-output relationship. Such changes in a neuron's sensitivity result from neuromodulation and are key to numerous higher brain computations, such as the visual system's ability to detect object orientation whatever the contrast. But mechanisms underlying neuronal gain modulation have been unclear. A new study in cerebellum demonstrates that short-term synaptic plasticity brings the fundamental nonlinearity, allowing neuromodulatory inhibition to act multiplicatively instead of additively. Neurons can perform mathematical operations such as additions, with their firing rate (the output) representing the sum of their synaptic conductances (the input). Multiplication, in turn, can result from changes in the slope (or gain) of such input–output relationship. Such changes in a neuron's sensitivity result from neuromodulation and are key to numerous higher brain computations. A study using rat cerebellum demonstrates that short-term synaptic plasticity brings the fundamental non-linearity, allowing neuromodulatory inhibition to act multiplicatively instead of additively. To act as computational devices, neurons must perform mathematical operations as they transform synaptic and modulatory input into output firing rate1. Experiments and theory indicate that neuronal firing typically represents the sum of synaptic inputs1,2,3, an additive operation, but multiplication of inputs is essential for many computations1. Multiplication by a constant produces a change in the slope, or gain, of the input–output relationship, amplifying or scaling down the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input. Such gain modulation occurs in vivo, during contrast invariance of orientation tuning4, attentional scaling5, translation-invariant object recognition6, auditory processing7 and coordinate transformations8,9. Moreover, theoretical studies highlight the necessity of gain modulation in several of these tasks9,10,11. Although potential cellular mechanisms for gain modulation have been identified, they often rely on membrane noise and require restrictive conditions to work3,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Because nonlinear components are used to scale signals in electronics, we examined whether synaptic nonlinearities are involved in neuronal gain modulation. We used synaptic stimulation and the dynamic-clamp technique to investigate gain modulation in granule cells in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Here we show that when excitation is mediated by synapses with short-term depression (STD), neuronal gain is controlled by an inhibitory conductance in a noise-independent manner, allowing driving and modulatory inputs to be multiplied together. The nonlinearity introduced by STD transforms inhibition-mediated additive shifts in the input–output relationship into multiplicative gain changes. When granule cells were driven with bursts of high-frequency mossy fibre input, as observed in vivo19,20, larger inhibition-mediated gain changes were observed, as expected with greater STD. Simulations of synaptic integration in more complex neocortical neurons suggest that STD-based gain modulation can also operate in neurons with large dendritic trees. Our results establish that neurons receiving depressing excitatory inputs can act as powerful multiplicative devices even when integration of postsynaptic conductances is linear."

The alpha-secretase ADAM10 has been found to be regulated by retinoic acid, the bioreactive metabolite of vitamin A. Here we show that retinoids induce gene expression of ADAM10 and alpha-secretase activity by nonpermissive retinoid acid receptor/retinoid X receptor (RAR/RXR) heterodimers, whereby alpha- and beta-isotypes of RAR play a major role. However, ligands of other RXR binding partners, such as the vitamin D receptor, do not stimulate alpha-secretase activity. On the basis of these findings, we examined the effect of synthetic retinoids and found a strong enhancement of nonamyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by the vitamin A analog acitretin: it stimulated ADAM10 promoter activity with an EC(50) of 1.5 microM and led to an increase of mature ADAM10 protein that resulted in a two- to three-fold increase of the ratio between alpha- and beta-secretase activity in neuroblastoma cells. The alpha-secretase stimulation by acitretin was completely inhibited by the ADAM10-specific inhibitor GI254023X. Intracerebral injection of acitretin in APP/PS1-21 transgenic mice led to a reduction of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42). The results of this study may have clinical relevance because acitretin has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis since 1997 and found generally safe for long-term use in humans."

The crucial role of Duox2 has been demonstrated in patients suffering from partial iodide organification defect caused by bi-allelic mutations in the DUOX2 gene. However, the Duox1 function in thyroid remains elusive. We optimized a functional assay by co-expressing Duox1 or Duox2 with their respective maturation factors, DuoxA1 and DuoxA2, to compare their intrinsic enzymatic activities under stimulation of the major signaling pathways active in the thyroid in relation to their membrane expression. We showed that basal activity of both Duox isoenzymes depends on calcium and functional EF-hand motifs. However, the two oxidases are differentially regulated by activation of intracellular signaling cascades. Duox1 but not Duox2 activity is stimulated by forskolin (EC50 = 0.1 μm) via protein kinase A-mediated Duox1 phosphorylation on serine 955. In contrast, phorbol esters induce Duox2 phosphorylation via protein kinase C activation associated with high H2O2 generation (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate EC50 = 0.8 nm). These results were confirmed in human thyroid cells, suggesting that Duox1 is also involved in thyroid hormonogenesis. Our data provide, for the first time, detailed insights into the mechanisms controlling the activation of Duox1–2 proteins and reveal additional phosphorylation-mediated regulation.

Our data provide, for the first time, detailed insights into the mechanisms controlling the activation of Duox1–2 proteins and reveal additional phosphorylation-mediated regulation. Dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2) belong to the family of NADPH oxidases (Nox), which is composed of five additional enzymes: Nox1–5 (1Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D. Virion A. J.

These transmembrane proteins are characterized by a COOH-terminal NADPH oxidase catalytic core responsible for reactive oxygen species synthesis. The best characterized NADPH oxidase Nox2 is involved in the leukocyte respiratory burst and activated by invading pathogens (4Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling the Nox-mediated reactive oxygen species production are multiple and complex. The activation of Nox1 (5Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Duox1 and Duox2 isoenzymes are large members of the Nox/Duox family. In addition to the catalytic core, Duox1 and Duox2 proteins are NH2-terminally extended by an extracellular peroxidase-like domain followed by a membrane-spanning segment and an intracellular domain comprising two canonical EF-hand motifs (2De Deken X.

Duox1 and Duox2 are the sole proteins directly generating H2O2 (10Dupuy C. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Pommier J. Virion A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) outside the cells, whereas small Nox homologues are mostly superoxide generators (3Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Duox isoforms do not need to be associated with cytosolic factors to be active but undergo a critical maturation process necessary to acquire their active conformation at the apical cell surface of the thyrocytes (11De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The immature nonfunctional form (180 kDa) is not properly glycosylated and maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Only the co-expression of the Duox maturation factors (DuoxA1 and DuoxA2) allows functional reconstitution. They are N-glycosylated proteins permitting the endoplasmic reticulum exit of properly folded Duox enzymes (12Grasberger H. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18269-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 13Grasberger H. De Deken X. Miot F. Pohlenz J. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1408-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The DUOXA genes are localized near their respective DUOX gene in a head to head orientation on chromosome 15 and co-expressed with their Duox counterpart in the same tissues (12Grasberger H. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18269-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Dual oxidases expressed at the apical side of surface epithelia exposed to microorganisms, like the airways or the digestive tract, are supposed to function as components of the innate host defense system (14Geiszt M.

However, Duox1 and Duox2 isoenzymes were initially identified as H2O2-generating thyroid oxidases (1Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D. Virion A. J. Biol.

The main function of the thyroid is the uptake and concentration of iodide from the bloodstream to synthesize thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in the follicular lumen (17Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1971; 29: 287-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). H2O2 produced at the apical pole of the thyrocyte is utilized by thyroperoxidase as an electron acceptor to oxidize iodide, covalently link oxidized iodide to tyrosines of thyroglobulin, and couple iodinated tyrosyl residues to form protein-bound iodothyronines (T3 and T4) (18Nunez J. Pommier J. Vitam. Horm. 1982; 39: 175-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Under physiological iodide supply, hormonogenesis is rate-limited by the availability of hydrogen peroxide (19Corvilain B. Van Sande J. Laurent E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Patients presenting iodide organification defect caused by mutations in their DUOX2 gene suffer from transient or permanent hypothyroidism depending on the mono- or bi-allelic character of the mutation, demonstrating the crucial function of Duox2 in thyroid hormone synthesis (20Moreno J.C. Bikker H. Kempers M.J. van Trotsenburg A.S. Baas F. de Vijlder J.J. Vulsma T. Ris-Stalpers C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 21Vigone M.C. Fugazzola L.

Metab. 2008; 93: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the physiological meaning of the co-existence of the two dual oxidases and their respective maturation factors in the thyroid tissue remains an open question. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of activation of Duox1 and Duox2 using Duox/DuoxA co-transfected cells stimulated by agonists known to regulate the thyroid metabolism (26Raspe E. Laurent E. Andry G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Corvilain B. Laurent E. Lecomte M. Vansande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Duox1 and Duox2 activities are mainly calcium-dependent NADPH oxidases. Moreover, additional mechanisms governing their intrinsic activity are different; Duox1 is positively regulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) 6The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; Fsk, forskolin; 6-MB-cAMP, N6-monobutyryladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. cascade, whereas Duox2 is highly induced by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with very low concentrations of PMA. Plasmids and Mutagenesis-The wild type untagged versions of human Duox1 (accession number AF230495) and Duox2 (accession number AF230496) cDNA were cloned from ATG to stop codon into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The NH2-terminal hemagglutinin epitope-tagged human Duox2 (HA-Duox2-pcDNA3.1) and the COOH-terminal c-Myc epitope-tagged human DuoxA1 and DuoxA2 (DuoxA1-Myc-pcDNA3.1 and DuoxA2-Myc-pcDNA3.1) were described elsewhere (12Grasberger H. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18269-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We added an additional Rho tag to Duox1 to be able to distinguish it from HA-Duox2 in future experiments. The Duox1 native signal peptide was replaced by the TSH receptor signal peptide to facilitate the cloning step. The Rho-HA-Duox1-pcDNA3 construct was generated as follows. The 23 first amino acids (residue 1 corresponding to the initiation methionine) of the human Duox1 protein (accession number AAF73921) were replaced by the signal peptide of the human TSH receptor (MRPADLLQLVLLLDLPRDLGG) (accession number CAA02195) and the first 19 residues of the bovine rhodopsin (Rho) (accession number P02699) (MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNKTGVV; two putative glycosylation sites are underlined) (28Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The cDNA corresponding to the NH2-terminal HA-tagged Duox1 protein (24–1551 amino acids) was cloned just downstream of the Rho tag by insertion of an EcoRI site. The presence of the TSH receptor signal peptide, Rho, and HA tags at the NH2 terminus of Duox1 did not affect its expression nor its peroxide generating activity (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the extra N-linked sugars present on the Rho tag have been very useful to separate the two glycosylated forms of Duox1 for mass spectrometry analysis, because it is mainly the mature highly glycosylated form of Duox1 that is phosphorylated upon stimulation. Mutations in Duox1–2 were introduced by directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (primers are described in supplemental Table S1). All of the constructs were verified by Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing on an automated ABI Prism 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection-Cos-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2% streptomycin-penicillin, 1% fungizone, and 1% sodium pyruvate. For H2O2 assay, adherent cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected in 6-well plates using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacture’s protocol (ratio: 1 μg of DNA for 3 μl of FuGENE 6) with 500 ng of Rho-HA-Duox1-pcDNA3 and 500 ng of DuoxA1-Myc-pcDNA3.1 or with 500 ng of HA-Duox2-pcDNA3.1 and 500 ng of DuoxA2-Myc-pcDNA3.1. Under optimal conditions, the transfection efficiency reached 20–30% of cells expressing Duox proteins at the cell surface detected by FACS. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells seeded in 10-cm-diameter dishes were transfected with 8 μg of DNA and 24 μl of FuGENE 6. Human Thyroid Primary Culture-Human thyroid tissue was obtained from patients undergoing partial or total thyroidectomy for resection of solitary cold nodules or multinodular goiters. Only healthy, normal-looking, non-nodular tissue was used within 30 min after surgical removal. Thyrocytes in primary culture obtained from follicles isolated by collagenase digestion and differential centrifugation were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F-12/MCDB104 (2:1:1) medium (Invitrogen) with 1% sodium pyruvate, 40 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 μg/ml insulin, 2% streptomycin-penicillin, and 1% fungizone (29Roger P.P. Hotimsky A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 26: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Roger P. Taton M. van Sande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thyrocytes were seeded 5 days before the assay. The protocol has been approved by the hospital ethics committee. H2O2 Measurement and Flow Immunocytometry Analysis-Production of H2O2 was determined by the sensitive fluorimetric method of Bénard and Brault (31Benard B. Brault J. Union Med. Can. 1971; 100: 701-705PubMed Google Scholar) slightly modified as previously described (11De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The peroxide released from transfected cells (Duox1/DuoxA1 or Duox2/DuoxA2) into Krebs-Ringer-Hepes medium was accumulated in the presence of stimulating agents for 2.5 h at 37 °C. After removing the medium, cell surface expression of Duox1–2 proteins was measured by flow cytometry (FACS). Briefly, the cells detached with phosphate-buffered saline EDTA/EGTA (5 mm) were incubated sequentially with anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat IgG, both diluted 1/100 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) staining in the second incubation step was used to exclude damaged cells from subsequent analysis. Fluorescence was analyzed using cell sorting (FACS-can; Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium) counting 20,000 events/sample. Relative protein expression was determined by calculating the differences in total fluorescence intensity (Arbitrary Unit) between the samples and an equal-sized population of control cells expressing only Duox1 or Duox2 constructs without their respective maturation factors. Without the latter, no cell surface expression of Duox could be detected (11De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). H2O2 production was normalized to cell surface expression of each construct and reported as pg of H2O2/FACS. For cultures of human thyrocytes, H2O2 released over 90 min in the presence of various agents was normalized to total proteins extracted in Laemmli buffer and quantified by paper dye binding assay (ng of H2O2/μg of protein) (32Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis-Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm vanadate) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was pre-cleared with Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Duox1 complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Duox antibody (1/100) conjugated to Sepharose beads (2De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and Duox2 proteins with monoclonal anti-HA antibody precoated on agarose beads (Clone HA-7; Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins of the immunoprecipitate were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (2De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Duox proteins were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate (1/1,000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), which is directed to the phospho motif RXX(S/T). Fluorescent secondary antibodies (1/10,000; IRDye 800 anti-rabbit from LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) were used for image acquisition and quantification with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). The membrane was stripped and immunoblotted with the anti-Duox antibody (1/16,000) and fluorescent secondary antibodies (1/10,000; IRDye 680 anti-rabbit) to quantify total Duox proteins. Radioactive Phosphorus Incorporation-Cells maintained 24 h in serum-free phosphate-depleted medium were incubated 2 h with 500 μCi (Cos-7) or 1mCi (thyrocytes) of [32P]orthophosphate. The proteins were prepared as described above, and phosphorylated proteins were detected and quantified with a Storage Phosphor Screen (GE Healthcare) scanned with Typhoon Trio+ (GE Healthcare). Total Duox proteins for each condition were measured by Odyssey infrared imaging system coupled with the polyclonal anti-Duox antibody. In Vitro PKA Phosphorylation Assay-Cos-7 Duox1/DuoxA1 transfected cells were cultured 24 h without serum. The proteins were prepared in lysis buffer, and Duox1 complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight with monoclonal anti-HA antibody precoated on agarose beads as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a 50-μl final volume that contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/tube), and 100 ng of purified catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ). After SDS/PAGE and Western blotting, radioactive signals were quantified with Typhoon Trio+; Duox proteins were immunodetected with the anti-Duox antibody and visualized with Odyssey imaging system. Mass Spectrometry Analysis-Cos-7 cells transfected with wild type Duox1 and DuoxA1 constructs were cultured 24 h without serum and stimulated 30 min with 10 μm forskolin. Duox1 complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Duox antibody as described above. Duox1 proteins were separated by 7%-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. After excision of the Duox gel bands, the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel (33Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3554) Google Scholar). The digested peptides were separated onto a C18 reverse phase 1 × 50 mm column (Vydac; Alltech Associates, Lokeren, Belgium) and deposited onto a stainless steel target. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Quadrupole-time of flight Ultima Global mass spectrometer equipped with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization source (Micromass, Waters, Zellik, Belgium) calibrated using the monoisotopic masses of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides from bovine serum albumin. Statistical Analysis-The data are presented as the means ± S.D. The results were analyzed using the unpaired Student’s t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (**, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). DuoxA-based Functional Assay to Study Duox-mediated H2O2 Generation-Heterologous systems combining DuoxA expression have already been successfully used to characterize Duox activity of human Duox2 natural mutants (13Grasberger H. De Deken X. Miot F. Pohlenz J. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1408-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and to reconstitute a functional H2O2-generating system in a lung cancer cell line (34Luxen S. Belinsky S.A. Knaus U.G. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The originality of our study is to analyze the specific activity of Duox1 and Duox2 isoenzymes by normalizing the hydrogen peroxide production to the cell surface expression of the respective proteins. Insertion of an HA tag in the Duox1–2 ectodomain provides an effective means to reliably estimate Duox membrane expression and compare the activities of the two enzymes. We first validated our heterologous system: 1) Measurement of H2O2 produced after 1 μm ionomycin stimulation of cells transfected with Duox/DuoxA (constant DuoxA quantity, 50 ng) was proportional to the quantity of transfected Duox plasmids (25–500 ng) with a plateau reached at 250–500 ng of Duox DNA probably caused by a limited amount of DuoxA (Fig. 1A). 2) We observed a linear relationship between Duox-mediated H2O2 generation and the membrane expression of Duox as measured by FACS (Fig. 1B). The specific activity of both Duox enzymes was comparable, and no H2O2 was detected in cells expressing Duox or DuoxA alone (Fig. 1A). 3) We verified that the addition of the tags did not modify the expression and activity of Duox1–2 proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). In all experiments, the specific activity of the Duox enzymes is represented as the amount of H2O2 produced normalized to their surface expression (pg H2O2/FACS). In humans, the thyroid metabolism is under the control of the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate cascade and the cAMP cascade (26Raspe E. Laurent E. Andry G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Corvilain B. Laurent E. Lecomte M. Vansande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our functional assay, 1 μm ionomycin increased the activity of both Duox1 and Duox2 enzymes to the same level, but raising concentrations of ionomycin from 2 to 4 μm resulted in higher activity of Duox1 than Duox2 (Fig. 2A). The adenylate cyclase agonist, forskolin (Fsk), raised the amount of H2O2 generated by Duox1 but not by Duox2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.1 μm (Fig. 2B). Moreover PMA, a PKC activator, differentially regulated activities of Duox1 and Duox2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Although micromolar concentrations of PMA were needed to increase Duox1 activity with an EC50 of 1.8 μm, a maximal activation of Duox2 enzyme was already observed with nanomolar PMA concentrations (EC50 = 0.8 nm). The addition of Fsk or PMA to ionomycin in the incubation medium provoked a release of H2O2 corresponding to the sum of the amounts generated by the cells treated with the agents separately (Iono versus Iono+Fsk for Duox1: p < 0.01; Iono versus Iono+PMA for Duox1: p < 0.001; Iono versus Iono+PMA for Duox2: p < 0.01) (Fig. 2E). In contrast to Duox1, raising calcium concentration was not sufficient to activate Duox2 by Fsk. In all of the conditions, 1 μm diphenyleneiodonium, a flavoprotein inhibitor, reduced the H2O2 level produced by the two enzymes, indicating that it derives from an NADPH oxidase (data not shown). Regulation of Duox Activity by Calcium-Duox-mediated H2O2 generation is presumed to be regulated by binding of Ca2+ to the two EF-hand motifs, located in the cytosolic portion spanning transmembrane domain 1 and 2 (13Grasberger H. De Deken X. Miot F. Pohlenz J. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1408-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Luxen S. Belinsky S.A. Knaus U.G.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, the absence of calcium ions in the H2O2 measurement assay abolished the Duox1–2 activity (data not shown). The other calcium-dependent NADPH oxidase, NOX5, possesses four calcium-binding sites arranged in two functional pairs (36Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To study the role of the two Duox EF-hands, the crucial glutamate residue was replaced by a glutamine in the twelfth position of the EF-hand sequence. Duox2 mutants E843Q and E879Q completely lost the ability to produce H2O2 in basal or stimulated conditions but maintained a cell surface expression similar to the wild type (WT) protein (Fig. 3). Similarly, inactivation of one of the two EF-hands in Duox1 (E839Q and E875Q Duox1 mutants) was sufficient to inactivate Duox1, although a correct processing to the membrane occurred as for Duox2 (supplemental Fig. S2). These results strongly suggest that the two EF-hand motifs operate as one functional pair necessary for Duox activation in response to an increase of intracellular calcium concentration. Duox1 Activity Is Positively Modulated through the cAMP Pathway-As shown in Fig. 2, Duox1-dependent H2O2 generation was positively controlled by Fsk, contrary to Duox2. To establish the role of the protein kinase A, N6-monobutyryladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (6-MB-cAMP), a site-selective PKA agonist, was used. H2O2 produced by Duox1 was significantly increased with either 50 μm 6-MB-cAMP or 1 μm Fsk (Fig. 4A). We also co-transfected a vector encoding the α isoform of the PKA catalytic subunit with WT Duox/DuoxA constructs (37Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Buchler W. Meinecke M. Chakraborty T. Jahnsen T. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKA for 48 h, verified by Western blotting (data not shown), also induced an increase of Duox1 activity. Co-expression of the PKA subunit had only a minor effect on Duox2 activity, and treatment with the 6-MB-cAMP did not increase H2O2 production by Duox2. Motif scanning for PKA substrates based on the consensus sequence (R/K)2X(S/T) identifies three potential PKA phosphorylation sites in Duox1 (Ser955, Thr1007, and Ser1217) (supplemental Fig. S3). We analyzed the Duox1 phosphorylation state with an anti-RXX(pS/pT) antibody that could potentially recognize phosphorylation on Ser955 and Ser1217 but not on Thr1007. Under basal conditions, the mature form of Duox1 (200 kDa) was already phosphorylated in Cos-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S4). It is noteworthy that the slower migrating form of Duox1 (mature form) and the immature form were shifted to 200 and 190 kDa, respectively, instead of the wild type 190- and 180-kDa proteins. This phenomenon can be explained by the addition of extra N-linked sugars on the two putative N-glycosylation sites present in the Rho tag sequence as previously described for similar TSH receptor constructs (28Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002;"

However, of the seven somatic H1 isotypes in humans some are also implicated in the regulation of local gene expression. Histone H1 isotype 4 (H1.4) represses transcription, and its lysine residue 26 (Lys26) was found to be important in this aspect. H1.4K26 is known to be methylated and acetylated in vivo, but the enzymes responsible for these post-translational modifications and the regulatory cues that promote H1.4 residence on chromatin are poorly characterized. Here we report that the euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase G9a/KMT1C mediates H1.4K26 mono- and dimethylation in vitro and in vivo and thereby provides a recognition surface for the chromatin-binding proteins HP1 and L3MBTL1. Moreover, we show evidence that G9a promotes H1 deposition and is required for retention of H1 on chromatin. We also identify members of the JMJD2/KDM4 subfamily of jumonji-C type histone demethylases as being responsible for the removal of H1.4K26 methylation.

Histone lysine methyl marks have been implicated in important cellular processes including regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and recently also epigenetic processes. Despite these efforts we still do not know the substrate specificity of all histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMT) 4The abbreviations used are: HKMTs, histone lysine methyltransferases; HKDMs, histone lysine demethylases; PRC2, polycomb repressive complex 2; JmjC, Jumonji-C; cv, column volume; HA, hemagglutinin; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DBD, DNA binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (about 50 in mammals), nor do we fully comprehend the number and variety of covalent modifications and the number of potential combinatorial readouts that translate into a biological function. The recent discovery of HKDMs illustrates that methyl marks are also subject to dynamic regulation but we still lack information regarding the substrate specificity of a number of demethylases and about biological consequences of the removal of methyl marks.In contrast to the covalent modification landscape on the core histones, post-translational modifications on the linker histone isotypes are relatively under-reported. Besides extensive histone H1 phosphorylation originally discovered in 1967 (1Langan T.A.S. Smith L.K. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 603Google Scholar) and later ascribed to cell cycle regulatory events, only a handful of studies reported acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, and formylation of histone H1 (2Wisniewski J.R.

Knock-out of three somatic mammalian H1 isotypes, however, did lead to changes in nucleosome spacing and gene regulation (15Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E.

Seven H1 isotypes are found in somatic mammalian cells, some of which are cell-type specific. Generally, H1 participates in chromatin organization and as evidenced by studies performed in vitro promotes the formation of condensed chromatin (17Woodcock C.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Fan Y. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 19Tremethick D.J.

However, not all H1 isotypes are functionally redundant and their roles in gene expression range from transcriptional repression to activation (21Alami R. Fan Y. Pack S. Sonbuchner T.M. Besse A.

Cell. 2007; 28: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It seems likely that single H1 post-translational modifications or combinations thereof affect H1 chromatin binding and compaction as well as nucleosome spacing (discussed in Refs. 23Trojer P.

Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Later, the first mammalian H1 methylation site was identified on isotype 4 (also known as isotype “H1b” in human and “H1e” in mouse) at lysine 26 (H1.4K26) (5Ohe Y. Hayasli H. Iwai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, a systematic mass spectrometric mapping of human and mouse H1 isotypes unveiled a number of mono- and dimethylated lysines on various H1 isotypes many of which are located in the globular domains (2Wisniewski J.R. Zougman A. Kruger S. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 72-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). H1.4 confers transcriptional repression and Lys26 was found to be important in this context (7Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the H3K27-specific HKMT EZH2/KMT6 (27Allis C.D. Berger S. Jenuwein T.

In contrast, another study directed at defining the substrate preferences of PRC2 found no evidence for H1 methylation. Instead, the presence of H1 stimulated EZH2 activity toward H3K27 (29Martin C. Cao R. Zhang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8365-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To date there is no report describing demethylation of histone H1.Here we used an unbiased biochemical approach to identify H1.4K26 HKMT activities. We demonstrate that G9a in addition to EZH2 methylates H1.4 in vitro and in vivo and that G9a impacts the recruitment of histone H1 to chromatin. Moreover, we use a candidate approach to identify potential H1.4K26 demethylases and find that members of the JMJD2 subfamily of JmjC-type demethylases reduce trimethylated H1.4K26 to di- and monomethylated states.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConventional Purification of Histone H1.4K26 Methyltransferase Activity-HeLa nuclear pellet fraction was prepared following the protocol of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 g of nuclear pellet fraction were subjected to 1000 ml of DE52 resin (Whatman) that was packed into a low-pressure chromatography column (15 cm diameter; Spectrum) and equilibrated with BD buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate (BD-100; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound proteins were eluted by gravity flow using BD containing 350 mm ammonium sulfate (BD-350). The elution fraction was dialyzed against BD-100 and subjected to 100 ml of heparin-Sepharose 6FF (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with BD-100. Bound proteins were eluted with a 10-cv linear gradient from 200 to 700 mm ammonium sulfate in BD. Fractions containing H1.4K26 HKMT activity were pooled, dialyzed, and subjected to a 54-ml DEAE 5PW column (Tosoh) equilibrated with BD-100. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-cv linear gradient from BD100 to BD800. Subsequently, fractions containing the activity were pooled, dialyzed against BD-100, and subjected to a Mono S HR10/10 (GE Healthcare) column. The elution of bound proteins was carried out as described for the DEAE 5PW step. Fractions containing activity were pooled, dialyzed against BD-100, and subjected to a Mono Q HR5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The elution of bound proteins was carried out as described for the DEAE 5PW step. Fractions containing activity were pooled and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis as well as to a Superose 6 HR10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions from the gel filtration chromatography were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining or subjected to immunoblotting.Protein Expression and Purification, Western Blot, and Silver Staining-Recombinant histone H1.4 wild type or mutant (lysine 26 changed to alanine; H1.4 K26A) was produced in bacteria as an HA-tagged fusion protein using standard techniques. Affinity purified H1.4 protein exhibited multiple bands in SDS-PAGE likely due to truncated versions of the protein. Recombinant full-length G9a was obtained using a baculoviral expression system according to standard techniques. The baculovirus containing the G9a sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Yoichi Shinkai. Baculovirally expressed GST-Jmjd2a (residues 1–506), GST-Jmjd2b (residues 1–424), GST-Jmjd2c (residues 1–372), and FLAG-Jmjd2d (residues 1–510) were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) or anti-FLAG(M2) affinity gel (Sigma). Western blotting was performed using standard techniques with antibodies against HA (Sigma), FLAG(M2) (Sigma), histone H1.4K26me2 (Abcam; we find that the antibody showed a certain extent of cross-reactivity to H1.4K26me1 and -me3 in peptide dot blot experiments (supplemental Fig. S2A)), mouse H1.4K26me1 (Jenuwein Lab; for details of antibody generation strategy see Ref. 31Perez-Burgos L.

Silver staining was performed using standard molecular biology methods.In Vitro HKMT Assay-HKMT assays were carried out as described previously (33Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Methods. 2003; 31: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was performed in a total volume of 30 μl in HKMT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) with 0.6 μl of 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of [methyl-3H]AdoMet (TRK581-1MCI, GE Healthcare), 1–10 μl of a source of enzymatic activity (either fractions of conventional purification or ∼50 nm recombinant G9a), and 8 μl of substrate. The substrate consisted of ∼2 μg of recombinant histone H1.4 (wild type or K26A mutant) or 5 μg of synthetic peptides corresponding to either the N terminus of histone H3 (residues 4–15) or that of H1.4 (residues 17–34). The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. HKMT assays were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by fluorography using [3H]ENHANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).In Vitro HKDM Assay-The demethylation reaction was carried out for 3–8 h at 37 °C in the presence of 30–200 ng/μl of recombinant JMJD2 proteins, 2 μm peptide substrate, 20 μm Fe(II)-sulfate, 2 μm ZnCl2, 500 μm 2-oxoglutarate, 500 μm ascorbic acid, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 120–150 mm KCl in a final volume of 8 μl. To inhibit demethylation the iron chelating agent deferoxamine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Seventy μl of matrix solution (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 37% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.12% trifluoroacetic acid) were added to the reaction products, 1 μl of the sample was spotted on a MALDI sample plate, and spectra were acquired as described (34Rudolph T.

The following peptides were used as substrates: H3K4me3, ART[Kme3]QTARKSTGGKAPRKQL-Cys; H3K9me3, ARTKQTAR[Kme3]STGGKAPRKQL-Cys; H3K27me3, KAAR[Kme3] SAPATGGVKKPHRYRP-Cys; H4K20me3, SGR GKGG[Kme3]GLGKGGAKRHRK-Cys; H1.4K26me3, PVKKKAR[Kme3]SAGGAKRK or PVKKKAR[Kme3]AAGGAKRK; H1.4K26me2, TPVKKKAR[Kme2]AAGGAKR-Cys; and H1.4K26me1, PVKKKAR[Kme1]SAGGAKRK.Mass Spectrometric Analysis-Histone samples were excised from SDS-PA gels, in-gel digested with trypsin (at a w/w ratio of 1:200, trypsin:protein, estimated by the staining intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained histones) for 2 h before the reaction was stopped by addition of 5% formic acid and 60% acetonitrile. The resulting peptides were extracted and dried under vacuum. To propionylate peptides, dried digests were solubilized in 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate followed by addition of 50 μl of a propionic anhydride solution (at a v/v ratio of 30:70, propionic anhydride:methanol) and adjustment of pH 7 with NH4OH. The samples were incubated at 50 °C for 20 min and dried under vacuum before LC-MS/MS.All LC-MS/MS experiments were performed using a Dionex Ultimate nanoflow HPLC system (Sunnyvale CA) and a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Histone samples were first solubilized in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a trap column (Dionex Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 300-μm inner diameter × 5 mm). After washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 20 μl/min for 2 min, the peptides were back-flashed onto a 75 μm × 12-cm emitter column packed with Magic C18AQ, 3-μm 200 Å (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Aubum, CA), and eluted with a linear gradient of 2 to 45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid in 30 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Mass spectrometry data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition procedure with each full MS followed by analysis of the five most intense ions by a zoom scan and a MS/MS scan. Data dependent analysis used a repeat count of two and a dynamic exclusion duration of 60 s.Transfections, Stable Cell Line-3 × 106 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE HD (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 h post-infection, harvested, and whole cell extract prepared using RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). Alternatively, transfected cells were subjected to histone extraction. The generation of the NIH3T3-tet off cells (Clontech) with a stably integrated, inducible Jmjd2b(1–424)-green fluorescent protein expression construct was described previously (35Fodor B.D. Kubicek S. Yonezawa M. O’Sullivan R.J. Sengupta R. Perez-Burgos L. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Schotta G. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1557-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Induction was performed for 12 h and green fluorescent protein-positive cells were fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted and histones extracted.Histone Extraction-Core and linker histones were extracted from 293, 293FT, HeLa, 293TREx-luciferase (see below), NIH 3T3, and embryonic stem cells using 0.2 m sulfuric acid according to standard protocols. The acidic supernatant (containing histones) was neutralized by the addition of 0.75 volume of 1.5 m Tris, pH 8.8. Cells were either untreated or treated with the G9a small molecule inhibitor BIX-01294 (kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation-One mg of solubilized nuclear pellet was mixed with 1 volume of BD-200 plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Five μg of antibody were added and the reaction mixture (∼200 μl) incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Twenty μl of pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose (Roche) were added and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Reactions were spun in a microcentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was discarded, and beads washed two times with 400 μl of BC-200 containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, one time with 400 μl of BC-500, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, followed by one time with 400 μl of BC-100. Beads were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-HeLa cells were grown in the presence of 1% DMSO or 2.5 μm decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) in DMSO for 72 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and cDNA was produced using the SuperScript III cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR was performed using the Brilliant® II SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). Primer sequences are available upon request.ChIP-We previously generated a 293 TREx cell line (Invitrogen) that is stably transfected with a constitutively expressing luciferase transgene containing GAL4 DNA binding sites upstream of the transcriptional start site (293TREx-luciferase (8Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar)). This cell line was stably transfected with pcDNA4TO (Invitrogen) containing the GAL4-DBD and full-length cDNA of human G9a (inserted between the HindIII and EcoRI sites). GAL4-tagged G9a was expressed upon addition of 2 μg/ml tetracycline/doxycycline for 24 or 48 h. ChIP was performed in duplicate according to standard techniques and as previously described (36Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde in the growth medium for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm in growth medium. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl). Cell lysate was sonicated using a Bioruptor™ 200 (Diagenode) with 200 watts ultrasonic wave output power. Sonication was carried out for 15 min with alternating 30-s on/off pulses. Sheared chromatin was used for immunoprecipitation using antibodies described above and antibodies against GAL4 (Millipore) and random IgG (Jackson). H1.4K26me2 antibody competition with histone peptides was carried out as follows: 5 μg of antibody was mixed in a tube with 1 μm H3K9me2, H1K26me0, and H1K26me2 peptides in a final volume of 40 μl for 30 min on ice. The entire mixture was subsequently used for ChIP. Precipitated material was analyzed by real time quantitative PCRs carried out in triplicate. Paired t-tests were performed to calculate p values. ChIP experiments on the endogenous MAGE-A1 promoter were carried out in triplicate as described above using HeLa cells grown in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm decitabine for 72 h. The following primer set was used: oligo 1, 5′-GTCCAGGCTCTGCCAGACATC-3′ and oligo 2, 5′-CGTCCCTCAGAATGGAAACCTC-3′. The GAPDH ChIP primer set is located around the transcriptional start site and the sequence is available upon request.RESULTSPurification of H1.4K26 Methyltransferase Activities-We, and others previously reported that H1.4K26 is methylated in vivo (2Wisniewski J.R. Zougman A. Kruger S. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 72-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Ohe Y. Hayasli H. Iwai K. J. Biochem.

Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In an unbiased attempt to identify H1.4K26-specific methyltransferases we used recombinant bacterially expressed histone H1.4 as a substrate for in vitro HKMT assays and readily detected the H1-specific HKMT activity in both nuclear extract and pellet fractions. The target specificity of the HKMT activity assays was verified by comparing methylation of wild type H1.4 to that of a version in which the Lys26 residue was mutated to alanine (H1.4K26A) (Fig. 1A). Notably, methylation of the K26A mutant was strongly reduced but not completely abolished, suggesting that other residue(s) on histone H1.4 in addition to Lys26 are methylated. The endogenous core histones H3 and H4 were methylated when the nuclear pellet fraction was used in HKMT assays. Surprisingly, the addition of recombinant H1.4K26A but not wild type H1.4 abolished the activity toward H4. At present we do not know if this finding is relevant and did not pursue it further in this study.We next performed a conventional purification from the nuclear pellet following H1.4 HKMT activity (Fig. 1B) and found that H1.4K26-specific and non-Lys26-specific activities co-eluted throughout the entire purification (supplemental Fig. S1A and data not shown). The peak fraction of the Mono Q elution (Fig. 1C) was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Among other polypeptides we identified three HKMTs: G9a/KMT1C, GLP/KMT1D, and EZH2/KMT6 and the presence of each was verified by Western blot (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1). Analysis of the H1.4K26 HKMT activity by gel filtration chromatography revealed that the activity peak migrated at high molecular mass (400–800 kDa) and correlated well with both the G9a and EZH2 elution profiles as visualized by Western blot (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, a larger migrating H1.4 protein species was mainly methylated in fraction B14 and its radiolabel intensity did not correlate with the G9a and EZH2 elution profiles. Although fraction B14 contained G9a and EZH2, it is unclear why its substrate preference was different from that of fractions B8–B12. The methylation on this H1.4 protein was also Lys26 specific because the radiolabel was lost when the fractions were assayed with an H1.4K26A mutant protein (Fig. 1D).We demonstrated previously that EZH2 was able to methylate H1.4. Therefore, it was possible that EZH2 is solely responsible for the H1.4 methylation observed. To clarify this we performed immunoprecipitations from nuclear pellet fractions and demonstrated that: 1) G9a and EZH2 do not interact; 2) both G9a and EZH2 immunoprecipitates contain H1.4 HKMT activity compared with an IgG control (Fig. 1E); and 3) the presence of histone octamers in the HKMT assay does not abolish G9a activity toward H1.4 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Significantly less activity is precipitated with anti-EZH2 but this might be explained by the fairly stringent wash conditions that partially disrupted the EZH2 containing PRC2 complex.G9a Methylates H1.4 at Lysine 26-Given that G9a was shown previously to methylate native histone H1 in vitro (37Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) we used recombinant full-length G9a to perform in vitro HKMT assays with either wild type H1.4 or its K26A mutant as substrate. We detected significant [3H]CH3 incorporation on wild type H1.4 as evidenced by fluorography (Fig. 2A) but a signal was not detected on H1.4K26A. However, longer exposure times gave evidence of minor [3H]CH3 label (data not shown) suggesting that other lysines might be methylated with low efficiency. The reaction was carried out in substrate excess to attain the maximum amount of methylation under the given assay conditions to facilitate mass spectrometric analysis (see Fig. 2D). We monitored the increase in Lys26 methylation upon incubation of HA-tagged H1.4 with G9a and AdoMet using anti-H1.4K26me2-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the antibody was methyl-specific because recombinant un-methylated H1.4 was not recognized despite being recognized by an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B). The multiple bands are recognized by anti-HA and anti-H1.4K26me2 antibodies likely resulted from H1.4 truncations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Next, we used synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 17–34 of H1.4 that were either unmethylated or harbored one, two, or three methyl groups at Lys26 as substrates for G9a-dependent HKMT assays. G9a only utilized unmethylated and monomethylated peptides in a time-limiting reaction, similar to the result obtained when H3K9-peptides were used as substrate (Fig. 2C). Therefore, G9a predominantly functions as an H3K9 and H1.4K26 mono- and dimethylase in vitro, although extended incubation times allowed G9a to perform trimethylation of the substrate (data not shown; previously discussed in Ref. 38Patnaik D.

https://openalex.org/W2157942235,"Human coxsackievirus (CV) belongs to the picornavirus family, which consists of over 200 medically relevant viruses. In picornavirus, a chymotrypsin-like protease (3C(pro)) is required for viral replication by processing the polyproteins, and thus it is regarded as an antiviral drug target. A 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) also exists in human coronaviruses (CoV) such as 229E and the one causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To combat SARS, we previously had developed peptidomimetic and zinc-coordinating inhibitors of 3CL(pro). As shown in the present study, some of these compounds were also found to be active against 3C(pro) of CV strain B3 (CVB3). Several crystal structures of 3C(pro) from CVB3 and 3CL(pro) from CoV-229E and SARS-CoV in complex with the inhibitors were solved. The zinc-coordinating inhibitor is tetrahedrally coordinated to the His(40)-Cys(147) catalytic dyad of CVB3 3C(pro). The presence of specific binding pockets for the residues of peptidomimetic inhibitors explains the binding specificity. Our results provide a structural basis for inhibitor optimization and development of potential drugs for antiviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2014179668,"Growth factors, insulin signaling, and nutrients are important regulators of beta-cell mass and function. The events linking these signals to the regulation of beta-cell mass are not completely understood. The mTOR pathway integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients. Here, we evaluated the role of the mTOR/raptor (mTORC1) signaling in proliferative conditions induced by controlled activation of Akt signaling. These experiments show that the mTORC1 is a major regulator of beta-cell cycle progression by modulation of cyclin D2, D3, and Cdk4 activity. The regulation of cell cycle progression by mTORC1 signaling resulted from modulation of the synthesis and stability of cyclin D2, a critical regulator of beta-cell cycle, proliferation, and mass. These studies provide novel insights into the regulation of cell cycle by the mTORC1, provide a mechanism for the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin, and imply that the use of rapamycin could negatively impact the success of islet transplantation and the adaptation of beta-cells to insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2064779084,"Background Serotonin signaling influences social behavior in both human and nonhuman primates. In humans, variation upstream of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has recently been shown to influence both behavioral measures of social anxiety and amygdala response to social threats. Here we show that length polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR predict social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, a species in which 5-HTTLPR variation is analogous to that of humans. Methodology/Principal Findings In contrast to monkeys with two copies of the long allele (L/L), monkeys with one copy of the short allele of this gene (S/L) spent less time gazing at face than non-face images, less time looking in the eye region of faces, and had larger pupil diameters when gazing at photos of a high versus low status male macaques. Moreover, in a novel primed gambling task, presentation of photos of high status male macaques promoted risk-aversion in S/L monkeys but promoted risk-seeking in L/L monkeys. Finally, as measured by a “pay-per-view” task, S/L monkeys required juice payment to view photos of high status males, whereas L/L monkeys sacrificed fluid to see the same photos. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that genetic variation in serotonin function contributes to social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, and thus shapes social behavior in humans and rhesus macaques alike."
https://openalex.org/W1984733368,"The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for the multiple changes in gene expression that occur during differentiation. However, the basis within the complex for specificity in effecting positive <i>versus</i> negative changes in gene expression has only begun to be elucidated. The catalytic core of the complex can be either of two closely related ATPases, BRM or BRG1, with the potential that the choice of alternative subunits is a key determinant of specificity. Short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of the ATPases was used to explore their respective roles in the well characterized multistage process of osteoblast differentiation. The results reveal an unexpected role for BRM-specific complexes. Instead of impeding differentiation as was seen with BRG1 depletion, depletion of BRM caused accelerated progression to the differentiation phenotype. Multiple tissue-specific differentiation markers, including the tightly regulated late stage marker osteocalcin, become constitutively up-regulated in BRM-depleted cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the osteocalcin promoter as a model for the behavior of the complexes indicates that the promoter is a direct target of both BRM- and BRG1-containing complexes. BRG1 complexes, which are required for activation, are associated with the promoter well before induction, but the concurrent presence of BRM-specific complexes overrides their activation function. BRM-specific complexes are present only on the repressed promoter and are required for association of the co-repressor HDAC1. These findings reveal an unanticipated degree of specialization of function linked with the choice of ATPase and suggest a new paradigm for the roles of the alternative subunits during differentiation."

The primary structure of α-synuclein consists of three distinct regions. The N-terminal region of α-synuclein includes the mutation sites associated with familial PD (A53T, A30P, and E46K) and contains six imperfectly conserved repeats (KTKEGV) that may facilitate protein-protein binding. This repeat section is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices, typical of the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins (14.Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is considered a cytosolic protein, and consequently its pathogenic effect was assumed to be limited to the cytoplasm of single cells. However, recent studies have suggested that α-synuclein also has extracellular pathogenic effects (22.Borghi R. Marchese R. Negro A. Marinelli L. Forloni G. Zaccheo D. Abbruzzese G. Tabaton M.

Despite all these studies, it is still not clear how the various aggregate forms of α-synuclein are involved in the progression of PD. Therefore, reagents that can interact with specific aggregate forms of α-synuclein would be very useful not only for fundamental studies of how α-synuclein aggregates affect cell function but also as potential diagnostic and therapeutic agents for PD. Recently, we reported inhibition of both aggregation and extracellular toxicity of α-synuclein in vitro by a single chain variable domain antibody fragment (scFv) that specifically recognized an oligomeric form of α-synuclein (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a second scFv (syn-10H) that binds a larger later stage oligomeric form of α-synuclein than the previously reported scFv. The syn-10H scFv neutralizes α-synuclein-induced toxicity in both undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line and inhibits α-synuclein aggregation in vitro. The syn-10H scFv reacts specifically with homogenized PD brain tissue but does not cross-react with similarly treated samples taken from Alzheimer disease (AD) or healthy brain samples. Such scFvs therefore have potential value as diagnostic reagents to identify the presence of specific oligomeric species in PD tissue and fluid samples. The scFvs also have value as therapeutic agents as they can be used either extracellularly or expressed intracellularly (intrabodies) to prevent formation of toxic aggregates in vivo whether inside or outside of cells. Intrabodies have been used efficiently to neutralize toxic effects of different pathogenic agents, including α-synuclein (33.Wheeler Y.Y. Chen S.Y. Sane D.C. Mol.

Moreover, immunization studies in mouse models of PD have shown that extracellular antibodies can reduce accumulation of intracellular aggregates of α-synuclein (37.Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Adame A.

The Tomlinson I and J phage libraries, helper phage KM13, Escherichia coli TG1, and HB2151 were obtained from Medical Research Council (Cambridge, UK). Each phage library has a diversity of greater than 108 and are comprised of a single polypeptide with the VH and VL domains connected by a flexible (Gly4Ser)3 linker. The phage library was propagated essentially as described (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38.Barkhordarian H. Emadi S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Libraries were grown separately and mixed in equal titers for the panning experiments. α-Synuclein plasmid provided by Dr. Michael J. Volles (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School) was transformed into BL-21 competent cells, plated onto LB-agar plates (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin), and grown overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies of BL21 (DE3) were grown and purified essentially as described (39.Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein was lyophilized and stored at −80 °C until further use. The lyophilized α-synuclein stock was dissolved in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 70 μm. Oligomeric aggregates of α-synuclein were obtained by incubating at 37 °C for 7–10 days without shaking. Fibrils were obtained upon longer incubation up to 35 days. Aβ40 oligomers (BIOSOURCE) were dissolved in 100% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 250-μl aliquots, air-dried, and stored at −20 °C until further use. Aliquots were resuspended in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted in Buffer A to a 20 μm concentration and incubated at 37 °C without shaking for 5 days. The oligomeric morphologies of Aβ40 were verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) prior to study (40.Zameer A. Kasturirangan S. Emadi S. Nimmagadda S.V. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A diluted sample of α-synuclein (20 μm) containing predominantly larger aggregate forms was used for bio-panning studies. Three rounds of bio-panning against the α-synuclein mixture were performed essentially as described (41.Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunotubes (Maxisorb, Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μm sample of α-synuclein mixture in 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate, pH 9.6. The tube was then blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mm phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C. An aliquot of phage library (1012 plaque-forming unit/ml) in 4 ml of 1% BSA/PBS was added to the immunotube and incubated for 30 min with continuous rocking, followed by 90 min without rocking at 22 °C. The sample was subsequently washed 10 times with 1 ml of PBS/Tween 0.1% and 15 times with PBS to remove the nonspecifically bound phage. The bound phage were eluted from the immunotube by incubation with triethylamine (100 mm, pH 11) for 10 min, followed by neutralization with Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 7.4) and hydrolysis with trypsin (1 mg/ml) and calcium (1 mm) for 30 min with continuous rocking at room temperature. A 1-ml aliquot of eluted phage was added to 10 ml of E. coli TG1 (A600 of 0.4) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Eluted phage were amplified by infecting fresh TG1 cells in the presence of helper phage KM13 (5 × 1010) and purified according to standard protocols (Cambridge, UK). Phage titers were determined by serial dilutions on agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Polyclonal ELISA—The polyclonal phage ELISA was performed as described previously (38.Barkhordarian H. Emadi S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). High binding polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with 5 μm of the α-synuclein mixture in carbonate/bicarbonate, pH 9.6, and 1010 plaque-forming unit aliquots of PEG-precipitated phage was added. Bound phage was detected after 1 h of incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-M13 antibody horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and detected with HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine (Sigma) after 20 min. The activity was determined by subtracting A650 from A450 using a Wallac 1420 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Monoclonal ELISA—Individual clones obtained from panning against α-synuclein mixture were grown as described (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The high binding microtiter plates (Corning Glass) were coated with 5 μm α-synuclein mixture and blocked as described above. Bacterial supernatant containing antibody fragments was added to each well (100 μl/well). Bound phage were detected as described above. Soluble scFv was produced by expressing recovered phagemid samples in the nonsuppressor E. coli strain HB2151 (42.Carter P. Bedouelle H. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4431-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Individually selected clones were grown as described previously (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and scFv production was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Supernatant and periplasmic fractions were assayed for antigen binding by ELISA as described (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). High affinity microtiter plates were coated with 5 μm α-synuclein mixture. After blocking and washing, an aliquot (100 μl) of supernatant and periplasmic fractions containing antibody fragments was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected after a 1-h incubation using 1:500 dilution of anti-c-Myc tag (9E10) HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmid was isolated from E. coli TG1 using a plasmid mini-prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The presence of a full-length 935-bp scFv insert was confirmed by PCR as described (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 43.Hoogenboom H.R. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The false stop codon (TGA) in the constant region of scFv was corrected and replaced with a tryptophan (TGG) using site-directed mutagenesis as described (44.Marcus W.D. Wang H. Lohr D. Sierks M.R. Lindsay S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Selected individual clones were purified using a protein A-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) as described previously (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Lyophilized α-synuclein was dissolved to a final concentration of 70 μm in Buffer A, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and incubated at 37 °C for 35 days. Aliquots (3 μl) of incubated solution taken at different time points were applied to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and air-dried. The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% milk (PMSM) and probed with 0.3 mg/ml syn-10H for 2 h followed by overnight incubation with 1:500 dilution of 9E10. The immunoreactivity was detected after a 1-h incubation using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-mouse HRP. Lyophilized α-synuclein was dissolved to a final concentration of 100 μm in Buffer A and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days without shaking. An aliquot (20 μl) of incubated solution was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a Tris/Tricine buffer system (45.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and developed using silver staining according to the manufacturer's protocols. The sample was then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and probed with 0.3 mg/ml syn-10H as described above. α-Synuclein was dissolved to a final concentration of 70 μm in Buffer A, filtered as described above, and incubated at 37 °C either with or without the addition of 15 μm scFv. Aggregation of α-synuclein was measured in triplicate at various time points as described previously (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol.

Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were maintained in culture flasks in medium containing 50% (v/v) minimal essential medium, 50% (v/v) Ham's modification of F-12, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (w/v) l-glutamine (3.6 mm), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic and grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were harvested from flasks and plated in 48-well polystyrene plates (Corning Glass) with 3 × 105 cells per 300 μl of medium per well. The cells were differentiated by adding 10 μm retinoic acid to each well and incubating at 37 °C for 4 days. As reported previously, SH-SY5Y cells treated with such a protocol exhibit several characteristics of cholinergic neurons, including expression of ChAT and VMAT (47.Pahlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nanberg E.

Res. 2004; 5: 579-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After 4 days, the medium was exchanged with 300 μl of serum-free media, followed by the addition of the preincubated mixtures of α-synuclein with or without scFv to individual wells. The same volume of medium was added to the control cultures. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cell viability was measured by lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Briefly, cells were centrifuged, and aliquots (50 μl) of the media from each well were transferred to a 96-well plate. The supplied buffer and substrate were then added to the supernatant as described by the manufacturer. Absorbance was measured by subtracting A650 from A480 using a Wallac 1420 plate reader. LDH release was determined by dividing the absorbance of treated wells by the absorbance of untreated wells. The data are reported as percentage of control value obtained from three independent experiments. The cell viability was also measured using trypan blue assay as described previously (32.Emadi S. Barkhordarian H. Wang M.S. Schulz P. Sierks M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were detached from flasks using trypsin, washed with PBS, and plated in a 96-well plate with the density of 2 × 104 cells per well per 100 μl of PBS. The cell was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed twice with buffer containing PBS and BSA (0.5%). The cells were then labeled with or without syn-10H scFv (0.3 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the pellet was incubated with 9E10 antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of fluorescein conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen). The percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of positive cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur system). Control samples stained with secondary antibody alone were included in each experiment. Topographic AFM images were obtained in air at room temperature using a Tapping Mode AFM with a Nanoscope IIIa controller (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). Images were acquired using oxide sharpened Si3N4 AFM tips (k = 40 n/m, ∼300-kHz) (model OTESPA, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) at scan rates of 2–3 Hz and at scan resolution of 512 samples per line. AFM images were analyzed with the scanning probe imaging processor software (Image Metrology) to generate height distribution histograms for each sample. A 600 × 7.8-mm BioSep-SEC S-2000 column (Phenomenex) on a System Gold high pressure liquid chromatograph (Beckman Coulter) was washed and equilibrated with PBS. An aliquot of purified α-synuclein (100 μm) was incubated in Buffer A at 37 °C for 7 days and was run on the size exclusion column at a 0.8 ml/min flow rate. After washing the column, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (45.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Human brain sections were a generous donation from Dr. Thomas Beach (Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ). The human brain tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The samples were sonicated on ice using 10-s bursts followed by 15-s pauses for a total of 5 min using a Fisher sonic dismembrator. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants of brain homogenates were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until further use. A3-μl aliquot of brain sample was applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and air-dried. The me"

The binding of RNA primers/promoters to the polymerases is an initiation step in viral transcription. In our current study, we reveal the 2.7 Å tertiary structure of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of PB2 by x-ray crystallography. This domain incorporates lysine 627 of PB2, and this residue is associated with the high pathogenicity and host range restriction of influenza A virus. We found from our current analyses that this lysine is located in a unique “φ”-shaped structure consisting of a helix and an encircled loop within the PB2 domain. By electrostatic analysis, we identified a highly basic groove along with this φ loop and found that lysine 627 is located in the φ loop. A PB2 domain mutant in which glutamic acid is substituted at position 627 shows significantly lower RNA binding activity. This is the first report to show a relationship between RNA binding activity and the pathogenicity-determinant lysine 627. Using the Matras program for protein three-dimensional structural comparisons, we further found that the helix bundles in the PB2 domain are similar to that of activator 1, the 40-kDa subunit of DNA replication clamp loader (replication factor C), which is also an RNA-binding protein. This suggests a functional and structural relationship between the RNA-binding mechanisms underlying both influenza A viral transcription and cellular DNA replication. Our present results thus provide important new information for developing novel drugs that target the primer/promoter RNA binding of viral RNA polymerases.

The C-terminal domain of PB2 includes the Lys627 residue, which plays a role in the high pathogenicity and host range restriction of the influenza virus. The structure of PB2 has not been previously elucidated, and the structure-function relationships between this domain and Lys627 represent a significant advance in our understanding of the pathogenicity of influenza A. Expression and Purification of the Influenza A Virus RNA Polymerase PB2 3/3 RNA-binding Domain-A cDNA fragment of the influenza A virus RNA polymerase PB2 3/3 domain (aa 535–759) was amplified by PCR from pBMSA-PB2 (RIKEN) using the following primers: PB2 Met 3/3, 5′-GCCGTTCATATGATGTGGGAGATTAATGGT-3′, and PB2 stop BamHI, 5′-GCCGTTGGATCCTTAATTGATGGCCATCCGAAT-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was then subcloned into the pET28a(+) plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. This construct was then introduced into BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) Escherichia coli. The induction of His6-tagged recombinant protein expression was achieved by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in TBG-M9 medium, and this was followed by purification using Ni2+-agarose. For further purification, the His-tagged proteins were cleaved by thrombin and purified using a HiTrap™ carboxymethyl (CM) FF column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) with the ÄKTAprime™ plus system (GE Healthcare). For phase determination, we expressed the recombinant proteins using seleno-methionine (SeMet)-containing M9 medium (18Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) in E. coli B836 (DE3) cells (Novagen) to enable multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis for lysine 627 was performed by PCR. We purified PB2 3/3 Glu627 and PB2 3/3 for reference using a HiTrap™ SP XL column (GE Healthcare). RNA Binding Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) Assay-A Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to perform surface plasmon resonance assays in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The buffers used in these analyses were as follows: HBS-EP running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) and sensor chip streptavidin to which 100 μl of 20 μm biotinylated RNA oligomers were immobilized. A 5′-vRNA promoter (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′), capped primer (5′-m7GmAAAUACUCAAG-3′), or non-capped primer (5′-AmAAUACUCAAG-3′) were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science Co. Ltd., (Hokkaido, Japan), and successful capping of the primers was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Voyager 2073 system). These molecules were then tested in the PB2 3/3 domain protein binding assays. Various concentrations (0.015, 0.044, 0.13, 0.40, 1.2, and 3.6 μm) of the purified influenza A virus RNA polymerase PB2 3/3 proteins were then applied to the RNA-immobilized sensor chip in HBS-EP buffer at a 20 μl/min flow rate. A blank control was used as a reference, and these values were subtracted from the raw data. Estimation of the Kd (Dissociation Constant) Values of the PB2 3/3 Protein for Different RNA Substrates-For affinity analyses, the association-dissociation curves for various concentrations of PB2 3/3 or PB2 3/3 Glu627 protein were plotted using the BIAevaluation steady state affinity program (GE Healthcare) from which equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values (mol/liter) were calculated. Crystallization-Purified samples were concentrated to 4–10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Optimal conditions for crystallization were determined initially using Crystal Screen 1™ and Crystal Screen 2™ (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), which involved the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Native crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate hydrochloric acid, pH 6.2, and 2 m sodium formate. Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled PB2 3/3 protein were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate hydrochloric acid, pH 6.0, and 3 m sodium formate. X-ray Diffraction Analysis-Diffraction data sets for Native and SeMet crystals were collected at 100 K, using a mixture of paratone-N (Hampton Research) and paraffin oil as a cryoprotectant, on a beamline PF-AR NW12 instrument at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The image data were processed using HKL2000 (19Otowinovski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and SCALA (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The phase was obtained by MAD with three wavelength SeMet data sets using SOLVE and RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The initial models were constructed using the XtalView program (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Iterative refinement and model building were subsequently performed using the REFMAC5 module of the CCP4 suite (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). There were no residues found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot as determined by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). To perform x-ray crystallographic analysis of the RNA polymerase PB2 of influenza A virus (H1N1, A/PR/8/34), it was necessary to obtain soluble quantities of the enzyme. The PB2 subunit was therefore divided into three portions. We expressed PB2 3/3 (aa 535–759) in E. coli as a His6-tagged recombinant protein that was subsequently purified from soluble fractions using Ni2+-agarose. We further purified the PB2 3/3 domain protein by cation-exchange chromatography to near homogeneity (98%). We then subjected the recombinant PB2 3/3 protein to crystallization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Native crystals were found to belong to the space group P3221 with the properties a = b = 52.5 Å, c = 156.3 Å. The Matthew’s value (Vm) was 2.7, assuming one molecule in an asymmetric unit. SeMet crystals were found in the same space group with the properties a = b = 52.6 Å, c = 156.4 Å. The crystal structure of PB2 3/3 was then determined by MAD phasing guided by the six SeMet positions out of the 10 methionine sites using SeMet crystals (24Hendrickson W.A. Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The model structure for PB2 3/3 was constructed from 208 residues (aa 535–742), except for the C-terminal 18 residues, and 86 water molecules (R value, 23.7%, and Rfree, 29.0%) using reflection data of up to 2.7 Å. There were no residues found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The determined structure for PB2 3/3 is shown in Fig. 1 and consists of eight helices and seven strands (Fig. 1, a and b). The N-terminal region (aa 535–684) is rich in α-helices, whereas the C-terminal portion is predominantly composed of β-strands (Fig. 1, a and b). The structure of the PB2 3/3 C terminus (aa 685–742) consists of three strands and one helix, which is quite similar to the already reported structure of the importin-binding domain of PB2 (Fig. 1b) (13Tarendeau F. Boudet J. Guilligay D. Mas P.J. Bougault C.M. Boulo S. Baudin F. Ruigrok R.W. Daigle N. Ellenberg J. Cusack S. Simorre J.P. Hart D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region, which has not previously been reported, consists of seven helix bundles and four β-strands (Fig. 1a). The C-terminal importin-binding region and the N terminus are linked by a “tethering loop” (aa 676–692) (Fig. 1a). Because the N terminus of PB2 3/3 is located in front of the importin-binding surface of its C-terminal region in the tertiary structure, the binding of the C-terminal region of PB2 to importin α-protein (13Tarendeau F. Boudet J. Guilligay D. Mas P.J. Bougault C.M. Boulo S. Baudin F. Ruigrok R.W. Daigle N. Ellenberg J. Cusack S. Simorre J.P. Hart D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) requires its N-terminal portion to move or rotate away (domain-domain movement). Recently, the other structure of the domain was reported by Tarendeau et al. (25Tarendeau F. Crepin T. Guilligay D. Ruigrok R.W. Cusack S. Hart D.J. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4e1000136Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There are eight amino acid differences among the two structures outside of the N-terminal regions (former: this structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 3cw4); latter: Protein Data Bank accession code 2vy6) A613T, F636L, A661T, V667I, T676I, G682S, A684S, and K702R. A661T, G682S, A684S, and K702R are host range mutations from (avian to avian) to (human to human). Unless these changes occur, the tertiary structure is basically identical to the root mean square deviation 1.103 Å. These host range mutations never affect the tertiary structure, suggesting that they directly interact with other host or virus factors. Their structures also do not include the residues Asp678–Gly685 in the tethering loop. We identified a characteristic structure in PB2 3/3 in which one helix (aa 589–605) is encircled by a loop (aa 623–635) (Fig. 1, b–d). We denoted this the “φ structure” because its shape resembles this Greek letter (Fig. 1, b and c). In the encircled “φ loop,” two prolines and one phenylalanine (PFXXXXP) are conserved among the influenza A, B, and C virus PB2 subunits (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting important roles, possibly including structural maintenance, for this region. The residue at position 627 in PB2 has been shown to be a determinant of pathogenicity and host range restriction for the influenza A virus (26Subbarao E.K. London W. Murphy B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1761-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shinya K. Hamm S. Hatta M. Ito H. Ito T. Kawaoka Y. Virology. 2004; 320: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 28Hatta M. Gao P. Halfmann P. Kawaoka Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lysine 627 is located in the φ loop (Fig. 1, b and c). In the φ helix,“ there is also a conserved sequence GXXYSXhhR (“h” denotes a hydrophobic amino acid), which would be expected to contribute to the essential functions of the overall φ structure in the life cycle of the influenza A virus. Because the side chains of Lys (627: red) QSRMQ (purple) are toward the outside on the flexible φ loop, they would be expected to function in interactions with other molecules. The inherent flexibility of this structure further suggests important roles for the PB2 domain, which include the pathogenicity of this virus, as discussed in the next section. To predict the function of the PB2 3/3 domain, we calculated the electrostatic potentials on its surface using the GRASP program (Fig. 2). One surface of PB2 3/3 (Fig. 2a) is highly basic when compared with the opposite side, suggesting that it may play an important role in the association with RNA primers and/or promoters as described in a later section (Fig. 2a). The φ loop generates a boundary along with a basic groove (Fig. 2a). Thus, the basic surface of PB2 consists of three parts: (I) a small portion separated by the φ loop (Lys586, Arg589), (II) a boundary of the φ loop (Lys627, Arg630), and (III) a basic groove separated by the φ loop (Fig. 2a). This basic surface is also separated from non-basic surfaces by helix 4 (Fig. 2a). Based upon our prediction that the basic surface would function in RNA binding, we tested whether the recombinant PB2 3/3 product had RNA primer and/or promoter binding activities using surface plasmon resonance analysis. This assay method is also suitable for performing kinetic analysis. The interactions of various concentrations (0.015, 0.044, 0.13, 0.40, 1.2, and 3.6 μm) of the PB2 3/3 protein with synthetic RNA oligomers (capped and non-capped primer RNAs and a 5′-vRNA promoter) were then evaluated (Fig. 3). Capped primer (5′-m7GpppAmAAUACUCAAG-3′), non-capped primer (5′-AmAAUACUCAAG-3′), or vRNA 5′ promoter (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′) were tested in a PB2 3/3 domain protein binding assay (11Jung T.E. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Fechter P. Mingay L. Sharps J. Chambers A. Fodor E. Brownlee G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20381-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An increase in the resonance units indicates an association. The PB2 3/3 protein was found to associate with all of these RNA oligomers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3), indicating that it possesses RNA binding activity. Significantly, this is the first report to show that this domain of PB2 has RNA binding activity. To determine whether any preferences exist for the binding of RNA to the PB2 3/3 domain protein, the Kd values were determined for various RNA molecules using the BIAevaluation program (Fig. 3). The Kd value for 5′-vRNA promoter was calculated as 3.2 μm, whereas those for capped and non-capped primers were found to be 12 and 8.8 μm, respectively. This suggests that PB2 3/3 has 2–3-fold higher binding affinity for vRNA promoter in comparison with capped and non-capped RNA oligomers. Honda and Ishihama’s review (9Honda A. Ishihama A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that this domain has primer binding activity but did not show any data in support of this. Jung and Brownlee (11Jung T.E. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have shown that the PB2 subunit binds to the vRNA promoter but did not show which domain contributes to this activity. We show in our current study that the PB2 3/3 domain has RNA binding activity with a Kd in the μm range. This affinity was found not to be dependent on capping, but our current data do not exclude the possibility that the whole PB2 subunit or trimer RNA polymerase complex binds to capped primers through this domain. The affinity of binding to the vRNA promoter is higher than that found for capped primer RNA, suggesting that this domain facilitates promoter binding with the PB1 subunit (11Jung T.E. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We next focused on the lysine residue at position 627, which is located in the φ loop (Figs. 1, b and c, and 2, a and b), because this residue has been shown to be a determinant of the pathogenicity and host range restriction of the influenza A virus (4De Clercq E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 5Hayden F.G. Atmar R.L. Schilling M. Johnson C. Poretz D. Paar D. Huson L. Ward P. Mills R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6Reece P.A. J. Med. Virol. 2007; 79: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When the residue at position 627 is glutamic acid, influenza A virus shows low temperature sensitivity in mammalian cells (30Labadie K. Dos Santos Afonso E. Rameix-Welti M.A. van der Werf S. Naffakh N. Virology. 2007; 362: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When this residue is lysine, the virus shows high pathogenicity in mammals (26Subbarao E.K. London W. Murphy B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1761-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hatta M. Gao P. Halfmann P. Kawaoka Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Lysine is almost exclusively found in human influenza virus isolates, whereas glutamic acid is almost exclusively found in avian influenza virus isolates at this position. This amino acid was also previously reported to be involved in the interaction with NP (nucleoprotein) protein (30Labadie K. Dos Santos Afonso E. Rameix-Welti M.A. van der Werf S. Naffakh N. Virology. 2007; 362: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Ye Q. Krug R.M. Tao Y.J. Nature. 2006; 444: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Based on our data regarding the basic surface of this domain, we predicted that the residue would also contribute to the binding of acidic molecules such as RNA. Thus, to investigate whether lysine 627 contributes to RNA binding activity, we replaced it with glutamic acid at this position in the PB2 3/3 protein (PB2 3/3 Glu627). During the purification of the PB2 3/3 and PB2 3/3 Glu627 proteins using CM column chromatography, we found that they had quite different properties. PB2 3/3 bound to CM resin, whereas PB2 3/3 Glu627 did not (Fig. 2, c–e). This suggests that the substitution of only one lysine at position 627 with glutamic acid has profound effects upon the surface electric charges of this domain, although there are 13 basic residues on the basic surface of the PB2 3/3 domain. Because the lysine at position 627 is located in the center of the basic surface and within the φ loop (Fig. 2a), it may have strong effects upon surface electric charges. To investigate whether lysine 627 contributes to RNA binding, we examined the PB2 3/3 and PB2 3/3 Glu627 proteins for this activity using a surface plasmon resonance assay for four types of oligonucleotide RNAs, such as primer/promoter RNA (Fig. 3). The RNA binding activity of PB2 3/3 Glu627 was significantly decreased for all RNA oligomers tested when compared with that of PB2 3/3 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table 1). We thus concluded that residue 627 is indeed involved in RNA binding. The differences in the RNA binding activity of PB2 might therefore contribute to the pathogenicity of influenza in humans. Our current results are also not necessarily inconsistent with previous reports for NP as it is not unusual for a domain to have multiple functions and bind to several molecules. Taken together, our present findings thus indicate that the PB2 surface is a potential candidate for novel anti-influenza A virus drugs from the viewpoint of pathogenicity and host range restriction levels. To further investigate the functional and structural relationships of the recombinant PB2 3/3 domain, we screened for proteins with a similar tertiary structure using the Matras program (32Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The results of these searches indicated that the helix bundles in the N-terminal portion of PB2 3/3 have similarities with that of subunit C from DNA clamp loader (replication factor C). The tertiary structure of DNA clamp loader was reported previously by Kuriyan and colleagues (33Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2a, blue line). The red and blue lines overlap at the helix as shown by the stereo structures (supplemental Fig. 2a). Kuriyan's model illustrates that DNA clamp loader binds to RNA primers, proliferating cell nuclear autoantigen (PCNA), DNA clamp), and DNA polymerase at the initiation of DNA replication (supplemental Fig. 2c). Taken together, our analysis outlines the structural and functional relationship between influenza A virus transcription and cellular DNA replication from the view point of RNA primer binding. Because each of the two domains, influenza RNA polymerase PB2 3/3 and DNA clamp loader, have RNA binding activity, it is probable that these helix bundles are involved with an RNA binding function. In conclusion, the unique φ-shaped structure within the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the associated structure-function relationships between RNA binding and pathogenicity for this enzyme have the potential to lead to novel anti-influenza A virus drugs. The development of such agents may be achieved by performing docking simulations in silico in which the surfaces of these unique domains can be comprehensively tested using small molecule databases.

Soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) is a heterodimer that is activated by NO· to convert cytosolic GTP to cGMP, a second messenger required for normal VSMC relaxation. Here, we show that aldosterone (10-9-10-7 mol/liter) diminishes GC activity by activating NADPH oxidase in bovine aortic VSMC to increase reactive oxygen species levels and induce oxidative posttranslational modification(s) of Cys-122, a β1-subunit cysteinyl residue demonstrated previously to modulate NO· sensing by GC. In VSMC treated with aldosterone, Western immunoblotting detected evidence of GC β1-subunit disulfide bonding, whereas mass spectrometry analysis of a homologous peptide containing the Cys-122-bearing sequence exposed to conditions of increased oxidant stress confirmed cysteinyl sulfinic acid (m/z 435), sulfonic acid (m/z 443), and disulfide (m/z 836) bond formation. The functional effect of these modifications was examined by transfecting COS-7 cells with wild-type GC or mutant GC containing an alanine substitution at Cys-122 (C122A). Exposure to aldosterone or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly decreased cGMP levels in cells expressing wild-type GC. In contrast, aldosterone or H2O2 did not influence cGMP levels in cells expressing the mutant C122A GC, confirming that oxidative modification of Cys-122 specifically impairs GC activity.

It has been suggested that aldosterone-induced vascular dysfunction is a consequence of a vasculopathy that results from the propensity for aldosterone to generate ROS 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; DETA NONOate, diethylenetriamine NONOate; GC, guanylyl cyclase; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; AMT, 2-amino-5,6 dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine; ALDO, aldosterone; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MS-MS, tandem mass spectrometry; WT, wild type. and decrease bioavailable NO· (6Struthers A.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 217: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the vascular endothelium, aldosterone has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction by inducing an acquired antioxidant-deficient state that disrupts cellular redox homeostasis to increase ROS accumulation and diminish NO· levels. In vivo, this results in diminished endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity (7Leopold J.A. Dam A. Maron B.A. Scribner A.W. Liao R. Handy D.E. Stanton R.C. Pitt B. Loscalzo J. Nat.

The relationship between aldosterone-induced oxidant stress and NO·-stimulated vasodilatory signaling pathways in VSMC, however, remains unknown. The influence of oxidant stress on NO·-activated GC signaling in VSMC has been the subject of investigation for over three decades (8Melichar V.O. Behr-Roussel D. Zabel U. Uttenthal L.O. Rodrigo J.

Guanylyl cyclase is a heterodimeric enzyme that requires coexpression of the α1-, or α2-, and β1-subunits to achieve catalytic activity and convert cytosolic GTP to cGMP, which, in turn, induces VSMC relaxation (13Koesling D. Methods (Amst.). 1999; 19: 485-493Google Scholar). When GC is functionally deficient, vasodilatory signaling is disrupted and vascular compliance is decreased, an effect that is associated with myocardial infarction, stroke, and progression of coronary artery disease (3Weber K.T.

NO· is the primary, biologically active stimulator of GC. In the presence of excess ROS, it has been suggested that GC enzymatic function may be decreased by: (i) a peroxynitrite (ONOO-)-mediated decrease in GC specific activity (15Weber M. Lauer N. Mulsch A. Kojda G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); (ii) oxidation of the β1-subunit-associated prosthetic heme group that converts GC to an NO·-insensitive state (14Stasch J.P.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that aldosterone-mediated ROS formation promotes oxidative posttranslational modification of GC and conversion of the enzyme to an NO·-insensitive state, thereby disrupting a key pathway essential for normal VSMC relaxation. Cell Culture and Treatments-Bovine aortic VSMC (Genlantis) were grown to confluence using phenol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were passaged twice weekly using 0.5% trypsin/EDTA, and experiments were performed on cells from passages 4–10. Aldosterone (Steraloids) and apocynin (Cayman) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 nmol/liter), which also served as the vehicle control. Cells were treated with aldosterone (10-9-10-7 mol/liter) for 24 h, and in selected experiments, coincubated with apocynin (3 × 10-5 mol/liter) or 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,2-thiazin (AMT) (100 μmol/liter)(Cayman) for 24 h. NOS2 was induced using the combination of irradiated lipopolysaccharide (30 μg/ml)-(Sigma), interleukin 1-β (50 ng/ml)(Endogen), and interferon-γ (50 ng/ml)(Endogen) as described previously (19Welch G.N. Upchurch Jr., G.R. Farivar R.S. Pigazzi A. Vu K. Brecher P. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 22-31PubMed Google Scholar). Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Fluorescence-ROS generation was assessed using 6-carboxy-2′,7′ dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate ester fluorescence (5 μmol/liter) (Molecular Probes) as described previously (7Leopold J.A.

Amplex Red Activity Assay-Hydrogen peroxide was measured using the horseradish peroxidase-linked Amplex Red assay per kit instructions (Invitrogen). Phenol-red free tissue culture medium from experimental samples was incubated in 100 μm Amplex Red reagent, and absorbance was measured at an excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an emission wave-length of 590 nm in a microplate fluorometer (Spectramax Gemini XPS, Molecular Devices). Data are standardized to sample protein concentration. NADPH Oxidase Activity-NADPH oxidase activity was measured using lucigenin (5 μmol/liter) chemiluminescence. Photon emission was measured every 10 s for 5 min in a luminometer (Turner Biosystems 20/20n), and the rate of enzyme activity was calculated as described previously (20Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M.

NO· Metabolites-Nitrite ( NO2-) and nitrate ( NO3-) were measured from cell culture medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and l-arginine (1 mmol/liter)(Sigma) by 2,3-diaminonaphthalene fluorescence (Cayman). 3-Nitrotyrosine Immunohistochemistry-Cells were grown to confluence on glass chamber slides, exposed to anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and stained using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate method (Vector laboratories) as described previously (21Walford G.A.

Images were viewed under 200× magnification with the Olympus BX51™ microscope and acquired by Picture Taker™. cGMP Measurement-Confluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then exposed to 6% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were collected and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cGMP formation was measured by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman), and bicinchoninic acid (Bio-Rad) was used for protein determination. Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase Activity Assay-Intracellular GC activity was measured using the methodology of Waldman et al. (22Waldman S.A. Leitman D.C. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All samples were incubated with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and DETA NONOate (10 mm, Cayman) at 37° for 10 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 4 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP (Sigma). After 10 min, 6% trichloroacetic acid was added, supernatant fractions were extracted using water-saturated ethyl ether (Fisher), and samples were dried under nitrogen gas. cGMP levels were measured by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman). Immunoblotting-Proteins were size-fractionated electrophoretically using SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-NOS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-GC α1-subunit and anti-GC β1-subunit (Cayman) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot to Detect GC Disulfide Bond Formation- VSMC were lysed in an alkylating buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 100 mm iodoacetamide, 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide) and sonicated on ice. Following a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, alkylated proteins were precipitated with acetone. Proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and disulfides were reduced by adding a final concentration of 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Following a 20-min incubation at 25 °C, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was removed with a Micro Bio-Spin column 6 (Bio-Rad), and 1% SDS was added to the eluant. The previously oxidized (now reduced) cysteines were labeled with 1 mm polyethylene glycol-conjugated maleimide (molecular mass 10 kDa, Fluka). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, proteins were precipitated with acetone, resuspended in 50 μl of non-reducing SDS electrophoresis buffer, size-fractionated electrophoretically using SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (23Mastroberardino P.G. Orr A.L. Hu X. Na H.M. Greenamyre J.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To detect disulfides specific to the sGC β1-subunit, the membrane was immunoblotted with an sGC β1-subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transfection-Expression constructs in pCMV5 were used to overexpress α1-, β1-, and β1-C122A subunits of rat GC as described previously (18Sayed N. Baskaran P. Ma X. van den Akker F. Beuve A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12312-12317Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells, which do not express endogenous GC, were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes and transfected with 5 μg of DNA for 4 h with Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) (24Handy D.E. Zhang Y. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15518-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After this time, medium was replaced with full growth media, and experiments were performed after 48 h. Mass Spectrometry-In-gel trypsin digestion of immunoprecipitated GC from bovine VSMC whole cell extracts was performed according to the method by Shevchenko et al. (25Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were subjected to liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, and modified cysteinyl thiols in digested peptides were monitored using MS1 analysis. A doubly charged ion of m/z 435 corresponding to a Cys-122-containing peptide (CTDADKGK) with the addition of two oxygens was identified. A model peptide containing CTDADKGK was synthesized in the Biopolymers Laboratory at Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA). To study the effect of oxidant stress on Cys-122, the peptide (0.1 mm) was incubated with 200 μmol/liter H2O2 and 0.2 mmol/liter ferrous sulfate (Sigma) in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.9, for 30 min at 22 °C. Reaction products were mixed with 10 volumes of 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water and analyzed with an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometry system (Thermo Electron Co., San Jose, CA) equipped with a static nanospray ion source probe. The spray voltage was set to 1.4 kV, and the heated capillary was set to 200 °C. MS1 scanning was performed using an enhanced scan mode to monitor the size and charge state of the ions. MS-MS scanning was acquired for definitive identification of the oxidation products of the peptide. Statistical Analysis-Continuous data were expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison between groups was performed by Student's paired two-tailed t test, and p < 0.05 is considered significant. Aldosterone Induces Oxidant Stress in VSMC-To evaluate the effect of aldosterone on ROS accumulation, bovine aortic VSMC were exposed to aldosterone (10-9-10-7 mol/liter) for 24 h. When compared with vehicle-treated cells, there was a concentration-dependent increase in ROS levels in aldosterone-treated cells (117.9 ± 5.7 versus 124.5 ± 6.1 versus 144.9 ± 4.6% control, p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 1A). As no further increase in ROS formation was observed after 24 h, experiments were performed following this incubation period in VSMC exposed to 10-7 mol/liter aldosterone, a pathophysiologically relevant concentration comparable with levels achieved in patients with primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism (3Weber K.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Aldosterone-mediated ROS generation resulted from activation of NADPH oxidase, a predominant source of ROS in VSMC. Aldosterone increased NADPH oxidase activity nearly 2-fold when compared with vehicle-treated cells (61.7 ± 1.5 versus 117.9 ± 5.7 nmol ·O2-/min/mg of protein, p < 0.001, n = 3). Coincubation of aldosterone-treated cells with apocynin (30 μmol/liter), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, decreased ROS levels significantly (145.1 ± 1.8 versus 115.6 ± 8.6% control, p < 0.04, n = 3), confirming that the majority of aldosterone-mediated ROS formation resulted from NADPH oxidase activation. Next, the effect of aldosterone on H2O2 levels was assessed as H2O2 has been shown to modify protein function by reacting with free thiol moieties and GC contains several cysteinyl thiols. When compared with vehicle, aldosterone increased H2O2 formation significantly as determined by Amplex Red fluorescence (5.24 ± 0.02 versus 9.31 ± 1.06 μm/μg of protein, p < 0.03, n = 3) (Fig. 1B). Coincubation with apocynin decreased aldosterone-induced H2O2 production by 66.1% (p < 0.01, n = 3). Together, these studies demonstrate that aldosterone activates NADPH oxidase to increase oxidant stress in VSMC. Aldosterone and NO· Metabolism-Under basal conditions in VSMC, bioavailable NO· has one of two metabolic fates. It may either remain unoxidized to bind the Fe2+ center of the prosthetic heme group to activate GC and increase cGMP levels or undergo oxidation to nitrite ( NO2-) and nitrate ( NO3-). Therefore, to assess the influence of aldosterone on endogenously produced NO· bioactivity, we induced iNOS expression to increase NO2- production (0.0 ± 0.0 versus 0.08 ± 0.01 μm/μg of protein, p < 0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 2, A and B). AMT (100 μmol/liter), a specific iNOS inhibitor, decreased NO2- formation to non-detectable levels in iNOS-expressing cells, indicating that iNOS was the primary source of NO2-. Exposure of iNOS-expressing cells to aldosterone had no further influence on either iNOS protein expression or NO2- levels. To demonstrate that these findings were not unique to iNOS-expressing cells, we treated VSMC with the exogenous NO· donor, DETA NONOate (1 mmol/liter). DETA NONOate-treated cells exhibited a significant increase in NO2- formation (0.0 ± 0.0 versus 1.34 ± 0.02 μm/μg of protein, p < 0.03, n = 3), and aldosterone had no additional effect on these levels (1.35 ± 0.02 μm/μg of protein, p = not significant, n = 3). In addition to the observed lack of effect of aldosterone on NO2- levels, aldosterone had no influence on total NO· metabolites (NOx: NO2- + NO3-) in iNOS-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). It has been shown previously that following iNOS induction in vitro, the NO2- to NO3- ratio is ∼2:1; however, in the presence of increased ROS generation, enhanced peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation may shift this ratio in favor of NO3- (26Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, in iNOS-expressing cells, the NO2-/NO3- ratio was found to be 1.86:1, and aldosterone decreased this ratio by 31.7% (p < 0.04, n = 6). To explain the observed shift in the NO2-/NO3- ratio, we examined ONOO- formation (Fig. 2D). In iNOS-expressing cells, aldosterone induced a 54% rise in ONOO- formation when compared with untreated cells as assessed by 3-nitrotyrosine immunostaining (p < 0.02, n = 3). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity with apocynin in aldosterone-treated cells fully restored the NO2-/NO3- ratio, increasing it modestly to ∼3:1 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these studies reveal that aldosterone increases ONOO- formation in iNOS-expressing cells and offer an explanation for the observed decrease in the NO2-/NO3- ratio. Aldosterone Decreases GC Activity and cGMP Production- Next, the influence of aldosterone on NO·-GC signaling was examined. Although there was no effect of aldosterone on GC α1-or β1-subunit protein expression (Fig. 3A), we observed a 46% decrease in basal GC activity in aldosterone-treated when compared with vehicle-treated cells (0.016 ± 0.001 versus 0.008 ± 0.002 pmol cGMP/10 min/μg of protein, p < 0.02, n = 4) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, in iNOS-expressing cells, aldosterone decreased GC activity by 35.3% (p < 0.001, n = 4) (Fig. 3C) and cGMP levels by 50.7% (0.014 ± 0.0019 versus 0.007 ± 0.002 cGMP pmol/μg of protein, p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 3D). This finding was confirmed in DETA NONOate-treated cells where aldosterone decreased cGMP levels by 54% when compared with DETA NONOate alone (2.80 ± 0.43 versus 1.28 ± 0.25 fmol/μg of protein, p < 0.02, n = 4). The role of aldosterone-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity as the mediator of decreased GC activity was investigated. When compared with aldosterone alone, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity with apocynin restored iNOS-stimulated GC activity (Fig. 3C) and increased cGMP formation in both iNOS-expressing (Fig. 3D) and DETA NONOate-treated cells (1.28 ± 0.25 versus 2.3 ± 0.16 fmol/μg of protein, p < 0.02, n = 4). Disulfide Bond Formation in GC β-Subunit-To determine whether oxidative modification of redox-susceptible cysteinyl thiols was one mechanism by which aldosterone impairs GC activity, we assessed disulfide bond formation in aldosterone-treated cells. The presence of disulfide bond formation may occur as a consequence of increased oxidant stress and has been suggested previously to influence adversely normal NO·-GC signaling (17Brandwein H.J. Lewicki J.A. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2958-2962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether aldosterone induced disulfide bond formation in the β1-subunit of GC, we treated VSMC with either vehicle or aldosterone and blocked free thiols with iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide. We then reduced any potential disulfide bonds and labeled the previously oxidized (and now reduced) thiols with polyethylene glycol-conjugated maleimide (molecular mass 10 kDa). In this manner, two cysteinyl thiols involved in a disulfide bond increase the apparent molecular mass of the GC β1-subunit by a total of 20 kDa (23Mastroberardino P.G. Orr A.L. Hu X. Na H.M. Greenamyre J.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The vehicle-treated cells demonstrated only the fully reduced GC β1-subunit; however, following aldosterone treatment, bands at 85 and 105 kDa were apparent, suggesting that aldosterone oxidatively modified cysteinyl thiols in the GC β1-subunit to induce the formation of two disulfide bonds (Fig. 4A). Posttranslational Oxidative Modification of GC Decreases NO· Sensing-To support our hypothesis that aldosterone impairs GC activity by inducing oxidative modification of a key cysteinyl residue located within the NO·-sensing region of GC, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to target three key β1-subunit associated cysteinyl residues (Cys-78, Cys-122, Cys-214). These cysteines were selected for analysis based on prior studies that implicated them as integral to normal NO· sensing by GC (10Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Sayed N. Baskaran P. Ma X. van den Akker F. Beuve A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12312-12317Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of GC using a β1-subunit antibody was performed on VSMC exposed to aldosterone for 24 h, and after separation of peptides by capillary column liquid chromatography, MS1 scanning suggested potential oxidative modification of Cys-122 (peptide sequence: CTDADKGK). To examine the effect of oxidant stress on Cys-122, a model peptide containing the above amino acid sequence was synthesized. After exposure of this peptide to H2O2 (200 μmol/liter) for 30 min, MS1 scanning identified three doubly charged ions at m/z 435, m/z 443, and m/z 836 that corresponded to the CTDADKGK oxidation products cysteinyl sulfinic acid, cysteinyl sulfonic acid, and cysteinyl disulfide, respectively. MS-MS scanning confirmed the identity of these products (Fig. 4, B–D). Collision-induced dissociation of ion m/z 435 resulted in a spectrum with a characteristically predominant [M-81] ion (m/z = 394 at doubly charged state), representing the loss of NH3 and SO2 in the parent ion after a rearrangement of the N-terminal cysteinyl sulfinic acid in the peptide (for details of this reaction, see Ref. 27Srikanth R. Wilson J. Bridgewater J.D. Numbers J.R. Lim J. Olbris M.R. Kettani A. Vachet R.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 18: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). In addition, fragmentation of ion m/z 836 resulted in a spectrum with the most abundant daughter ion being derived from the homolytic cleavage of the disulfide bond present in the parent ion (Fig. 4D). These mass spectrometry analyses reveal that oxidation of CTDADKGK results in oxidation products by either the addition of oxygen or disulfide bond formation. To determine whether oxidative modification of Cys-122 has functional implications for normal NO· sensing by GC, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with rat GC DNAs coding for the wild-type (WT) α1- and β1-subunit of GC or the wild-type α1-subunit and a mutant β1-subunit containing a substitution of alanine for cysteine at position 122 (α1/β1-C122A). Although a single amino acid dissimilarity exists at position 126 between rat (glutamate) and bovine (aspartate) GC DNA, this difference is conservative and unlikely to affect the microenvironment of Cys-122. Expression of the transiently transfected WT α1-subunit and WT or mutant β1-subunit GC DNA in COS-7 cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). GC activity was determined in COS-7 cells expressing the WT or α1/β1-C122A mutant DNA exposed to H2O2 (250 μmol/liter) for 5 min to induce oxidant stress or vehicle control. Although exposure to H2O2 decreased NO·-stimulated cGMP levels by 66.3% in the WT-transfected cells when compared with vehicle-treated cells (100 ± 13.7 versus 33.7 ± 10.6% control, p < 0.005, n = 3), H2O2 had no effect on NO·-stimulated cGMP levels in α1/β1-C122A mutant-transfected cells (100 ± 6.1 versus 93.5 ± 2.8% control, p = not significant, n = 3) (Fig. 5B). These findings confirm that oxidative modification of Cys-122 renders GC insensitive to NO·. Aldosterone Decreases GC NO· Sensing by Oxidative Modification of Cys-122-To determine whether aldosterone had similar functional implications for normal NO· sensing by GC as H2O2, we first demonstrated that COS-7 cells express a functional mineralocorticoid receptor and NADPH oxidase enzyme (supplemental Fig. 1A). Similar to VSMC, we found that COS-7 cells treated with aldosterone for 24 h increased significantly p67phox protein expression when compared with vehicle control (p < 0.05, n = 3) (supplemental Fig. 1A). Next, we assessed the effect of aldosterone on NADPH oxidase activation and ROS generation.

The delta (delta)-subunit-containing receptors are expressed exclusively extra-synaptically and mediate tonic inhibition. In the present study, we were interested in determining the architecture of receptors containing the delta-subunit. To investigate this, we predefined the subunit arrangement by concatenation. We prepared five dual and three triple concatenated subunit constructs. These concatenated dual and triple constructs were used to predefine nine different GABA(A) receptor pentamers. These pentamers composed of alpha(1)-, beta(3)-, and delta-subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and maximal currents elicited in response to 1 mm GABA were determined in the presence and absence of THDOC (3alpha, 21-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one). beta(3)-alpha(1)-delta/alpha(1)-beta(3) and beta(3)-alpha(1)-delta/beta(3)-alpha(1) resulted in the expression of large currents in response to GABA. Interestingly, the presence of the neurosteroid THDOC uncovered alpha(1)-beta(3)-alpha(1)/beta(3)-delta receptors, additionally. The functional receptors were characterized in detail using the agonist GABA, THDOC, Zn(2+), and ethanol and their properties were compared with those of non-concatenated alpha(1)beta(3) and alpha(1)beta(3)delta receptors. Each concatenated receptor isoform displayed a specific set of properties, but none of them responded to 30 mm ethanol. We conclude from the investigated receptors that delta can assume multiple positions in the receptor pentamer. The GABA dose-response properties of alpha(1)-beta(3)-alpha(1)/beta(3)-delta and beta(3)-alpha(1)-delta/alpha(1)-beta(3) match most closely the properties of non-concatenated alpha(1)beta(3)delta receptors. Furthermore, we show that the delta-subunit can contribute to the formation of an agonist site in alpha(1)-beta(3)-alpha(1)/beta(3)-delta receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2032567196,"In oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, the two photosystems, photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), function in parallel, and their excitation levels must be balanced to maintain an optimal photosynthetic rate under various light conditions. State transitions balance excitation energy between the two photosystems by redistributing light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) proteins. Here we describe two RNA interference (RNAi) mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with one of the minor monomeric LHCII proteins, CP29 or CP26, knocked down. These two proteins have been identified in PSI-LHCI supercomplexes that harbor mobile LHCII proteins from PSII under a state where PSII is preferentially excited (State 2). We show that both the CP29 and CP26 RNAi mutants undergo reductions in the PSII antenna size during a transition from State 1 (a state where PSI is preferentially excited) to State 2, as reflected by nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence, low temperature fluorescence spectra, and functional absorption cross-section. However, the undocked LHCIIs from PSII do not re-associate with PSI in the CP29-RNAi (b4i) mutant because the antenna size of PSI was not complementary increased. The mobile LHCIIs in the CP26-RNAi (b5i) mutant, however, re-associate with PSI, whose PSI-LHCI/II supercomplex is visualized on a sucrose density gradient. This study clarifies that CP29, not CP26, is an essential component in state transitions and demonstrates that CP29 is crucial when mobile LHCIIs re-associate with PSI under State 2 conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2040575932,"Glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) contain interdigitated processes that form specialized intercellular junctions, termed slit diaphragms, which provide a selective filtration barrier in the renal glomerulus. Analyses of disease-causing mutations in familial nephrotic syndromes and targeted mutagenesis in mice have revealed critical roles of several proteins in the assembly of slit diaphragms. The nephrin-podocin complex is the main constituent of slit diaphragms. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these proteins to maintain the slit diaphragms are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the PAR3-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-PAR6beta cell polarity proteins co-localize to the slit diaphragms with nephrin. Furthermore, selective depletion of aPKClambda in mouse podocytes results in the disassembly of slit diaphragms, a disturbance in apico-basal cell polarity, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The aPKC-PAR3 complex associates with the nephrin-podocin complex in podocytes through direct interaction between PAR3 and nephrin, and the kinase activity of aPKC is required for the appropriate distribution of nephrin and podocin in podocytes. These observations not only establish a critical function of the polarity proteins in the maintenance of slit diaphragms, but also imply their potential involvement in renal failure in FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W2072300232,"High-affinity Ca(2+) transport ATPases play a crucial role in controlling cytosolic Ca(2+). The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is a neurotoxic agent found in affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that has been implicated in dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Using kinetic assays, we have shown that the Ca(2+) dependencies of intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA and SPCA) activity are the same in human AD and normal brain but that of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) is different. The addition of Abeta to normal brain decreases the PMCA activity measured at pCa 5.5, resulting in the same Ca(2+)dependency as that seen in AD brain, whereas the addition of Abeta to AD brain has no effect on PMCA activity. Abeta also decreases the activity of PMCA purified from pig cerebrum, the effect being isoform specific. The level of inhibition of purified PMCA caused by Abeta is reduced by cholesterol, and the level of inhibition of PMCA activity by Abeta in the raft fraction of pig synaptosomal membranes is lower than for the nonraft fraction. We conclude that the effect of Abeta on PMCA activity could be important in amyloid toxicity, resulting in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) dysregulation and could explain the different Ca(2+) dependencies of PMCA activity observed in normal and AD brain."
https://openalex.org/W1999489139,"Background The success of social insects can be in part attributed to their division of labor, which has been explained by a response threshold model. This model posits that individuals differ in their response thresholds to task-associated stimuli, so that individuals with lower thresholds specialize in this task. This model is at odds with findings on honeybee behavior as nectar and pollen foragers exhibit different responsiveness to sucrose, with nectar foragers having higher response thresholds to sucrose concentration. Moreover, it has been suggested that sucrose responsiveness correlates with responsiveness to most if not all other stimuli. If this is the case, explaining task specialization and the origins of division of labor on the basis of differences in response thresholds is difficult. Methodology To compare responsiveness to stimuli presenting clear-cut differences in hedonic value and behavioral contexts, we measured appetitive and aversive responsiveness in the same bees in the laboratory. We quantified proboscis extension responses to increasing sucrose concentrations and sting extension responses to electric shocks of increasing voltage. We analyzed the relationship between aversive responsiveness and aversive olfactory conditioning of the sting extension reflex, and determined how this relationship relates to division of labor. Principal Findings Sucrose and shock responsiveness measured in the same bees did not correlate, thus suggesting that they correspond to independent behavioral syndromes, a foraging and a defensive one. Bees which were more responsive to shock learned and memorized better aversive associations. Finally, guards were less responsive than nectar foragers to electric shocks, exhibiting higher tolerance to low voltage shocks. Consequently, foragers, which are more sensitive, were the ones learning and memorizing better in aversive conditioning. Conclusions Our results constitute the first integrative study on how aversive responsiveness affects learning, memory and social organization in honeybees. We suggest that parallel behavioral modules (e.g. appetitive, aversive) coexist within each individual bee and determine its tendency to adopt a given task. This conclusion, which is at odds with a simple threshold model, should open new opportunities for exploring the division of labor in social insects."

The initial response to the drug is robust; however, tumor cells commonly develop resistance to cisplatin, which complicates treatment. Recently, overexpression of the Cu-ATPase ATP7B in ovary cells was linked to the increased cellular resistance to cisplatin; and the role for Cu-ATPases in the export of cisplatin from cells was proposed. Our results support functional interactions between cisplatin and ATP7B but argue against the active transport through the copper translocation pathway as a mechanism of drug resistance. In hepatocytes, we observed no correlation between the levels of endogenous ATP7B and the resistance of cells to cisplatin. Unlike copper, cisplatin does not induce trafficking of ATP7B in hepatoma cells, neither does it compete with copper in a transport assay. However, cisplatin binds to ATP7B and stimulates catalytic phosphorylation with EC50 similar to that of copper. Mutations of the first five N-terminal copper-binding sites of ATP7B do not inhibit the cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of ATP7B. In contrast, the deletion of the first four copper-binding sites abolishes the effect of cisplatin on the ATP7B activity. Thus, cisplatin binding to ATP7B and/or general changes in cellular copper homeostasis are likely contributors to the increased resistance to the drug. The link between changes in copper homeostasis and cisplatin resistance was confirmed by treating the Huh7 cells with copper chelator and increasing their resistance to cisplatin.cisplatin Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of ovarian, testicular, lung, and stomach cancers.

DDP mediates its cytotoxic effects by binding to DNA, forming the intrastrand cross-links and thus causing an inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair with eventual cell death (6Jamieson E.R.

The initial tumor response to the treatment with DDP is robust; however, the efficacy of treatment decreases with longer and repetitive therapy cycles. The resistance arises rapidly and is sufficient to cause a failure of DDP therapy (8Andrews P.A. Jones J.A. Varki N.M. Howell S.B. Cancer Commun. 1990; 2: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cells develop resistance to DDP are not fully understood. Detoxification of DDP, enhanced repair and tolerance of DNA adducts, inhibition of apoptosis, impaired uptake and increased efflux of the drug may contribute to the acquired resistance of cells (9Akiyama S.

In ovarian carcinoma cells, ATP7B was detected in vesicles resembling exosomes, prompting the suggestion that ATP7B facilitates DDP efflux (25Safaei R. Larson B.J. Cheng T.C. Gibson M.A. Otani S.

Goodman M. Howell S.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4578-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).These observations have raised significant interest and many questions. ATP7B is a P1-type-ATPase with high selectivity to Cu(I) (27Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Cu(I) stimulates catalytic activity of ATP7B, inducing the hydrolysis of ATP via formation of an acyl-phosphate intermediate, a step necessary for subsequent transport of copper across membranes (28Petris M.J. Voskoboinik I. Cater M. Smith K. Kim B.E. Llanos R.M. Strausak D. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol.

Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not apparent how ATP7B may coordinate and transport DDP or even platinum, a metal with electronic structure different from Cu(I). Recent studies provided the in vitro evidence for the DDP-dependent ATP-hydrolysis by ATP7B and the ATP7B-dependent transport of DDP at acidic pH (pH 4.6) (31Safaei R. Otani S. Larson B.J. Rasmussen M.L. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because these conditions do not match the physiological conditions at which ATP7B operates, it remains uncertain whether the transport of DDP to vesicles represents the primary mechanism through which ATP7B mediates resistance of cells to DDP.ATP7B is highly expressed in hepatocytes. Given the poor response of hepatic tumors to chemotherapy and the poor prognosis of advanced hepatomas (32Wakamatsu T. Nakahashi Y. Hachimine D. Seki T. Okazaki K. Int. J. Oncol. 2007; 31: 1465-1472PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mathurin P. Rixe O. Carbonell N. Bernard B. Cluzel P. Bellin M.F. Khayat D. Opolon P. Poynard T. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 12: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it was interesting and important to investigate the role of ATP7B in the sensitivity of hepatocytes and hepatoma cells to DDP. Hepatocytes, unlike ovary cells, express only one Cu-ATPase, ATP7B; this simplifies evaluation of the ATP7B contribution to DDP resistance. Contrary to expectation, in hepatoma cells and in primary hepatocytes, we did not observe a correlation between the levels of ATP7B and cell sensitivity to DDP, nor did we see the effect of DDP on ATP7B transport activity or trafficking. Instead, we demonstrate that DDP binds to ATP7B and induces formation of a phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. We found that the mode of DDP binding to ATP7B differs from that of copper and requires the presence of the N-terminal metal-binding domain. We propose a model of how the overexpression of ATP7B increases cell resistance to the drug.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents-The DDP solution (GRY-Pharma, Kirchzarten, Germany or Novaplus purchased through Ben Venue Laboratories, Bedford, OH) was obtained via the pharmacies of the University of Leipzig or the Oregon Health & Science University, respectively. It was kept as a 3.33 mm solution in 0.9% NaCl in the dark at room temperature. Other chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were provided by Sigma.Cell Lines-Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained at 27 °C in suspension cultures in SF900 II (Invitrogen). The human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen).Mouse Strains-The generation of Atp7b-/- mice has been described previously (34Buiakova O.I. Xu J. Lutsenko S. Zeitlin S. Das K. Das S. Ross B.M. Mekios C. Scheinberg I.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Atp7b-/- mice were housed at the Medizinisch Experimentelles Zentrum (MEZ) of the University of Leipzig according to the university guidelines on the use of laboratory and experimental animals. The animals were euthanized by phenobarbital injection (intraperitoneal). Eight-week-old mice of either sex were used for the experiments.Primary Liver Cells-Hepatocytes were isolated according to Seglen et al. (35Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) with modifications by Gebhardt et al. (36Gebhardt R. Jung W. Robenek H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 29: 68-76PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cells were centrifuged at room temperature at 37.5 × g for 2 min. The pellets were resuspended in culture medium Williams E (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). The viability was determined by staining with trypan blue. The hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes, prepared 1 day before hepatocyte isolation, and maintained in Williams E. For 24-well plates, hepatocytes were plated at a density 2.5 × 105 cells/dish. All of the cells were then grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2 h prior to treatment with DDP.Cytotoxicity Experiments-HepG2 and Huh7 cells were plated in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks at a density of 7 × 105 cells (HepG2) or 3 × 105 cells (Huh7) in 5 ml of standard growth medium and left for 72 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C to form a monolayer. The cells were then treated with 0.1–100 μm DDP for 24 h. Copper deficiency was produced by incubating cells with 200 μm bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) 48 h prior to and during treatment with DDP. The number of viable cells was determined by Casy TT® (Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany).The primary hepatocytes were cultured in a 24-well plate and then incubated with different concentration of DDP for 24 h. Drug-containing medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS twice before the addition of MTT and then incubated with 200 μl of MTT solution (2 mg/ml PBS) for 2 h. MTT solution was removed, and 200 μl of Me2SO was added to each well to lyse cells. The percentage of viable cells after DDP treatment was determined photometrically by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm compared with untreated controls.ATP7B Expression in Hepatoma Cells-Huh7 and HepG2 cells were grown to >90% confluence and trypsinized in 0.05% trypsin/PBS. Then cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol/PBS. The cells were homogenized and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was subjected centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g to sediment cell membranes. The membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 333 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.6 m urea, 3.3% SDS, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was determined (37Kruger N.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis was carried out using antibody against the nucleotide-binding domain; staining with the anti-β-actin antibody was used as a protein loading control.Immunofluorescence Microscopy-HepG2 cells were grown in 10-cm2 cell culture dishes to >90% confluence before being trypsinized in 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.05% trypsin) and adjusted to 10 ml with the medium. In a 12-well tray, 16 μl of the 10 ml of cell suspension was seeded onto flamed glass coverslips and cultured in the appropriate growth media until the cells reached 80% confluence. The cells were then treated with either 200 μm BCS to decrease free copper levels in the medium, with 10–200 μm CuCl2 or with 10–200 μm DDP for 3 h. The cells were then fixed by immersion in acetone for 30 s at -20 °C. The cells were blocked overnight in 1% gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide in PBS at 4 °C and then incubated with the anti-ATP7B antibodies as in Ref. 38Bartee M.Y. Lutsenko S.

After washing four times with PBS for 1 h, the cells were treated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000; Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat for ATP7B, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for Syntaxin 6. The cells were then washed four times in PBS for 1 h, and then coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The images were analyzed using a Zeiss Confocal Scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).ATP7B Expression in Sf9 Insect Cells and Preparation of Membrane Fractions-The cells were infected with the recombinant virus encoding the wild-type ATP7B, the D1027A mutant (this mutation inactivates phosphorylation of invariant residue D1027), the ATP7B variant with the deletion of metal-binding sites 1–4 (ΔMBS1–4), and the ATP7B with CXXCto AXXA mutation of metal-binding sites 1–5, (mMBS1–5)) as previously described (29Tsivkovskii R.

To obtain membrane preparations, the cells from 50 ml of culture were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 5 ml of homogenizing buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). One tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche) was added per 50 ml of buffer solution. The cells were homogenized 20 times in a manual glass homogenizer and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was subjected to an additional centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g to sediment cell membranes. The pelleted cell membranes were resuspended in the homogenizing buffer. The membrane protein solution was stored frozen at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Vesicles for Copper Transport-The Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant virus or empty vector (used as a control) were harvested after 3 days. Cells from a 50-ml culture were pelleted, resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer for vesicles: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, antipain, and leupeptin (each diluted 1:1000), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (diluted 1:200). The cells were homogenized 20 times in a semi-automatic homogenizer (Schütt homgen plus, Göttingen, Germany) at 3000 rpm and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pelleted membranes were then resuspended in sterile filtered buffer (SMS; 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm potassium nitrate, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4). Vesicle formation was facilitated by vortexing and passing several times through a 25-gauge ⅝-inch needle. The vesicle solution was stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (37Kruger N.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the ATP7B expression, the samples were analyzed by Western analysis using antibody against the nucleotide-binding domain of ATP7B (the region that is unaltered in all mutants).Cu64 Uptake in Vesicles-The transport assay has been carried as described by Gmaj et al. (41Gmaj P. Zurini M. Murer H. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The vesicle solution was thawed, diluted to 5 μg of protein/μl with sterile filtered SMS buffer and kept on ice. For the transport assay 20 μl of vesicle solution was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min. Subsequently, the reaction was started at 37 °C by the addition of 80 μl of sterile filtered incubation solution (50 mm sucrose, 100 mm potassium nitrate, 10 mm Hepes/Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mm magnesium nitrate, 12.5 mm DTT, 6.25 mm ATP, 2.5 μm copper chloride (final copper concentration, 2 μm), 6 μCi/ml Cu64 (Rotop Pharmaka, Radeberg, Germany), and 0–10 μm DDP). The reaction was stopped at different time intervals by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold sterile filtered stopping solution (50 mm sucrose, 100 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) and filtered immediately through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose vacuum filter system. The filter was washed with 3 ml of stopping solution before and after filtration, and its radioactivity was measured by the γ-Counter Cobra Quantum (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).The Effect of Copper or DDP on Phosphorylation of ATP7B with [γ-32P]ATP-75 μg of membrane protein was resuspended in 200 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 6, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). 250 μm BCS was added and incubated on ice for 30 min; BCS was removed by centrifugation (5 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C). The pellets were washed with phosphorylation buffer, resuspended in the same buffer containing 100 μm ascorbate and 100 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and then incubated with of copper or DDP (0.5–10 μm) on ice for 10 min. In some cases, incubation with 2 μm DDP for 15 min was done prior to incubation with copper. To test the effect of BCS on phosphorylation, the metals were first removed by incubation with BCS as described above, then ATP7B was incubated for 10 min with either 10 μm copper (control) or DDP, then increasing concentrations of BCS (10–100 μm) were added for 30 min, and phosphorylation was measured.Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi; specific activity, 20 mCi/μmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 4 min. In several experiments, 0–500 μm ADP was added on ice for 4 min prior to termination of the reaction. All of the additional treatments were done as described in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of ice-cold stop solution (1 mm NaH2PO4 in 50% trichloroacetic acid) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The pellet was washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold water and centrifuged again for 5 min. The pellet was dissolved in 40 μl of sample buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m DTT, 5% SDS, and bromphenol blue), and 30 μl were loaded on a 7% acidic gel (stacking gel: 5.5% acrylamide, 41.3 mm Tris, pH 5.8, 1% SDS, 5% ammonium persulfate, 5% N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; separating gel: 7% acrylamide, 64.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 6.25% ammonium persulfate, 6.25% N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min and dried on blotting paper. The dried gels were exposed overnight either to screen for the Fuji BAS reader (Fuji, Düsseldorf, Germany) or Kodak BioMax MR film. The photon-stimulated-luminescence intensity of the bands was quantified using Aida Image Analyzer (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Papain Digestion and Western Blot Analysis of ATP7B-The membrane protein was solubilized in 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% n-decyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm cysteine, 20% glycerol, 50 mm MOPS·NaOH, pH 7 and centrifuged 5 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended and incubated in the buffer containing 500 μm BCS, 10 μm CuCl2, or 10 μm DDP at 30 °C for 1 h. Papain was activated in papain buffer (5 mm cysteine, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm MOPS·NaOH, pH 7) at room temperature for 30 min. ATP7B and papain were mixed 1:100–1:1000 at 30 °C for 2–200 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) up to a concentration of 2 mm. trichloroacetic acid was added to 2.5% immediately, and samples were centrifuged 5 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Then the pellet was resuspended in 34 μl of loading buffer, and 30 μl was loaded onto 8–16% gradient gel (Pierce). The samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. For the detection of ATP7B, anti-C-terminal domain antibody (generated against the recombinant protein corresponding to the last 92 residues of human ATP7B) was diluted in 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% PBS-T (1:3000) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Following extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized using Super Signal Chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and detected using x-ray films (Biomax O-Mat; Kodak).Statistical Analysis-The results are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical differences were analyzed by Mann-Whitney-U test using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The test of significance was two-tailed, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSHepatoma Cells HepG2 and Huh7 Show Different Sensitivity to DDP-Increased cellular ATP7B levels have been linked to changes in cell resistance to DDP and were interpreted as evidence for a major role of ATP7B in DDP efflux. To investigate the contribution of ATP7B to hepatoma cell response to DDP, the effect of DDP on cell survival was investigated using the HepG2 and Huh7 cells. These cells are both of human hepatic origin and have comparable levels of ATP7B (Fig. 1A). Therefore, if ATP7B plays a major role in DDP efflux, it was expected that both cell lines may have comparable sensitivity to the drug. However, the effect of DDP on cell viability was very different. The Huh7 cells showed a biphasic response with a sharp 50% decrease in cell survival and the half-maximum effect at 1.54 μm DDP (Fig. 1B). A further increase of the DDP concentration up to 100 μm induces a much smaller (additional 10%) decline in cell viability. In contrast, the HepG2 cells show monophasic decrease in cell viability with the EC50 for DDP equal to 16.15 μm. Higher DDP concentration in the medium induces larger decline in cell survival down to ∼20% at 100 μm (Fig. 1B).Primary Hepatocytes Lacking ATP7B Show Higher Resistance to DDP-The liver is the major detoxification organ, which mediates its function through multiple pathways. The individual contribution of these pathways may vary in cultured cell lines, thus producing distinct responses to DDP, as we observed for Huh7 and HepG2. Therefore, to examine the role of ATP7B more directly, we determined whether the elimination of endogenous ATP7B would render hepatocytes more sensitive to cisplatin. The primary hepatocytes were isolated from the control and Atp7b-/- mice, and their viability was compared in the presence of increasing concentration of DDP. Although in the absence of DDP the Atp7b-/- hepatocytes are generally less viable (as evidenced by the lower yield of cells during primary culture preparation), they showed higher resistance to cisplatin (EC50 = 135.2 μm) compared with control (EC50 = 57.8 μm) (Fig. 2). These results suggested that, in hepatocytes, ATP7B-mediated efflux did not play a majo"
https://openalex.org/W2058420026,"Natural selection should favour the ability of mothers to adjust the sex ratio of offspring in relation to the offspring's potential reproductive success. In polygynous species, mothers in good condition would be advantaged by giving birth to more sons. While studies on mammals in general provide support for the hypothesis, studies on humans provide particularly inconsistent results, possibly because the assumptions of the model do not apply.Here, we take a subset of humans in very good condition: the Forbe's billionaire list. First, we test if the assumptions of the model apply, and show that mothers leave more grandchildren through their sons than through their daughters. We then show that billionaires have 60% sons, which is significantly different from the general population, consistent with our hypothesis. However, women who themselves are billionaires have fewer sons than women having children with billionaires, suggesting that maternal testosterone does not explain the observed variation. Furthermore, paternal masculinity as indexed by achievement, could not explain the variation, since there was no variation in sex ratio between self-made or inherited billionaires.Humans in the highest economic bracket leave more grandchildren through sons than through daughters. Therefore, adaptive variation in sex ratios is expected, and human mothers in the highest economic bracket do give birth to more sons, suggesting similar sex ratio manipulation as seen in other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2115012992,"Background Adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) is often considered in the treatment of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC). We explored the recollections of thyroid cancer survivors on the diagnosis of WDTC, adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, and decision-making related to RAI treatment. Participants provided recommendations for healthcare providers on counseling future patients on adjuvant RAI treatment. Methods We conducted three focus group sessions, including WDTC survivors recruited from two Canadian academic hospitals. Participants had a prior history of WDTC that was completely resected at primary surgery and had been offered adjuvant RAI treatment. Open-ended questions were used to generate discussion in the groups. Saturation of major themes was achieved among the groups. Findings There were 16 participants in the study, twelve of whom were women (75%). All but one participant had received RAI treatment (94%). Participants reported that a thyroid cancer diagnosis was life-changing, resulting in feelings of fear and uncertainty. Some participants felt dismissed as not having a serious disease. Some participants reported receiving conflicting messages from healthcare providers on the appropriateness of adjuvant RAI treatment or insufficient information. If RAI-related side effects occurred, their presence was not legitimized by some healthcare providers. Conclusions The diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer significantly impacts the lives of survivors. Fear and uncertainty related to a cancer diagnosis, feelings of the diagnosis being dismissed as not serious, conflicting messages about adjuvant RAI treatment, and treatment-related side effects, have been raised as important concerns by thyroid cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2069563113,"Background The anti-inflammatory capacity of heat shock proteins (HSP) has been demonstrated in various animal models of inflammatory diseases and in patients. However, the mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory capacity are poorly understood. Therefore, the possible protective potential of HSP70 and its mechanisms were studied in proteoglycan (PG) induced arthritis (PGIA), a chronic and relapsing, T cell mediated murine model of arthritis. Methodology/Principal Findings HSP70 immunization, 10 days prior to disease induction with PG, inhibited arthritis both clinically and histologically. In addition, it significantly reduced PG-specific IgG2a but not IgG1 antibody production. Furthermore, IFN-γ and IL-10 production upon in vitro restimulation with HSP70 was indicative of the induction of an HSP70-specific T cell response in HSP70 immunized mice. Remarkably, HSP70 treatment also modulated the PG-specific T cell response, as shown by the increased production of IL-10 and IFN-γ upon in vitro PG restimulation. Moreover, it increased IL-10 mRNA expression in CD4+CD25+ cells. HSP70 vaccination did not suppress arthritis in IL-10−/− mice, indicating the crucial role of IL-10 in the protective effect. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, a single mycobacterial HSP70 immunization can suppress inflammation and tissue damage in PGIA and results in an enhanced regulatory response as shown by the antigen-specific IL-10 production. Moreover, HSP70 induced protection is critically IL-10 dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2022599869,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, regulating gene expression of enzymes and transporters involved in xenobiotic/drug metabolism. Here, we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is required for the transcriptional activity of PXR. PRMT1 regulates expression of numerous genes, including nuclear receptor-regulated transcription, through methylating histone and non-histone proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation and histone methyltransferase assays revealed that PRMT1 is a major histone methyltransferase associated with PXR. The PXR ligand-binding domain is responsible for PXR-PRMT1 interaction as determined by mammalian two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that PRMT1 was recruited to the regulatory region of the PXR target gene cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with a concomitant methylation of arginine 3 of histone H4, in response to the PXR agonist rifampicin. In mammalian cells, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and gene deletion of PRMT1 greatly diminished the transcriptional activity of PXR, suggesting an indispensable role of PRMT1 in PXR-regulated gene expression. Interestingly, PXR appears to have a reciprocal effect on the PRMT1 functions by regulating its cellular compartmentalization as well as its substrate specificity. Taken together, these results demonstrated mutual interactions and functional interplays between PXR and PRMT1, and this interaction may be important for the epigenetics of PXR-regulated gene expression.

Willson T.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These physiological functions of PXR are achieved through coordinating transcriptional regulation of Phase I and Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes as well as the “Phase III” transporters (2Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 649-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The structural flexibility in the ligand binding pocket enables PXR to function as a xenobiotic receptor through interacting with a wide range of structurally diverse compounds (3Watkins R.E. Wisely G.B. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Lambert M.H. Williams S.P. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Redinbo M.R. Science. 2001; 292: 2329-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Xeno- and endobiotics that activate PXR include a variety of prescription and nonprescription drugs, herbal medicines, environmental toxicants, and bile acids (4Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of PXR is not only regulated by ligands, but also by various signal transduction pathways including NF-κB-regulated inflammatory pathway (5Gu X. Ke S. Liu D. Sheng T.

We have shown that the transcriptional activity of PXR is negatively regulated by NF-κB (5Gu X. Ke S. Liu D. Sheng T. Thomas P.E. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. Xie W. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17882-17889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowl diseases and colon cancer (6Xie W. Tian Y. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 177-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications on the N termini of histones have been shown to play critical roles in gene regulation including the regulation of transcriptional activity by nuclear receptors. These modifications include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (7Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). It is believed that the combination of modifications of the chromatin-associated histone and non-histone proteins, and the interplays between these modifications create a marking system (“histone code”), which is part of the epigenetic mechanisms for gene regulation (8Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). The protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) including PRMT1, PRMT2, and PRMT4 (CARM1) were shown to be nuclear receptor coactivators (9Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T.

These enzymes regulate gene expression through methylating histone and non-histone proteins, and the methylation marks are important for the nuclear/steroid receptor-mediated transcriptional activity. PRMT1 is a major arginine methyltransferase which methylates H4R3 and H2AR3. Recent evidence suggests that histone modification by PRMT1 set the stage for subsequent histone modifications (13Huang S. Litt M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and there is an intricate interplay between H4R3 methylation and other histone modifications. For example, arginine methylation (H4R3) by PRMT1 facilitates H4 acetylation but H4 acetylation inhibits methylation of H4R3 (14Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that histone modifications during transcription proceed in a unidirectional sequence and to complete a transcription cycle, methylated H4R3 has to be demethylated, followed by acetylation and then deacetylation or replacement (15Tian Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 77: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of these histone modification enzymes in nuclear receptor-regulated gene expression will help us understand the epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation and provide important basis for drug/therapeutic designs to effectively intervene in pathological processes such as tumorigenesis and inflammatory responses. In this study, we identified PRMT1 to be a major HMT associated with PXR, and we demonstrated that PRMT1 is a required histone methyltransferase for PXR transcriptional activity. PRMT1 regulates PXR transcriptional activity by direct association with PXR in a ligand-dependent manner, and PXR agonist rifampicin caused recruitment of PRMT1 to the regulatory region of PXR target gene CYP3A4. Knockdown of PRMT1 through siRNA or gene deletion inhibited PXR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we found that PXR plays a critical role in regulating PRMT1 cellular compartmentalization and substrate preference.

DNA sequences coding different PXR fragments were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). pACT, pBIND, and pG5-luc were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) for the mammalian two-hybrid assay. pBIND-PXR (Gal4-PXR) and pACT-PRMT1 (VP16-PRMT1) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified human PXR DNA sequence into pBIND vector and PCR-amplified PRMT1 DNA sequence into pACT vector following the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). Co-immunoprecipitation-PXR-HepG2 cells were washed with PBS and homogenized in the Co-IP lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added before use.

After centrifugation (12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min), supernatant fractions were collected and incubated with antibodies and GammaBind Plus-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Corresponding isotype IgG was used as a negative control. The beads were washed three times, and the precipitated protein complexes were analyzed with HMT assay or Western blot. Histone Methyltransferase Assay and Peptide Sequencing Analysis-The PRMT1 (Upstate) HMT assay was based on the manufacturer’s recommendation. In brief, 2 μg of core histones, 2 μg of H4, or 0.4 μg of H4 N-terminal peptides were incubated with the immunoprecipitated HMT complexes or recombinant PRMT1 at 30 °C for 90 min, in 1× HMT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]SAM) as the methyl donor. The reaction mix was separated in 16% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for autoradiography and staining with Ponceau BS red dye (Sigma). The radioactive proteins identified by autoradiography were excised from the membrane for N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. The radioactivity in the Edman degradation fractions corresponding to amino acid residues was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

After over 4 h of blocking in 5% milk with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), the blot was incubated with appropriate primary antibodies at 37 °C overnight. After washing with TBST buffer for 30 min, the membrane was then subjected to 1:2000 corresponding alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h. After another wash with TBST for 30 min, the membrane was exposed to Nitro Blue tetrazolium/BCIP as the substrate (Promega). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay-Cells were seeded in 12-well plates. When growth reached 50% confluence, cells were transfected with plasmid DNA for 12 h using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen).

CV-1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transient transfected with pBIND-PXR, pACT-PRMT1, and pG5-luc. 12 h after transfection, cells were treated with rifampicin (10 μm, 48 h), and luciferase activity was determined with Polarstar optima luminometer (BMG Laboratory). GST Pull-down Assay-The GST pull-down assay was performed as described (18Tian Y. Ke S. Chen M. Sheng T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44041-44048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled full-length PRMT1 protein was generated with a TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) using the SP6 promoter-driven cDNA plasmid as the template. PCR-generated PXR cDNA fragments were inserted in-frame into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21), and fusion polypeptides were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Twenty micrograms of each fusion polypeptide (estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin in an SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie Blue staining) was incubated with 20 μl of radiolabeled PRMT1 in a total volume of 200 μl of binding reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm KCl) for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were washed three times with the same buffer without bovine serum albumin. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The signals were detected by autoradiography. The input control was 2 μl of the radioactive PRMT1. Small Interference RNA-Two small interfering RNA-expressing plasmids were constructed by cloning the sequences targeting PRMT1 at coding region sequences 756–773 (19Robin-Lespinasse Y. Sentis S.

The targeting plasmids were created by inserting 5′-GATCCGATCCACTGGTGGGAGAACTTCAAGAGAGTTCTCCCACCAGTGGATTTTTTTGGAAAAGCT-3′ (siPRMT1–28) and 5′-GATCCGCTCCATGTTTCATAACCGGTTCAAGAGACCGGTTATGAAACATGGAGTTTTTTGGAAAAGCT-3′ (siPRMT1–11). The siRNA plasmids and the scramble siRNA control were co-transfected with PXR-directed reporter plasmid pGL3-3A4-Luc (5Gu X. Ke S. Liu D. Sheng T. Thomas P.E. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. Xie W. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17882-17889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) into PXR-HepG2 cells. The transfected cells were treated with rifampicin (10 μm, 48 h). Luciferase activity and PRMT1 protein expression were determined with luminometry and Western blotting, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol from Upstate, using the ChIP assay kit with modifications. Briefly, PXR-HepG2 cells were treated with rifampicin (10 μm, 2 h) and DMSO (vehicle control). Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and then the reaction was stopped by incubating in glycine with a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and harvested by scraping with cell scraper. Then the cells were lysed in the SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) on ice for 10 min. The samples were sonicated into DNA fragments of 0.2–1 kb (checked by agarose gel electrophoresis/ethidium bromide staining) and microcentrifuged at maximal speed for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by rotating with 60 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/protein-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C and then aliquoted after centrifugation. 20 μl was saved as input and 200 μl (equal to one-fifth the amount of cells from one 100% confluent 15-cm dish) was used for each antibody. Each 200-μl supernatant was diluted with 800 μl of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and incubated with the specific antibody (1 μg/sample) at 4 °C overnight. A mock precipitation without antibody was used as negative control. The next day, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-agarose slurry was added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C for another 2–4 h. The beads were then washed for 3–5 min with 1 ml of each buffers listed: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGE-PAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid (sodium salt), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). After all washes, pellets were suspended by vertex with 150 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min, and then supernatant was collected. This elution progress was repeated once again, and in total 300-μl elutes were collected. The one-tenth input was diluted with dilution buffer to a total volume of 300 μl. Elutes and diluted inputs were incubated in 0.3 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking. Then 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 20 μg of proteinase K were added to the sample and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then incubated with 10 μg of glycogen in 75% ethanol at -20 °C overnight. After precipitation by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the recovered DNA pellets were dissolved in 30 μl of distilled water. The DNA target in the sample was determined by real-time quantitative PCR in triplicates with a 1-μl sample. Three independent experiments were performed. Amplifications were performed in the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR primers used were: forward primer, 5′-GTCCCAATTAAAGGTCATAAAGC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CTTGAACCGACATGATTTCAAG-3′. Statistical Analysis-Statistical evaluations were conducted using two-tailed t test with triplicates for each treatment. A p value of less than 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant. Data are the means ± S.D. of three independent results. Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Cells were seeded in chamber slides and kept in standard cell culture condition. For microscopy, the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. After three washes, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After another three washes, cells were blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS/Tween (0.1% Tween20 in PBS) at room temperature for 3 h. Primary antibodies (mouse anti-PXR antibody with a dilution of 1:100, rabbit anti-PRMT1 antibody with a dilution of 1:500) in the blocking buffer were incubated with cells at 4 °C overnight. The corresponding isotype IgG was used as negative control. After washing with PBS/Tween for three times, cells were incubated with anti-mouse red-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 568 or anti-rabbit green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 dyes (Invitrogen) in the PBS/Tween for another 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed for three times and DAPI (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA) was added. The results were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX71) equipped with Olympus DP70 digital camera. Association of PRMT1 with PXR in HepG2 Cells-Histone methyltransferases have been demonstrated to be transcriptional regulators for nuclear receptors. To analyze PXR-associated histone methyltransferase(s) (HMT), we created a cell line (PXR-HepG2), by stable transfection of FLAG-tagged human PXR into HepG2 cells, which lack PXR (5Gu X. Ke S. Liu D. Sheng T. Thomas P.E. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. Xie W. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17882-17889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The HMT(s) associated with rifampicin-activated PXR were detected by co-immunoprecipitation followed by histone methyltransferase assay with core histones as the substrates and radiolabeled S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([H3]SAM) as the methyl donor. Methylated histones were detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1A, the methyltransferase activity was associated with FLAG-tagged PXR in the precipitated complex and the precipitated HMT(s) methylated both histones H4 and H2A. To identify the amino acid residue(s) methylated by PXR-associated HMT(s), the methylated H4 was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. As shown in Fig. 1B, arginine 3 (H4R3) was the only methylated residue among the 23 N-terminal amino acids analyzed. PRMT1 has been demonstrated to be the predominant enzyme responsible for this site-specific methylation (20Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7723-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). H2A shares the same N-terminal “SGRGK” sequence motif with H4, therefore it was also methylated by PRMT1 (Fig. 1A, left lane). PRMT5 is another enzyme that has been shown to methylate H4R3 in this SGRGK motif (21Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Methods. 2003; 31: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, PRMT5 is also known to methylate histone H3 (22Pal S. Vishwanath S.N. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sif S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9630-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, we found that major HMT associated with PXR-methylated H2A and H4, but not H3. It has been reported that acetylation of H4 inhibits methylation of H4R3 by recombinant PRMT1 (14Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The pre-acetylation on H4K5, K8, K12, or K16 inhibits the methylation at similar level (14Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, the pre-acetylation on K12 significantly inhibits the methylation of H4R3 by the PXR-associated complex while pre-acetylation on the other lysines was less effective in the inhibition (Fig. 1D). The recombinant PRMT1 showed the same substrate methylation preference regardless the acetylation status of the test peptide. These results suggested that the substrate specificity of PRMT1 can be regulated when it is in association with PXR. Ligand-dependent Physical and Functional Interaction between PRMT1 and PXR-To analyze the effects of PXR ligand on the interaction between the receptor and PRMT1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay with the protein extracts of PXR-HepG2 cells treated with the PXR ligand rifampicin. The complexes precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody were eluted with FLAG tag and analyzed by Western blotting. PRMT1 was found to associate with PXR in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To further analyze the interaction between PXR and PRMT1 in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay with liver tissues from VP16-hPXR transgenic mice. In these mice, the mouse PXR has been replaced with human PXR, which has been fused with VP16 activation domain, resulting in constitutively active PXR in these animals (16Xie W. Barwick J.L. Downes M. Blumberg B. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Brunt E.M. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). PRMT1 was found to specifically associate with PXR as determined by co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). To further analyze the ligand-dependent PXR-PRMT1 interaction, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assay in CV-1 cells. Consistent with the ligand-dependent interaction in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1A), transient transfection of VP16-PRMT1 significantly enhanced the Gal4-PXR-driven luciferase expression upon PXR ligand rifampicin treatment (Fig. 2C). To identify and characterize the interactive domains of PXR responsible for association with PRMT1, we performed GST pull-down assay using GST fusion peptides containing various domains of PXR (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2D, only the PXR fragment, which contains the hinge domain and the ligand binding domain, interacted with PRMT1. However, the hinge domain alone showed no interaction. Taken together, these results indicated that PRMT1 specifically associated with PXR ligand-binding domain, which is consistent with the ligand-dependent interaction manner. The PXR interaction appears to be PRMT1-specific. PRMT5 failed to interact with GST-PXR fusion peptides in the pull-down assay (data not shown). Requirement of PRMT1 for the Transcriptional Activity of PXR-The PRMT1-null mutation is embryonic lethal in homozygous mice. However, mouse embryonic stem cells survived without PRMT1 (23Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We utilized these PRMT1 knock out mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) to analyze the role of PRMT1 in regulating PXR transcriptional activity in vivo. Gal4-mPXR (mouse PXR) and Gal4-responsive tk-UAS-luciferase reporter plasmids were co-transfected into the PRMT1-deficient and wild-type mouse ES cells. In the wild-type ES cells, mouse PXR agonist pregnenolone-16-α-carbonitrile (PCN) induced the PXR-driven luciferase reporter gene, whereas in the PRMT1(-/-) ES cells, PCN was not effective in the induction (Fig. 3A). To test the effect of PRMT1 on PXR transactivation in human cells, we performed PRMT1 knockdown experiment in PXR-HepG2 cells with small interference RNA (siRNA). The DNA fragment, which encoded a 21-bp hairpin siRNA targeting at PRMT1 nucleotides 756–773 (19Robin-Lespinasse Y. Sentis S. Kolytcheff C. Rostan M.C. Corbo L. Le Romancer M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pSilencer vector (Ambion). When this siRNA-expressing plasmid was transfected into the PXR-HepG2 cells, the PXR ligand-dependent activation of CYP3A4-luciferase reporter gene activity was dramatically inhibited (Fig. 3B). A similar result was obtained with another siRNA, which targets at PRMT1 nucleotides 353–371 (Fig. 3C, upper panel). The decreased PRMT1 protein expression in siRNA-transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Recruitment of PRMT1 to the Regulatory Regions of PXR Target Gene CYP3A4-PXR was identified to be the major transcription factor regulating CYP3A4 through binding to the xenobiotic response enhancer module (XREM) about 8-kb upstream of the transcriptional starting site (24Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The above results of physical and functional interactions between PXR and PRMT1 led us to hypothesize that PRMT1 is recruited to this regulatory region of CYP3A4 in response to PXR ligand stimulation. PXR-HepG2 cells were used in a ChIP assay to analyze the recruitment of PXR and PRMT1 as well as changes of histone modifications on the CYP3A4 regulatory region. Our results indicated that activation of PXR by rifampicin resulted in recruitment of PXR to the regulatory region of CYP3A4 as well as increasing of histone H4 acetylation which is indicative of transcriptional activation of the gene. Concomitantly, PRMT1 was also recruited to this CYP3A4 regulatory region in response to rifampicin treatment with increases in H4R3 methylation (Fig. 4). Regulation of PRMT1 Subcellular Localization by PXR-Results from the co-immunoprecipitation/HMT assay indicated that PXR regulates PRMT1 substrate specificity (Fig. 1D). Because PXR and PRMT1 interacted physically and functionally, it is possible that PXR may influence the cellular distribution of PRMT1. To test this possibility, we examined the subcellular localization of PRMT1 in cells with or without PXR. Interestingly, in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 which lacks PXR, PRMT1 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm region. However, in PXR-HepG2 cells where PXR is restored, PRMT1 was largely localized in the nucleus. The similar effects of PXR on PRMT1 were also observed in the human intestinal epithelial tumor cell line HT29, which also lacks PXR. In these cells, PRMT1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Upon restoration of PXR expression by stable transfection, PRMT1 became localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PXR plays an important role in regulating the nuclear compartmentalization of PRMT1, which may affect the activity of PRMT1. PRMT1, which methylates arginine 3 of histone H4 (H4R3), is a major arginine methyltransferase in mammalian cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that PRMT1 plays a vital role in physiological and pathophysiological processes including development, nuclear receptor-regulated gene expression, and oncogenesis (12Rizzo G. Renga B. Antonelli E. Passeri D. Pellicciari R. Fiorucci S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Barrero M.J. Malik S. Mol.

Acta. 2005; 1723: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mouse homozygous null mutant of PRMT1 is early embryonic lethal, attesting to the vital function of PRMT1 in the development and survival of the whole organism (23Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition to modifying histones, PRMT1 has also been found to methylate non-histone proteins involved in DNA repair (28Dery U. Coulombe Y. Rodrigue A. Stasiak A. Richard S. Masson J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3058-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), DNA methylation (29Tan C.P. Nakielny S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7224-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), translational control, and maintenance of heterochromatic and euchromatic barrier (30Huang S. Li X. Yusufzai T.M. Qiu Y. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7991-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that PRMT1 regulates many aspects of gene expression. At the molecular level, intricate interplays between PRMT1 and other histone modification enzymes have been found. For example, methylation of H4R3 by PRMT1 promotes acetylation of histone H4, which leads to gene activation; however, acetylations of histone H4 inhibits H4R3 methylation (14Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), suggesting a unidirectional relay of histone marking processes in a transcription cycle (15Tian Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 77: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we propose that by direct interaction with PRMT1, nuclear receptors such as PXR initiate target gene transcription by recruiting PRMT1 to the regulatory region to accomplish the step of creating methyl marks on the chromatin. In this study, we provide strong evidence indicating that PRMT1 is a major histone methyltransferase associated with PXR and plays an indispensable role in the transcriptional activity of PXR. We used an unbiased biochemical approach with FLAG-tagged PXR to precipitate the PXR-associated histone methyltransferases in HepG2 cells. In our Co-IP/methyltransferase assay with core histones H3, H2A, H2B, and H4 as substrates, H2A and H4 were methylated by the PXR-associated HMTs. We sequenced the N-terminal 23 amino acids of methylated H4 and found that H4R3 was the major methylated residue. The methylated H2A was most likely due to the common “SGRGK” motif shared by these peptides (Fig. 1C). The results of Co-IP in both mouse liver tissue and PXR-transfected HepG2 cells indicated that PXR interacts with PRMT1. GST pull-down assay strongly suggested that the direct interaction between PXR and PRMT1 is through the PXR ligand binding domain. As indicated by the ChIP assay results, this direct interaction may play a role in recruitment of PRMT1 to the CYP3A4 regulatory region, where it promotes transcription through methylation and acetylation of chromatin as demonstrated here (Fig. 4). Another possibility is that by direct contact, PRMT1 methylates PXR and thus modifies its transactivity. For example, HNF-4α is methylated by PRMT1 and thus changes its activity of target gene regulation (25Barrero M.J. Malik S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 233-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have tested this possibility by performing PRMT1 methyltransferase assay with GST-PXR as the substrate. In this assay, PRMT1 did not methylate the GST-PXR fusion peptide (data not shown). The important role of PRMT1 in the transcriptional activity of PXR was further confirmed using two approaches: 1) knockdown of PRMT1 expression by PRMT1-specific siRNA drastically inhibited the PXR-regulated luciferase reporter gene activity, and 2) in PRMT1(-/-) cells PXR transcriptional activity was not detectable, suggesting an indispensable function of PRMT1 for the PXR-regulated gene expression. Interestingly, our results indicate that PXR also regulates functions of PRMT1 in at least two aspects. 1) PXR regulates the PRMT1 substrate specificity. In comparison with the recombinant PRMT1, the PXR-associated PRMT1 demonstrated preference for certain pre-acetylated H4 peptides; whereas preacetylation of H4K12 is inhibitory to methylation of H4R3 by PRMT1 (Fig. 1D), acetylation of H4K5, H4K8, and H4K16 has no effect on the H4R3 methylation. 2) The presence of PXR has a significant effect on the cellular compartmentalization of PRMT1. In normal human hepatocytes that express PXR, PRMT1 is mostly localized in the nucleus (data not shown); however, in HepG2 cells that lack PXR, PRMT1 is localized mostly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). Stable transfection of PXR restores the PXR responses (5Gu X. Ke S. Liu D. Sheng T. Thomas P.E. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. Xie W. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17882-17889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and PRMT1 is localized in the nucleus as demonstrated in this study (Fig. 5), suggesting PXR plays an important role in PRMT1 nuclear translocation. However, possibility cannot be completely eliminated that this phenomenon is unique to hepatocytes, and PXR overexpression causes PRMT1 nuclear translocation. To further analyze the role of PXR in PRMT1 nuclear translocation, we extend this observation to another cell line. We transfected PXR into colon epithelium cell line HT29, which lost endogenous PXR (Fig. 5). Similar to HepG2 cells, PRMT1 also translocated from cytoplasmic region into nucleus with PXR expression, lending addition support to the role of PXR in PRMT1 nuclear localization (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that interaction between PXR and PRMT1 is reciprocal and not only PRMT1 regulates PXR transcriptional activity, but PXR also regulates the activity of PRMT1 through controlling its cellular compartmentalization in addition to substrate preferences. The effects of PXR on PRMT1 suggest that PXR has a rather general effect on the cellular processes that require PRMT1 and furthermore, function of PXR may go beyond the xenobiotic/drug metabolism to include many aspects of physiological/pathophysiological processes which require PRMT1."
https://openalex.org/W2088948163,"ACK1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase implicated in trafficking through binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and clathrin. Here, we have identified a new ACK1-binding partner, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which binds ACK1 via a conserved PPXY-containing region. We show that this motif also binds Nedd4-related proteins and several other WW domain-containing proteins, including the tumor suppressor oxidoreductase Wwox. In HeLa cells ACK1 colocalizes with Nedd4-2 in clathrin-rich vesicles, requiring this PPXY motif. Nedd4-2 strongly down-regulates ACK1 levels when coexpressed, and this process can be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132. ACK1 degradation via Nedd4 requires their mutual interaction and a functional E3 ligase; it is also driven by ACK1 activity. ACK1 is polyubiquitinated in vivo, and dominant inhibitory Nedd4 blocks endogenous ACK1 turnover in response to acute EGF treatment. Because EGF stimulation activates ACK1 (Galisteo, M., Y., Y., Urena, J., and Schlessinger, J. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 9796-9801), our result suggest that EGF receptor-mediated ACK1 activation allows Nedd4-2 to drive kinase degradation. Thus the interplay between Nedd4-2-related E3 ligases that regulate ACK1 levels and Cbl that modifies EGF receptor impinges on cell receptor dynamics. These processes are particularly pertinent given the report of genomic amplification of the ACK1 locus in metastatic tumors.

ACK2 activity in vivo (but not in vitro) is enhanced by active Cdc42, as assessed by increased tyrosine autophosphorylation (2Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recombinant ACK1 (comprising the kinase domain, SH3 domain, and Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain) can undergo autophosphorylation at Tyr284 in the activation loop, resulting in a modest increase in its activity toward a peptide substrate (4Yokoyama N. Miller W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ACK1 indicate that the kinase adopts an “active” conformation independent of such phosphorylation (5Lougheed J.C. Chen R.H. Mak P. Stout T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44039-44045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although its catalytic activity is very low. In vivo, ACK1 may act as a mediator of EGF 2The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. signals to phosphorylate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dbl and can interact with integrin complexes and modulate cell adhesion (6Kato-Srandkiewicz J.

ACK1 contains an N-terminal tyrosine kinase domain flanked by SH3 and Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domains and a long proline-rich C-terminal region downstream of the clathrin-binding box (see Fig. 1A). The clathrin-binding motif LIDFG drives an interaction thought to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (8Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, the proline-rich region of ACK1 has been shown to contain multiple specific binding sites for SH3 partners including Grb2 and SNX9 (10Lee Y.L. Lim L. Manser E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5040-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SNX9·ACK2·clathrin complex has been invoked as promoting degradation of EGF receptor (11Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although no specific mechanism was suggested. Interestingly ACK belongs to the class of proteins referred to as Hsp90 clients, where the chaperone is required for in vivo kinase activity (12Yang W. Jansen J.M. Lin Q. Canova S. Cerione R.A. Childress C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ACK1 has been found in various proteomic studies as complexed to receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (23Pickart C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). ACK1 only binds to EGFR after ligand stimulation (13Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress C. Yang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Such an interaction can regulate EGFR degradation via its UBA domain binding to the C-terminal domain of ACK1. Further, ACK1 has recently been identified as a gene amplified in a number of human tumors (14van der Horst E.H. Degenhardt Y.Y. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf L. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A different study found that ACK1 stimulated prostate tumorigenesis perhaps by negatively regulating the proapoptotic tumor suppressor, Wwox (15Mahajan N.P. Whang Y.E. Mohler J.L. Earp H.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10514-10523Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified several additional binding partners to ACK1 using a single step affinity purification protocol. Some of these participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including amphiphysin 1/2 and AP2. Based on the clathrin-binding profile of the various ACK1 domains used (including the clathrin-binding domain previously reported (8Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we conclude that these proteins represent direct ACK1 binders. Most interestingly, an E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell expressed and developmentally down-regulated) protein was found to bind to a specific ACK1 PPXY motif close to the clathrin box, which required the WW domain of Nedd4-2. ACK1 and Nedd4-2 colocalized to clathrin-coated vesicles in HeLa cells. A number of other E3 ligases with WW domains have the potential to bind ACK1, indicating ACK1 may be under tight proteolytic regulation. In support of this, ACK1 is down-regulated when coexpressed with Nedd4-2, with ACK1 kinase activity being required for this turnover. In addition, ACK1 can inhibit EGFR ubiquitination without affecting receptor activation and endocytosis. Our results suggest that Nedd4-2 may regulate EGFR activity through its down-regulation of ACK1. Materials-Glutathione-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody was from Transduction Laboratory. Anti-ACK1 (A11 and H172), anti-EGFR and anti-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Anti-AP2 antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents. Anti-FLAG (M2), anti-GST (monoclonal), anti-actin, and anti-Amphiphysin (BIN1) antibodies were from Sigma. Antibody against Nedd4 WW domain was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-mouse or rabbit Alexa 488, 546, and 647 secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture-COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine, minimum essential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum to 80% confluency before transfection. Construction ACK1, Ubiquitin, Nedd4-2 (KIAA0439), and Amphiphysin Constructs-All of the ACK1 constructs (designated with amino acid number in Fig. 1A) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides flanked by BamHI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were then digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned into pXJ GFP-FLAG and pGEX 4T-1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Human ubiquitin was obtained from BamHI/NotI-digested PCR product with primers 5′-CATGGATTCATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAGACT-3′ and 5′-CATGCGGCCGCTCACCCACCTCTGAGACGGAGTAC-3′ in the pXJ-HA vector. Full-length KIAA0439 (Nedd4-2) obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research institute (Japan) was subcloned into pXJ-HA, pXJ-GST, and pXJ-Myc vectors using the HindIII and NotI sites. In Vitro Binding Assay-GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described previously (1Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (∼200 μl; final concentration, ∼2-3 mg/ml). Rat brain lysates (10 mg/ml) were prepared in lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride 5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) were passed through the GST fusion protein-Sepharose column several times. The columns were washed extensively with GST buffer (PBS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100), and the bound proteins were released by 10 mm glutathione in GST buffer. Transfection and Coimmunoprecipitation-Subconfluent COS7, 293, or HeLa cells grown to 80% confluency were transfected with various DNA constructs (1-2 μg) using Lipofectamine reagent (5 μl; Invitrogen) as previously described (16Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiment, 24 or 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysed cell mixture was sonicated for 10 s followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in the microcentrifuge for 20 min. Clarified cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (M2; Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and then loaded onto a yellow tip column. After extensive washing with buffer (PBS containing 2 mm vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 0.1% Triton X-100), the bound proteins were eluted with 2× PAGE sample buffer by boiling for 10 min. Western Blotting and Peptide Scan Blotting-Eluted proteins samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilutions) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000 dilutions) for 1 h at room temperature. The signals were visualized with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For peptide scan overlay assay, cellulose membrane with 13-mer peptides displaced by 4 amino acids, which covers the ACK sequence from residues 621 to 940, was ordered form (Jerini AG). The peptide membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with biotinylated Nedd4-2-WW domains (5 μg/ml) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Overlays with [γ-32P]GTP-labeled Proteins-The WW domain array filter was purchased from Panomics. The GST-Ras fusion proteins (ACK1 517-647) were labeled as follows. The fusion proteins were incubated for 4 min with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP in 50 μl of exchange buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA). This mixture was immediately added to 3 ml of binding and wash buffer (PBS containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 0.1 mm GTP and added to a roller bottle containing the array filter. Following 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the filters were washed (three times for 10 min each time) with binding and wash buffer and exposed to PhosphorImager plates (Molecular Dynamics) for quantification or to x-ray film. Immunofluorescence and Imaging-Transfected HeLa or COS7 cells grown on coverslip were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed with PBS twice for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocking with 10% goat serum, the cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:100 dilution) in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice and incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa 488 or 546; 1:100 or Alexa 647; 1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize nucleus, the cells on coverslips were incubated with fluorescent dye H-33342 for 10 min and then washed with PBS. The cells were mounted and viewed by Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) or Zeiss Axioplan2 linked to a cooled CCD camera (Coolsnap HQ, Roper Scientific) using a 60× oil lens. Images were collected using Lasersharp or MetaVue and processed by Adobe Photoshop. EGF, Cell Adhesion, and Cell Cycle Effect on Endogenous ACK1 Level-For EGF stimulation, COS7 cells were serum-starved overnight before stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the time indicated. For proteasome inhibitor treatment, the cells were pretreated with MG132 (50 μm) for 1 h prior to EGF stimulation. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ACK1 antibody. For cell adhesion, the plastic dish was coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The dish was washed a few times with PBS. COS7 cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS two times, and resuspended in serum-free media. The cells were then plated onto fibronectin-coated dish for 2 h before lysis. For cell cycle effect, a few plates of HeLa cells were treated with 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. Round-up cells were rinsed off the plates and concentrated before lysis. Endocytosis of EGFR to Early Endosomes-ACK1(727-915) was transfected to COS7 cells for 6 h and serum-starved overnight. The cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min before fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then immunostained with appropriate antibodies and visualized with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. H33342 (Sigma) was used for nuclear staining. Small Interfering RNA-mediated Knockdown of ACK1-COS7 cells were treated with control and ACK small interfering RNA (synthesized from Invitrogen) for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction. The ACK1 small interfering RNA sequence was described previously (17Grøvdal L. Johannessen L. Rødland M. Madshus I. Stang E. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Identification of E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Nedd4-2 as a New ACK1-binding Protein from Brain Lysates-Several proteins including clathrin, SH3PX1, and HSP90 have been identified as binding partners of ACK1 (10Lee Y.L. Lim L. Manser E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5040-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Yang W. Jansen J.M. Lin Q. Canova S. Cerione R.A. Childress C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We previously identified a clathrin-binding box in ACK1 (amino acids 570-575) that is similar to those in a number of clathrin-associated proteins (8Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nevertheless we have observed that ACK1 protein lacking this box or ACK1 (amino acids 588-1031) whose sequence lies C-terminal to the clathrin box, also colocalized with clathrin (data not shown). To identify sequences that might represent another “clathrin-associated domain,” we examined the sequences that lie between the clathrin box and the MIG-6 homology domain (proline-rich; Fig. 1A). GST fusion proteins encoding fragments of ACK1 were used as affinity matrices to recover proteins from rat brain lysates. Among the affinity-purified proteins, five were unequivocally identified by tryptic mass fingerprinting: namely clathrin, amphiphysin-1, amphiphysin-2, AP2, and Nedd4-2 (marked on Fig. 1B). Amphiphysin binding is likely mediated by their SH3 domain. These lipid-binding proteins and AP2 participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The identification of these proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). Association of ACK1 with amphiphysin-2 was then confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (supplemental Fig. S1). Nedd4-2 was identified by appropriate molecular mass (and 10 matching peptide fragments, which included peptided sequences from the alternate spliced C2, WW2, and WW4 domains (Fig. 1C). ACK1 Associates with Nedd4-2 in Vivo-Nedd4-2 is a member of a family of related E3 ubiquitin ligases consisting of a C2-like domain, four WW domains, and a HECT ubiquitinligase domain (Fig. 1C). To establish the interaction of Nedd4-2 and ACK1 in vivo, we first immunoprecipitated overexpressed FLAG-tagged ACK1 from COS7 cell lysates, and endogenous Nedd4 proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). Bands corresponding to COS7 Nedd4 isoforms were detected (lane 2). To confirm the presence of an endogenous ACK1·Nedd4-2 complex, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Nedd4 from these cells under three conditions. No ACK1 was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells incubated in serum (Fig. 2B, lane 1), but overnight incubation under serum-free or with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (lanes 2 and 3) allowed us to detect the complex. This suggests the Nedd4·ACK1 complex is less stable in serum because there was no apparent difference in the total level of ACK1, total cell lysate (TCL). Next we examined the ACK1 sequences responsible for interaction with Nedd4-2 using various ACK1 deletion constructs. A small region (amino acids 588-679) was sufficient to bind Nedd4-2 (Fig. 2C, lane 4). With full-length ACK1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2) there is much less soluble ACK1 protein recovered from the lysates and coexpression of Nedd4-2 reduces ACK1 levels (discussed later) and thus the apparently weaker interaction. By contrast the smaller ACK1(588-679) bound robustly to a region encompassing the four WW domains of Nedd4-2 (Fig. 2D, lane 2). WW domains can interact with proline-rich targets including the prototype PPXY motif such as those found in sodium channels (18Lott J.S. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Teesdale-Spittle P.H. Mc-Donald F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ACK1 contains a PPXY motif (residues 632-635) that appears to be the unique site for binding for the Nedd4-2 WW domains as assessed by using a peptide scan analysis of the entire ACK1 proline-rich region (Fig. 2E). The membrane array containing 13-mer overlapping synthetic peptides covering ACK1 residues 621-940 was overlaid with biotinylated GST-Nedd4-2 WW1-4 (residues 234-599). Only two adjacent peptides containing the PPXY motif were detected. We note that this Nedd4-binding site is conserved among vertebrate ACK1 orthologues (Fig. 2F) despite low overall identity (<40%) in the C-terminal half of ACK1 (say comparing human and zebra fish versions). Another ACK1 partner Wwox has been described (15Mahajan N.P. Whang Y.E. Mohler J.L. Earp H.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10514-10523Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); likely Wwox binding involves the same PPXY site. To look at WW binding across a spectrum of proteins, we employed recombinant WW domain arrays (Panomics) overlaid with labeled ACK1(517-647). Fig. 3 illustrates the signals generated with these arrays. Src SH3 domain serves as a positive control (strongest signals). These results suggest that Nedd4-2 can bind ACK1 via both WW2 and WW3 domains. A majority of targets are WW domains from Nedd4-related E3 ligases (boxed), whereas the only other binders were BAG3, Wwox, and MAGI-3 with a single WW domain. Thus E3 and non-E3 ligases may compete for ACK1 binding. BAG3 is of interest because inhibition of BAG3 can lead to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Hsp90 client proteins (19Doong H. Rizzo K. Fang S. Kulpa V. Weissman A.M. Kohn E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28490-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and ACK1 itself is such a client protein (12Yang W. Jansen J.M. Lin Q. Canova S. Cerione R.A. Childress C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 Colocalizes to Clathrin-containing Vesicles in the Presence of ACK1-Nedd4 is a cytoplasmic protein in human cultured cells (20Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was important to establish whether full-length ACK1 colocalizes with Nedd4-2 in vivo. Nedd4-2 coexpressed with ACK1 in HeLa colocalized in puncta, indicating that these proteins bind in vivo (Fig. 4A, panels a-c). Further the Nedd4-2 puncta (without ACK1) only rarely (∼10%) contained clathrin (Fig. 4, B, panels a-c, insets, and C). However when ACK1 and Nedd4-2 were cotransfected, essentially all of the Nedd4-2 was associated with ACK1-associated clathrin-containing vesicles (Fig. 4, A, panels a-c; B, panels d--f, arrowheads; and C). To test the role of the PPXY motif, full-length ACK1 with or without the PPXY motif were tested (Fig. 4A, panels d-i). The redistribution of Nedd4-2 to ACK1-enriched vesicles could be driven by ACK1(588-679), containing the PPXY motif and clathrin-binding region (Fig. 4A, panels h-i) but not when the PPXY was deleted (Fig. 4A, panels d-f). These results indicated that full-length ACK1 localizes with Nedd4-2 in vivo and that the PPXY motif in ACK1 mediates their association. Cdc42 may promote tyrosine auto-phosphorylation of ACK in vivo (4Yokoyama N. Miller W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cdc42 can also negatively regulate the interaction of ACK2 with clathrin perhaps through a related mechanism (21Yang W. Lin Q. Zhao J. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43987-43993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined whether the association of ACK1 and Nedd4-2 was influenced by activated Cdc42. We transiently coexpressed ACK1 and Nedd4-2 with wild type Cdc42, active Cdc42V12 or dominant inhibitory Cdc42N17. 1The colocalization of ACK1 and Nedd4-2 in puncta remained similar to those in Fig. 4A (panels a-c) in the presence of Cdc42WT (supplemental Fig. S2). These punctate structures were larger when active Cdc42 was present and much smaller with Cdc42N17 (supplemental Fig. S2). We conclude that although Cdc42·GTP influences the morphology of the ACK1-associated structures, Nedd4-2 binds to ACK1 independent of Cdc42. Nedd4-2 Promotes ACK1 Turnover-In our immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4), we often found that coexpression of ACK1 with GST-Nedd4 strongly reduced ACK1 levels across the field versus expressing the kinase alone. This suggested that Nedd4-2 down-regulates ACK1 levels. FLAG-tagged ACK1 and GST-tagged Nedd4-2 were cotransfected into COS7 cells (with or without the cofactor ubiquitin), and the total ACK1 level was assessed 48 h after transfection. FLAG-ACK1 levels were dramatically reduced with GST-tagged Nedd4-2 (Fig. 5A, top panel, lanes 2 and 4), even after 4 h of treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (second panel). Overnight treatment with MG132 could protect ACK1 levels (Fig. 5A, third panel). Overexpression of ubiquitin alone did not alter levels of ACK1 (lane 3, top panel). The effect of Nedd4-2 was not seen with another nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FAK (Fig. 5A, fourth panel). We also noted that Myc-tagged Nedd4-2 affected ACK1 turnover less than GST-tagged Nedd4-2 (supplemental Fig. S3), which is likely related to the dimeric nature of GST fusion proteins. To test whether Nedd4-2 affects endogenous ACK1 turnover, we overexpressed wild type GST-Nedd4-2 and a mutant that is deficient in ligase activity (C/S mutant in ligase domain). Our results indicate the ligase-deficient Nedd4-2 can block this turnover (Fig. 5B) and conclude that Nedd4-like E3 ligases target ACK1 for degradation. To look at the kinetics of ACK1 turnover, we introduced expression plasmids encoding FLAG-ACK1 with and without Nedd4-2 C/S and used cycloheximide to then block protein synthesis after 4 h as shown in Fig. 5C. The ACK1 levels declined over 2 h following cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5C, lane 3), an effect that could be blocked by the Nedd4-2C/S mutant (Fig. 5C, lanes 5-8). ACK1 Turnover Depends on Binding to Nedd4, a Functional Nedd4 Ligase Activity and ACK1 Activity-We then examined whether the Nedd4-2 effect on ACK1 turnover required their direct association. The Nedd4-2 binding-deficient mutant ACK1ΔPPAY was unaffected, unlike wild type ACK1 (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 2 and 5, top panel), indicating that binding is required for such turnover. Similarly Nedd4-2C/S can bind ACK1 but does not promote turnover (compare lanes 2 and 3). However, Nedd4-2 (Fig. 5E, lane 5 and 6, top panel). Our results indicate that kinase activity of ACK1 is required for ACK1 turnover in vivo. ACK1 Ubiquitination and the Role of Its UBA Domains-ACK1 degradation on its association with Nedd4-2 suggested that this E3 ligase mediates ACK1 ubiquitination. Not surprisingly, coexpression with HA-tagged ubiquitin resulted in its incorporation into ACK1 when the proteasome was inhibited (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Additional Nedd4-2 did not increase ACK1 ubiquitination, indicating that endogenous E3 ligase can efficiently drive this process. ACK1 contains two UBA domains of ∼40 residues (within residues 955-1031) that occur among diverse proteins linked to ubiquitination (22Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The smaller ∼70-kDa TNK1 kinase, (Thirty-eight Negative kinase 1), the only other member of the ACK1 family, also contains two such related UBA domains at the C terminus although lacking all other protein interactions domains described here (data not shown). We examined the effect of deleting both UBAs (Fig. 6A, ΔC) on ACK1 ubiquitination: comparing lane 2 versus lane 5, it is clear deleting these two domains elevates ACK1 levels considerably; the presence of the UBA domains clearly promotes ACK1 ubiquitination (13Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress C. Yang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nedd4 can nonetheless increase ubiquitination of ACK1ΔC (Fig. 6A, lane 6, top panel). To check whether ACK1 is mono- or polyubiquitinated, we used an ubiquitin mutant with lysine-to-arginine substitutions at three major sites for chain branching (Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63 (23Pickart C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)). This ubiquitin mutant was poorly incorporated (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that ACK1 is polyubiquitinated as previously suggested (13Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress"
https://openalex.org/W2102954693,"The Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) flourished in Central Asian riverine forest systems in a range disjunct from that of other tigers, but was driven to extinction in 1970 prior to a modern molecular evaluation. For over a century naturalists puzzled over the taxonomic validity, placement, and biogeographic origin of this enigmatic animal. Using ancient-DNA (aDNA) methodology, we generated composite mtDNA haplotypes from twenty wild Caspian tigers from throughout their historic range sampled from museum collections. We found that Caspian tigers carry a major mtDNA haplotype differing by only a single nucleotide from the monomorphic haplotype found across all contemporary Amur tigers (P. t. altaica). Phylogeographic analysis with extant tiger subspecies suggests that less than 10,000 years ago the Caspian/Amur tiger ancestor colonized Central Asia via the Gansu Corridor (Silk Road) from eastern China then subsequently traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Amur tiger in the Russian Far East. The conservation implications of these findings are far reaching, as the observed genetic depletion characteristic of modern Amur tigers likely reflects these founder migrations and therefore predates human influence. Also, due to their evolutionary propinquity, living Amur tigers offer an appropriate genetic source should reintroductions to the former range of the Caspian tiger be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2020731274,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) has been implicated in a variety of nuclear processes including DNA double strand break repair, V(D)J recombination, and transcription. A recent study showed that DNA-PK is responsible for Ser-473 phosphorylation in the hydrophobic motif of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in genotoxic-stressed cells, suggesting a novel role for DNA-PK in cell signaling. Here, we report that DNA-PK activity toward PKB peptides is impaired in DNA-PK knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells when compared with wild type. In addition, human glioblastoma cells expressing a mutant form of DNA-PK (M059J) displayed a lower DNA-PK activity when compared with glioblastoma cells expressing wild-type DNA-PK (M059K) when PKB peptide substrates were tested. DNA-PK preferentially phosphorylated PKB on Ser-473 when compared with its known in vitro substrate, p53. A consensus hydrophobic amino acid surrounding the Ser-473 phospho-acceptor site in PKB containing amino acids Phe at position +1 and +4 and Tyr at position –1 are critical for DNA-PK activity. Thus, these data define the specificity of DNA-PK action as a Ser-473 kinase for PKB in DNA repair signaling.

Amplification of genes encoding PKB isoforms has been found in several types of human cancer (2Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The discovery that PKB activation is dependent on 3-phosphoinositides expanded much of the interest into the role of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in cellular signaling (3Fayard E. Tintignac L.A. Baudry A. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5675-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Both phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, the products of PI3K, bind with high affinity to the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB, thus recruiting the kinase to the plasma membrane (4Frech M.

One well defined regulatory mechanism for PKB activation is phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the activation loop of PKB by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (6Alessi D.R. James S.R.

The unphosphorylated form of PKB is virtually inactive, and PDK1 phosphorylation stimulates its activity by at least 100-fold (6Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Furthermore, phosphorylation on a second regulatory site, Ser-473 at the C terminus, termed the hydrophobic motif, responsible for further 7–10-fold full activation of PKB (10Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of PKB, the role of Ser-473 phosphorylation is important not only for kinase activation but also for stabilization of the active conformation of PKB (11Yang J. Cron P.

Recently, our laboratory showed that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a candidate kinase, responsible for Ser-473 phosphorylation during PKB activation in genotoxic-stressed cells such as HEK293 (13Feng J.

Furthermore, Dragoi et al. (15Dragoi A.M. Fu X. Ivanov S. Zhang P. Sheng L. Wu D. Li G.C. Chu W.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs is an important intermediate in CpG-DNA-triggered PKB signaling pathway. The core protein of the DNA-PK multiprotein complex is represented by the Mr ∼460,000 DNA-PKcs, which, in itself, is a serine/threonine kinase similar to proteins of the PI3K family (16Hartley K.O.

Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), is capable of phosphorylating several protein substrates, including transcription factors replication protein A, p53, c-Jun, HMG1, and RNA helicase A, and is also capable of autophosphorylation (17Meek K.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of DNA-PK in vivo is not well defined, its importance in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and V(D)J recombination events has been clearly demonstrated (18Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 19Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). NHEJ is one of the major pathways for the repair of DNA double strand breaks in human cells. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown that DNA-PK, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and Artemis are essential components of the NHEJ pathway (19Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Jeggo P. O’Neill P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide further evidence that DNA-PK is a bona fide Ser-473 kinase for PKB. We define the specificity of DNA-PK phosphorylation of PKB at the Ser-473 site and show that DNA-PK activity toward peptides containing the Ser-473 consensus site (FSYtide) is impaired in DNA-PK–/– MEFs. Together, these data support that DNA-PK acts upstream of PKB in the DNA repair signaling pathway.

Sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfection-HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. DNA-PK+/+ MEFs, DNA-PK–/– MEFs, and M059K and M059J cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm non-essential amino acid (Invitrogen), and 20 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected with PKB plasmids by a modified calcium phosphate method (24Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 1–2 μg/ml plasmid DNA. Transfection mixtures were removed after 16 h incubation, and cells were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation with 5 μm doxorubicin (Sigma) for the indicated times.

Immune complexes were washed twice with 1 ml of Z′0.05 buffer and were finally resuspended in the same buffer.

All reactions were stopped by adding 50 μm EDTA and processed as described previously (27Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

DNA-PK Effectively Phosphorylates FSYtide When Compared with p53tide in Vitro-DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate two types of consensus sequence: an SQ-motif present in p53, Ku70, SRF, c-Jun, RPA32, H2AX, and DNA-PK itself (17Meek K.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). PKB has a potential non-SQ at its C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Fig. 1A). To analyze the substrate specificity of DNA-PK, we measured the apparent Km and kcat toward short peptides derived from PKB and p53 representing the two types of DNA-PK substrate (Table 1). The synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Ser-473 of PKB (FSYtide; PHFPQFSYSASSTA) with a kcat/Km of 5.4 × 106 m–1 s–1 was a much more efficient DNA-PK substrate than the peptide containing the Ser-15 phosphorylation site of p53 (p53tide; EPPLSQEAFADLWKK) (kcat/Km = 2.9 × 106 m–1 s–1). This result suggests that DNA-PK can phosphorylate PKB on Ser-473 and may potentially play an additional role in PKB signaling.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of peptide phosphorylation by DNA-PKSubstrateKmKcataThe molecular size used was 469 kDa for DNA-PKcs.Kcat/Kmmms-1m-1 s-1FSYtide0.633417.55.4 × 106p53tide2.888368.12.9 × 106a The molecular size used was 469 kDa for DNA-PKcs. Open table in a new tab Molecular Basis for the Substrate Specificity of DNA-PK-Members of the AGC family of protein kinases such as PKB, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK) are activated and phosphorylated by PDK1 (6Alessi D.R.

Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The C-terminal hydrophobic motif of these kinases is well conserved between these PDK1 substrates (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the substrate specificity of DNA-PK, hydrophobic motif peptides from the AGC family were tested as DNA-PK substrates in vitro. Peptides derived from PKB isoforms were preferentially phosphorylated by DNA-PK in this system (Fig. 1B). The PKBβ peptide exhibited the highest apparent activity, but this was likely due to an additional Thr residue in the N terminus of the peptide because the activity of a Thr→ Pro mutant peptide (PKBβ-M) was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that DNA-PK can phosphorylate some AGC family members in the order PKBα > PKBβ/γ ≥ SGK1. These data therefore confirmed that the hydrophobic motif of PKB is specifically phosphorylated on Ser-473 by DNA-PK and suggest that PKBα may be the preferred substrate. To study the influence of amino acid residues adjacent to the minimal consensus phosphorylation site for DNA-PK (FXXFSY), we generated variant Ala-scanning peptides. By comparing the phosphorylation of FSYtide with the variant Ala-scanning peptides, we identified that phenylalanine at position +1 and +4 and tyrosine at position –1 from the phospho-acceptor site were key residues for DNA-PK activity (Fig. 1C). The mutant peptides (F469R, F472R, and Y474R, arrows), where a hydrophobic amino acid (Phe or Tyr) was substituted with a basic amino acid (Arg), showed a significant decrease in DNA-PK activity (Fig. 1C). This effect was reversed when the basic amino acid was resubstituted with a hydrophobic residue (Y474F, Fig. 1C), supporting the requirement for a hydrophobic amino acid in this position. To further evaluate these findings, we extended our analysis to the protein level by overexpression of mutant proteins in cultured cells treated with the DNA damage agent doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor widely used as an anticancer drug. Doxorubicin-induced PKB activation was impaired in cells transfected with F469R, F472R, and Y474R mutants of PKBα in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). These inhibitory effects were reversed by the hydrophobic “re-substitution” mutant (Y474F, Fig. 1D). In addition, immunoblot analysis with anti-pSer-473 antibody revealed that PKB activation correlated well with Ser-473 phosphorylation of PKB, indicating that the hydrophobic motif of PKB plays a key role in determining the substrate specificity of DNA-PK. It was previously shown that PKBα knock-out mice show impaired DNA damage-dependent induction of p21 after single dose whole body irradiation (31Bozulic L. Surucu B. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of the PKB target FoxO4 on Ser-193, which increases in doxyrubicin-treated cells, was abolished in DNA-PK–/– cells (32Surucu B. Bozulic L. Hynx D. Parcellier A. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30025-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, two events (Ser-193 phosphorylation of FoxO4 and p21 protein levels) were monitored in cells expressing PKB mutants following doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21 and phosphorylation of FoxO4 was blocked in PKB-Y474R cells (Fig. 1, E–H). This inhibition was reverted in PKB-Y474F-transfected cells, indicating that PKB is indeed the downstream modulator of DNA-PK in the DNA damage pathway. Interestingly, similar results were obtained from insulin-stimulated cells (data not shown), indicating that insulin-mediated PKB activation also required key amino acids in the hydrophobic motif of PKB. Impairment of Ser-473 Kinase Activity in DNA-PK–/– and DNA-PK-deficient Cells-Recently, we have purified and identified DNA-PK as a candidate Ser-473 kinase for PKB in HEK293 cells (13Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To further characterize this novel mechanism, DNA-PK was immunoprecipitated from DNA-PK+/+ and DNA-PK–/– mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines. These immunoprecipitates were incubated with peptides containing the consensus Ser-473 phosphorylation site (FSYtide), a Ser-473→ Ala mutant peptide (FAYtide), or p53tide in vitro. DNA-stimulated DNA-PK activity toward both the FSY peptide and p53tide was observed in DNA-PK+/+, but not in DNA-PK–/– MEFs, suggesting that DNA-PK is indeed capable of phosphorylating FSYtide and p53tide in a DNA-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1A). In contrast, no activation was observed when peptides containing a mutation in the Ser-473 amino acid (FAYtide) were used. Similar results were also obtained (supplemental Fig. 1B) when these peptides were incubated with DNA-PK immunoprecipitated from human glioblastoma cells containing wild-type, active DNA-PK (M059K) or DNA-PK inactive mutant cells (M059J). These data suggest that DNA-PK acts as a Ser-473 kinase for PKB and requires specific amino acids in the hydrophobic motif for phosphorylation. DNA double strand breaks play a central role in the activation of damage response pathways in cells upon irradiation whereby the PI3K-like kinases, DNA-PK and ATM, function as damage sensors in downstream signaling (19Burma S.

Therefore, it has been suggested that radiation-induced DNA damage will lead to the activation of the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway through DNA-PK and ATM. In the present study, we have characterized the phosphorylation of PKB by DNA-PK, a critical component of DNA double strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. The biochemical kinetics of DNA-PK suggests that PKB is a much more efficient substrate than p53 in vitro (Table 1). Furthermore, the results from in vitro DNA-PK assays with hydrophobic motif peptide substrates from the AGC kinase family (FXXFX(S/T); Fig. 1B) indicated that PKBα is preferentially phosphorylated by DNA-PK. By using DNA-PK assays with variant Ala-scanning peptides of FSYtide, we propose that phenylalanine at position +1 and +4 and tyrosine at position –1 from the phospho-acceptor site are required for DNA-PK activity in proteins. The resubstitution mutant peptide (Y474F) clearly showed the importance of hydrophobic amino acid in this position. Similar data were obtained from cells transfected with full-length PKBα mutants F469R, F472R, and Y474R (Fig. 1, D–H), indicating that the hydrophobic motif of PKB play a key role in defining the substrate specificity of DNA-PK. In DNA-PK–/– MEFs and human glioblastoma cells expressing mutant, inactive DNA-PK, immunoprecipitated DNA-PK activity toward FSYtide (PKB peptide) was impaired when compared with that of control cells expressing wild-type DNA-PK (supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with previous reports (39Li X. Lu Y. Liang K. Liu B. Fan Z. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R589-R597Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Quevedo C. Kaplan D.R. Derry W.B. Curr.

Chem. 2008; 283: 30025-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating that DNA-PK is required Ser-473 phosphorylation and that PKB activation also occurred during DNA repair signaling. We have previously shown that insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473 did not occur through DNA-PK and that γ-irradiation triggered DNA-PK mediated phosphorylation on this residue (32Surucu B. Bozulic L. Hynx D. Parcellier A. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30025-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We now extend these findings to define the amino acids in the hydrophobic motif of PKB required for DNA-PK mediated Ser-473 phosphorylation. We attempted to identify potential activators of DNA-PK that would stimulate PKB phosphorylation of Ser-473. Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is a novel factor that is bound by DNA-PK and stimulates DNA end joining in vitro (41Byrum J. Jordan S. Safrany S.T. Rodgers W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2776-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Ma Y. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10756-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used IP6 to stimulate DNA-PK activity in vitro in the presence/absence of Ku70/Ku86 subunits with FSYtide as substrate. In our hands, dsDNA induced DNA-PK activity toward FSYtide, whereas different concentrations of IP6 failed to activate DNA-PK (data not shown). The DNA end-joining activity of DNA-PK is triggered by binding of IP6 to the Ku subunit, where it induces a conformational change and a corresponding increase in DNA-PK end-joining activity (42Ma Y. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10756-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, this conformational change appears not to be involved in DNA-PK activity toward FSYtide. We also tested charged molecules such as spermine, poly(l-lysine), poly(Glu-Tyr), and heparin, which mimic the negative charge of dsDNA to activate DNA-PK activity. However, none of these molecules activated DNA-PK activity toward FSYtide in the presence of Ku70/Ku86 (data not shown). It has been suggested that DNA-PK activity toward a degenerative non-SQ peptide library can be increased in the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ in vitro (43O’Neill T. Dwyer A.J. Ziv Y. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Abraham R.H. Lai J.H. Hill D. Shiloh Y. Cantley L.C. Rathbun G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, Chan et al. (44Chan D.W. Son S.C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol.

We did not detect significant differences in DNA-PK activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (data not shown). Recent observations from ATM–/– MEFs or ATM–/–, ATR–/– double MEFs (31Bozulic L. Surucu B. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) contrast with the conclusion of Viniegra et al. (45Viniegra J.G. Martinez N. Modirassari P. Losa J.H. Parada Cobo C. Lobo V.J. Luquero C.I. Alvarez-Vallina L. Ramon y Cajal S. Rojas J.M. Sanchez-Prieto R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4029-4036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), who argued that ATM promotes PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473. It should be noted that ATM–/– MEFs in their study were produced from a p53–/– background. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that p53 has an influence on Ser-473 phosphorylation of PKB in ATM–/– cells through DNA-PK in insulin signaling as well as DNA repair signaling (31Bozulic L. Surucu B. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, mTOR and its associated protein Rictor have been shown to phosphorylate PKB on Ser-473 in Drosophila and human cells (14Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5255) Google Scholar, 46Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40406-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been reported that ATR, another member of the PI3K-like kinase, may act as a novel upstream activator of PKB in response to DNA damage induced by O6-guanine methylating agents (47Caporali S. Levati L. Starace G. Ragone G. Bonmassar E. Alvino E. D’Atri S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473 is a complex and important regulatory process in cells and further underscore the key role of PKB activation in many physiological processes. In conclusion, we provide additional evidence for the role of DNA-PK as a Ser-473 kinase for PKB in DNA repair mechanisms and have defined key amino acids in the hydrophobic motif of PKB that control DNA-PK substrate specificity. Further analysis is likely to elucidate the specific role of each putative Ser-473 kinase of PKB under different conditions and in different cellular environments, which will provide a better understanding of the role of PKB in signaling and its potential in therapeutic applications.

These experimental approaches allow one to directly test specific ligands (e.g. Na+, K+, or Mg2+) for their capacity to alter the Ca2+ binding/dissociation in CBD preparations. We found that the CBD1 and CBD2 domains are kinetically distinct Ca2+ sensors capable of sensing the Ca2+ within the time scale of a single cardiac cycle. Kinetically distinct CBD sensors have a capacity to sense local Ca2+ changes in distinct compartments of the cell and thus may serve as a feedback mechanism for distinct regulation of NCX in dyadic cleft, submembrane space, and bulk cytosol.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of CBD Proteins-The DNA constructs of CBD1, CBD2, and CBD12, encoding 371–509, 501– 657, and 371–657 residues of canine NCX1 (Protein Data Bank accession code P23685; AD-splice variant) were cloned into a pET23b vector (generously provided by Dr. M. Hilge) and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3)-competent cells (Novagen) at 37 °C for 5 h by using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction (18Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Grown cells were diluted 1:100 in 2× YT medium and grown again until A595 nm reached 0.4–0.6. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and after a 5-h induction period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g for 10 min) and then were flash-frozen and stored at –70 °C.Thawed cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm CaCl2 with 1 μg/ml DNase I (type DN-25; Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized and disrupted twice in microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). CBD1, CBD2, or CBD12 was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 7 ml of nickel beads (HIS-Select™, nickel affinity gel; Sigma) and washed (7 × 25 ml) with 250 mm Mes, pH 6.3, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (MNG buffer). CBD1, CBD2, and CBD12 were eluted with 2 × 15-ml portions of MNG buffer containing 300 mm imadozole, pH 7.4. Imidazole was removed by washing the protein preparations with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% sodium azide and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (at 4 °C) buffer containing 10 g/liter Chelex-100 (Bio-Red). Dialyzed CBD preparations were washed twice with 0.1–0.2-mm EDTA using Ultracel-3k (Millipore), and EDTA was removed by ultrafiltration. The protein was determined at A280 nm by using ∈ = 3105 m–1 cm–1 for CBD1, ∈ = 5960 m–1 cm–1 for CBD2, and ∈ = 9065 m–1 cm–1 for CBD12. Purified preparations of proteins (>95%, as judged by SDS-PAGE) were stored at –70 °C.45Ca2+/Protein Equilibrium Binding-The 45Ca2+ binding assay was done by using the ultrafiltration procedure (36Ladant D.

To remove Ca2+, all glassware and tubes were washed with 0.1 m HCl, and filters were pretreated with 5% NaHCO3 (38Wingard J.N. Chan J. Bosanac I. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. Ikura M. Ames J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Decalcified buffers (containing 0.9–2.3 μm Ca2+) were prepared by passing them through Chelex-100. All of the 45Ca2+ binding experiments were done with an Ultracel-3k (15-ml sample compartment, 3-kDa cut-off; Millipore Corp.). The assay medium (1 ml), containing 10–40 μm CBD1 or CBD2 in decalcified buffer, was placed into the upper compartment of the Ultracel-3k concentrator. For the binding assay, 1 μl of 5.7 mm 45Ca2+ stock solution (∼3 μCi) was added to the assay medium with protein, carefully mixed, and allowed to equilibrate. After 10 min, the sample was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 30–50 s, forming 15–20 μl of filtrate. The filtrate was returned to the upper chamber, mixed, and centrifuged again. 5-μl samples of filtrate and protein were analyzed for radioactivity. Subsequently, nonradioactive CaCl2 was added serially to the protein sample, and after centrifugation, 5-μl samples of the filtrate and upper compartment were tested for radioactivity. The [Ca2+]free was measured as [Ca2+]free = [Ca2+]tot(a/b), where a and b represent the radioactivity in the ultrafiltrate and upper compartment, respectively. The CBD-bound Ca2+ was determined as follows.[Ca2+-CBD]=[Ca2+]add+[Ca2+]res-[Ca2+]free [Ca2+]add represents the externally added Ca2+, whereas [Ca2+]res is the residual (endogenous) Ca2+ in solution. [Ca2+]res was determined by Fluo-3 as described below. The bound 45Ca2+/CBD (mol/mol) was plotted versus [Ca2+]free, and the data was fitted to a Hill equation,Y=Cap(LnH)/(LnH+KdnH) or to the following Adair equation.Y=[Cap(1+2L/Kd2)L/Kd1]/(2[1+(1+L/Kd2)L/Kd1])Ca2+/Protein Equilibrium Binding Assayed by Fluo-3-The experimental procedures of this assay were previously described (39Eberhard M. Erne P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Eberhard M. Erne P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A F-96 MicroWell™ plate (Nunc) was pre-washed to remove any contaminating Ca2+. The exact concentrations of Fluo-3 were determined photometrically using ∈506 = 86,000 m–1 cm–1. Each well (140 μl of assay medium) contained 11 μm Fluo-3 with or without 10 μm protein. Fluorescence was measured (at 25°C) on an Infinite-F200 microplate reader (TECAN) at λex = 485 ± 10 nm and a λem value of 535 ± 12.5 nm. The [Ca2+]res and Kd values were derived as fit parameters, whereas [F]t was held constant. For the Fluo-3 plus CBD1 titration curves, the obtained [Ca2+]res and Fluo-3 Kd values were used to subtract the Fluo-3-bound Ca2+ species (F-Ca2+) to yield the CBD1 curve. [F-Ca2+]eq was calculated as [F-Ca2+]eq = x[F]t, and [Ca2+]free was calculated as [Ca2+]free = xKd, whereas x represents the fractional saturation of Fluo-3 at each given point of the titration curve (x = 1 and x = ∼0 were determined experimentally with saturating Ca2+ and EDTA, respectively). The [Ca2+-CBD] levels were derived as follows.[Ca2+-CBD]=[Ca2+]add+[Ca2+]res-[Ca2+]free-[F-Ca2+]eq The [Ca2+-CBD]/[CBD] values were plotted as bound Ca2+ per CBD as a function of [Ca2+]free, and the Ca2+ titration curves were analyzed by using GraFit 3.01 software.Stopped Flow Experiments-In the stopped flow experiments, 150 μl of 20–40 μm CBD1 or CBD2 with 20–80 μm Ca2+ (syringe A) was mixed (t = 10–20 ms) with 150 μl of buffer containing 150 μm Quin-2 (syringe B) at 25 °C. Under these conditions, [Ca2+]i drops below 100 nm within <2 ms. The stopped flow machine SFM-3 (BioLogic) equipped with a TC-100/15 cuvette (a mixing dead time of ∼2 ms). Quin-2 was excited at λex = 333 nm from a monochromator with a hydrogen-xenon lamp (150 W), and the emission was monitored at λem > 495 nm. The rapid mixing conditions were controlled with a MPF program, and the data were analyzed with Bio-Kine 32 V4.45 (BioLogic).Statistics-The Kd, koff, and nH values present the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done by using the two sample independent t test (Origin 7.0, Northampton, MA).RESULTSEquilibrium 45Ca2+ Binding Measurements-The 45Ca2+ titration curves were analyzed for purified preparations of CBD1, CBD2, and CBD12 at pH 7.2 and 25 °C. The protein-bound 45Ca2+ was quantified by ultrafiltration. In an assay medium of 100 mm choline chloride (or KCl), CBD1 binds ∼1.8 45Ca (mol/mol) at saturating concentrations of [45Ca2+]free = 2–3 μm, showing a Kd of 0.4 μm and a Hill coefficient of nH = 2.1 (Fig. 1a). Under comparable experimental conditions, CBD2 binds ∼1.7 45Ca (mol/mol) with a Kd of 6.2 μm and nH = 2.0 (Fig. 1a). Adair analysis reveals Kd1/Kd2 ratios of 12.6 and 11.6 for CBD1 and CBD2, respectively (Table 1). This is consistent (within the experimental error) with measured values of Hill coefficient (nH = 1.8–2.0), although the maximal capacities for Ca2+ binding are not exactly 2.0 (Table 1) for either protein (notably, Adair equation predefines a number of binding sites, whereas the Hill equation does not). Therefore, the derived values of Kd1 and Kd2 can be used (in combination with measured koff values) for calculating the kon values in a kinetic model describing a cooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions to CBDs (see Fig. 7).TABLE 1Equilibrium Ca2+ binding constants of CBD1 and CBD2Hill equationAdair equationnHKdStoichiometryKd1Kd2Stoichiometryμmmol/molμmμmmol/molCBD11.83 ± 0.050.30 ± 0.152.37 ± 0.181.13 ± 0.150.09 ± 0.032.38 ± 0.18CBD22.02 ± 0.274.95 ± 1.201.58 ± 0.0523.2 ± 1.592.00 ± 0.011.66 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 7Kinetic schemes of Ca2+ interactions with Ca2+ sensors of CBD1 and CBD2.

The dotted lines depict the primary site of CBD2, which does not interact with Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of Mg2+, the titration curve of CBD12 reaches saturation at [45Ca2+]free = 60–80 μm with a maximal binding capacity of ∼5.9 45Ca/CBD12 (mol/mol), whereas Adair analysis reveals the intrinsic Kd values for six Ca2+ sites as 0.2, 1.5, 2.3, 25, 30, and 120 μm (Fig. 1b). These data suggest that the CBD12 construct can bind two additional Ca2+ ions with Kd values of > 30 μm as compared with CBD1 and CBD2 constructs (Fig. 1b). Considering the crystal structure data, according to which CBD1 contains four binding sites (19Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Johnson E. Bruschweiler-Li L. Showalter S.A. Vuister G.W. Zhang F. Brüschweiler R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas CBD2 contains only two sites (20Besserer G.M. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Chaptal V. Casico D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18467-18472Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the “extra” two affinity sites observed in CBD12 belong to CBD1 and not to CBD2. In the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, CBD12 binds less Ca2+ at any given concentration of [Ca2+]free (Fig. 1b), meaning that Mg2+ decreases the affinities of nearly all Ca2+-binding sites of CBD12.Equilibrium Ca2+ Binding Measurements by Fluo-3-The above-described radioactive assays of Ca2+ binding exhibited a maximal capacity of ∼2 bound Ca2+ (mol/mol) for both CBD1 and CBD2 (Fig. 1a), whereas ∼ 6 Ca2+/CBD12 (mol/mol) bound species were detected in CBD12 (Fig. 1b). To resolve this discrepancy as well as to validate the accuracy of our radioactive measurements, the Ca2+ binding properties of CBD1 were quantitatively evaluated by a complementary and independent approach. To this end, the fluorescence assay of Fluo-3 was performed because of its capacity to measure not only the Kd values but also the Ca2+ binding stoichiometry (39Eberhard M. Erne P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Eberhard M. Erne P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This method is based on the competition of Ca2+ binding to the protein of interest and Fluo-3. Compared with the Fluo-3 curve alone, the Fluo-3 plus CBD1 titration curve is shifted right because of competition between Fluo-3 and CBD1 for Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2a). The plotting of [Ca2+]free versus CBD1-bound Ca2+ (n = 6) shows an excellent fit, with a Kd of 0.28 μm and nH = 2.4 at a capacity of 2.3 Ca2+/CBD1 (mol/mol) (Fig. 2b). Very similar titration curves were obtained by using the radioactive and fluorescence assays (Fig. 2c). Therefore, in the isolated preparations of CBD1, both the radioactive and fluorescence assays reveal the maximal stoichiometry of ∼2 Ca2+/ CBD1 (mol/mol), meaning that the low affinity sites of the isolated CBD1 cannot be identified because of the conformational state of CBD1 and not because of methodological limitations.FIGURE 2Ca2+ binding assay of CBD1 monitored by Fluo-3. The Ca2+ titration curves were analyzed on the basis of CBD1 and Fluo-3 competition for Ca2+ binding (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). a, the fraction of Fluo-3-bound Ca2+ was experimentally evaluated at various concentrations of Ca2+ in an assay medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 100 mm KCl. The titrations were done either in the presence of 11.1 μm Fluo-3 alone (i.e. standard curve, •) or 11.1 μm Fluo-3 plus 10 μm CBD1 (◯). The data were plotted as a function of total Ca2+. The solid line represents the fit of a standard titration curve of Fluo-3 (in the absence of CBD1), exhibiting a Kd value of 0.38 μm. b, the CBD1-bound Ca2+ (mol/mol) was calculated at each point of the titration curve and plotted versus free concentrations of Ca2+ (see “Materials and Methods”). The experimental points represent the data collected from six independent experiments. The assay buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, plus 100 mm KCl (TK buffer) or choline chloride (TC buffer). The solid line was calculated to fit the experimental data by using a Hill equation. The fitting parameters of the Ca2+ binding curves were derived as follows: Capacity = 2.32 ± 0.06 Ca2+/CBD1 (mol/mol), Kd = 0.28 ± 0.01 μm, and nH = 2.4 ± 0.01. c, the Ca2+ titration curves were obtained for CBD1 by parallel measurements of fluorescence (◯) and radioactivity (•). The experimental points of radioactive (dashed line) and fluorescence (solid line) assays were fitted according to a Hill equation, yielding Kd = 0.25 ± 0.02 μm, Cap = 2.60 ± 0.12 45Ca2+/CBD1 (mo/mol), and nH = 1.98 ± 0.25 for the radioactive assay and Kd = 0.29 ± 0.02, Cap = 2.45 ± 0.10 Ca2+/CBD1 (mol/mol), and nH = 2.70 for the fluorescence assay. The lower (dotted) line represents the difference between the titration curves obtained by two different methods.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stopped Flow Measurements of Ca2+ Off Rates-The stopped flow technique was used for measuring the rate constants of Ca2+ dissociation from CBD1 and CBD2 by exploring Quin-2. The use of Quin-2 was preferred, because this probe has an extremely high affinity to Ca2+ (Kd ∼50 nm), whereas kon = ∼109 m–1 s–1 is nearly a diffusion-controlled reaction (41Bayley P. Ahlstrom P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Martin S.R. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these experiments 10–20 μm CBD1 or CBD2 (pre-equilibrated with 40–80 μm Ca2+) was mixed with 150 μm Quin-2. The rationale behind this is that when Quin-2 is mixed with the Ca2+/protein, [Ca2+]free drops rapidly (<2 ms) below Kd, thereby inducing the Ca2+/protein dissociation. Subsequently, Ca2+ dissociates from a protein complex (on a slower time scale) and binds to Quin-2, resulting in a rise in fluorescence. The observed increase in fluorescence matches the rate and amount of Ca2+ dissociation from the complex. Under standard assay conditions (100 mm choline chloride or KCl), approximately two Ca2+ ions dissociate from CBD1 with observed order rate constant of koff = 13.3 ± 0.1 s–1 (Fig. 3a). The Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of CBD2 is much faster, exhibiting a koff of 155 ± 3 s–1 (Fig. 3b). Comparable results were obtained for five different preparations of CBD1 (koff = 6–13 s–1) and CBD2 (koff = 155–300 s–1) (Table 2). In contrast to CBD1 and CBD2, the CBD12 construct shows the biphasic kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation, exhibiting a k1 value of 7 ± 3 s–1 and a k2 value of 125 ± 50 s–1 (Fig. 3c). Because the k1 and k2 values are quite similar to the rate constants observed in the isolated CBD1 and CBD2, it is reasonable to assume that the CBDs retain their kinetic properties in the integrated CBD12 construct. The Ca2+ dissociation from the low affinity sites of CBD1 is perhaps so fast that it cannot be detected by stopped flow techniques even in the CBD12 construct.FIGURE 3Stopped flow measurements of the Ca2+ dissociation rate constants of CBD1 and CBD2. All of the buffer solutions were prepared on the basis of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 100 mm KCl (TK buffer). a, 150μl of 20 μm CBD1 plus 80 μm CaCl2 in TK buffer (syringe A) was mixed (t = 20 ms) at 25 °C with 150 μl of 150 μm Quin-2 in TK buffer (syringe B)."

Activation of this receptor modulates several key biochemical pathways, including gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation of fatty acids, fatty acid uptake, cholesterol homeostasis, and lipogenesis. It is of current interest to determine whether the interaction between pregnane x receptor and these key biochemical pathways is evolutionarily conserved. We show here that activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathway synergizes with pregnane x receptor-mediated gene activation in mouse hepatocytes. Conversely, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling has a repressive effect upon pregnane x receptor-mediated gene activation in rat and human hepatocytes. We show that the human pregnane x receptor protein can serve as an effective substrate for catalytically active cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. Metabolic labeling of the protein in vivo indicates that human pregnane x receptor exists as a phosphoprotein and that activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling modulates the phosphorylation status of pregnane x receptor. Activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling also modulates the interactions of pregnane x receptor with protein cofactors. Our results define the species-specific impact of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling on pregnane x receptor and provide a molecular explanation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated repression of human pregnane x receptor activity.

Kliewer S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). PXR is activated by a vast array of compounds, including certain steroids and bile acids, a plethora of naturally occurring compounds, specific antibiotics, antifungal drugs, polychlorinated binphenyls, organochloride pesticides, and phenobarbital (PB) (2Goodwin B. Redinbo M.R. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The prototypical marker of PXR activation and best-characterized PXR target gene in mammals encodes certain members of the CYP3A family of cytochrome P450 (CYP) drug-metabolizing enzymes (3Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). It is now clear that PXR-mediated gene activation coordinately regulates a group of genes that encode CYP proteins and additional drug-metabolizing enzymes, as well as drug transporter proteins in liver and intestine (5Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Hence, PXR-mediated gene activation produces profound up-regulation of the metabolism, transport, and elimination of potentially toxic chemicals, including many steroids, xenobiotics, cholesterol metabolites, and other compounds, from the body.Ligand-mediated activation of PXR occurs in a species-specific manner (6Moore L.B.

One of the most effective activators of human PXR is the macrocyclic antibiotic, rifampicin. Interestingly, rifampicin does not appreciably activate mouse PXR. Conversely, pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) is an efficacious activator of mouse PXR but has only minimal effect on human PXR. The species-specific induction of CYP3A gene expression can be fully accounted for by evolution of the ligand-binding pocket of this nuclear receptor from mice to humans. We and others have demonstrated this experimentally using novel lines of PXR knock-out mice crossed with additional novel lines of transgenic mice expressing the human PXR protein (7Scheer N. Ross J.

Although much is known regarding the identity of target genes and ligands for this nuclear receptor, very little is known regarding the signal transduction pathways that interface with the PXR protein.The primary target of intracellular cAMP is cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (11Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3580-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Numerous physiological stimuli, such as β-adrenergic stimulation during fasting and caloric restriction, as well as acute inflammation produce increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP in hepatocytes. The PKA signal transduction pathway is also involved in the phosphorylation of target proteins through indirect interaction with the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (12Dumaz N. Marais R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3491-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the effect of PKA signaling on drug-inducible CYP3A and CYP2B gene expression in hepatocytes. Using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, Sidhu and Omiecinski (13Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12762-12773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that PB-mediated induction of Cyp3A1 and Cyp2B1/2 expression is inhibited by treatment with cAMP analogues. Conversely, the same laboratory reported that forskolin treatment produces increased expression of Cyp3A1 in rat hepatocytes; however, induction was independent of cAMP and PKA signaling (14Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this difference was conclusively demonstrated when two groups independently found that forskolin functions as a direct agonist of both rodent and human PXR, thereby inducing ligand-dependent expression of CYP3A genes (15Ding X. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Dowless M.S. Barbee J.L. Borchert K.M. Bocchinfuso W.P. Houck K.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 512: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In mice, it has been reported that PB-mediated induction of Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 gene expression is inhibited by PKA activators, whereas inhibitors of PKA enhanced drug-inducible CYP gene expression (17Galisteo M. Marc N. Fautrel A. Guillouzo A. Corcos L. Lagadic-Gossmann D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1270-1277PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marc N. Galisteo M. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Fautrel A. Joannard F. Guillouzo A. Corcos L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Studies from our laboratory using mouse models show that the PKA signal transduction pathway synergizes with ligand-dependent PXR-mediated induction of Cyp3a11 gene expression (15Ding X. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that the PKA-mediated synergism is a PXR-dependent phenomenon in mice. Additional studies from our laboratory using mouse models indicate that PKA signaling interfaces with constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) activity by modulating CAR-protein cofactor interactions and also by increasing the expression of the Car gene itself (19Ding X. Lichti K. Kim I. Gonzalez F.J. Staudinger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26540-26551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies, we noticed significant differences in PKA-dependent alterations of drug-inducible CYP gene expression that were dependent upon the species of rodent (mouse versus rat) used to isolate primary cultures of hepatocytes. To date, there are no studies that we are aware of that have systematically investigated the effect of PKA signaling upon drug-inducible CYP gene expression in hepatocytes across multiple species. These observations led us to initiate a systematic study of the effect of PKA signaling on drug-inducible CYP3A gene expression in cultured hepatocytes across three different species: mice, rats, and humans.Using primary cultures of hepatocytes, we show here that pharmacological activation of PKA signaling using the cyclic AMP analog, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), has a species-specific effect upon PXR-mediated activation of drug-inducible CYP3A gene expression. In primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes, PKA signaling has a synergistic effect upon PXR-mediated Cyp3a11 gene activation. Conversely, in primary cultures of human and rat hepatocytes, PKA signaling dramatically represses PXR-mediated drug-inducible Cyp3A1 gene activation. We use biochemical and pharmacological methods to explore the molecular basis of the interface between the PKA signal transduction pathway and the human PXR protein. In vitro 32P-labeling experiments using recombinant human PXR protein and several catalytically active protein kinases reveal that human PXR protein serves as a comparatively effective and direct substrate for PKA. In vivo metabolic labeling experiments using [32P]orthophosphate show for the first time that human PXR exists as a phosphoprotein in cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against phosphothreonine amino acid residues reveals that activation of PKA signaling increases the phosphothreonine content of the human PXR protein. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis indicates that PKA signaling probably represses human PXR activity through increases in the strength of interaction between human PXR and the protein cofactor nuclear receptor co-repressor protein (NCoR). Elucidation of the mechanism by which PKA signaling modulates PXR activity will probably be useful in the prediction and prevention of harmful drug interactions in patients on combination therapy that also suffer from diabetes, obesity, or acute inflammation. It is of further interest to determine the extent to which the interface between PXR and key signal transduction pathways, such as the PKA signaling pathway, is evolutionarily conserved. This thrust of research will also probably be useful in helping to understand the molecular basis of altered drug metabolism pathways in patients with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODSHepatocyte Culture and Treatment-Hepatocytes were isolated from male mice or rats using a standard collagenase perfusion method, as described previously (20Brobst D.E. Ding X. Creech K.L. Goodwin B. Kelley B. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates at a density of 8 × 105 live cells/well. Primary cultures of human hepatocytes were purchased from CellzDirect (Pittsboro, NC). Forty-eight hours after plating, hepatocytes were treated with 1 mm concentrations of 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP or 8-bromo-cyclic-GMP, 10 μm PCN, a known rodent PXR agonist, or 10 μm rifampicin, a known human PXR agonist. Mouse hepatocytes were treated for 24 h, and human hepatocytes were treated for 48 h.RNA Isolation, Northern Blot, and Real Time Quantitative-PCR Analysis-Total RNA was isolated from cell culture using a commercially available reagent, TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s directions. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to the cDNA sequences for mouse and rat CYP3A analogs or for 18 S RNA, as described previously (15Ding X. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Ding X. Staudinger J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For QPCR analysis, isolated RNA was DNase-treated (Sigma) and reverse transcribed (Promega), and quantitative PCR was performed using a Cepheid Smart Cycler™ (Sunnyvale, CA) to detect mRNA expression specific for CYP3A and CYP2B orthologues in mice, rats, and humans. Primers for CYP3A were designed as follows: mouse Cyp3a11 (5′-CAA GGA GAT GTT CCC TGT CA and 5′-CCA CGT TCA CTC CAA ATG AT), rat Cyp3A1 (5′-AAT AAG GCA CCT CCC ACC TA and 5′-GGA TCA CGG TGA AGA GCA TA), and human CYP3A4 (5′-CAG GAG GAA ATT GAT GCA GTT TT and 5′-GTC AAG ATA CTC CAT CTG TAG CAC AGT). Primers for CYP2B were designed as follows: mouse Cyp2b10 (5′-GAC TTT GGG ATG GGA AAG AG and 5′-CCA AAC ACA ATG GAG CAG AT), human CYP2B6 (5′-AAG CGG ATT TGT CTT GGT GAA and 5′-TGG AGG ATG GTG GTG AAG AAG), and rat Cyp2B1/B2 (5′-GGT ACC TGC TTC CCA AGA AC and 5′-ACA AAT GTG CTT TCC TGT GG). -Fold induction was calculated using 18 S RNA to normalize the data as described previously (22Staudinger J.L. Madan A. Carol K.M. Parkinson A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Generation of the Human PXR Recombinant Adenovirus- Recombinant adenoviruses were generated using the Ad-Easy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene). A BamHI/XhoI human PXR PCR product was inserted into the pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP1 transfer vector. The PCR primer sequences were 5′-GAC GGC CTC GAG GCT ACC TGT GAT GCC GAA CAA CTC and 5′-GAA GGC CTC GAG GCC ACC ATG GAT TAC AAG GAT GAC. These primers were designed to omit the stop codon in order to fuse the protein to a 3× FLAG epitope at the COOH terminus. Viruses were propagated in the AD-293 cell line and were purified using cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Cells were transduced with the purified adenovirus expressing FLAG-tagged human PXR at a multiplicity of infection of 10.Immunopurification of FLAG-tagged Human PXR Protein-Following overnight adenoviral transduction, cells were drug-treated for 24–48 h and lysed by sonication in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Thermo Scientific). Cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of immobilized protein A (Repligen). Immunoprecipitation of the human PXR protein was accomplished using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or a polyclonal antibody directed against the human PXR protein, as indicated. Control reactions contained nonimmune IgG (Sigma) or blank virus as indicated. Free immune complexes were captured with immobilized protein A and washed three times with lysis buffer.In Vitro Phosphorylation Analysis-Immunopurified human PXR protein was subjected to in vitro phosphorylation analysis using catalytically active purified kinases, including CDK1, CK2, GSK3 (New England Biosciences), PKA, PKC (Promega), p70S6K, AMPK, and Akt2 (Upstate). Approximately 3 μg of human PXR protein was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with the above kinases and corresponding reaction buffers. Reaction buffer composition was as follows: CDK1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), CK2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), GSK3 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), PKA (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), PKC (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.4 mm CaCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), p70S6K (40 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), AMPK (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 300 μm AMP, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and Akt2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and autoradiography analysis was performed overnight at –80 °C.In Vivo Metabolic Labeling Analysis-HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. The cells were transduced with Ad-hPXR or Ad-GFP (multiplicity of infection = 10) overnight. After viral transduction, the cells were treated with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 6 h. The culture medium was then supplemented with 300 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/well and treated with vehicle, 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, or 1 mm 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (8-Br-cGMP) for an additional 14 h. The cells were washed three times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and human PXR protein was immunopurified using anti-human PXR antibody as described above. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and autoradiography analysis was performed for 30 min at room temperature. For control purposes, a duplicate experiment was performed for the parallel Western blot analysis that omitted the radiolabel in order to examine the efficiency of immunopurification.Detection of Phosphothreonine in Human PXR-The immunopurified human PXR protein was resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies obtained from the PhosphoDetect™ phosphoserine and phosphothreonine detection kits (Calbiochem). The λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) reaction conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mm MnCl2, at pH 7.5 at 25 °C.Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Analysis-The XREM-Luc and mammalian two-hybrid reporter gene assays were performed as previously described (20Brobst D.E. Ding X. Creech K.L. Goodwin B. Kelley B. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Ding X. Staudinger J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 7000 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PXR transactivation assays were transfected with 110 ng of DNA/well containing SV40-β-galactosidase (40 ng), XREM-Luc (20 ng), pGFP-hPXR (5 ng), pFC-PKA or pFC-MEK1 (10 ng), and pBluescript (35 ng). The mammalian two-hybrid assays were transfected with 110 ng of DNA/well containing SV40-β-galactosidase (40 ng), pFR-Luc (20 ng), Gal4-NCoR (20 ng), VP16-hPXR (10 ng), pFC-PKA (10 ng), and pBluescript (10 ng). The next day, the cells were drug-treated for 24 h. Luciferase activities were determined using a standard luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activities were determined by o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside assay and were read at 420 nm.Statistical Analysis-Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Duncan's multiple range post hoc test.RESULTSPKA Signaling has a Species-specific Effect on PXR-mediated Gene Activation in Hepatocytes-To determine if PKA signaling has a species-specific effect upon PXR-mediated gene activation, primary cultures of mouse and rat hepatocytes were isolated and treated with vehicle or 10 μm PCN for 24 h in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mm) of 8-Br-cAMP, and Northern blotting analysis was performed (Fig. 1). As expected, treatment with PCN produced increased expression of both Cyp3a11 and Cyp3A1 in primary cultures of mouse and rat hepatocytes, respectively. Strikingly, increasing concentrations of the PKA activator, 8-Br-cAMP, had opposite effects upon PCN-inducible CYP3A gene expression in primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes when compared with that obtained using rat hepatocytes. In mouse hepatocytes, 8-Br-cAMP synergized with PCN, producing extremely robust levels of Cyp3a11 gene expression at the highest doses, whereas in rat hepatocytes, it dramatically repressed the expression of Cyp3A1. Both the synergistic and repressive effects were concentration-dependent in both species examined, respectively. The synergistic effect of 8-Br-cAMP in mouse hepatocytes was also PXR-dependent, since there was only minimal induction of Cyp3a11 gene expression at the highest doses of 8-Br-cAMP examined in PXR knock-out mice (data not shown).To further examine the specificity of the effect of the effect of PKA signaling across species, we treated primary cultures of mouse, rat, and human hepatocytes for 24 h with either 8-Br-cAMP or 8-Br-cGMP as a control compound, in the presence and absence of 10 μm PCN or rifampicin and performed real time quantitative PCR to analyze the expression levels of CYP3A. Fig. 2A shows that treatment of primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or 10 μm PCN for 24 h induced expression of Cyp3a11 to approximately equivalent levels, whereas co-treatment with 8-Br-cAMP and PCN produced a synergistic level of PXR target gene expression (>2000-fold induction). Treatment with 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP alone had no significant effect upon Cyp3a11 gene expression levels, and co-treatment with 8-Br-cGMP and PCN produced very similar effects when compared with PCN treatment alone. Primary cultures of rat and human hepatocytes were also treated using identical experimental conditions. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP isolated from these two species produced the exact opposite effect of that observed with mouse hepatocytes. Fig. 2B shows that treatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with either 8-Br-cAMP or 8-Br-cGMP produced little or no effect upon Cyp3A1 gene expression levels, whereas treatment with 10 μm PCN induced expression as expected. However, treatment of rat hepatocytes with 8-Br-cAMP together with PCN reduced the -fold induction of Cyp3A1 expression to less than 10% of that observed when compared with PCN treatment alone. In contrast, treatment of rat hepatocytes with 8-Br-cGMP together with PCN induced expression of Cyp3A1 comparable with that observed with PCN treatment alone. When primary cultures of human hepatocytes were used, 10 μm rifampicin was substituted for PCN treatment; other than that, the experimental conditions were identical. Fig. 2C reveals that treatment with 8-Br-cAMP produced dramatic repression of rifampicin-inducible CYP3A4 gene expression. Treatment with 8-Br-cGMP had very little or no effect upon either the basal or rifampicin-inducible expression of the CYP3A4 gene.FIGURE 2PKA activation has a species-specific effect on CYP3A gene expression in primary cultures of hepatocytes. Primary cultures of mouse (A), rat (B), and human (C) hepatocytes were treated with either 10 μm PCN or 10 μm rifampicin and with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP for 24 h and monitored for the induction of CYP3A orthologues. Data are expressed as -fold induction over the vehicle control and are normalized to 18 S expression and represent the mean of the replicates ± S.D. (n = 3). Letters different from each other indicate a statistical difference between treatment groups (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Species Specificity Resides in the Cyclic AMP Signaling Pathway-We next sought to determine whether the species-specific response to cAMP resides in the PXR protein or is a function of how PKA signaling interfaces with PXR activity. The XREM-Luc reporter gene was used in HepG2 cells to determine if overexpression of PKA altered activity toward the CYP3A4 promoter in a species-specific manner. A plasmid encoding human PXR was co-transfected with the XREM-Luc reporter gene in the presence and absence of an additional expression vector encoding the catalytic domain of PKA (Clontech). A plasmid encoding MEK3 (Clontech) was used as a control for kinase overexpression. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, selected wells were treated with rifampicin for an additional 24 h (Fig. 3A). As expected, rifampicin activated XREM-Luc reporter gene activity ∼65-fold in the presence of human PXR. Overexpression of PKA repressed reporter gene activity by ∼70%, whereas overexpression of MEK3 did not. Identical experiments using a plasmid encoding mouse PXR yielded similar results in that overexpression of PKA significantly repressed XREM-Luc reporter gene activity, whereas overexpression of MEK3 did not (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that PKA signaling is a repressive signal in the human genetic background and that repression of PXR activity is independent of the species of PXR protein.FIGURE 3Species-specific modulation of PXR activity resides in the PKA signaling pathway. HepG2 cells were transfected with expression vectors for human PXR (A) or mouse PXR (B), together with the XREM-Luc reporter gene, in the presence or absence of an expression vector encoding constitutively active PKA. Cells were treated with 10 μm rifampicin, 10 μm PCN, 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP for 24 h. Data are expressed as the mean of replicates ± S.D. (n = 8) and are normalized to β-galactosidase activity. C, primary cultures of humanized mouse hepatocytes were treated with 10 μm rifampicin in the presence and absence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP and 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP for 24 h. Data are expressed as the mean of replicates ± S.D. (n = 3).

Following liver perfusion, primary cultures of “PXR-humanized” mouse hepatocytes were treated with 8-Br-cAMP in the presence and absence of the human PXR agonist rifampicin (Fig. 3C). As expected, treatment with rifampicin produced a 6-fold increase in Cyp3a11 gene expression. Co-treatment of hepatocytes with 8-Br-cAMP and rifampicin had a positive effect, producing ∼14-fold increase in Cyp3a11 gene expression. As a negative control, treatm"
https://openalex.org/W2012300905,"Axin, a key modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, acts as a scaffold protein in phosphorylating and degrading cytoplasmic beta-catenin. Canonical Wnt proteins appear to stabilize beta-catenin by inducing the interaction of LRP5/6 with Axin. This interaction requires the phosphorylation of the Ser or Thr residues in the PPPP(S/T)PX(T/S) motifs at the intracellular domain of LRP5/6. In this work, we identified a novel Axin-interacting protein, zinc-finger BED domain-containing 3 (Zbed3), by yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiment in mammalian cells and in vitro pulldown assays. Moreover, we found Zbed3 also contains a PPPPSPT motif, which is crucial to its binding to Axin. The Ser and Thr residues in the motif appear to be also phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and the CKI family kinases, as GSK3beta and CKIepsilon could enhance the interaction of Zbed3 with Axin. Mutation of the Ser (SA) or Thr (TA) residue to Ala in the motif markedly impaired its ability to interact with Axin. Expressing Zbed3, but not these mutants, led to inhibition of GSK3beta-mediated beta-catenin phosphorylation, cytoplasmic beta-catenin accumulation, and activation of lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1-dependent reporter gene transcription. Furthermore, knockdown of Zbed3 with RNA interference attenuated Wnt-induced beta-catenin accumulation, lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1-dependent luciferase reporter activity, and the Wnt target gene expression. These results together indicate that Zbed3 is a novel Axin-binding protein that is involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2154285250,"Adipocyte-secreted proteins play important roles in metabolic regulation through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanisms. Using transcriptional profiling, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 80 (Ccdc80; also known as DRO1 and URB) as a novel secreted protein highly expressed in white adipose tissue. In 3T3-L1 cells Ccdc80 is expressed and secreted in a biphasic manner with high levels in postconfluent preadipocytes and terminally differentiated adipocytes. To determine whether Ccdc80 regulates adipocyte differentiation, Ccdc80 expression was manipulated using both knockdown and overexpression approaches. Small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of Ccdc80 in 3T3-L1 cells inhibits adipocyte differentiation. This phenotype was partially reversed by treating the knockdown cells with Ccdc80-containing conditioned medium from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Molecular studies indicate that Ccdc80 is required for the full inhibition of T-cell factor-mediated transcriptional activity, down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes during clonal expansion, and the subsequent induction of C/EBPalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Surprisingly, overexpression of Ccdc80 in 3T3-L1 cells also inhibits adipocyte differentiation without affecting the repression of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that Ccdc80 plays dual roles in adipogenesis by mechanisms that involve at least in part down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and induction of C/EBPalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma."
https://openalex.org/W2031691741,"Atherosclerosis is a complex pathological condition caused by a number of mechanisms including the accelerated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Diabetes is likely to be an important risk factor for atherosclerosis, as hyperglycemia induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and may thus contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. This study was performed to investigate whether PGC-1alpha, a PPARgamma coactivator and metabolic master regulator, plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and migration induced by high glucose.PGC-1alpha mRNA levels are decreased in blood vessel media of STZ-treated diabetic rats. In cultured rat VSMCs, high glucose dose-dependently inhibits PGC-1alpha mRNA expression. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha either by infection with adenovirus, or by stimulation with palmitic acid, significantly reduces high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In contrast, suppression of PGC-1alpha by siRNA mimics the effects of glucose on VSMCs. Finally, mechanistic studies suggest that PGC-1alpha-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration is regulated through preventing ERK1/2 phosphorylation.These results indicate that PGC-1alpha is a key regulator of high glucose-induced proliferation and migration in VSMCs, and suggest that elevation of PGC-1alpha in VSMC could be a useful strategy in preventing the development of diabetic atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016496971,"The fate of neural stem cells (NSCs), including their proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death, is regulated by multiple intrinsic signals and the extrinsic environment. We had previously reported that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) directly induces astroglial differentiation of NSCs by activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway independently of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Here, we reported the observation that AICAR inhibited NSC proliferation and its underlying mechanism. Analysis of caspase activity and cell cycle showed that AICAR induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in NSCs, associated with decreased levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, phospho-retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and cyclin D but did not cause apoptosis. Iodotubericidin and Compound C, inhibitors of adenosine kinase and AMPK, respectively, or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK, but not JAK inhibitor, were able to reverse the anti-proliferative effect of AICAR. Glucose deprivation also activated the AMPK pathway, induced G0/G1 arrest, and suppressed the proliferation of NSCs, an effect associated with decreased levels of phospho-Rb and cyclin D protein. Furthermore, Compound C and overexpression of dominant-negative AMPK in C17.2 NSCs could block the glucose deprivation-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D and partially reverse the suppression of proliferation. These results suggest that AICAR and glucose deprivation might induce G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and suppress proliferation of NSCs via phospho-Rb and cyclin D down-regulation.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), signaling pathways have also been implicated in the control of self-renewal of NSCs and may act as important niche factors to maintain them. Because of their ability to self-renew, NSCs have promise for treatment of neurological diseases by transplantation therapy or by recruitment of endogenous precursors to repair the adult brain. In contrast, it has been reported that NSCs and brain tumors share many common features (18Oliver T.G. Wechsler-Reya R.J. Neuron. 2004; 42: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). They express common sets of markers (e.g. Nestin, CD133, and Sox2) and share similar pathways regulating their proliferation (e.g. Sonic hedgehog, phosphatase, and tensin homolog). Study of the self-renewal of adult NSCs will yield new insights into brain cancer (19Galli R. Binda E. Orfanelli U. Cipelletti B. Gritti A. De Vitis S. Fiocco R. Foroni C. Dimeco F. Vescovi A.

Recently, we demonstrated that a cell-permeable small molecule, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) could directly induce astroglial differentiation of NSCs. AICAR is a very commonly used and quite specific activator (22Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic master regulator (23Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Hardie D.G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). It has also been reported to have diverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, regulation of the pro-inflammatory response, and cytokine production, most of which are associated with AMPK activation. However, our recent study showed that the effect of AICAR on induction of astroglial differentiation of NSCs is independent of its classical target AMPK but dependent on JAK/STAT3. In conjunction with this effect on astrogliogenesis, we also observed a reduction in the number of NSCs. Although AICAR has been reported to regulate cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest, and regulate apoptosis in various cell types, including a protective anti-apoptotic effect in astrocytes (25Blazquez C. Geelen M.J. Velasco G. Guzman M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and hippocampal neurons (26Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the reported details of these effects and their underlying mechanisms are varied and intricate. Thus far, there are few reports of the effects of AICAR or any other metabolic regulator on the self-renewal of NSCs or other stem cells. In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which AICAR exposure reduces NSC number and the role of AMPK and the JAK/STAT3 pathway in the antiproliferative effect of AICAR in NSCs. Finally, we investigated the role of AMPK in NSC survival under conditions of cellular stress induced by depletion of energy such as glucose deprivation. Chemicals-AICAR, d-mannose, d-glucose, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. JAK inhibitor I, Compound C, staurosporine (STS), and iodotubericidin (ITU) were from Calbiochem. Neural Stem Cell Culture-Mouse immortalized NSC line C17.2 (C17.2-NSC, a generous gift from Dr. Tie-Qiao Wen) was originally described by Snyder et al. (27Snyder E.Y. Deitcher D.L. Walsh C. Arnold-Aldea S. Hartwieg E.A. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 33-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The C17.2-NSC were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and split when the cells reached ∼90% confluency. Primary NSCs were isolated from the cerebral cortices of embryonic day 14 (E14) SD. rats according to methods described previously (28Zang Y. Yu L.F. Pang T. Fang L.P. Feng X. Wen T.Q. Nan F.J. Feng L.Y. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and all experiments were performed with cells that had undergone two passages. The primary NSCs (E14-NSC) were maintained on uncoated 25-ml flasks (Corning) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) that contained N2 and B27 supplements (Invitrogen) plus penicillin (Sigma, 100 μg/ml), streptomycin (Sigma, 100 μg/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega, 10 ng/ml), and epidermal growth factor (Promega, 10 ng/ml). For monolayer growth of E14-NSC, the cells were mechanically dissociated from the E14 neurospheres and plated at a density of 20 × 104 cells/ml on 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips or 6-well plates (Corning). The monolayers were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) that contained N2 and B27 supplement (Invitrogen) plus penicillin (100 μg/ml, Sigma), streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Sigma), basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml, Promega), and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml, Promega). Medium was supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor each day. Plasmid Construction and Transfection-cDNA encoding human AMPK-α1, containing a mutation that alters aspartic acid 159 to an alanine (D159A) (29Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP vector (a kind gift from Dr. Ding YQ of Shanghai institute for biological sciences) to generate pCAGGS-DN-AMPK-IRES-EGFP. Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection as directed by the manufacturer. Western Blot Analysis-20–100 μg of protein per lane was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were processed for immunoblotting as described previously (28Zang Y. Yu L.F. Pang T. Fang L.P. Feng X. Wen T.Q. Nan F.J. Feng L.Y. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used at 1:1000 dilutions unless otherwise indicated: AMPK-α, phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172), ACC, phospho-ACC (Ser-79), STAT3, phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705), phospho-Rb (Ser-807/811), cyclin D, and anti-actin (Sigma, 1:5000). Rb (1:1000) was purchased from ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Trypan Blue Exclusion Test-Cells were harvested with trypsin, and a small aliquot of the cell suspension was diluted with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Cells were counted under a phase-contrast microscope. Cells with a damaged cell membrane (necrotic cells) stained blue, whereas cells with an intact plasma membrane (healthy or apoptotic cells) remained unstained. All experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. Nuclear Staining with Hoechst 3334-C17.2-NSCs treated with 1 mm AICAR were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated slides for 48 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and rinsed. Chromatin staining was performed with Hoechst 33342 to detect nuclear condensation (a morphological change associated with apoptosis), and the cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus). Measurement of Caspase Activity-The caspase activity in the AICAR-treated C17.2-NSCs were detected according to a protocol previously described (30Zhang Y.H. Zhang H.J. Wu F. Chen Y.H. Ma X.Q. Du J.Q. Zhou Z.L. Li J.Y. Nan F.J. Li J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4842-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). AICAR-treated cell were washed once using PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml proteinase K, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells in lysis buffer were cooled to –80 °C and then warmed to 4 °C four times to lyse them completely. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured using the Bradford method. Caspase-3 activity was measured in a volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm Ac-DEVD-amidomethylcoumarin and 20 μl of cell lysate. A sample composed of substrate and lysis buffer was used as a blank. Caspase-3 activity was normalized to equal protein concentrations. Proliferation Assay as Measured by MTT Incorporation-NSCs were plated overnight in 96-well plates at 4000 cells per well in growth media. After seeding, cells were maintained in growth media treated with different concentrations of AICAR for 48 h or treated with 1 mm AICAR for 24, 48, and 72 h. 40 μl of MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Then MTT was removed and replaced with 200 μl of DMSO for 10 min at 37 °C until crystals were dissolved. The absorbance was measured on SpectraMax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 550 nm with a reference at 690 nm. The optical density of the result in MTT assay was directly proportional to the number of viable cells. Each experiment was done in triplicate. For all those low glucose assays performed in this paper, we chose the time point of 24 h as the observing time to decrease the other complex side effects except for AMPK activation induced by low glucose. Cell Cycle Analysis-Cells were trypsinized and fixed as described above. After PBS washings, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A. The cell suspension was kept 30 min at room temperature, and then cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur CellSorting System (BD Bioscience). The experiment was repeated at least three independent times, and the data were analyzed using CellQuestk and ModFitk software. Statistics-Data were presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data for multiple comparisons was performed by analysis if variance. For single comparison, the significance of differences between means was determined by t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, a value of p < 0.01 was considered statistically high significant, and a value of p < 0.001 was considered statistically extremely significant. AICAR Inhibits Proliferation of Neural Stem Cells-We found a reduction in NSC number accompanying the differentiation induced by AICAR. AICAR exposure can significantly inhibit C17.2 proliferation in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1A) and time-dependent (Fig. 1B) manner compared with the controls. Reductions in C17.2 cell numbers of 5.48, 17.27, 23.79, 35.00, and 76.77% were induced by 48 h of treatment with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm AICAR, respectively. Treatment with 1 mm AICAR for 24, 48, and 72 h resulted in 6.54, 36.15, and 41.99% reduction of the total cell number, respectively. AICAR Causes Cell Cycle Arrest in G0/G0 Phase-The reduction in cell number could result from either an increase in cell death or inhibition of proliferation. To distinguish these possibilities, we first investigated the effect of AICAR on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry analysis. Compared with control cells, AICAR treatment for 24 h significantly increased the proportion of C17.2-NSCs in the G0/G1 phase (from 46.58 ± 2.05 to 60.78 ± 0.75%) and decreased that in the S (from 36.39 ± 4.33 to 28.98 ± 2.20%) and G2/M phases (from 17.02 ± 3.19 to 10.05 ± 2.17%) (Fig. 2A). This effect of AICAR was highly significant (p < 0.001, n = 3). As expected, similar results were observed for AICAR-treated primary E14-NSCs (Fig. 2B). The G1 arrest induced by AICAR was obvious in comparison with the untreated control cells. The proportion of G0/G1 phase cells increased from 66.96% in controls to 75.28% in AICAR-treated cells, whereas S phase and G2 phase decreased from 15.02 to 10.46% and from 18.03 to 14.26%, respectively. AICAR Decreases the Phosphorylation of Rb and the Protein Level of Cyclin D in Neural Stem Cells-Phosphorylation of Rb is reported to be a critical and common event during the process of cell proliferation and plays an especially important role in G1 progression and G1-S transition. We next examined the effect of AICAR on Rb. Western blot analysis of the C17.2 cell lysate after 1–2 days of AICAR treatment showed that AICAR dramatically decreased the phosphorylation of Rb in a time-dependent fashion compared with control cells (Fig. 2C). In agreement with this, the protein level of the upstream regulator of Rb, cyclin D, in C17.2-NSCs was also found to decrease in a time-dependent manner. Similar results were observed in the primary E14-NSC, i.e. a decrease of cyclin D protein expression and Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Our results suggest that the AICAR-induced G0/G1 arrest in NSCs might be associated with decreasing levels of phospho-Rb and D-cyclin protein. AICAR Does Not Cause Necrosis or Apoptosis of Neural Stem Cells-We then investigated whether AICAR could induce cell death (necrosis or apoptosis). In a trypan blue exclusion assay, no difference was observed in the proportion of dead cells between AICAR-treated and vehicle-treated C17.2 cells (data not shown). To determine whether 1 mm AICAR induces apoptosis of NSCs, we stained the nuclei of 1 mm AICAR-treated C17.2 with Hoechst 33342. AICAR-treated C17.2 showed no obvious nuclear condensation compared with negative and positive control cells (Fig. 2E). We then measured the absolute activity of caspase-3 in the cell lysates and observed a slightly increased activity of caspase-3 (about 10 times that in the control cells, Table. 1) in AICAR-treated cells, which is much lower than that induced by 0.25 μm STS, an inducer of apoptosis in NSCs (Fig. 2F). In addition, Western blot analysis showed slightly decreased expression of procaspase-3, which was in accord with its increasing activity, and no obvious accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage fragment in AICAR-treated C17.2 cells after 2 days of treatment, whereas STS produced more cleaved PARP fragment (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, we found an evident reduction in full-length PARP after 2 days of treatment with AICAR although no cleavage fragment was produced. Thus, we speculated that AICAR probably down-regulated the expression of PARP, a hypothesis that needs to be confirmed. Our results suggest that AICAR induces a non-apoptotic activation of caspase-3 in NSC. These data indicate that the AICAR-induced reduction in the number of NSC is probably a result of the inhibition of cell proliferation by G1/G0 arrest rather than to cell death. Inhibition of AMPK Activity by Inhibitors or Dominant-negative AMPK (DN-AMPK) Blocks the Growth-suppressive activation. However, in our recent study we found that although AICAR could activate the AMPK pathway in NSC as it does in other cell types, several lines of evidence suggest that this enzyme is not essential in the astrogliogenic effect of AICAR. To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect of AICAR on NSC proliferation is also caused by mechanisms other than AMPK activation, we investigated the effects of two different inhibitors of AICAR function, ITU and compound C. ITU blocks the conversion of AICAR to its activated phosphorylated form, ZMP, inside the cell by inhibiting an adenosine kinase, and Compound C is a well known AMPK inhibitor. Pretreatment with ITU (0.2 μm) completely blocked the inhibitory effect of AICAR on proliferation of NSC (Fig. 3A). Compound C (5 μm) partially but significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of AICAR on NSC proliferation (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment with these inhibitors completely blocked AICAR-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC. These results indicate that ZMP formation through phosphorylation of AICAR and activity of AMPK is required for the suppression of growth by AICAR. To further confirm the involvement of AMPK in the growth-suppressive effect of AICAR on NSC, we performed experiments using a dicistronic vector simultaneously expressing a dominant-negative form of AMPKα1 (DN-AMPK) and the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to mark the transfected cells, as described in our recent paper (28Zang Y. Yu L.F. Pang T. Fang L.P. Feng X. Wen T.Q. Nan F.J. Feng L.Y. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DN-AMPK, confirmed by Western blotting using anti-pan-α-AMPK antibody, but not of empty vector (mock transfection) suppressed AICAR-induced phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 3C). In mock-transfected NSC, AICAR decreased cyclin D expression and Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) as shown in Fig. 2. DN-AMPK partially but significantly reversed this down-regulatory effect of AICAR, implying the involvement of AMPK. Furthermore, FACS analysis showed that in mock-transfected C17.2-NSC AICAR caused obvious G0/G1 arrest, increasing the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase from 44.43 to 61.21%, as shown in Fig. 3A. DN-AMPK transfection partially but highly significantly (***, p < 0.001, n = 3) blocked cell cycle arrest by AICAR, with the proportion of DN-AMPK-transfected cells in G0/G1 phase being 45.21 and 51.7% after 24 h of DMSO or AICAR treatment, respectively (Fig. 3D). This result is in agreement with those of the Western blot analysis of the growth regulators. Taken together, all of the above evidence clearly demonstrates that AMPK activation is a key process for the inhibitory effect of AICAR on the proliferation of NSC. The JAK-STAT3 Pathway Is Not Responsible for the Anti-proliferative Effect of AICAR on NSCs-We recently reported that AICAR could activate the JAK/STAT3 pathway in NSC and that its newly reported effect (i.e. inducing astroglial differentiation of NSC) is independent of its classical target AMPK but occurs via activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. However, although all of the above evidence shows that AMPK plays a key role in the anti-proliferative effect of AICAR on NSC, we wondered about the role of JAK/STAT3 pathway in this process. We first investigated the effect of CNTF, a reference activator of the JAK/STAT3 pathway and classical gliogenesis inducer, on the proliferation of NSC. As expected, CNTF induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 4A), whereas it had no obvious effect on NSC proliferation and cyclin D protein level (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggested that there might not be a correlation between the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway and the growth inhibition of NSC. We then used a pan-specific JAK inhibitor, JAK inhibitor I, to further determine whether the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway contributes to the AICAR-induced growth suppression. C17.2-NSCs were pretreated with various concentrations of JAK inhibitor I (0, 1, 5, 10 μm) 1 h before the addition of 1 mm AICAR, and their proliferation was measured with an MTT assay after 48 h. The results shown in Fig. 4D indicate that JAK inhibitor I treatment had no effect on AICAR-induced NSC inhibition, because the ability of JAK inhibitor I to block AICAR-induced STAT3 phosphorylation had already been confirmed in our recent report (28Zang Y. Yu L.F. Pang T. Fang L.P. Feng X. Wen T.Q. Nan F.J. Feng L.Y. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the JAK/STAT3 pathway is not essential in the inhibitory effect of AICAR on NSCs. Low Glucose Activates the AMPK Pathway and Suppresses the Proliferation in NSC-As a metabolite-sensing protein kinase AMPK was reported to play an important role in responses to metabolic stress in muscle cells. Although we recently reported that AMPK is not involved in the AICAR-induced astrogliogenesis of NSCs, all the evidence reported here points strongly toward an important role of AMPK as an effective anti-proliferative system in NSC. Therefore, it was of interest for us to investigate the role of AMPK in NSC survival under conditions of cellular stress induced by depletion of energy. Here, we chose glucose deprivation as the metabolic stimulus. First, we investigated whether low glucose could stimulate the activation of the AMPK pathway in NSC, as it does in muscle cells. Glucose deprivation was achieved by replacing some or all of the d-glucose in the growth medium with d-mannose, a stereoisomer of glucose that is neither transported into cells nor metabolized by them. The Western blot analysis of NSCs exposed to low glucose (25, 10, 2.5, 0 mm) for 24 h showed that low glucose induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). We then studied the effect of glucose deprivation on NSC proliferation. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, low glucose exposure significantly inhibited NSC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Glucose Deprivation Causes G0/G0 Arrest in NSCs-We next investigated the possibility that necrosis and apoptosis were induced by low"

Here we use single muscle fibers, individually skinned by microdissection, to investigate the diffusibility and autolytic activation of calpain-3 in situ. Virtually all calpain-3 present in mature muscle fibers is tightly bound in the vicinity of the titin N2A line and triad junctions and remains so irrespective of fiber stretching or raised [Ca2+]. Most calpain-3 is evidently bound within the contractile filament lattice, because (i) its slow diffusional loss is slowed further by locking myosin and actin into rigor and (ii) detergent dispersion of membranes causes rapid washout of most ryanodine receptors and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps with little accompanying washout of calpain-3. Calpain-3 autolyzes (becoming proteolytically active) in a tightly calcium-dependent manner. It remains in its nonactivated full-length form if [Ca2+] is maintained at ≤50 nm, the normal resting level, even with brief increases to 2–20 μm during repeated tetanic contractions, but it becomes active (though still bound) if [Ca2+] is kept slightly elevated at 200 nm (∼20% autolysis in 1 h). Calpain-3 did not spontaneously autolyze even when free in solution with 200 nm Ca2+ for up to 60 min. These findings explain why calpain-3 remains quiescent with normal exercise but is activated following eccentric (stretching) contractions, when resting [Ca2+] is elevated, and how a protease such as calpain-3 can be very Ca2+-sensitive yet highly specific in its actions.

Interestingly, overexpression of this protease has no apparent deleterious effects in normal mice (5Spencer M.J. Guyon J.R. Sorimachi H. Potts A. Richard I. Herasse M. Chamberlain J. Dalkilic I.

Genet. 2005; 14: 2801-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which lack a putative binding site for calpain-3 on the N2A domain of titin. Calpain-3 is a 94-kDa protein homologous to the ubiquitous calpain family members, μ-calpain and m-calpain. It has an N-terminal domain, a proteolytic region (domains IIa and IIb), a C2-like region (domain III), and a Ca2+-binding region (domain IV) but also contains three unique sequences: an N-terminal sequence, and insertion sequences IS1 (inserted between domains IIa and IIb) and IS2 (inserted between domains III and IV) (7Sorimachi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain-3 only becomes proteolytically active against other substrates once IS1 has been excised; this commences as a strictly intramolecular process in which calpain-3 autolyzes itself in the IS1 domain, producing a 60-kDa C-terminal region containing domains IIb to IV, which remains tightly associated with the severed IIa domain (8Taveau M.

Subsequent intra- or intermolecular reactions continue the proteolysis of the IS1 sequence, reducing the C-terminal fragment to 58 kDa and then 55 kDa (8Taveau M. Bourg N. Sillon G. Roudaut C. Bartoli M. Richard I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9127-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Garcia Diaz B.E. Moldoveanu T. Kuiper M.J. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27656-27666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that calpain-3 in muscle “spontaneously” autolyzes to the 55–60-kDa products and that this rendered the calpain inactive (10Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is now recognized that autolysis is actually the process endowing proteolytic activity, it is still often said to occur in a Ca2+-independent manner (11Ono Y. Hayashi C. Doi N. Tagami M. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Ojima K. Ono Y. Hata S. Koyama S. Doi N. Sorimachi H. J. Muscle Res.

J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C116-C122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Garcia Diaz B.E. Gauthier S. Davies P.L.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that the protease core itself autolyzes with only trace contaminating Ca2+ present in experimental solutions (17Garcia Diaz B.E. Gauthier S. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3714-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified recombinant calpain-3, when free in solution, undergoes autolysis within 5 min in the presence of just 500 nm Ca2+ (18Branca D. Gugliucci A. Bano D. Brini M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although this does not necessarily mean that autolysis of calpain-3 in situ is similarly sensitive, it has been shown in fresh muscle homogenates that native calpain-3 autolyzes in a Ca2+- and time-dependent manner at [Ca2+] > 2 μm (14Murphy R.M. Snow R.J. Lamb G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C116-C122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Calpain-3 has been shown to bind to titin at both the N2A line and the M-line (19Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), although the latter binding site is not present in adult fast twitch muscle (12Ojima K. Ono Y. Hata S. Koyama S. Doi N. Sorimachi H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2006; 26: 409-417Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The N terminus of calpain-3 also binds at the Z-band to α-actinin (20Ojima K. Ono Y. Doi N. Yoshioka K. Kawabata Y. Labeit S. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14493-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that in adult human muscle, most calpain was localized in two transverse bands per sarcomere, one on each side of the Z-band, in the vicinity of the N2A line on titin (21Keira Y. Noguchi S. Minami N. Hayashi Y.K. Nishino I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, calpain-3 has also been reported to interact with the ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channels (RyRs) 2The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; IB, immunobuffer; MHC, myosin heavy chain; CSQ1, calsequestrin. 2The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; IB, immunobuffer; MHC, myosin heavy chain; CSQ1, calsequestrin. at the triad junctions (22Kramerova I. Kudryashova E. Wu B. Ottenheijm C. Granzier H. Spencer M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3271-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which are positioned closely in register with the titin N2A lines, leaving it unclear as to how much of the calpain-3 is associated with titin and how much with the triads. One issue with the study of Kramerova et al. (22Kramerova I. Kudryashova E. Wu B. Ottenheijm C. Granzier H. Spencer M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3271-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is that most of the calpain-3 segregating with the RyRs was autolyzed rather than in its native full-length form, leaving doubt about whether calpain-3 may have altered in position over the time scale involved in the prolonged spinning procedures used in preparation of the triad fractions, perhaps with autolysis altering its diffusibility or binding sites. Another recent investigation in myotubes concluded that calpain-3 changes in its position from the N2A line to the M-line when the sarcomeres are stretched to ∼120% or more of their resting length (i.e. ≥2.8 μm), with autolysis of the calpain-3 being required for this response (20Ojima K. Ono Y. Doi N. Yoshioka K. Kawabata Y. Labeit S. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14493-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this was concluded not by manipulation of sarcomere length but rather by comparing adjacent regions where the sarcomeres were either hypercontracted or overstretched, which probably resulted from uncontrolled increases in intracellular [Ca2+] causing contraction in one region leading to stretch of the adjacent region, possibly with the raised [Ca2+] in contracted regions causing concomitant autolysis of calpain-3. Thus, the factors controlling the localization and autolytic activation of calpain-3 remain unclear. In healthy adult muscle, the protease remains in its unautolyzed form even after intensive exercise, such as sprinting and endurance running in humans (14Murphy R.M. Snow R.J. Lamb G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C116-C122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, when subjects perform eccentric contractions, the damaging procedure where the muscles are stretched while contracting, such as in downhill walking, autolysis of calpain-3 is observed, but only 24 h later (23Murphy R.M. Goodman C.A. McKenna M.J. Bennie J. Leikis M. Lamb G.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2007; 103: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is the only physiological circumstance yet found to cause calpain-3 autolysis. The autolysis might have been in some way dependent on the fiber stretching, although this does not readily explain why the autolysis occurred many hours later rather than immediately. Most pertinently, one other unique feature of eccentric contraction is that it results in the resting cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (usually said to be in the range ∼50–100 nm), increasing 1.5–2-fold for 24 h or more (24Balnave C.D. Allen D.G. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Lynch G.S. Fary C.J. Williams D.A.

Physiol. 2002; 282: R1122-R1132PubMed Google Scholar), and this may be critical for calpain-3 autolysis. Here, we use single muscle fibers skinned by microdissection under paraffin oil to investigate the localization and diffusibility of calpain-3 in resting fibers in situ. Furthermore, we examine the effects of sarcomere stretch and raised [Ca2+], both transient large rises during normal tetanic contraction and prolonged small increases of the resting level, on the diffusibility, localization, and autolytic activation of the calpain. Collection of Tissues and Skeletal Muscle Fibers-With the approval of the La Trobe University Animal Ethics Committee, male Long-Evans hooded rats (∼6–8 months old) were killed by overdose with fluothane (2%, v/v). Both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were rapidly excised and pinned at resting length under paraffin oil and kept cool (∼10 °C) on an ice pack. Most experiments utilized EDL muscle fibers that had been mechanically skinned to allow manipulation of the intracellular environment, although a comparison between EDL and soleus muscle was performed using intact segments of individual fibers. Single fibers were mechanically skinned, as described previously (28Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 478: 331-339Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To remove the sarcolemma (or surface membrane), a small number of myofibrils were pulled away from the rest of the fiber with the sarcolemma forming into a “cuff” of membrane as it rolled back on itself along the fiber (29Murphy R.M. Mollica J.P. Lamb G.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the diffusibility, Ca2+-sensitivity, and Triton wash-out of calpain-3, skinned fiber segments (∼3 mm long) were either treated in a microcentrifuge tube in 5–10 μl of solution (see below) or mounted onto a force transducer to allow the fiber to be stretched where treatment was in a 10-μl droplet of solution under paraffin oil. Treated fibers were collected into a fresh aliquot of the given treatment solution mixed 2:1 (v/v) with 3× solubilizing buffer (0.125 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 4 m urea, 10% mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue). Solutions were collected separately into solubilizing buffer. Most fibers collected were heated (95–100 °C, 4 min), although when fibers were collected for examination of the RyR they were not heated. Samples were stored at -20 °C until analyzed. Experiments were conducted at 23 ± 2 °C. Solutions-The well buffered, low [Ca2+] physiological solution contained 90 mm Hepes, 50 mm EGTA, 8 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 36 mm Na+, 126 mm K+, 10.3 mm total Mg2+, pH 7.10, and pCa (equal to -log10 [Ca2+] >9 or [Ca2+] <10 nm). A well buffered, high [Ca2+] physiological solution contained 50 mm Ca-EGTA (pCa ∼4.7) and 8.12 mm Mg2+. Similar solutions were prepared without ATP, where ATP and creatine phosphate were absent, and there was 18 mm HDTA2- (Fluka, Bachs, Switzerland). To prepare solutions containing Ca2+ well buffered at 50 and 200 nm, the pCa 9 and pCa 4.7 solutions were mixed in the ratios 4:1 (50 nm) and 1:1 (200 nm). A weakly buffered solution was prepared where the EGTA was replaced by HDTA2- (50 mm) and then 50 μm EGTA was added (see “Electrical Stimulation”). A further solution containing 40 μm Ca2+ was prepared containing 90 mm Hepes, 66 mm HDTA2-, 1.5 mm Mg2+, 1.2 mm CaCO3, 36 mm Na+, 126 mm K+, pH 7.10. In all solutions, the free [Mg2+] was 1 mm. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Treatment of Fibers to Examine Diffusibility, Ca2+ Sensitivity, Effect of ATP, and Triton Solubility of Calpain-3-Calpain-3 was analyzed in individual fiber segments or groups of three mechanically skinned fiber segments following exposures to 10 μl of solution in microcentrifuge tubes. To examine the diffusibility of calpain-3, skinned fiber segments were exposed to well buffered, low [Ca2+] physiological solution containing ATP for 2, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min. The partitioning of calpain-3, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps (SERCA1), RyR, calsequestrin 1 (CSQ1), and actin into solution in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 prepared in the low [Ca2+] physiological solution was examined. Groups of three mechanically skinned EDL fiber segments were placed in 1% Triton solution for 10, 30, 60, or 120 min. Calpain-3 was analyzed in fibers following 60 min of exposure to a solution containing either 50 nm Ca2+ or 200 nm Ca2+, with or without ATP (see above). In all experiments, fibers were vortexed periodically during exposure times, following which fibers and solutions were collected as described. Stretching Fibers-To examine the effect of stretching a fiber on the diffusibility of calpain-3, groups of three mechanically skinned EDL fiber segments were tied in parallel with surgical thread, mounted onto a force transducer at resting length, and then stretched to double their length under paraffin oil. The fibers were then transferred to a droplet of well buffered low [Ca2+] solution either with or without ATP for 30 or 60 min, respectively, following which the fibers and solutions were collected as described above. Electrical Stimulation of Mechanically Skinned Muscle Fibers- Mechanically skinned fibers were electrically stimulated, as described previously (30Verburg E. Dutka T.L. Lamb G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C1199-C1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Importantly, in these experiments, the [Ca2+] was only weakly buffered (50 μm EGTA compared with 50 mm EGTA in well Ca2+-buffered solutions described above), allowing the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] to increase as would occur in vivo, resulting in force production that was measured by a force transducer. Tetani were elicited with 50-Hz trains for 0.2 s, and after 13–16 tetani individual fibers (n = 4) were collected into solubilizing buffer and prepared for Western blotting as described above. Antibodies-Calpain-3 (mouse monoclonal 12A2, Novocastra, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK), calpain-3 anti-pIS2C (goat polyclonal, provided by Prof. Sorimachi, Japan), SERCA1 (mouse monoclonal CaF2-5D2 clone, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), RyR1 (mouse monoclonal, 34C clone, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), CSQ1; mouse monoclonal VIIIDI2 clone, ab2824; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and actin (rabbit polyclonal, affinity-isolated, A2066; Sigma) were used. Western Blotting-Individual fiber segments and their corresponding wash solutions were analyzed for calpain-3 protein content by Western blotting using protocols similar to those described previously (29Murphy R.M. Mollica J.P. Lamb G.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 31Murphy R.M. Verburg E. Lamb G.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 576: 595-612Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 6–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and probed for calpain-3 (1:200), SERCA1 (1:200), RyR1 (1:200), CSQ1 (1:2000), and actin (1:200) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.025% Tween (PBST). Following transfer, the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was stained with BioSafe Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad) for detection of myosin heavy chain (MHC) used as a sensitive indicator of the absence of myofibrillar contamination in wash solutions. Images were collected following exposure to chemiluminescent substrate using a CCD camera attached to a ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) and using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Densitometry was performed with the Quantity One software. In all experiments examining the diffusibility of proteins, a sample pair consisted of the fiber segments and their corresponding wash solutions (e.g. Triton solution, 50 nm Ca2+ solution), with each pair being run side by side on SDS-PAGE. The amount of a given protein in a wash was expressed as a percentage of the total of the protein detected in the wash and its matched fiber segments. For each gel run, intact fiber segments were run as indicators of the total amount of each protein typically present in an untreated fiber segment. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy-The intracellular location of calpain-3 was examined in isolated rat EDL muscle fibers using the two different calpain-3 antibodies. EDL muscles were pinned at resting length on a Sylgaard-based dish and covered with 0.2% procaine in 0.9% NaCl for 5 min. After PBS washes, muscle was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 60 min while pinned and for a further 2 h in a vial at 4 °C. Individual fibers were teased from the muscle and blocked (immunobuffer (IB): 50 mm glycine, 0.033% saponin, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium azide) overnight. Fibers were exposed to calpain-3 antibodies diluted in IB, 12A2 (1:35), and IS2 (1:350) overnight with gentle rocking. IB washes were followed by exposing the fibers for 2 h to secondary antibodies (anti-goat Alexa 568 or anti-mouse Alexa 488; Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); 1:1000, 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS). Washes between changes in solution were in IB, with final washes in PBS. All incubations were at room temperature unless stated. All fluorescently labeled samples were stored in the dark at -20 °C. Images were collected using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope at 23–24 °C. The confocal scanning head was mounted on an inverted Leica TCS microscope, and images were acquired using Leica confocal software. Samples were viewed using an HCX PL APO ×63/1.20 W Corr/0.17 CS objective, and excitation was with a 20-milliwatt argon laser (488 nm) and 1.2-milliwatt HeNe laser (543 nm). Each confocal section was an average of 6–8 scans. Statistics-Data are expressed as means ± S.E., with the number of samples studied denoted as n. Student's t test (paired or unpaired as appropriate) and one-way analysis of variance were used to determine statistical significance (probability value, p < 0.05). All statistical analyses and data fits were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4. Measurement of Calpain-3 Binding and Diffusion in a Quiescent Muscle Fiber-In order to assess whether calpain-3 is normally freely diffusible in the cytoplasm of a muscle fiber, segments of individual fibers from freshly dissected rat EDL muscle were skinned by microdissection under paraffin oil and then washed in physiological intracellular solution for a set period. Western blotting was used to measure how much of the calpain-3 diffused into the wash solution and how much remained within the skinned fibers (Fig. 1). Each of these small samples was run in its entirety without any spinning or fractionation, and the density of the 94-kDa calpain-3 band was found to be directly proportional to the amount of sample run (see Fig. S1). Proteins that are freely diffusible in the cytoplasm are mostly washed out from skinned fibers within 1–2 min (31Murphy R.M. Verburg E. Lamb G.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 576: 595-612Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Stephenson G.M. Stephenson D.G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Strikingly, virtually none of the calpain-3 was lost from the skinned fibers here with 2 min of washing (Fig. 1). This was in marked contrast to an ∼82-kDa protein present in the same fiber segments, which was rapidly washed out of the fibers over such a period. Thus, it is clear that virtually all of the calpain-3 in a muscle fiber is tightly bound, and even after 2 h, <20% is lost from the fibers. Importantly too, all of the calpain-3 was present in its 94-kDa full-length, unautolyzed form, and it remained so even if it had diffused out of a fiber into the wash solution (e.g. lanes 5 and 7 in Fig. 1A). Autolysis of calpain-3 results in products of ∼60, 58, and 55 kDa (see below; Figs. 4 and 5); no such products were observed in these washout experiments. Furthermore, the total of the calpain-3 present in the fiber and wash solutions for each sample (normalized by MHC measurement of sample mass) showed no significant variation over the 2-h period nor any decrease relative to the total of the 82-kDa protein present in the same fiber and wash samples (not shown). Previous investigations had reported that calpain-3 readily autolyzed in vitro, but this was not the case here, most likely because the free [Ca2+] was tightly buffered at a low level at all times so as to prevent any Ca2+-dependent autolysis from occurring.FIGURE 4Effects of cytoplasmic [Ca2+], rigor, and stretch on calpain-3 diffusibility. A, bottom, Western blot showing calpain-3 (∼94 kDa) and 82-kDa protein remaining in EDL fiber segments (F) or in matching wash solution (W) following 60-min treatment with solutions containing either 200 or 50 nm Ca2+ with (+) or without (-) 8 mm ATP. All fibers were at normal resting length. In lane 2 (200 nm + ATP) a small amount of autolysis is detected in the fiber segments. Untreated intact segments are shown in lane 9 (Con). Top, MHC for each lane (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). B, relative amount of calpain-3 in wash solutions as percentage of total of all calpain-3 in fiber and wash lanes (including any autolyzed forms at 56–60 kDa). Values with and without ATP were significantly different (#, p < 0.05; one-way analysis of variance, Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis), but [Ca2+] (50 nm versus 200 nm) had no significant effect. C and D, similar data for fibers subjected to a maintained stretch to 2 times resting length or kept at resting length, with ATP absent (C) or present (D). [Ca2+] was buffered at 50 nm or lower in all cases. Fibers with no ATP were washed for 60 min, whereas the fibers with ATP were washed for only 30 min, so proportionately less was lost in the latter case.

They are nonetheless dynamic protective shells, as they participate in numerous processes of the virus cycle such as assembly, genome packaging, binding to receptors, and uncoating among others. In so doing, they undergo large scale conformational changes. Capsid proteins with essential enzymatic activities are being described more frequently. Here we show that the precursor (pVP2) of the capsid protein VP2 of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an avian double-stranded RNA virus, has autoproteolytic activity. The pVP2 C-terminal region is first processed by the viral protease VP4. VP2 Asp-431, lying in a flexible loop preceding the C-terminal most α-helix, is responsible for the endopeptidase activity that cleaves the Ala-441-Phe-442 bond to generate the mature VP2 polypeptide. The D431N substitution abrogates the endopeptidase activity without introducing a significant conformational change, as deduced from the three-dimensional structure of the mutant protein at 3.1 Å resolution. Combinations of VP2 polypeptides containing mutations affecting either the cleavage or the catalytic site revealed that pVP2 proteolytic processing is the result of a monomolecular cis-cleavage reaction. The D431N mutation does not affect the assembly of the VP2 trimers that constitute the capsid building block. Although VP2 D431N trimers are capable of assembling both pentamers and hexamers, expression of a polyprotein gene harboring the D431N mutation does not result in the assembly of IBDV virus-like particles. Reverse genetics analyses demonstrate that pVP2 self-processing is essential for the assembly of an infectious IBDV progeny.

Here we show that the precursor (pVP2) of the capsid protein VP2 of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an avian double-stranded RNA virus, has autoproteolytic activity. The pVP2 C-terminal region is first processed by the viral protease VP4. VP2 Asp-431, lying in a flexible loop preceding the C-terminal most α-helix, is responsible for the endopeptidase activity that cleaves the Ala-441-Phe-442 bond to generate the mature VP2 polypeptide. The D431N substitution abrogates the endopeptidase activity without introducing a significant conformational change, as deduced from the three-dimensional structure of the mutant protein at 3.1 Å resolution. Combinations of VP2 polypeptides containing mutations affecting either the cleavage or the catalytic site revealed that pVP2 proteolytic processing is the result of a monomolecular cis-cleavage reaction. The D431N mutation does not affect the assembly of the VP2 trimers that constitute the capsid building block. Although VP2 D431N trimers are capable of assembling both pentamers and hexamers, expression of a polyprotein gene harboring the D431N mutation does not result in the assembly of IBDV virus-like particles. Reverse genetics analyses demonstrate that pVP2 self-processing is essential for the assembly of an infectious IBDV progeny. Multiprotein assemblies are the basic cellular entities controlling fundamental biological processes. Viral capsids represent an excellent framework for the analysis of “built-in” features such as structural polymorphism and transient conformations. In addition, complex capsids may require one or more auxiliary proteins (scaffold, accessory, and proteolytic proteins) to trigger structural and functional changes. In this context, assembly of birnavirus capsid has resulted in an appropriate process for studying the coordination of molecular factors involved that, like in many other viruses, rarely leads to aberrant assemblies in vivo. Birnaviruses are a family of naked icosahedral viruses infecting rotifers, insects, fishes, and birds (1Delmas B. Kibenge F.S.B. Leong J.C. Mundt E. Vakharia V.N. Wu J.L. Fauquet C.M.

Although most of the research has been focused on the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an important avian pathogen (2van den Berg T.P. Eterradossi N. Toquin D. Meulemans G. Rev. Sci. Tech. 2000; 19: 509-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), available information suggests that all members of the family share similar replication strategies. The IBDV particle possesses a relatively complex icosahedral capsid based on a triangulation number T = 13 levo lattice composed by a single polypeptide known as VP2. Whereas the simplest capsids are built from 60 identical subunits and assembled into pentamers (T = 1), those with more than 60 subunits are assembled into pentamers and hexamers and cannot have identical but “quasi-equivalent” environments (T > 1) (3Caspar D.L.D. Klug A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1962; 27: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). The T number also describes the number of different environments occupied by the protein subunit (4Baker T.S. Olson N.H. Fuller S.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 862-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VP2 protein assembles into 260 trimers that form 12 pentamers and 120 hexamers (5Coulibaly F. Chevalier C. Gutsche I. Pous J. Navaza J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 10815-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). From strict geometric considerations, VP2 trimers have five distinct conformations. VP2 is synthesized as part of a polyprotein (∼110 kDa) that is cotranslationally self-cleaved, releasing three polypeptides, namely pVP2 (the VP2 precursor), VP4 (the protease), and VP3 (a polypeptide with scaffolding activity among others). pVP2 (512 residues, 54.4 kDa) undergoes subsequent, and much slower, processing events mediated by VP4 at three secondary targets (positions 487, 494, and 501) (8Sánchez A.B. Rodríguez J.F. Virology. 1999; 262: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the resulting intermediates are further cleaved between residues Ala-441 and Phe-442 to yield VP2 (47 kDa) and several C-terminal fragments (accounting for 7.4 kDa). Both the mechanism and the executor of the last pVP2 → VP2 proteolytic maturation remain unknown and are associated with the pVP2 assembly into a procapsid-like structure (9Chevalier C. Lepault J. Erk I. Da Costa B. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2384-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The released C-terminal segments remain associated to the capsid (10Da Costa B. Chevalier C.

Studies carried out with another birnavirus, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a pathogen of the aquatic fauna (12Dobos P. Annu. Rev. Fish Dis. 1996; 5: 25-54Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggest that the pVP2 → VP2 conversion is required for the maturation of quasi-spherical provirions into mature icosahedral virions (13Villanueva R.A. Galaz J.L. Valdes J.A. Jashes M.M. Sandino A.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13829-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This maturation mechanism is reminiscent of the post-assembly proteolytic maturation that takes place during the morphogenesis of some ssRNA icosahedral viruses, and in particular to those of noda- and tetraviruses (14Canady M.A. Tihova M. Hanzlik T.N. Johnson J.E. Yeager M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Schneemann A. Reddy V. Johnson J.E. Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 50: 381-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsid protein (CP) precursor, the α-protein, associates as a trimer, building a quasi-spherical provirion (16Gallagher T.M. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At low pH, the α-protein is autocatalytically processed, rendering the mature CP, known as β-protein, and the C-terminal γ-peptide (17Taylor D.J. Krishna N.K. Canady M.A. Schneemann A. Johnson J.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9972-9980Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This reaction is slow and dependent on a conserved Asp residue located in close proximity of the CP scissile bond (18Zlotnick A. Reddy V.S. Dasgupta R. Schneemann A. Ray Jr., W.J. Rueckert R.R. Johnson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13680-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maturation of the β-protein is accompanied by large conformational changes on the CP that irreversibly transforms the quasi-spherical (non-infectious) provirions into icosahedral infective virions (14Canady M.A. Tihova M.

Expression of VP2 alone results in the spontaneous assembly of icosahedral T = 1 subviral particles (SVP), an all-pentamer capsid ∼23 nm in diameter composed of 20 trimeric clusters of VP2. On the other hand, pVP2 expression leads to the assembly of tubular structures with a hexagonal lattice (7Castón J.R. Martínez-Torrecuadrada J.L. Maraver A. Lombardo E. Rodríguez J.F. Casal J.I.

The pVP2 C-terminal processing events are abolished when this protein is expressed using a baculovirus-based system. Notably, the pVP2 C-terminal region contains an amphipathic α-helix that plays an important role in allowing the formation of multiple VP2 conformations. VP3 also participates in the inherent conformational polymorphism of pVP2 through interaction with the pVP2 C-terminal end, working as a canonical scaffolding protein. The atomic structure of the VP2 polypeptide has been recently solved from T = 1 SVP (5Coulibaly F. Chevalier C. Gutsche I. Pous J. Navaza J. Bressanelli S. Delmas B. Rey F.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 761-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Garriga D. Querol-Audi J. Abaitua F. Saugar I. Pous J. Verdaguer N. Castón J.R. Rodriguez J.F. J.

Biol. 2006; 155: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The VP2 subunit folds into three domains termed projection (P), shell (S), and base (B). Domains S and P are β barrels with a jelly roll topology, whereas the B domain is formed by α-helices facing the interior of the shell, corresponding to its N and C termini. The helical C-terminal arm of VP2 establishes a domain swapping and mediates interactions between adjacent VP2 trimers increasing their stability. S and B domains share a high degree of structural similarity with noda- and tetravirus α-protein. pVP2 and α-protein cleavage sites are deeply buried inside the capsid shell, thus sheltered from possible attacks by cellular proteases. Fitting the VP2 atomic structure into the three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy map of IBDV T = 1 SVP allowed us to identify at least two conformations for its C-terminal region (19Saugar I. Luque D. Ona A. Rodriguez J.F. Carrascosa J.L. Trus B.L. Caston J.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Luque D. Saugar I.

These structural considerations tempted us to suggest Asp-391 and/or Asp-431 as candidate catalytic residues capable of triggering a hydrolytic cleavage either on its own scissile bond or on that from a neighboring pVP2 molecule (Fig. 1). The results presented here demonstrate that residue Asp-431 is essential for pVP2 proteolytic maturation, thus leading us to propose that birnavirus pVP2 polypeptides are autocatalytically processed. This finding provides yet another piece of evidence reinforcing the hypothesis about a common ancestor linking icosahedral ssRNA and dsRNA viruses. Cells and Viruses-Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) VT7LacOI/POLY and recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) FB/VP2-452 and FB/VP2-501 were previously described (7Castón J.R. Martínez-Torrecuadrada J.L.

Generation of the Recombinant Viruses VT7/LacOI-Using PCR overlap extension five mutant pVP2 genes were constructed containing the following single and double mutations: A441G, F442G, A441G/F442G, D431N, and D391N. PCR reactions were carried out using the pVP2 gene, cloned in the pFB/POLY plasmid as template, and the set of mutator primers (supplemental Table 1) in combination with primers 5′-GCCATCACAAGCCTCAGCGTTGG and 5′-GTGCACCGCGGAGTACCCCAG for A441G, F442G, and A441G/F442G. Primers 5′-GATGCCATCACAAGCCTCAGC and 5′-CGCAGTCGAGGTTGTGTGCAC were used for D431N and D391N. The resulting DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and SphI and used to replace the original NdeI-SphI fragment of the pVOTE.2/POLY plasmid previously described (25Martinez-Torrecuadrada J.L.

The pVOTE.2/D431N and pVOTE.2/D391N plasmids were used as a template for PCR synthesis to generate rBV/VP2-452D431N, rBV/VP2-452D391N, and rBV/VP2-501D431N. PCR was performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with common 5′ and 3′ end primer (5′-GCGCAGATCTATGACAAACCTGTCAGATCAAACCC and 5′-GCGCAAGCTTACCTTATGGCCCGGATTATGTCTTTGAAGC). BglII-HindIII-digested PCR fragments were cloned into FastBac (Invitrogen) BamH1-HindIII polylinker sites for protein expression. Selection of derived bacmids from the DH10Bac Escherichia coli strain and preparation for Lipofectine transfection were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). The constructs were expressed in H5 insect cells (29Maraver A. Oña A. Abaitua F. Gonzalez D. Clemente R. Ruiz-Díaz J.A. Castón J.R. Pazos F. Rodríguez J.F. J.

Immunoprecipitation of VP2-QM7 cell monolayers were infected with the corresponding rVV at a multiplicity of infection of 2 plaque-forming units/cell and maintained in the presence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase. At 18 h postinfection (pi), cells were washed twice and metabolically labeled with methionine-free DMEM containing 125 μCi/ml [35S]Met and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase for 1 h. After this period cells were washed 3 times with DMEM containing a 10-fold concentration of cold methionine and then maintained in DMEM supplemented with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase and 2% fetal calf serum. At 0, 24, 48, and 72 h post-labeling, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630). Immunoprecipitations were carried as described elsewhere (26Lombardo E. Maraver A. Castón J.R. Rivera J. Fernandez-Arias A. Serrano A. Carrascosa J.L. Rodriguez J.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6973-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer to a 1× final concentration and subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Reverse Genetic Analysis-DNA fragments containing cDNA versions corresponding to the complete positive strand RNAs of to the IBDV Soroa strain segments A and B, fused to the T7 bacteriophage promoter (in 5′ position with respect of the IBDV cDNAs), and a cDNA corresponding to the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (in 3′ position with respect of the IBDV cDNAs) sequences were generated by in vitro gene synthesis (Genescript Co.) and inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pUC57 cloning plasmid (GenBank™/EMBL). These plasmids were named pT7-SA-Rz and pT7-SB-Rz, containing the cDNA corresponding to segment A and B, respectively. Plasmid pVOTE/D431N, described above, was digested with SphI and NdeI and ligated to pT7-SA-Rz previously digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pT7-SA(D431N)-Rz, was sequenced to determine the correctness of its sequence. QM7 cells were transfected with a combination of either pT7-SA-Rz and pT7-SB-Rz or pT7-SA(D431N)-Rz and pT7-SB-Rz, respectively, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 6 h after transfection cultures were infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/cell of VT7LacOI, an rVV inducibly expressing the T7 RNA polymerase. After infection, cultures were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase. At 72 h pi, cultures were harvested and subjected to three freeze-thawing cycles. After removing cell debris by low speed centrifugation, supernatants were recovered and passed through 0.1-μm filters (Millipore) to eliminate contaminant rVV particles and used to infect fresh QM7 cell monolayers. Infections were performed in triplicate with undiluted and 10-1-10-5 serial dilutions of the initial stocks. A set of infected cells was used to determine the IBDV titer at 72 h pi. Another set was harvested at 72 h pi, and the corresponding extracts were analyzed for the presence of VP1 and VP2 proteins. The absence of contaminant infecting rVV particles was also monitored by Western blot using the mAbC3. The third set was also harvested at 72 h pi and used to collect cells originally infected with the undiluted stocks. These samples were subjected to three freeze-thawing cycles, and the procedure described above was repeated, thus allowing the analysis of the initial virus stock and two subsequent virus amplification rounds. Purification of IBDV Polyprotein-derived Structures-QM7 and H5 cells (2-5 × 108 cells) were infected with appropriate rVV or rBV (multiplicity of infection 1-5 plaque-forming units/cell). At 72 h pi in rVV assays and at 48 h pi in rBV assays, cells were harvested, lysed in PES buffer (25 mm piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2) plus 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) on ice, and processed on a 25% sucrose cushion and a linear 20-50% sucrose gradient (19Saugar I.

The particulate material containing polyprotein-derived structures was concentrated 20-fold by ultracentrifugation and used for SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and electron microscopy analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot-Infected cell extracts (25 μl) or concentrated sucrose gradient fractions (10 μl) were added to Laemmli' s sample buffer to a 1× final concentration and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Electrophoresis was performed in 11% polyacrylamide gels. Western blot analyses were carried out using an anti-VP2 serum as described (26Lombardo E. Maraver A. Castón J.R. Rivera J.

Electron Microscopy-2-5-μl samples of concentrated sucrose gradient fractions were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated grids for 2 min and negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Micrographs were recorded with a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope operating at 100 kV at a nominal magnification of 40,000×. Crystallization and Data Collection-Cubic crystals belonging to space group P213 (a = b = c = 326.72 Å) were obtained by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops at room temperature by mixing 2 volumes of VP2-452_D431N-derived SVP (1.6 mg/ml) and 1 volume of the reservoir solution containing 14-17% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, and 5% isopropanol. Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotecting solution containing 20% glycerol in the crystallization buffer and incubated for 1 min before they were flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal using synchrotron radiation at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France (beamline ID14-2) to 3.1 Å resolution. Diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (30Leslie A. Moras D. Podjarny A. Thiery J. Crystallographic computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and internally scaled with SCALA (31Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Structure Refinement-Crystals of D431N-mutated SVP were isomorphous to the previously obtained of native VP2 SVPs (PDB code 2GSY (22Garriga D. Querol-Audi J. Abaitua F. Saugar I. Pous J. Verdaguer N.

The initial maps for D431N-mutant were obtained after a rigid body fitting of the coordinates of native SVPs (PDB code 2GSY) to the new unit cell. The D431N mutation and other subtle changes were manually rebuilt using Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 2. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (code 3FBM). Effect of Mutations on Asp Residues Potentially Involved on pVP2 → VP2 Proteolytic Maturation-(p)VP2 residues Asp-391 and Asp-431 appeared to be likely candidates to trigger a nucleophilic attack on the pVP2 441-442 scissile bond. The IBDV polyprotein expressed by an inducible rVV provided an excellent framework to analyzing the possible role of residues Asp-391 and Asp-431 on pVP2 proteolytic maturation. As described above, the use of this system allows the accumulation of pVP2 and VP2 and the efficient assembly of virus-like particles (VLP), structurally undistinguishable from purified IBDV virions (26Lombardo E.

Casrrascosa J.L. Patton J.T. Segmented double-stranded RNA viruses: Structure and Molecular Biology. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk2008: 133-144Google Scholar). Hence, two single-point mutant versions of the IBDV polyprotein gene were generated and used to construct two rVV, called VT7LacOI/D431N and VT7LacOI/D391N, in which Asp residues under study at positions 431 and 391 were replaced by Asn residues, respectively. Cultures infected with these two rVV were harvested at different times pi (24, 48, and 72 h), and the corresponding extracts were analyzed by Western blot using VP2-specific serum. As a control for this experiment, cultures were also infected with VT7LacOI/POLY, a rVV expressing the wild-type polyprotein gene (26Lombardo E. Maraver A. Castón J.R. Rivera J. Fernandez-Arias A. Serrano A. Carrascosa J.L. Rodriguez J.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6973-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although expression of wild-type and D391N polyproteins led to accumulation of both pVP2 and VP2 polypeptides, samples from cells expressing polyprotein D431N showed equivalent pVP2 levels but did not contain detectable VP2 (Fig. 2A). These results strongly suggested that the D431N substitution specifically abrogated pVP2 proteolytic processing and were further confirmed using an alternative experimental approach. QM7 cells were infected with the three described rVV and, at 19 h pi, the cultures were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. Thereafter, cultures were extensively washed and incubated with fresh medium supplemented with an excess of cold methionine. At different times post-labeling (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), cells were harvested, and the corresponding extracts were subjected to immune precipitation using anti-VP2 antiserum. The results of this analysis (Fig. 2B) demonstrate that whereas in cells infected with VT7LacOI/POLY and VT7LacOI/D391N, the pVP2 polypeptide is progressively processed to mature VP2, the pVP2 polypeptide encoded by VT7LacOI/D431N remains intact for the durati"

The aim of our study was to analyze the mRNA levels, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain, of the genes that may possibly be associated with aggression consistently shown by male mice in special experimental settings. Methodology/Principal Findings The genes were Th, Dat1, Snca and Bdnf; the male mice were a group of animals that had each won 20 daily encounters in succession and a group of animals that had the same winning track record followed by a no-fight period for 14 days. Increased Th, Dat1 and Snca mRNA levels were in the fresh-from-the-fight group as compared to the controls. Increased Th and Dat1 mRNA levels were in the no-fight winners as compared to the controls. Significant positive correlations were found between the level of aggression and Th and Snca mRNA levels. Conclusions Repeated positive fighting experience enhances the expression of the Th, Dat1 and Snca genes, which are associated with brain dopaminergic systems. The expression of the Th and Dat1 genes stays enhanced for a long time."
https://openalex.org/W2027522948,"Leptin is a major determinant of energy homeostasis, acting both centrally and in the gastrointestinal tract. We previously reported that acute leptin treatment enhances the absorption of di- and tripeptides via the proton-dependent PepT1 transporter. In this study, we investigated the long term effect of leptin on PepT1 levels and activity in Caco2 cell monolayers in vitro. We then assessed the significance of the regulation of PepT1 in vivo in a model of diet-induced obesity. We demonstrated that 1) leptin regulated PepT1 at the transcriptional level, via the MAPK pathway, and at the translational level, via ribosomal protein S6 activation, in Caco2 cells and 2) this activation was systematically followed by a time- and concentration-dependent loss of leptin action reflecting desensitization. Deciphering this desensitization, we demonstrated that leptin induced a down-regulation of its own receptor protein and mRNA expression. More importantly, we showed, in mice with diet-induced obesity, that a 4-week hypercaloric diet resulted in a 46% decrease in PepT1-specific transport, because of a 30% decrease in PepT1 protein and a 50% decrease in PepT1 mRNA levels. As shown in Caco2 cells, these changes in PepT1 were supported by a parallel 2-fold decrease in leptin receptor expression in mice. Taken together, these results indicate that during induction of obesity, leptin resistance may also occur peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the absorption of oligopeptides and peptidomimetic drugs.

Leptin, the ob gene product, was first described as an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in fat and energy storage (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that other tissues, such as the placenta, brain, bone marrow, and stomach produce leptin (2Kiess W. Petzold S. Topfer M. Garten A. Bluher S. Kapellen T. Korner A. Kratzsch J. Best. Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 22: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This hormone produced by multiple sites is now thought to have pleiotropic functions, controlling not only food intake, but also immunity, the autonomic nervous system, or tissue remodeling and growth (reviewed in Ref. 3Myers M.G. Cowley M.A. Munzberg H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 537-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that leptin is closely associated with intestinal functions, with potential indirect effects on energy balance. Indeed, leptin can be secreted by the gastric mucosa and is rapidly released into the intestine following the ingestion of a meal as an active protein, which may be free or bound to its receptor (4Bado A.

Furthermore, leptin receptors are found on both the apical and basolateral sides of the enterocyte, facilitating the action of both adipocyte-derived leptin (on the basolateral side) and gastric leptin (on the apical side) (8Buyse M. Berlioz F. Guilmeau S. Tsocas A. Voisin T. Peranzi G. Merlin D. Laburthe M. Lewin M.J. Roze C. Bado A. J. Clin.

In this view, leptin has been shown to regulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 and cholecystokinin by enteroendocrine cells (6Guilmeau S. Buyse M. Tsocas A. Laigneau J.P. Bado A.

Leptin directly modulates nutrient absorption by decreasing carbohydrate absorption (via its action on the Na+/glucose cotransporter 1) and cholesterol absorption (13Ducroc R. Guilmeau S. Akasbi K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28182-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and fatty acid uptake and transport by triggering the expression of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (17Dube N.

In their studies of the role of leptin in the intestinal absorption of proteins and peptides, Kiely et al. (18Kiely J.M. Noh J.H. Svatek C.L. Pitt H.A. Swartz-Basile D.A. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2006; 41: 1243-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that the activity of the jejunal aminopeptidase and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, cleaving mono- and dipeptides, respectively, were lower in leptin-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. The relationship between leptin and PepT1 (H+-coupled peptide cotransporter 1), which transports most of the di- and tripeptides in the intestine, together with peptidomimetic drugs, has been the matter of studies. Gastric leptin has been shown to increase PepT1 activity within minutes by recruiting the preformed intracellular pool of the transporter to the brush border of the enterocytes, without modifying PepT1 mRNA levels (8Buyse M. Berlioz F. Guilmeau S. Tsocas A. Voisin T. Peranzi G. Merlin D. Laburthe M. Lewin M.J. Roze C. Bado A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we and others have reported that leptin is capable of increasing the mRNA levels for this transporter, thereby reconstituting the pool of PepT1 after long term challenge in vitro and in vivo (19Hindlet P. Bado A. Farinotti R. Buyse M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 323: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Nduati V. Yan Y. Dalmasso G. Driss A. Sitaraman S. Merlin D. J. Biol.

Building on these findings, this study was designed to investigate the regulation of PepT1 in a model of diet-induced obesity in mice characterized by progressive long term hyperleptinemia. It has been suggested that central densensitization to leptin is associated with obesity in this model. However, it was unknown whether such densensitization also occurred in the small intestine. We found that PepT1 regulation was dependent on the duration of leptin treatment and diet and investigated the possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Cell Culture-Caco2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in an environment containing 5% CO2, with 95% humidity, at 37 °C. The cells were seeded on Costar Transwell® membrane inserts with 0.4-μm pores (Corning, NY) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. The experiments were conducted on the 17th day of culture, after treatment in both the apical and basal sides with leptin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and/or with one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; Gly-Sar, glycyl-sarcosine; HC, hypercaloric chow; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling. inhibitors U0126 (Cayman Chemicals, SPI-BIO, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) and PD98059 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) or the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin (Cayman Chemicals). Animals-The experiments were conducted in male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France). The animals were housed in a room maintained at 21 °C, with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles and free access to water (accreditation number A92-01901). They were fed with standard laboratory chow (SC, control mice) (A04 biscuits; UAR, Villemoisson, France) or a high fat diet (referred to as the hypercaloric (HC) diet; purchased from SAFE, Augy, France). The standard chow diet provides 2,820 kcal/kg of food and contains 3% fat (270 kcal/kg, accounting for 9.6% of the kilocalories), 48% complex carbohydrates (1,910 kcal/kg, 67.7% kcal, primarily starch), and 16% protein (640 kcal/kg, 22.7% kcal). The HC diet provides 5,320 kcal/kg and includes 36% fat (3,220 kcal/kg, 60.5% kcal, primarily lard), 35% simple carbohydrates (1,440 kcal/kg, 26.3% kcal, mainly saccharose), and 18% protein (700 kcal/kg, 13.2% kcal). Actual food consumption was measured for both diets. All of the experiments were performed in accordance with European Committee Standards concerning the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the head of the staff responsible for laboratory animal care. PepT1 Activity in Caco2 Cells-PepT1 activity was assessed by following the transport of cephalexin (Sigma-Aldrich), a PepT1 substrate, across the Caco2 monolayer. All of the procedures were as previously described (19Hindlet P. Bado A. Farinotti R. Buyse M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 323: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the apical compartments of the Transwell® apparatus were filled with 0.5 ml of 1 μm cephalexin. Basolateral compartments were sampled at t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min, and the cephalexin concentration was calculated after high pressure liquid chromatography determination. The apparent permeability (Papp) was used to assess cephalexin transport across the monolayer, according to the following equation Papp = (dQ/dt)·(V/Q0·A), where V is the volume of the basolateral compartment, Q0 is the total amount of cephalexin in the apical compartment, A is the surface area of the membrane, and dQ/dt is the permeability rate (slope of plot of the concentration in the basolateral compartment against time). Transport of [3H]Gly-Sar in the Mouse Jejunal Loop ex Vivo Model-The animals were killed, and the transport of Gly-Sar, a specific PepT1 substrate, was monitored in the ex vivo jejunal loop model. Briefly, a 6-cm segment of jejunum was filled with 100 μl/cm Krebs modified buffer, pH 6, containing [3H]Gly-Sar (1 μmol/liter [3H]Gly-Sar Isobio, Fleurus, Belgium; specific activity, 0.5 Ci/mmol), 20 μmol/liter Gly-Sar (Sigma-Aldrich), and 500 mg/liter phenol red, to assess paracellular permeability. The segment was placed in a 37 °C thermostat-controlled bath of Krebs modified buffer at pH 7.4, through which a 95:5 mixture of O2:CO2 was continually bubbled. The samples were withdrawn from the bath at t = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min, and radioactivity was measured with a β counter. Apparent permeability to Gly-Sar was estimated as follows: Papp = (dQ/dt)·(V/Q0·A), where V is the volume of the bath, A is the area of the loop, Q0 is the total amount of radiolabeled Gly-Sar introduced into the loop, and dQ/dt is the flux across the intestinal loop. Protein Extraction-All of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C to inhibit proteolysis. For total protein extraction, Caco2 cells or samples scraped from the jejunum were homogenized in TENTS lysis buffer (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 126 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% SDS (v/v), and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 15 min. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. This supernatant corresponded to a total protein extract. For the study of protein phosphorylation, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (containing 90 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), protease inhibitors, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate as phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The phosphorylated proteins were present in the supernatant. Western Blot Analysis-The proteins (20–25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE in gels containing 8–12% acrylamide. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting. The dilutions of primary antibodies used were: 1:1000 for PepT1 (gift from Dr Merlin for in vitro studies or from Prof. Kapel for in vivo studies), 1:100 for Ob-R (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:5000 for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 (Tyr694) and STAT5 (Tyr705) (Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France), 1:1000 for total STAT3 and STAT5 (C-20 and C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000 for phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (ERK1/2) (Cell Signaling Technology), and total ERK (K-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000 for phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:5,000 for β-actin (clone AC74; Sigma-Aldrich). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000, and the membranes were probed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity of the bands was quantified with Scion Image (National Institutes of Health, Scion Corporation, Bethesda, MD). For the study of the expression of phosphorylated protein, the membranes were blotted with antibodies specific for phospho-STATs or phospho-ERK and then scraped and reblotted with antibodies recognizing total STATs or total ERK protein. Real Time PCR Analysis-Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method, with RNAble (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription from 5 μg of total RNA, with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). We quantified cDNA with the Light Cycler system (Roche Applied Science), used according to the manufacturers instructions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or S14 was used as a housekeeping gene. The primers were designed with Primer3 software (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of the primers used for the reverse transcription-PCR studiesGeneAccess numberPrimer sequences (5′ → 3′)SizebphPepT1NM_005073F-GTTGGCAACATCATTGTGCT149R-TCCGCTGGGTTGATGTAAGThGAPDHNM_002046F-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG112R-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTChOb-RaNM_002303F-TCACACCAAAGAATGAAAAAGC119R-TGCTTGATAAAAAGATGCTCAAAChOb-RbNM_001003679F-CCTGGGCACAAGGACTTAAT137R-CCTTCTTCAAAATGTAAAAATCTTCThSOCS3NM_003955F-CAAGGACGGAGACTTCGATT137R-AACTTGCTGTGGGTGACCAThPTP1BNM_002827F-TTCATCATGGGGGACTCTTC126R-ATTGTGTGGCTCCAGGATTCmPepT1NM_053079F-CGTGCACGTAGCACTGTCCAT66R-GGCTTGATTCCTCCTGTACCAmOb-RbNM_146146F-CGCTTCCCTTGTGAATTTTAA118R-ACAGTGTCCAGGAAAGGATGAmS14NM_020600F-CAGGACCAAGACCCCTGGA69R-ATCTTCATCCCAGAGCGAGC Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis-All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Mann-Whitney tests (or Student’s t tests, as appropriate) were used to compare pairs of means, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare groups of more than two means. Statistical analysis was performed with Graph Pad Prism (Graph Pad software, San Diego, CA). The values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all analyses. Leptin Induces a Time- and Concentration-dependent Regulation of PepT1 Levels and Activity-Challenging Caco2 cells with 0.2 nm leptin (corresponding to a normoleptinemia) for 7 days induced a significant 2.3-fold increase in cephalexin transport across the Caco2 monolayer, consistent with an increase in PepT1 activity (Fig. 1A). The increase in PepT1 activity was associated with a parallel 3.2-fold increase in protein levels (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, in Caco2 cells treated for 7 days with 1 nm (corresponding to hyperleptinemia), the increase in PepT1 protein levels and activity was no longer observed, indicating resistance to the administered leptin. We investigated this phenomenon further by carrying out a time course study of the effect of leptin. As expected, the lower concentration (0.2 nm) of leptin, which increased PepT1 activity and total protein levels after a 7-day challenge, increased PepT1 protein levels in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Indeed, 0.2 nm leptin induced a gradual increase in PepT1 levels, which peaked after 7 days of treatment. Interestingly, the higher concentration (1 nm) of leptin rapidly induced the expression of total PepT1 protein (2-fold increase) at 24 h, but this effect was transient and completely disappeared after 72-h treatment, reflecting desensitization. We then investigated whether the change in PepT1 protein levels could be explained by changes in mRNA levels. For both concentrations tested, leptin up-regulated PepT1 mRNA levels (×1.7 and 1.4 for 0.2 and 1 nm leptin, respectively; Fig. 3A), but this effect was only transient, with PepT1 mRNA levels returning to basal levels after treatment. More importantly, we found that mRNA levels peaked after only 6 h for the 1 nm treatment, whereas the peak was reached later (48 h) with the 0.2 nm treatment. Thus, the time at which mRNA levels peaked also appeared to depend on leptin concentration. Indeed, with a 0.5 nm leptin challenge, peak mRNA levels were reached at 24 h of treatment, and there was an inverse correlation between the time taken to reach peak PepT1 levels and leptin concentration (Fig. 3B). Leptin Increases PepT1 Protein Levels by Enhancing Its Translation-We then investigated the apparent discrepancy between the sustained levels of PepT1 protein at 7 days with the 0.2 nm treatment and the peak in mRNA levels observed after only 48 h of treatment. We hypothesized that an enhancement of translation might account for this pattern. We therefore analyzed phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, which is involved in the activation of translation, in a time course experiment. Densitometric analysis of the ribosomal protein S6 showed that treatment with 0.2 nm leptin was associated with a significant increase in S6 phosphorylation at 24 h treatment, with higher levels of phosphorylation persisting for a further 7 days (Fig. 4A). By contrast, when cells were treated with 1 nm leptin, ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation occurred earlier and was transient, peaking after 24 h of treatment and returning to basal level thereafter. Fig. 4B showed that the activation of S6 by leptin was, at least in part, mediated by the MAPK pathway as the inhibitor U0126 reversed the action of leptin on S6 phosphorylation. Moreover, the induction of PepT1 protein expression by leptin after 7 days of treatment was totally abolished by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin that blocks the S6 kinase action (Fig. 4C). Leptin Activates the Production of PepT1 mRNA through the ERK1/2 Pathway, but Not by STAT3 or STAT5 Activation-We then focused on intracellular events that might account for the effect of leptin on PepT1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, no phosphorylation of either STAT3 or STAT5 was observed under our conditions. However, a rapid and transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) occurred after 0.2 nm leptin treatment, corresponding to the phosphorylation of the two immunoreactive bands at 42 and 44 kDa (Fig. 5A). In addition, the effect of leptin was partially reversed by the MAPK/ERK1/2 kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Leptin Does Not Modify SOCS3 or Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase 1B Activation-We investigated the origin of the desensitization observed after activation by assessing the transcription of two genes encoding known inhibitors of leptin signaling: SOCS3 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. No significant change in mRNA levels was observed under the conditions in which Caco2 cell desensitization occurred (data not shown). Thus, Caco2 cell desensitization is unlikely to have been caused by these inhibitors in our conditions. Leptin Regulates Its Own Receptors, Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb-Alternatively, the desensitization of PepT1 expression and activity may reflect changes in leptin receptor expression. We observed the same pattern of expression for leptin receptor as the one seen for PepT1; leptin induced an increase of leptin receptor protein and mRNA levels, followed by a large decrease in both concentrations. Indeed, receptor protein or mRNA levels did not return to basal expression but diminished further and displayed a 2–4-fold decrease (Fig. 6). Moreover, the time at which peak expression occurred was again concentration-dependent. Indeed, 1 nm leptin treatment rapidly induced mRNA Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra (long and short form leptin receptors) expression, with levels peaking after 12 h of treatment, whereas the action of 0.2 nm leptin was more gradual with maximal Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra mRNA levels after 24–48 h of incubation (Fig. 6, B and C). Mice Fed a HC Diet Display Lower Levels of PepT1 Expression and Activity and of Ob-R Expression-We then investigated whether the changes in PepT1 and leptin receptors triggered by leptin in vitro could be observed in an in vivo model displaying hyperleptinemia (i.e. mice fed an HC diet). As expected, 4 weeks on the HC diet led to increases in weight gain, plasma leptin and insulin concentrations, and glycemia. In addition, this diet also resulted in a significantly higher daily caloric intake, with no significant effect on protein intake (Table 2). The HC diet induced a 46% decrease in PepT1-specific Gly-Sar transport (Fig. 7A), with no change in paracellular transport, as monitored by red phenol flux (data not shown). The modification in PepT1 activity was supported by a 30% decrease in PepT1 protein levels and a 50% decrease in PepT1 mRNA levels (Fig. 7, B and C). Moreover, leptin receptor expression was reduced by 40% by 4 weeks on the HC diet (Fig. 7D). In our previous study, we induced hyperleptinemia in rats by subcutaneously implanting an Alzet® pump delivering 1 μg of leptin/g/day for 7 days. By contrast to the decrease in leptin receptor levels observed in mice fed the HC diet, hyperleptinemia in leptin-treated rats induced no change in leptin receptor mRNA production (data not shown).TABLE 2Plasma glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations, weight gain, and daily food, calorie, and protein intake after 4 weeks on the HC or standard chow diet (n = 7 Student's t test)Standard chow-fed control mice (n = 6)Hypercaloric diet-fed mice (n = 6)Plasma glucose (mmol/liter)9.76 ± 0.1413.20 ± 0.82ap < 0.05 versus control micePlasma insulin (ng/ml)0.31 ± 0.040.71 ± 0.15ap < 0.05 versus control micePlasma leptin (ng/ml)0.80 ± 0.171.62 ± 0.19ap < 0.05 versus control mice4-week weight gain (g)2.63 ± 0.204.20 ± 0.21ap < 0.05 versus control miceDaily food intake (g)4.51 ± 0.503.86 ± 0.41ap < 0.05 versus control miceDaily caloric intake (kcal)12.69 ± 1.4120.53 ± 2.18ap < 0.05 versus control miceDaily protein intake (g)0.72 ± 0.080.69 ± 0.08a p < 0.05 versus control mice Open table in a new tab We provide here the first demonstration that the induction of obesity provokes a time-dependent loss of responsiveness in intestinal target genes. Indeed, diet-induced obesity is associated with a dramatic decrease in the PepT1-mediated transport of oligopeptides in the intestine, related to down-regulation of leptin receptor expression. As shown in our previous study, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice display reduced levels of PepT1 activity and expression; furthermore, hyperleptinemia induced for 7 days in rats, associated with a decrease in food intake, induces an increase in PepT1 expression and oligopeptide transport (19Hindlet P. Bado A. Farinotti R. Buyse M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 323: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, in the rat model of hyperleptinemia, we observed no change in leptin receptor expression in the small intestine (data not shown). Surprisingly, in the present study, we observed desensitization of the leptin response to continuous hyperleptinemia, because PepT1 levels ceased to increase after long term treatment. There may be several reasons for this desensitization. First, desensitization may be mediated by the induction of well described leptin signaling pathway inhibitors, such as SOCS3 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (21Badman M.K. Flier J.S. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2103-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, these two inhibitors are unlikely to play a role in our conditions, because no transcriptional activation was observed. Alternatively, leptin may contribute to the intestinal regulation of the gene encoding its receptor. Ob-R down-regulation was evident in the animals fed the HC diet for 4 weeks, in which plasma leptin concentration increased steadily. A shorter duration of hyperleptinemia and/or the difference in the model may explain why such a regulation was not observed in the 7-day leptin-treated rats. A similar pattern of regulation was also observed following prolonged leptin treatment in Caco2 cells. The close association between the levels of Ob-R and PepT1 in both Caco2 cells and mouse jejunum suggests that the regulation of PepT1 levels depends on receptor abundance and the resulting level of signaling. Indeed, treatment in vitro with 0.2 or 1 nm leptin rapidly induced an increase in Ob-R expression and may induce PepT1 expression. However, prolonged leptin treatment in vitro or four weeks of the HC diet in vivo may down-regulate expression of the receptor, leading to a net decrease in leptin signaling within enterocytes and the abolition of leptin effects on PepT1. Such a regulation has already been described in the central nervous system. Consistent with this, some authors showed, in neuroblastoma cells, that leptin down-regulates its own receptors (22Hikita M. Bujo H. Hirayama S. Takahashi K. Morisaki N. Saito Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that hypothalamic leptin receptors were down-regulated in hyperleptinemic rodents, leading to leptin resistance (23Martin R.L. Perez E. He Y.J. Dawson Jr., R. Millard W.J. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 1479-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Wilsey J. Scarpace P.J. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 181: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that leptin treatment in vitro induced a transient increase in Ob-R and PepT1 mRNA levels, followed by a normalization of PepT1 levels or a larger decrease in leptin receptor expression. The pattern of change in expression was clearly time- and concentration-dependent. Indeed, the time required to reach peak PepT1 mRNA levels was inversely correlated with leptin concentration, with higher concentrations resulting in faster effects on PepT1 transcription. A few studies have focused on the activation of PepT1 transcription. For example, the transcriptional factors Sp1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α have been shown to be involved in PepT1 induction (25Shimakura J. Terada T. Katsura T. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G471-G477Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Shimakura J. Terada T. Saito H. Katsura T. Inui K.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: G951-G956Google Scholar). Similarly, the authors of these studies demonstrated that PepT1 may also be induced by caudal-related homeobox 2 (27Shimakura J. Terada T. Shimada Y. Katsura T. Inui K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nduati et al. (20Nduati V. Yan Y. Dalmasso G. Driss A. Sitaraman S. Merlin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1359-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) identified a link between the induction of PepT1 by caudal-related homeobox 2 and leptin, because leptin was shown to increase cAMP levels, consequently activating caudal-related homeobox 2. We investigated the role of the MAPK pathway in PepT1 activation in our model. Leptin has been shown to activate ERK1/2 in the hypothalamus (28Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J.

We show here, using inhibitors of the MAPK pathway U0126 and PD98059, that this ERK1/2 phosphorylation contributes to the stimulatory effect of leptin on PepT1 mRNA production. Surprisingly, the STAT3 and STAT5 pathways were not activated with our physiological concentrations of leptin. This lack of STAT activation is particularly striking, because these transducers are thought to play a key role in leptin signaling (33Hegyi K. Fulop K. Kovacs K. Toth S. Falus A. Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, Morton et al. (34Morton N.M. Emilsson V. Liu Y.L. Cawthorne M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26194-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) showed that leptin could activate STAT3 and STAT5 in Caco2 cells after treatment with concentrations of 20–200 nm, much higher than the concentrations used in our study. However, the absence of downstream SOCS3 transcription activation provides further evidence that the STAT3 pathway was not activated in our conditions, because SOCS3 expression is dependent on STAT3 activation (28Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Valerio et al. (35Valerio A. Ghisi V. Dossena M. Tonello C. Giordano A. Frontini A. Ferrario M. Pizzi M. Spano P. Carruba M.O. Nisoli E. J. Biol.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a weak expression of phosphoSTAT3 and phosphoSTAT5 occurs, below the detection threshold of Western blotting. We investigated the basis of the sustained effect of leptin on PepT1 protein levels, whereas the effect on mRNA is only transient by studying the action of leptin on the ribosomal protein S6, which has been implicated in mRNA translation. It has been shown that S6 and its kinase (ribosomal S6 kinase) are phosphorylated via the MAPK pathway (32Gong Y. Ishida-Takahashi R. Villanueva E.C. Fingar D.C. Munzberg H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 4: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which we demonstrated to be activated in our in vitro model. In Caco2 cells, we confirmed the leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 via the ERK1/2 pathway using U0126. Moreover, we showed that the PepT1 sustained protein expression is induced by the activation of S6 by leptin. Taken together, these data show, in vitro, that leptin regulates PepT1 levels and activity at the transcriptional level, via the MAPK pathway, and at the translational level, via ribosomal protein S6 activation. We have also shown, in vivo, that PepT1 levels and activity are down-regulated in hyperleptinemic states of leptin resistance, such as obesity. Thus, obesity may be associated with decreases in oligopeptide absorption and the bioavailability of peptidomimetic drugs. These findings are of major interest because protein intake can induce satiety. Protein-induced satiety is supported by the aminostatic hypothesis developed by Mellinkoff et al. (37Mellinkoff S.M. Frankland M. Boyle D. Greipel M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1956; 8: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in 1956 and has since been clearly demonstrated (38Paddon-Jones D. Westman E.

Liou A.P. Tome D. Raybould H.E. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that the activation of the vagal afferents known to induce satiety depends on PepT1. Further studies are now required to investigate the potential effects of PepT1 regulation on food intake in obesity. We thank Lisa McErlean for careful reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2008153847,"Ets1 is an oncogene that functions as a transcription factor and regulates the activity of many genes potentially important for tumor initiation and progression. Interestingly, the Ets1 oncogene is over-expressed in many human squamous cell cancers and over-expression is highly correlated with invasion and metastasis. Thus, Ets1 is believed to mainly play a role in later stages of the oncogenic process, but not early events.To better define the role of Ets1 in squamous cell carcinogenesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model in which expression of the Ets1 oncogene could be temporally and spatially regulated. Upon Ets1 induction in differentiating cells of stratified squamous epithelium, these mice exhibited dramatic changes in epithelial organization including increased proliferation and blocked terminal differentiation. The phenotype was completely reversed when Ets1 expression was suppressed. In mice where Ets1 expression was re-induced at a later age, the phenotype was more localized and the lesions that developed were more invasive. Many potential Ets1 targets were upregulated in the skin of these mice with the most dramatic being the metalloprotease MMP13, which we demonstrate to be a direct transcriptional target of Ets1.Collectively, our data reveal that upregulation of Ets1 can be an early event that promotes pre-neoplastic changes in epidermal tissues via its regulation of key genes driving growth and invasion. Thus, the Ets1 oncogene may be important for oncogenic processes in both early and late stages of tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2170186642,"DTNBP1 has been recognized as a schizophrenia susceptible gene, and its protein product, dysbindin-1, is down-regulated in the brains of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the physiological role of dysbindin-1 in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that disruption of dysbindin-1 with unidentified proteins could contribute to pathogenesis and the symptoms of schizophrenia. GST pull-down from human neuroblastoma lysates showed an association of dysbindin-1 with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex. The DNA-PK complex interacts only with splice isoforms A and B, but not with C. We found that isoforms A and B localized in nucleus, where the kinase complex exist, whereas the isoform C was found exclusively in cytosol. Furthermore, results of phosphorylation assay suggest that the DNA-PK complex phosphorylated dysbindin-1 isoforms A and B in cells. These observations suggest that DNA-PK regulates the dysbindin-1 isoforms A and B by phosphorylation in nucleus. Isoform C does not contain exons from 1 to 6. Since schizophrenia-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur in these introns between exon 1 and exon 6, we suggest that these SNPs might affect splicing of DTNBP1, which leads to impairment of the functional interaction between dysbindin-1 and DNA-PK in schizophrenic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2063414224,"The integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain (tail) serves as a scaffold for numerous intracellular proteins. The mechanisms by which the tail coordinates these proteins to facilitate extracellular matrix assembly and cell spreading are not clear. This study demonstrates that the β1 cytoplasmic domain can regulate cell spreading on fibronectin and fibronectin matrix assembly through Akt- and talin-dependent mechanisms, respectively. To identify these mechanisms, we characterized GD25 cells expressing the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain mutants W775A and R760A. Although cell spreading appears normal in R760A mutant-integrin cells compared with wild type, it is inhibited in W775A mutant cells. In contrast, both mutant cell lines show defective fibronectin matrix assembly. Inhibition of cell spreading, but not matrix assembly, in the W775A mutant cells is due to a specific defect in Akt-1 activation. In addition, we find that both W775A and R760A mutant integrins have reduced surface expression of the 9EG7 epitope that correlates with reduced recruitment of talin to β1 integrin cytoplasmic complexes. Down-regulation of talin with small interfering RNA or expression of green fluorescent protein-talin head domain inhibits matrix assembly in β1 wild-type cells, mimicking the defect seen with the W775A and R760A mutant cells.

Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that are formed by the selective pairing of 8 β and 18 α subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar). Integrin receptors can rapidly and reversibly modulate the level of cell adhesiveness (2Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The adhesive function of integrins can be regulated by extracellular factors, such as extracellular ligands, divalent cations, or monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, integrin activation associated with high affinity ligand binding can be initiated from within the cell via modulation of the cytoplasmic tail and transmitted by conformational changes to the extracellular domain (inside-out signaling) (3Ginsberg M.H.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FN, fibronectin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DOC, deoxycholate; bFN, biotinylated FN; talinH, talin-head domain; wt, wild type. is a dynamic protein scaffold that provides structural support to cells and also induces cell signaling, in part through formation of cell-matrix adhesions. Fibronectin is an important and ubiquitous component of the ECM. Adhesion of cells to fibronectin can be regulated by changes in the repertoire of integrin expression or by modulation of integrin binding properties. Both α5β1 and αvβ3 integrin receptors can mediate cell adhesion to fibronectin and remodel it; however, the α5β1 integrin is the primary receptor involved in fibronectin fibrillogenesis (13Larsen M.

However, how sites within the cytoplasmic tail of the β1 integrin can selectively control fibronectin matrix formation as opposed to other integrin-dependent processes such as cell spreading remains to be elucidated. GD25, a mouse cell line derived from the embryonic stem cell line G201 (20Fassler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.A. Johansson S. Timpl R. Albrecht R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), is useful for studying β1 integrin function, because it is β1-deficient. Reconstitution of GD25 cells with wild-type or mutant β1 integrins provides an approach to study the functional contribution of particular integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain amino acid residues to different integrin-mediated functions. We previously demonstrated that a point mutation of the β1A integrin cytoplasmic tail, W775A, influences cell survival and Akt signaling (21Pankov R. Cukierman E. Clark K. Matsumoto K. Hahn C. Poulin B. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18671-18681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In our current studies, we test the hypothesis that specific sites in the β1A tail can regulate cell spreading and matrix assembly. Reconstitution of β1-/- GD25 cells with wild-type or mutant β1A integrins permitted us to identify β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain mutations (W775A and R760A) that disrupt regulation of Akt-1 and/or talin, leading to defects in cell spreading and fibronectin matrix assembly. The involvement of Akt-1 in cell spreading and talin in fibronectin matrix assembly was further confirmed using an inhibitor of Akt activity and by disrupting interactions with intracellular talin using siRNA or the GFP-talin head domain. Taken together, our data suggest that specific β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain residues can have both distinct and overlapping roles when regulating adhesion-dependent processes. Reagents and Antibodies-Antibodies against β1 integrin were rat 9EG7 (BD Pharmingen), mouse K20 (Immunotech), mouse 12G10 (22Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J.

Rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody was produced in our laboratory. Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Human plasma fibronectin (FN) was purified as previously described (25Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb.

Cell Culture and Generation of β1 Integrin Mutants-The β1-/- GD25 cell line was generously provided by Reinhard Fässler (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone (complete medium). Generation of alanine point mutations in the cDNA of the β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain and subsequent stable expression in the β1-/- GD25 cell line have been previously described (21Pankov R.

Briefly, amino acid residues that are conserved between six β integrin cytoplasmic tails were identified and mutated to alanine. Plasmids containing cDNA encoding either the wild-type or mutated β1A integrins were cotransfected with the puromycin selection vector pHA262pur into β1-/- GD25 cells. Stable cell lines containing similar levels of β1A integrin expression were obtained by culturing cells in medium containing 10 μg/ml puromycin and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using K20, an anti-total β1 integrin antibody. Generation of W775A β1 integrin mutant cells expressing constitutively active Akt has also been previously described (26Pankov R. Endo Y. Even-Ram S. Araki M. Clark K. Cukierman E. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fibronectin Matrix Assays-Stably transfected GD25 β1A integrin cell lines were plated in complete medium at 3 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. After culturing overnight, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM containing 20 μg/ml biotinylated FN (bFN), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. FN was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin according to the manufacturer's protocol for biotinylating IgG. Following a 5-h incubation, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium and magnesium (PBS+), scraped into deoxycholate (DOC) buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm iodoacetic acid (sodium salt), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) on ice, and passed five times through a 23-gauge needle. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The DOC-insoluble material was washed once in DOC buffer, resuspended in Novex 2× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved on 4-12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), the filters were blocked (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to quantify bFN incorporation into DOC-insoluble FN matrix. Binding was visualized using the ECL system and Hyperfilm x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). The same membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-vimentin antibody (Sigma clone Vim 13.2) to provide an internal protein loading control. Cell Spreading Assays-Cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM containing 1% BSA. Cell density was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml, and the cells were incubated for 10-15 min with or without inhibitors/antibodies at room temperature. The cells were replated on 35-mm diameter tissue-culture polystyrene plates coated with the indicated ECM protein. Cells were assayed for spreading at the times indicated in the figure legends. Microscope fields for each time point or treatment were chosen at random, and images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 light microscope equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera. An individual cell was counted as “spread” when there were cell protrusions or lamellae with loss of refractility over greater than 70% of the cell area. The percentages of spread cells were evaluated as (number of spread cells ÷ total number of cells in field) × 100%. Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence-Integrin expression profiles were determined for the parental β1-/- GD25 and early passage (<5) GD25 integrin β1A-sorted cell populations. The cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium on a fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) substratum. The cells were detached by initially washing twice in PBS without calcium and magnesium (PBS-) followed by incubation with PBS- containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in a 37 °C incubator. The cells were washed by centrifugation and resuspended in cold PBS- buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide (BSA buffer). 5 × 105 cells were incubated with an anti-integrin antibody or control IgG at 10 μg/ml final concentration for 40 min on ice, washed three times with BSA buffer, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells were fixed in PBS- containing 1% formaldehyde and stored at 4 °C. The integrin activation-state experiments used β1-/- GD25, integrin β1-sorted wild-type, W775A, and R760A cells. Cells cultured in complete medium were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and cultured for 5 h in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with PBS-/EDTA as described above. β1-/- GD25 cells and integrin β1 sorted populations were extensively washed with PBS-. Then 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride (integrin activation buffer) without or with 0.2 mm GRGDS or 0.2 mm GRGES peptides for 30 min on ice. Alexa 488-conjugated 9EG7 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated K20 were then added to the cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Following incubation, excess antibody was removed by washing three times with the integrin activation buffer containing 0.02% azide and the corresponding peptides. The cells were then fixed with PBS+ and 1% formaldehyde and stored at 4 °C. Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur interfaced with CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting was performed as previously described (21Pankov R. Cukierman E. Clark K. Matsumoto K. Hahn C. Poulin B. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18671-18681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GD25-β1A cell lines were detached with trypsin and washed in complete medium. The cells were resuspended in a mixture of 50% PBS-/1% BSA and 50% complete medium. Then 5 × 106 cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated K20 (anti-total β1 integrin antibody) for 30 min on ice. After the antibody incubation, the cells were washed with PBS-/1% BSA and resuspended in complete DMEM. The GD25-β1A integrin wild-type, W775A, and R760A cell populations with similar integrin β1 surface expression were sorted and collected using a Mo-Flo cell sorter (Dako) and Summit (Dako) software and were subsequently resuspended and cultured in complete medium. For immunofluorescence, samples were fixed/permeabilized in PBS+ containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The samples were then washed and fixed for an additional 15 min in PBS+ containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose. For staining only the fibronectin matrix and cell nuclei with SYBR green, cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS+ without permeabilization. For staining cells transfected with the GFP-talin head domain, cells were fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS+ and permeabilized for 20 min with 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PBS+. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 20% donkey serum and 2% BSA in PBS+ before staining with primary and secondary antibodies. Slides were mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp.) supplemented with 20% glycerol. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Isolation of Integrin-associated Protein Complexes-To isolate integrin-associated complexes, GD25 cell lines were harvested with trypsin, washed, and resuspended in DMEM with 1% calf serum. To recover from the trypsinization, the cells were maintained in suspension for 3 h with constant rocking on a platform shaker. The suspended cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with magnetic beads (Dynabeads, 4.5-μm diameter from Dynal/Invitrogen) at a bead-to-cell ratio of 5:1. The magnetic beads were pre-coated with mouse anti-integrin β1 antibody K20 at a ratio of 100 μg to 2 × 108 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated beads. Cells with bound magnetic beads were positively sorted using a magnetic separator and washed with cold CSK buffer 50 (50 mm sodium chloride, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 10 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.8). Integrin-associated protein complexes bound to the anti-integrin antibody beads were extracted with CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl at 4 °C. To isolate the complexes, lysate and beads were bath-sonicated in a Branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaner twice for 10 s at room temperature. The bead complexes were subsequently washed five times with cold CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl. To elute the proteins from the beads, 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added, and the samples were probe-sonicated with a Microson XL ultrasonic cell disrupter at setting 2-3 for three 5-s periods to reduce the viscosity of the samples. The levels of talin were determined by Western blot using sample volumes containing equal levels of β1 integrin. The Western blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescence was detected with a FUJI-FILM LAS4000 image analyzer. The blots were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Transfection of GFP-talin Head Domain Plasmid and Talin siRNA-All siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon. For siRNA transfection, cells were cultured overnight in complete medium. The next day, cells were washed with PBS-, and trypsin/EDTA was added for 2 min to remove the surrounding matrix without detaching the cells. Complete medium was added to inhibit the trypsin, and this mixture was then replaced with fresh medium (complete). 50 nm ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool or a mixture of 50 nm talin-1 and talin-2 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (12.5 nm of each individual siRNA) were then transfected into the cells using RNAiFECT (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The targeting sequences for the talin-1 SMARTpool siRNA were CGAAUGACCAAGGGUAUUA, GAUAGGCGCUCACAUCAAA, GCACAUACGUCAGGAACUG, and GAAGGGAGAGCGUAAGAUC. The targeting sequences for the talin-2 SMARTpool siRNA were GAGGGAAGAUGAGGGCUAA, GAACGUUUGUUGACUACCA, UGGCAGGGAUUUCACAGAA, and CGAAUGAGCCUGUGAGCGA. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and protein levels were quantified using Western blots developed as described previously. The plasmid encoding the GFP-mouse talin head domain was a generous gift from Michael Sheetz. For cDNA transfection, cells were plated for 2 h on tissue-culture dishes in complete medium. Immediately before transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using a 6:1 ratio of Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) reagent to DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated overnight in a 37 °C, 10% CO2 incubator. The next morning the cells were passaged and re-plated on glass coverslips. The cells were fixed and stained 48 h post-transfection. Image Processing and Statistics-All confocal images were prepared and processed using LSM Image Browser and NIH Image J software by adjusting brightness/contrast and applying a median filter. Graphs and statistics were prepared using SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software. p values were derived using one-way analysis of variance with pairwise multiple comparisons made using the Tukey-Kramer test. Specific Sites in the β1A Integrin Cytoplasmic Domain Are Required for Cell Spreading-DNA plasmids encoding wild-type β1A integrin or cytoplasmic mutant integrins were expressed in β1-/- GD25 cells, and stable cell lines were generated as previously described (21Pankov R. Cukierman E. Clark K. Matsumoto K. Hahn C. Poulin B. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18671-18681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specific amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the β1A integrin were selected for mutation (Fig. 1A), because they were conserved between comparable sites of six different β integrin subunits. To compare the role of these specific amino acid residues in a key function of cells, cell spreading was examined on a fibronectin-coated substrate. The α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins are major mediators of cell spreading on fibronectin. Because β1-/- GD25 cells reconstituted with the β1A integrin (GD25-β1Awt) still express the αvβ3 integrin, the kinetics of spreading on fibronectin were first compared to identify differences in rates of β1 versus β3 integrin-mediated spreading. The β1-/- GD25 and GD25-β1Awt cell lines were plated on substrates coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin and allowed to spread. The number of cells spread at the indicated time points was counted in the presence and absence of 40 μg/ml β1 integrin-blocking antibody 4B4 (Fig. 1B). The β1-/- GD25 cells, which primarily use the αvβ3 integrin to spread on fibronectin, displayed slower spreading kinetics than the GD25-β1Awt cells (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 at 10 and 20 min, respectively). Treatment of the GD25-β1Awt cells with the β1 blocking antibody 4B4 inhibited spreading rates to the levels observed with the β1-/- GD25 cells, indicating that the difference in spreading kinetics is due to β1 integrin function. As expected, 4B4 had no effect on the spreading rate of the β1-/- GD25 cells. We directly compared cell spreading by the β1-/- GD25, GD25-β1Awt, and nine β1A integrin cytoplasmic mutant cell lines on 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 20 min, the time at which wild-type β1 integrin function was most apparent. Cell spreading varied widely between the mutants, with seven point mutations, including R760A and T789A (p = 1.0 for both mutants), having little to no effect on spreading compared with that of the GD25-β1Awt cells, and the W775A (p = 0.001) and F766A (p < 0.05) mutants having the most significant defect in cell spreading (Fig. 1C). Comparison of Specific Sites in the β1A Integrin Cytoplasmic Domain Required for Fibronectin Matrix Assembly and Cell Spreading-Another key function of β1 integrins is to mediate fibronectin fibrillogenesis or matrix assembly. To compare the effect of each cytoplasmic domain integrin mutant on fibronectin fibrillogenesis, 20 μg/ml bFN was added to cells adherent to glass coverslips. The ability of the cells to assemble fibronectin fibrils was assessed by measuring incorporation of the added soluble bFN into a DOC-insoluble matrix as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Greater than 95% of the production of FN matrix could be attributed to the β1 integrin, because very little bFN was incorporated into the DOC-insoluble fraction by the β1-/- GD25 cells (data not shown). As observed for cell spreading on fibronectin, the effects of the β1A integrin cytoplasmic mutants on fibronectin fibrillogenesis were selective (Fig. 2). For example, cells expressing the T789A mutation compared with the W775A mutation showed no effect (p = 1.0) versus a dramatic decrease (p < 0.001) in fibronectin matrix formation, respectively. Interestingly, the R760A mutation also showed a striking decrease in fibronectin matrix formation, even though it showed little or no inhibition of spreading as seen in Fig. 1C (p < 0.001 for fibronectin matrix formation versus p = 1.0 for cell spreading on fibronectin). The magnitudes of the effects of each point mutation on matrix assembly compared with cell spreading revealed no direct correlation, indicating that mechanisms regulating fibronectin matrix assembly and cell spreading may not be coupled. To elucidate mechanisms that selectively regulate fibronectin matrix formation and cell spreading through the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, we further characterized the molecular and cellular phenotypic differences between the W775A and R760A β1A integrin mutations. W775A and R760A β1A Integrin Mutants Support Different Cell Spreading Phenotypes on Fibronectin versus Laminin-1-We first compared cell spreading of the two mutant cell lines on fibronectin and laminin-1 to test whether the differential spreading phenotype could be reproduced on another extracellular matrix component. Later time points for spreading were used, because the GD25-β1Awt cells spread more slowly on laminin-1. We also used a specific αv-blocking antibody, C8F12 (24Delcommenne M. Streuli C.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 19-34PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit the compensating effect of the αvβ3 integrin on cell spreading on fibronectin. In the presence of the αv-blocking antibody, spreading was significantly reduced in the W775A β1A integrin mutant cells when compared with the R760A β1A integrin mutant cells (Fig. 3A). These results reproduced the selective spreading defect observed previously (Fig. 1C). In striking contrast, when the cells were plated on 10 μg/ml laminin-1, neither the W775A nor the R760A β1A integrin mutant cells were able to spread (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that different mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of a single integrin subunit can lead to markedly different ligand adhesive specificities at the extracellular face and that the selective defect in cell spreading between the W775A and R760A integrin was characteristic of interactions with fibronectin but not laminin-1. Surface Expression of αv, α6, α5, and β3 Integrins in W775A and R760A β1A Integrin Mutant Cells-Ectopic expression of the β1A integrin in β1-/- GD25 cells induces expression of the integrin α6 subunit (18Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which permits spreading of the GD25-β1Awt cells on laminin-1. Both β1-/- GD25 cells and GD25-β1Awt cells treated with the α6 integrin function-blocking antibody GoH3 could not spread on laminin-1 (data not shown), indicating that the α6β1 integrin receptor is the primary mediator of cell spreading on laminin-1. Because the cells expressing the W775A and R760A β1A integrin mutations failed to spread on laminin-1 yet displayed a selective cell spreading defect on fibronectin, we quantified the surface expression of integrin subunits that bind to fibronectin and laminin-1 to rule out effects due to decreased surface levels. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of these β1A mutations did not decrease, and"

Here we describe an alternative type of inhibition mediated by GABA(A) receptors present on neocortical glutamatergic nerve terminals and examine the underlying signaling mechanism(s). By monitoring the activity of the presynaptic CaM kinase II/synapsin I signaling pathway in isolated nerve terminals, we demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor activation correlated with an increase in basal intraterminal [Ca(2+)](i). Interestingly, this activation of GABA(A) receptors resulted in a reduction of subsequent depolarization-evoked Ca(2+) influx, which thereby led to an inhibition of glutamate release. To investigate how the observed GABA(A) receptor-mediated modulation operates, we determined the sensitivity of this process to the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1 antagonist bumetanide, as well as substitution of Ca(2+) with Ba(2+), or Ca(2+)/calmodulin inhibition by W7. All of these treatments abolished the modulation by GABA(A) receptors. Application of selective antagonists of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) revealed that the GABA(A) receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate release required the specific activity of L- and R-type VGCCs. Crucially, the inhibition of release by these receptors was abolished in terminals isolated from R-type VGCC knock-out mice. Together, our results indicate that a functional coupling between nerve terminal GABA(A) receptors and L- or R-type VGCCs is mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signaling. This mechanism provides a GABA-mediated control of glutamatergic synaptic activity by a direct inhibition of glutamate release."
https://openalex.org/W2053675069,"In aggressive mimicry, a predator or parasite imitates a signal of another species in order to exploit the recipient of the signal. Some of the most remarkable examples of aggressive mimicry involve exploitation of a complex signal-response system by an unrelated predator species.We have found that predatory Chlorobalius leucoviridis katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) can attract male cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) by imitating the species-specific wing-flick replies of sexually receptive female cicadas. This aggressive mimicry is accomplished both acoustically, with tegminal clicks, and visually, with synchronized body jerks. Remarkably, the katydids respond effectively to a variety of complex, species-specific Cicadettini songs, including songs of many cicada species that the predator has never encountered.We propose that the versatility of aggressive mimicry in C. leucoviridis is accomplished by exploiting general design elements common to the songs of many acoustically signaling insects that use duets in pair-formation. Consideration of the mechanism of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may illuminate processes driving the evolution of insect acoustic signals, which play a central role in reproductive isolation of populations and the formation of species."
https://openalex.org/W2068999270,"A series of recent studies on large-scale networks of signaling and metabolic systems revealed that a certain network structure often called ""bow-tie network"" are observed. In signaling systems, bow-tie network takes a form with diverse and redundant inputs and outputs connected via a small numbers of core molecules. While arguments have been made that such network architecture enhances robustness and evolvability of biological systems, its functional role at a cellular level remains obscure. A hypothesis was proposed that such a network function as a stimuli-reaction classifier where dynamics of core molecules dictate downstream transcriptional activities, hence physiological responses against stimuli. In this study, we examined whether such hypothesis can be verified using experimental data from Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS) that comprehensively measured GPCR related ligands response for B-cell and macrophage. In a GPCR signaling system, cAMP and Ca2+ act as core molecules. Stimuli-response for 32 ligands to B-Cells and 23 ligands to macrophages has been measured. We found that ligands with correlated changes of cAMP and Ca2+ tend to cluster closely together within the hyperspaces of both cell types and they induced genes involved in the same cellular processes. It was found that ligands inducing cAMP synthesis activate genes involved in cell growth and proliferation; cAMP and Ca2+ molecules that increased together form a feedback loop and induce immune cells to migrate and adhere together. In contrast, ligands without a core molecules response are scattered throughout the hyperspace and do not share clusters. G-protein coupling receptors together with immune response specific receptors were found in cAMP and Ca2+ activated clusters. Analyses have been done on the original software applicable for discovering 'bow-tie' network architectures within the complex network of intracellular signaling where ab initio clustering has been implemented as well. Groups of potential transcription factors for each specific group of genes were found to be partly conserved across B-cell and macrophage. A series of findings support the hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006839646,"Synchronized discharges in the hippocampal CA3 recurrent network are supposed to underlie network oscillations, memory formation and seizure generation. In the hippocampal CA3 network, NMDA receptors are abundant at the recurrent synapses but scarce at the mossy fiber synapses. We generated mutant mice in which NMDA receptors were abolished in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons by postnatal day 14. The histological and cytological organizations of the hippocampal CA3 region were indistinguishable between control and mutant mice. We found that mutant mice lacking NMDA receptors selectively in CA3 pyramidal neurons became more susceptible to kainate-induced seizures. Consistently, mutant mice showed characteristic large EEG spikes associated with multiple unit activities (MUA), suggesting enhanced synchronous firing of CA3 neurons. The electrophysiological balance between fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission was comparable between control and mutant pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region, while the NMDA receptor-slow AHP coupling was diminished in the mutant neurons. In the adult brain, inducible ablation of NMDA receptors in the hippocampal CA3 region by the viral expression vector for Cre recombinase also induced similar large EEG spikes. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of CA3 NMDA receptors enhanced the susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures. These results raise an intriguing possibility that hippocampal CA3 NMDA receptors may suppress the excitability of the recurrent network as a whole in vivo by restricting synchronous firing of CA3 neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2087685666,"Nuclear retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) activates gene expression through dynamic interactions with coregulatory protein complexes, the assembly of which is directed by the ligand and the AF-2 domain of RARα. Then RARα and its coactivator SRC-3 are degraded by the proteasome. Recently it has emerged that the proteasome also plays a key role in RARα-mediated transcription. Here we show that SUG-1, one of the six ATPases of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, interacts with SRC-3, is recruited at the promoters of retinoic acid (RA) target genes, and thereby participates to their transcription. In addition, SUG-1 also mediates the proteasomal degradation of SRC-3. However, when present in excess amounts, SUG-1 blocks the activation of RARα target genes and the degradation of RARα that occurs in response to RA, via its ability to interfere with the recruitment of SRC-3 and other coregulators at the AF-2 domain of RARα.

The RA response is mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors, RARs (α, β, and γ) and RXRs (α, β, and γ), which function as ligand-dependent heterodimeric RAR/RXR transcription activators (1Germain P. Staels B. Dacquet C. Spedding M. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. Nuclear Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press, London2001Google Scholar). The basic mechanism of RARs transcriptional activity relies on their ability to bind to cognate DNA response elements located in the promoters of target genes and to undergo major conformational changes subsequently to ligand binding (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). The most striking change observed upon ligand binding is the swing of helix 12 named AF-2 located at the C-terminal end of the ligand binding domain, which generates a new interaction surface for coactivators, which include the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)/p160 family (SRC-1/NCoA1, SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP-1, and SRC-3/p/CIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB-1/TRAM-1) and p300/CBP (4Glass C.K.

Here we identified a new mechanism underlying the regulation of RARα target genes, in which SUG-1, one of the six AAA ATPases of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, links the transcription and degradation processes via its ability to interact with the p160 coactivator SRC-3.

Cells, Transfections, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting-MCF7, HeLa, and COS-1 cells were cultured under standard conditions and transiently transfected using the DMRIE-C reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was determined according to standard procedures. Whole cell and nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as in a previous study (23Bour G. Plassat J.L. Bauer A. Lalevee S. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol.

Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. siRNA-The SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) against human NCOA3/SRC-3 (M-003759-02), NCOA2/SRC-2 (M-020159-01), NCOA1/SRC-1 (M-005196-03), and SUG-1 (M-009484-02) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) as well as the control non-targeting siRNA pool (D-001206-13). siRNAs (50 nm) were transfected into MCF7 and HeLa cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR-Total RNAs were isolated and subjected to real-time qRT-PCR as previously described (23Bour G. Plassat J.L. Bauer A. Lalevee S. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol.

Primer sequences were as follows: human CYP26A1, 5′-GAAAGTGCGAGAAGAGCTGAA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGGGAATCTGGTATCCAT-3′; human RARα2, 5′-TTGGAATGGCTCAAACCAC-3′ and 5′-TTGTAGATGCGGGGTAGAGG-3′. ChIP-Subconfluent MCF7 cells were treated with RA (10-7m) and ChIP experiments were next performed according to the protocol described by Upstate. In Re-ChIP experiments, complexes were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 250 ml of 95 mm NaHCO3 containing 1% SDS, diluted 20 times with Re-ChIP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and subjected again to the ChIP procedure. The primer pairs used for qPCR amplification were as follows: Cyp26A1 R1, 5′-GCGGAACAAACGGTTAAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCAGTACAGGTCCCAGAGCTT-3′; Cyp26A1 R2, 5′-GAGTTCACTCGGATGTCACG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGCAGGGTTTCAGTCT-3′; RARβ2, 5′-CGATCCCAAGTTCTCCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CAGACTGGTTGGGTCATTTG-3′. Occupancy of the promoters was calculated by normalizing the PCR signals from the immunoprecipitation samples to the signals obtained from the input DNA. The specificity of the experimental conditions was checked in the absence of antibodies and with the promoter of the control 36B4 gene, which does not contain any RA response element (RARE). For ChIP-Western experiments, the precipitated chromatin complexes were proceeded as in a previous study (24Das P.M. Ramachandran K. vanWert J. Singal R. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 961-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bound proteins were revealed by immunoblotting. SUG-1 Interacts with SRC-3 and Contributes to the RA-induced Proteasomal Degradation of SRC-3-SRC-3 is degraded in several cell lines after 10-16 h of RA treatment (Fig. 1A) (20Gianni M. Parrella E.

It is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1A), and thus occurs through the proteasome. Given the ability of SUG-1, one of the six AAA ATPases of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, to interact with several transcription factors (22vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4199-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this subunit is involved in the degradation of SRC-3. First we examined the ability of SUG-1 to interact with SRC-3 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments performed with extracts from COS-1 cells overexpressing SUG-1 and FLAG-SRC-3. SUG-1 was retained by SRC-3 in the absence of ligand, and addition of RA further stimulated this interaction (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with endogenous SRC-3 and SUG-1 proteins in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C). That SUG-1 interacts with SRC-3 was corroborated in in vitro pulldown experiments using the GST-SUG-1 fusion protein (Fig. 1D). No interaction could be detected with the other coactivator SRC-1 (data not shown), which is not degraded in response to RA (20Gianni M. Parrella E. Raska I. Gaillard E. Nigro E.A. Gaudon C. Garattini E. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Then we investigated whether SUG-1 is involved in the RA-induced degradation of SRC-3 by using RNA interference. Selective knockdown of SUG-1 in MCF7 or HeLa cells with SMARTpool siRNAs did not affect the basal levels of SRC-3 but inhibited the RA-induced degradation of the coactivator (Fig. 1E). Note that the RA-induced degradation of RARα, which also involves the proteasome (18Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), was not abrogated but rather enhanced upon knockdown of SUG-1 (Fig. 1E) suggesting an unexpected degree of target specificity. SUG-1 and SRC-3 Contribute to the Transcription of RA Target Genes-Given that SRC-3 is a coactivator for RARα and that SUG-1 functions in a number of transcription programs (25Bhat K.P. Turner J.D. Myers S.E. Cape A.D. Ting J.P. Greer S.F. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 2214-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Zhu Q. Wani G. Yao J. Patnaik S. Wang Q.E. El-Mahdy M.A. Praetorius-Ibba M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4199-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SUG-1 also contributes to the transcription of RA target genes. In MCF7 cells, RA treatment induces rapidly (within 1 h) the expression of the Cyp26A1 gene that is the paradigm of the RA target genes, as assessed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Selective knockdown of SUG-1 (Fig. 2B) led to a marked reduction of the RA-induced expression of Cyp26A1 (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of SRC-3, which does not affect basal RARα levels (Fig. 2B) or RA-induced degradation of RARα (Fig. 2C), also reduced efficiently Cyp26A1 expression (Fig. 2A). This suggests that SUG-1 would contribute to RARα-dependent transcriptional activation as efficiency as SRC-3 (20Gianni M. Parrella E. Raska I. Gaillard E. Nigro E.A. Gaudon C. Garattini E. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Brown K. Chen Y. Underhill T.M. Mymryk J.S. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39402-39412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, knockdown of the other p160 coactivators, SRC-2 and SRC-1, had no effect (Fig. 2, A and B), in line with the concept that SRC proteins, though sharing a high degree of similarity, exert different functions in nuclear receptor-regulated gene transcription (28Zhang H. Yi X. Sun X. Yin N. Shi B. Wu H. Wang D. Wu G. Shang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). That both SUG-1 and SRC-3 influence RARα-mediated transcription has been confirmed in MCF7 cells cotransfected with a Luciferase reporter gene driven by a DR5 RA response element (Fig. 2D) and in HeLa cells with other endogenous RARα target genes (the RARα2 gene) (Fig. 2E). SUG-1 Is Recruited with SRC-3 to the Promoters of RA Target Genes-Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to investigate further the role played by SUG-1 in the transcription of endogenous RA target genes. The Cyp26A1 gene promoter contains two functional DR5 RAREs (Fig. 3A), a proximal one (R1) and a more distal one (R2), that work synergistically to provide a maximal response to RA in vivo (29Loudig O. Maclean G.A. Dore N.L. Luu L. Petkovich M. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We assessed the SUG-1 and SRC-3 occupancy of these promoter regions in MCF7 cells treated with RA during a time course. After RA addition, there was an enrichment of SUG-1 bound at both the R1 and R2 regions, which peaked at 60 min (Fig. 3, B and C). The levels of R1 and R2 bound to SRC-3 also increased with a peak that was concomitant with that of SUG-1. To investigate whether SUG-1 is present in the same complex with SRC-3 on the promoter, MCF7 cells were subjected to sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP) experiments first with SRC-3 and then with SUG-1 antibodies (Fig. 3, D and E). At 60 min following RA addition, both the R1 and R2 regions were specifically enriched, indicating that SUG-1 and SRC-3 form a complex on DNA in an RA-dependent manner. RARα was also recruited in the same time slot (Fig. 3, B and C), in line with our previous results (30Bruck N. Vitoux D. Ferry C. Duong V. Bauer A. de The H. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In Re-ChIP experiments performed first with RARα antibodies and then with SUG-1 antibodies, enrichment was also observed at 60 min (Fig. 3, D and E). Collectively, these results suggest that SUG-1 is recruited within complexes containing both SRC-3 and RARα. This has been corroborated in ChIP Western experiments (Fig. 3F): immunoprecipitated SRC-3 retained both RARα and SUG-1 at 60 min following RA addition. Next, we aimed at investigating whether SUG-1 was also recruited to the promoter of other RA target genes such as the RARβ2 gene. In MCF7 cells and most breast cancer cell lines, the RARβ2 gene is silenced by DNA methylation (31Widschwendter M. Berger J. Hermann M. Muller H.M. Amberger A. Zeschnigk M. Widschwendter A. Abendstein B. Zeimet A.G. Daxenbichler G. Marth C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and is not expressed in response to RA (data not shown). However, the proximal promoter region, which contains the DR5 RARE (Fig. 3G), is accessible to transcription factors, and ChIP experiments (Fig. 3G) gave results that were very similar to those obtained above for the Cyp26A1 promoter. Altogether these results indicate that SUG-1 is recruited concomitantly with SRC-3 to RARα target gene promoters, further supporting the idea that SUG-1 is involved in transcription. Note that a weak earlier (20 min after RA addition) peak was also observed (Fig. 3, B, C, and G), suggesting the existence of sequential waves of promoter accessibility for SUG-1 and SRC-3 (32Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SUG-1 Blocks Both RA-induced Expression of RARα-Target Genes and RARα Degradation-We analyzed the influence of SUG-1 overexpression on SRC-3 degradation and the transcription of RARα target genes. Overexpression of SUG-1 in MCF7 cells increased the efficiency of SRC-3 degradation (Fig. 4A, lane 4) confirming the contribution of SUG-1 in this process. Unexpectedly, forced expression of SUG-1 reduced the RA-induced expression of a DR5-driven Luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4B) and of the Cyp26A1 endogenous target gene (Fig. 4, C and D). It also inhibited the RA-induced degradation of RARα (Fig. 4A). Such effects were specific for SUG-1, because overexpression of SRC-3 or the other p160 coactivators did not affect the transcription of RA target genes or the degradation of RARα (20Gianni M. Parrella E. Raska I. Gaillard E. Nigro E.A. Gaudon C. Garattini E. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6 below). Interestingly, in MCF7 cell knockdown for SUG-1, re-expression of SUG-1 to endogenous levels restored both transcription (Fig. 4E, lanes 2 and 3) and RARα degradation (Fig. 4F, lanes 4 and 6). However, re-expression of SUG-1 to excess amounts had an inhibitory effect on both processes (Fig. 4E, lane 4 and Fig. 4F, lane 8). Collectively these results suggest that, when present in excess amounts, SUG-1 competes with endogenous complexes involved in the transcription of RARα target genes and in the degradation of RARα.FIGURE 6Overexpression of SRC-3 reverses the inhibitory effects of SUG-1 on RARα degradation and RARα-mediated transcription. A, in COS-1 cells cotransfected with RARα and SUG-1 expression vectors and RA-treated for 1 h, overexpression of SRC-3 reverses the interaction of SUG-1 with RARα. Nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with RARα monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting. The upper panels correspond to aliquots of unprecipitated extracts. B and C, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the RARα vector and the DR5-tk-LUC reporter construct, along with SUG-1 and/or FLAG-SRC-3 and RA-treated. Extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting (B) and for luciferase activity (C). The results are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. D and E, the same as in B and C but with SRC-1 instead of FLAG-SRC-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overexpressed SUG-1 Interferes with SRC-3 for Binding to RARα-In response to RA, SRC-3 and several coregulators interact with RARα at the coactivator surface involving helix 12 (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, SUG-1 interacts with this same RARα surface (22vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A), the integrity of which is required for both RARα transcriptional activity and degradation (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 18Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether overexpressed SUG-1 would interfere with SRC-3 for RARα binding. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed with extracts from COS-1 cells cotransfected with RARα, FLAG-SRC-3, and/or SUG-1 vectors. In the absence of SUG-1, an interaction between RARα and SRC-3 was detected in response to RA whatever immunoprecipitation was performed with RARα (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5) or FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 5). When SUG-1 was overexpressed, this interaction was decreased (Fig. 5, D and E, lanes 6 and 7). Thus, when present in high amounts, SUG-1 interferes with the interaction between RARα and SRC-3. Next we investigated whether, reciprocally, overexpression of SRC-3 might squelch the excess of SUG-1 and thereby restore the interaction between RARα and SRC-3. We found that in cells cotransfected with the RARα and SUG-1 vectors, the interaction between RARα and SUG-1 was decreased upon forced expression of SRC-3 (Fig. 6A). Subsequently the interaction between RARα and SRC-3 was restored (Fig. 6A). RARα degradation and transcriptional activity, which were blocked in the presence of an excess of SUG-1 (Fig. 6B, lane 6 and Fig. 6C, lane 3), were also restored upon overexpression of SRC-3 (Fig. 6B, lanes 7-10 and Fig. 6C, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, SRC-1, which does not interact with SUG-1, was ineffective (Fig. 6, D and E). Altogether these results converge to the conclusion that SRC-3 would specifically squelch the excess of SUG-1 through its ability to bind SUG-1 and/or RARα, thereby restoring the ability of RARα to activate transcription and to be degraded. In eukaryotic cells, gene expression in response to RA is a rapid process that is rigorously controlled by an ever-growing network of dynamic and carefully orchestrated series of exchanges between RARs and coregulatory proteins (21Bour G. Lalevee S. Rochette-Egly C. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, in response to RA, coactivators of the p160 SRC family are recruited to cognate gene promoters by RARs through direct contacts involving their nuclear receptor interaction domain and transmit the activation signal through their AD1 and AD2 domains, which serve as platforms to recruit other factors that contribute to transcriptional activation. In addition, a variety of post-translational modifications and degradation processes cooperate with the ligand to fine-tune the transcription of RA target genes (11Bastien J. Rochette-Egly C. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 328: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 21Bour G. Lalevee S. Rochette-Egly C. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we identified a new mechanism underlying the activation of RARα target genes, which involves SUG-1, one of the ATPases of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 7). SUG-1 Interacts with SRC-3 and Contributes to Its Degradation-Given that, in response to RA, RARα as well as its coactivator SRC-3 are degraded by the 26 S proteasome (18Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Gianni M. Parrella E. Raska I. Gaillard E. Nigro E.A. Gaudon C. Garattini E. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SUG-1 is involved in these processes. We have shown that SUG-1 interacts with SRC-3 both in vitro and in vivo and contributes to the proteasomal degradation of SRC-3. The exact mechanism of this effect is still unclear, but may relate to the chaperone-like activity of SUG-1 such that SRC-3 degradation is favored (16Demartino G.N. Gillette T.G. Cell. 2007; 129: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, one cannot exclude that SUG-1 also participates in the assembly of the 19 S and 20 S subcomplexes to shuttle SRC-3 to the 20 S core for degradation (33Lassot I. Latreille D. Rousset E. Sourisseau M. Linares L.K. Chable-Bessia C. Coux O. Benkirane M. Kiernan R.E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 369-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Satoh K. Sasajima H. Nyoumura K.I. Yokosawa H. Sawada H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, according to our data, SUG-1 is not required for the degradation of RARα. SRC-3 is not required either (Fig. 2C), in contrast with what was reported for estrogen receptor α (35Shao W. Keeton E.K. McDonnell D.P. Brown M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11599-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting again a degree of specificity. Further investigations will be necessary to decipher how the proteasome is recruited for RARα degradation. SUG-1 Participates in RA Target Gene Transcription-The present study indicates that SUG-1 also participates in the transcription of RARα target genes. According to the new arising concept that dynamic exchanges of coactivators are required for transcription to proceed, SUG-1 might play a role in the control of RARα-mediated transcription through its ability to promote the degradation of SRC-3. Such a process might serve to clear out SRC-3 so that other coregulators can subsequently bind to facilitate the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery (15Collins G.A. Tansey W.P. Curr. Opin.

However, such a model is unlikely because SRC-3 degradation occurs rather late after RA addition (10-16 h) when transcription has declined (see Fig. 2) (20Gianni M. Parrella E. Raska I. Gaillard E. Nigro E.A. Gaudon C. Garattini E. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus SUG-1-mediated SRC-3 degradation would rather signal the end of the transcriptional process (37Tansey W.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In fact, the present study presents evidence that, in vivo, SUG-1 is rapidly (within 1 h) recruited onto promoters of RARα target genes. Pertinent with this new finding, SUG-1 has been recently reported to associate with several yeast promoters (38Auld K.L. Brown C.R. Casolari J.M. Komili S. Silver P.A. Mol.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4199-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given that SUG-1 interacts with SRC-3 and is recruited concomitantly with SRC-3, one can propose that SUG-1 might be a positive coregulator assembling several complexes at RARα target genes as already described for the (Spt-Ada-Gen5-acetyltransferase) histone-acetyl-transferase complex (43Lee D. Ezhkova E. Li B. Pattenden S.G. Tansey W.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 423-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However it cannot be excluded that SUG-1 is also recruited to histones as a component of the 19 S or the (ATPases independent of 20 S) complexes and as such reconfigures local chromatin to promote recruitment of appropriate histone modifiers (44Ezhkova E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 45Koues O.I. Dudley R.K. Truax A.D. Gerhardt D. Bhat K.P. McNeal S. Greer S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5837-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism of SUG-1 action may be, it is interesting to note that in fine SUG-1 has an impact on RA-induced cellular differentiation. Indeed, taking as a model the well known NB4 cells, which differentiate into granulo-cytes in response to RA, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SUG-1 decreases the RA-induced expression of several differentiation markers (supplemental Fig. S1). When Present in Excess Amounts, SUG-1 Blocks Both RARα Degradation and RARα-mediated Transcription-Unexpectedly the present study demonstrates that SUG-1 overexpression inhibits the transcription of RARα target genes as well as RARα degradation. The exact mechanism of this inhibition is not yet clear, but several hypotheses might be proposed (Fig. 7). First, a radical one might be suggested in which this inhibition would reflect the increased degradation of SRC-3 observed upon SUG-1 overexpression. Although consistent with the inhibition of RARα-mediated transcription, such a model does not fit with the inhibition of RARα degradation, because this process does not depend on SRC-3. Second, because SUG-1 interacts with several transcription factors (22vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 40Gillette T.G. Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the observed inhibition may reflect a transcriptional interference/squelching phenomenon, as previously observed for other components of transcriptional multiprotein complexes. In this regard, high levels of SUG-1 have been shown to interfere with endogenous SUG-1 function in proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and hence activation of E1A (41Rasti M. Grand R.J. Yousef A.F. Shuen M. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. Turnell A.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), VP16 (47Zhu Q. Yao J. Wani G. Chen J. Wang Q.E. Wani A.A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In fact, because SUG-1 is able to interact with RARα at the same surface involving H12 that is required for the recruitment of coactivators, the present study rather indicates that overexpressed SUG-1 binds RARα, which as such becomes stalled, unable to recruit the adequate coregulators involved in transcription or in degradation (Fig. 7B). Because the blocking effect of SUG-1 can be overcome by increasing the amounts of SRC-3, the ratio between RARα, SRC-3, and SUG-1 appears to be crucial for the control of RARα degradation and transcriptional activity, in line with their ability to interact with each other. In conclusion, consistent with the dynamics of the association-dissociation of coregulators involved in RARα-mediated transcription, we can suggest that SUG-1 shuttles between different complexes so that the correct proteins are present with the right activity at the right place and the right time. At the end, SUG-1 would join proteolytic complexes to promote the degradation of SRC-3 and the end of the RA signal. Further investigations will be required to characterize the SUG-1-associated complexes and how they participate in the proteolytic and non-proteolytic processes. Nevertheless our results demonstrate that SUG-1 plays a unique role in the expression of RA target genes by providing a link between transcription and degradation. We thank R. Losson (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC)) for providing the SUG-1 constructs and members of the cell culture facilities (IGBMC) for help."
https://openalex.org/W2054637007,"Background Some HIV infected individuals remain asymptomatic for protracted periods of time in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Virological control, CD4 T cell loss and HIV-specific responses are some of the key interrelated determinants of HIV-1 disease progression. In this study, possible interactions between viral load, CD4 T cell slopes, host genetics and HIV-specific IFN-γ responses were evaluated in chronically HIV-1-infected adults. Methodolology/Principal Findings Multilevel regression modeling was used to stratify clade A or D HIV-infected individuals into disease progression groups based on CD4 T cell slopes. ELISpot assays were used to quantify the frequency and magnitude of HIV-induced IFN-γ responses in 7 defined rapid progressors (RPs) and 14 defined slow progressors (SPs) at a single time point. HLA typing was performed using reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA). Although neither the breadth nor the magnitude of the proteome-wide HIV-specific IFN-γ response correlated with viral load, slow disease progression was associated with over-representation of host immunogenetic protective HLA B* alleles (10 of 14 SPs compared to 0 of 7; p = 0.004, Fisher's Exact) especially B*57 and B*5801, multiclade Gag T-cell targeting (71%, 10 of 14 SPs compared to 14%, 1 of 7 RPs); p = 0.029, Fisher's Exact test and evident virological control (3.65 compared to 5.46 log10 copies/mL in SPs and RPs respectively); p<0.001, unpaired student's t-test Conclusions These data are consistent with others that associated protection from HIV disease with inherent host HLA B allele-mediated ability to induce broader Gag T-cell targeting coupled with apparent virological control. These immunogenetic features of Gag-specific immune response which could influence disease progression may provide useful insight in future HIV vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2043847586,"Background Protein crystallization is a slow process of trial and error and limits the amount of solved protein structures. Search of a universal heterogeneous nucleant is an effort to facilitate crystallizability of proteins. Methodology The effect of polystyrene nanospheres on protein crystallization were tested with three commercial proteins: lysozyme, xylanase, xylose isomerase, and with five research target proteins: hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII, laccase, sarcosine dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (SDMT), and anti-testosterone Fab fragment 5F2. The use of nanospheres both in screening and as an additive for known crystallization conditions was studied. In screening, the addition of an aqueous solution of nanosphere to the crystallization drop had a significant positive effect on crystallization success in comparison to the control screen. As an additive in hydrophobin crystallization, the nanospheres altered the crystal packing, most likely due to the amphiphilic nature of hydrophobins. In the case of laccase, nanospheres could be used as an alternative for streak-seeding, which insofar had remained the only technique to produce high-diffracting crystals. With methyltransferase SDMT the nanospheres, used also as an additive, produced fewer, larger crystals in less time. Nanospheres, combined with the streak-seeding method, produced single 5F2 Fab crystals in shorter equilibration times. Conclusions All in all, the use of nanospheres in protein crystallization proved to be beneficial, both when screening new crystallization conditions to promote nucleation and when used as an additive to produce better quality crystals, faster. The polystyrene nanospheres are easy to use, commercially available and close to being inert, as even with amphiphilic proteins only the crystal packing is altered and the nanospheres do not interfere with the structure and function of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2039421691,"Bacillus subtilis StoA is an extracytoplasmic thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase (TDOR) important for the synthesis of the endospore peptidoglycan cortex protective layer. Here we demonstrate that StoA is membrane-associated in B. subtilis and report the crystal structure of the soluble protein lacking its membrane anchor. This showed that StoA adopts a thioredoxin-like fold with N-terminal and internal additions that are characteristic of extracytoplasmic TDORs. The CXXC active site of the crystallized protein was found to be in a mixture of oxidized and reduced states, illustrating that there is little conformational variation between redox states. The midpoint reduction potential was determined as -248 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7 consistent with StoA fulfilling a reductive role in endospore biogenesis. pK(a) values of the active site cysteines, Cys-65 and Cys-68, were determined to be 5.5 and 7.8. Although Cys-68 is buried within the structure, both cysteines were found to be accessible to cysteine-specific alkylating reagents. In vivo studies of site-directed variants of StoA revealed that the active site cysteines are functionally important, as is Glu-71, which lies close to the active site and is conserved in many reducing extracytoplasmic TDORs. The structure and biophysical properties of StoA are very similar to those of ResA, a B. subtilis extracytoplasmic TDOR involved in cytochrome c maturation, raising important general questions about how these similar but non-redundant proteins achieve specificity. A detailed comparison of the two proteins demonstrates that relatively subtle differences, largely located around the active sites of the proteins, are sufficient to confer specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1968962159,"Transplant arteriosclerosis is characterized by inflammation and intimal thickening caused by accumulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) both from donor and recipient. We assessed the relationship between clinical factors and the presence of host-derived SMCs in 124 myocardial biopsies from 26 consecutive patients who received hearts from opposite-sex donors. Clinical and demographic information was obtained from the patients' medical records. Host-derived SMCs accounted for 3.35+/-2.3% of cells in arterioles (range, 0.08-12.51%). As shown by linear regression analysis, an increased number of SMCs was associated with rejection grade (mean, 1.41+/-1.03, p = 0.034) and the number of leukocytes (19.1+/-12.7 per 20 high-power fields, p = 0.01). The accumulation of host-derived SMCs was associated with an increased number of leukocytes in the allografts. In vitro, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) released from leukocytes was crucial for SMC migration. After heart allotransplantation, mice treated with MCP-1-specific antibodies had significantly fewer host-derived SMCs in the grafts than mice treated with isotypic antibody controls. We conclude that the number of host-derived SMCs in human cardiac allografts is associated with the rejection grade and that MCP-1 may play pivotal role in recruiting host-derived SMCs into cardiac allografts."
https://openalex.org/W2096552620,"To identify surface-accessible residues and monitor conformational changes of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor protein in membranes, we have introduced 10 cysteine substitutions into the N-terminal ligand-binding domain. The reactivity of these mutants with progressively larger maleimide-polyethylene glycol derivatives (MPEG) was measured using a gel shift assay of tryptic fragments. The results indicate that the mutations fall into four categories as follows: sites that are highly accessible based on reactivity with the largest 20-kDa MPEG (S2C); sites that are moderately accessible based on reactivity only with 5-kDa MPEG (S6C, S7C, A189C, and S277C); sites whose accessibility is markedly enhanced by Ca(2+) (S171C, S277C, and A575C); and sites that are inaccessible irrespective of incubation conditions (S217C, A245C, and S436C). The stimulation of accessibility induced by Ca(2+) at the S277C site occurred with an EC(50) of 0.8 mum and was mimicked by Sr(2+) but not Ba(2+). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate alone did not affect reactivity of any of the mutants in the presence or absence of Ca(2+). The data are interpreted using crystal structures and EM reconstructions of the receptor. Our data identify N-terminal regions of the protein that become exposed upon Ca(2+) binding and suggest possible orientations of the suppressor and ligand-binding domains that have implications for the mechanism of gating of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2056442152,"Experience during early postnatal development plays an important role in the refinement of specific neural connections in the brain. In the mammalian visual system, altered visual experiences induce plastic adaptation of visual cortical responses and guide rearrangements of afferent axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Previous studies using visual deprivation demonstrated that the afferents serving an open eye significantly retract when cortical neurons are pharmacologically inhibited by applying a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist, muscimol, whereas those serving a deprived eye are rescued from retraction, suggesting that presynaptic activity can lead to the retraction of geniculocortical axons in the absence of postsynaptic activity. Because muscimol application suppresses the spike activity of cortical neurons leaving transmitter release intact at geniculocortical synapses, local synaptic interaction may underlie the retraction of active axons in the inhibited cortex.New studies reported here determined whether experience-driven axon retraction can occur in the visual cortex inactivated by blocking synaptic inputs. We inactivated the primary visual cortex of kittens by suppressing synaptic transmission with cortical injections of botulinum neurotoxin type E, which cleaves a synaptic protein, SNAP-25, and blocks transmitter release, and examined the geniculocortical axon morphology in the animals with normal vision and those deprived of vision binocularly. We found that afferent axons in the animals with normal vision showed a significant retraction in the inactivated cortex, as similarly observed in the muscimol-treated cortex, whereas the axons in the binocularly deprived animals were preserved.Therefore, the experience-driven axon retraction in the inactivated cortex can proceed in the absence of synaptic transmission. These results suggest that presynaptic mechanisms play an important role in the experience-driven refinement of geniculocortical axons."
