https://openalex.org/W2048158327,"All metazoan eukaryotes express microRNAs (miRNAs), roughly 22-nucleotide regulatory RNAs that can repress the expression of messenger RNAs bearing complementary sequences. Several DNA viruses also express miRNAs in infected cells, suggesting a role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Although specific viral miRNAs have been shown to autoregulate viral mRNAs or downregulate cellular mRNAs, the function of most viral miRNAs remains unknown. Here we report that the miR-K12-11 miRNA encoded by Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) shows significant homology to cellular miR-155, including the entire miRNA 'seed' region. Using a range of assays, we show that expression of physiological levels of miR-K12-11 or miR-155 results in the downregulation of an extensive set of common mRNA targets, including genes with known roles in cell growth regulation. Our findings indicate that viral miR-K12-11 functions as an orthologue of cellular miR-155 and probably evolved to exploit a pre-existing gene regulatory pathway in B cells. Moreover, the known aetiological role of miR-155 in B-cell transformation suggests that miR-K12-11 may contribute to the induction of KSHV-positive B-cell tumours in infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2088048947,"The halo of the Milky Way provides unique elemental abundance and kinematic information on the first objects to form in the Universe, and this information can be used to tightly constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution. Although the halo was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components—an inner and an outer halo—that exhibit different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational (inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of proto-Galactic clumps. The outer region of the Milky Way beyond the galactic disk, known as the halo, was long thought of as a homogenous entity, made up of ancient stars. But recent analysis of small numbers of objects within the halo suggests that they do not comprise a single population. Based on spectroscopic data from more than 20,000 stars, the halo is shown to consist of two broadly overlapping structural components — an inner halo that rotates slowly in the same direction as the Milky Way as a whole; and an outer halo rotating in the opposite direction. The outer halo has relatively low abundances of elements heavier than helium. The inner halo may have formed by a succession of dissipational mergers, and the outer halo through dissipationless processes and the tidal disruption of proto-galactic clumps. The halo of the Milky Way is clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components, an inner and an outer halo. While the inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one third that of the inner."

https://openalex.org/W2000226242,"The synthesis of SrFeO2, a new compound bearing a square-planar oxygen coordination around Fe2+, is shown. SrFeO2 is isostructural with 'infinite layer' cupric oxides, and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature. Conventional high-temperature reactions limit the control of coordination polyhedra in transition-metal oxides to those obtainable within the bounds of known coordination geometries for a given transition metal1. For example, iron atoms are almost exclusively coordinated by three-dimensional polyhedra such as tetrahedra and octahedra. However, recent works have shown that binary metal hydrides act as reducing agents at low temperatures, allowing access to unprecedented structures2,3,4. Here we show the reaction of a perovskite SrFeO3 with CaH2 to yield SrFeO2, a new compound bearing a square-planar oxygen coordination around Fe2+. SrFeO2 is isostructural with ‘infinite layer’ cupric oxides5,6,7,8, and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature in spite of the two-dimensional structure, indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due to strong Fe d to O p hybridization. Surprisingly, SrFeO2 remains free from the structural instability that might well be expected at low temperatures owing to twofold orbital degeneracy in the Fe2+ ground state with D4h point symmetry. The reduction and the oxidation between SrFeO2 and SrFeO3 proceed via the brownmillerite-type intermediate SrFeO2.5, and start at the relatively low temperature of ∼400 K, making the material appealing for a variety of applications, including oxygen ion conduction, oxygen gas absorption and catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2149362751,"Probiotics are proposed to positively modulate the intestinal epithelial barrier formed by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and intercellular junctions. Disruption of this border alters paracellular permeability and is a key mechanism for the development of enteric infections and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).To study the in vivo effect of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) on the stabilization of the intestinal barrier under healthy conditions, germfree mice were colonized with EcN or K12 E. coli strain MG1655. IECs were isolated and analyzed for gene and protein expression of the tight junction molecules ZO-1 and ZO-2. Then, in order to analyze beneficial effects of EcN under inflammatory conditions, the probiotic was orally administered to BALB/c mice with acute dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with EcN resulted in an up-regulation of ZO-1 in IECs at both mRNA and protein levels. EcN administration to DSS-treated mice reduced the loss of body weight and colon shortening. In addition, infiltration of the colon with leukocytes was ameliorated in EcN inoculated mice. Acute DSS colitis did not result in an anion secretory defect, but abrogated the sodium absorptive function of the mucosa. Additionally, intestinal barrier function was severely affected as evidenced by a strong increase in the mucosal uptake of Evans blue in vivo. Concomitant administration of EcN to DSS treated animals resulted in a significant protection against intestinal barrier dysfunction and IECs isolated from these mice exhibited a more pronounced expression of ZO-1.This study convincingly demonstrates that probiotic EcN is able to mediate up-regulation of ZO-1 expression in murine IECs and confer protection from the DSS colitis-associated increase in mucosal permeability to luminal substances."

https://openalex.org/W2012603112,"Male-factor infertility is a common condition, and etiology is unknown for a high proportion of cases. Abnormal epigenetic programming of the germline is proposed as a possible mechanism compromising spermatogenesis of some men currently diagnosed with idiopathic infertility. During germ cell maturation and gametogenesis, cells of the germ line undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming. This process involves widespread erasure of somatic-like patterns of DNA methylation followed by establishment of sex-specific patterns by de novo DNA methylation. Incomplete reprogramming of the male germ line could, in theory, result in both altered sperm DNA methylation and compromised spermatogenesis.We determined concentration, motility and morphology of sperm in semen samples collected by male members of couples attending an infertility clinic. Using MethyLight and Illumina assays we measured methylation of DNA isolated from purified sperm from the same samples. Methylation at numerous sequences was elevated in DNA from poor quality sperm.This is the first report of a broad epigenetic defect associated with abnormal semen parameters. Our results suggest that the underlying mechanism for these epigenetic changes may be improper erasure of DNA methylation during epigenetic reprogramming of the male germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2170820867,"As predicted by Darwin, bipedal posture and locomotion are key distinguishing features of the earliest known hominins. Hominin axial skeletons show many derived adaptations for bipedalism, including an elongated lumbar region, both in the number of vertebrae and their lengths, as well as a marked posterior concavity of wedged lumbar vertebrae, known as a lordosis. The lordosis stabilizes the upper body over the lower limbs in bipeds by positioning the trunk's centre of mass (COM) above the hips. However, bipedalism poses a unique challenge to pregnant females because the changing body shape and the extra mass associated with pregnancy shift the trunk's COM anterior to the hips. Here we show that human females have evolved a derived curvature and reinforcement of the lumbar vertebrae to compensate for this bipedal obstetric load. Similarly dimorphic morphologies in fossil vertebrae of Australopithecus suggest that this adaptation to fetal load preceded the evolution of Homo."
https://openalex.org/W2150125436,"Despite a mass of research on the epidemiology of seasonal influenza, overall patterns of infection have not been fully described on broad geographic scales and for specific types and subtypes of the influenza virus. Here we provide a descriptive analysis of laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data by type and subtype (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B) for 19 temperate countries in the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1997 to 2005, compiled from a public database maintained by WHO (FluNet). Key findings include patterns of large scale co-occurrence of influenza type A and B, interhemispheric synchrony for subtype A/H3N2, and latitudinal gradients in epidemic timing for type A. These findings highlight the need for more countries to conduct year-round viral surveillance and report reliable incidence data at the type and subtype level, especially in the Tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2051796655,"Between 2005 and 2050, the human population is forecast to grow by 2.7 billion, with the vast majority of this growth occurring in low income countries. This growth is likely to have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, and make the achievement of international development goals more difficult. The measurement, monitoring and potential mitigation of these impacts require high resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions. In low income countries, however, where the changes will be concentrated, the least information on the distribution of population exists. In this paper we investigate whether satellite imagery in combination with land cover information and census data can be used to create inexpensive, high resolution and easily-updatable settlement and population distribution maps over large areas.We examine various approaches for the production of maps of the East African region (Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) and where fine resolution census data exists, test the accuracies of map production approaches and existing population distribution products. The results show that combining high resolution census, settlement and land cover information is important in producing accurate population distribution maps.We find that this semi-automated population distribution mapping at unprecedented spatial resolution produces more accurate results than existing products and can be undertaken for as little as $0.01 per km(2). The resulting population maps are a product of the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP: http://www.map.ox.ac.uk) and are freely available."
https://openalex.org/W2113716558,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is one of only four bigenomic proteins in mammalian cells, having ten subunits encoded in the nuclear genome and three in the mitochondrial DNA. The mechanism of its bigenomic control is not well understood. The ten nuclear subunits are on different chromosomes, and the possibility of their coordinate regulation by the same transcription factor(s) deserves serious consideration. The present study tested our hypothesis that nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) serves such a role in subunit coordination. Following in silico analysis of murine nuclear-encoded COX subunit promoters, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays indicated NRF-1 binding to all ten promoters. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also showed NRF-1 binding to all ten promoters in murine neuroblastoma cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative NRF-1 binding sites confirmed the functionality of NRF-1 binding on all ten COX promoters. These sites are highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans. Silencing of NRF-1 with RNA interference reduced all ten COX subunit mRNAs and mRNAs of other genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. We conclude that NRF-1 plays a significant role in coordinating the transcriptional regulation of all ten nuclear-encoded COX subunits in neurons. Moreover, NRF-1 is known to activate mitochondrial transcription factors A and B, thereby indirectly regulating the expressions of the three mitochondrial-encoded COX subunits. Thus, NRF-1 and our previously described NRF-2 prove to be the two key bigenomic coordinators for transcriptional regulation of all cytochrome c oxidase subunits in neurons. Possible interactions between the NRFs will be investigated in the future.

Cytochrome c oxidase or complex IV is a large transmembrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and plasma membrane of prokaryotes. It is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, catalyzing the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen to form water. The important outcome of this reaction is the generation of ATP through the coupled process of oxidative phosphorylation. Neurons are highly dependent upon ATP for their activity and functions (1Wong-Riley M.T.T. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 94-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of ATP generated in the brain is synthesized in the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation (2Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme is reduced in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (3Manczak M. Anekonda T.S. Henson E.

Brown R.M. Chong W.K. Wilson C.J. Brown G.K. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). COX deficiency is found with different clinical phenotypes primarily affecting organs with high energy demand, such as the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney (6Lerman-Sagie T. Leshinsky-Silver E. Watemberg N. Luckman Y. Lev D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 2: 127-136Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar).COX is a complex of 13 different subunits, 3 of which (I, II, and III) are encoded in the mitochondrial DNA, and the remaining 10 are nuclear-encoded (7Kadenbach B. Jarausch J. Hartmann R. Merle P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To form a functional holoenzyme with 1:1 stoichiometry, exact coordination is essential between the two genomes. All regulatory factors directing the expression of nuclear and mitochondrial respiratory genes are of nuclear origin. Nuclear-encoded factors such as mitochondrial RNA polymerase, a transcription and mitochondrial DNA maintenance factor (TFAM), transcription specificity factors (TFB1M and TFB2M), and a transcription termination factor govern mitochondrial gene expression (8Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The second type of nuclear-encoded factors encompasses transcription factors and coactivators that control nuclear respiratory gene expression. These factors serve to integrate respiratory gene expression with a wide range of cellular functions (8Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Two redox-responsive transcription factors, nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2, or NRF-1 and NRF-2, have been proposed to mediate such bigenomic coordination in non-neuronal cells (12Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5631-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both NRF-1 and NRF-2 reportedly regulate the expression of a few nuclear-encoded COX subunit genes and indirectly regulate the three mitochondrial-encoded COX subunit genes by activating mitochondrial transcription factors A and B (TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M) (9Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 10Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1354-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In addition, both NRF-1 and NRF-2 regulate a number of genes required for mitochondrial respiratory functions (11Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).Previously, we showed that NRF-2 transcriptionally regulates all ten nuclear-encoded COX subunits in neurons (14Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Ongwijitwat S. Liang H.L. Graboyes E.M. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 374: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also found that the protein and mRNA levels of NRF-2 changed in response to changing neuronal activity and in concert with altered COX activity (16Nie F. Wong-Riley M.T.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Guo A. Nie F. Wong-Riley M.T.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 417: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Zhang C.

Neurosci. 2005; 22: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Neuronal NRF-1, NRF-2, as well as an important coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α all responded to impulse blockade in vitro and visual deprivation in vivo by down-regulating their gene expressions and gene product (21Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M.T. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our recent study indicates that NRF-1 is transcriptionally regulated by neuronal activity, and sustained activity is required for heightened NRF-1 expression in cultured neurons (22Yang S.J. Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Neurosci. 2006; 141: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether NRF-1 also plays an important role in regulating all ten nuclear-encoded COX subunit genes located on different chromosomes was entirely unknown.The goal of the present study was to test our hypothesis that NRF-1 regulates all ten nuclear-encoded COX subunit genes. Using multiple approaches, including in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), super shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), promoter mutation assays, as well as RNA interference, we documented that NRF-1 has functional binding sites on all ten nuclear-encoded COX subunit promoters in murine neurons. Furthermore, the binding sites are conserved among mice, rats, and humans. Thus, NRF-1 and NRF-2 prove to be the two key bigenomic coordinators for transcriptional regulation of all cytochrome c oxidase subunits in neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureMurine Neuro-2a neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (ATCC, CCL-131) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).In Silico Analysis of Murine COX Subunit PromotersDNA sequences surrounding the transcription start points (TSPs) of all ten nuclear-encoded murine COX subunit genes were derived from the mouse genome data base in GenBank™. These promoter sequences encompassed 1 kb upstream and up to 1 kb downstream (excluding protein-coding sequence) of the TSP of each gene analyzed. Computer-assisted search for putative NRF-1 core binding sequences “GCGCAT/CGC” or “GCGCAG/CGC” was conducted on each promoter sequence.Alignment of human, mouse, and rat promoter sequences was done as previously described, using the Genome VISTA genome alignment tool (14Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mouse COX promoter sequences were compared with rat and human genomic sequences using a 5-bp calculation window. Regions of high homology and/or contain known NRF-1 binding sites were compared for the conservation of NRF-1 binding.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Supershift AssaysEMSAs to assay NRF-1 interactions with putative binding elements on all ten COX subunit promoters were carried out as previously described (14Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, oligonucleotide probes with putative NRF-1 binding site on each murine COX subunit promoter (Table 1, based on in silico analysis) were synthesized, annealed, and labeled by a Klenow fragment fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dATP (50 μCi/200 ng). Each labeled probe was incubated with 2 μg of calf thymus DNA and 5 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega, Madison, WI) and processed for EMSA. Supershift assays were also performed and, in each reaction, 1–1.5 μg of NRF-1-specific antibodies (polyclonal goat antibodies, gift of Dr. Richard Scarpulla, Northwestern University, Chicago) were added to the probe/nuclear extract mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For competition, 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extract before adding labeled or nonspecific oligonucleotide. Shift reactions were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gel and run at 200 V for 2.5 h in 0.25× TBE buffer. Results were visualized by autoradiography. Rat cytochrome c with NRF-1 binding site at position –172/–147 was designed as previously described (12Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and used as a positive control. NRF-1 mutants with mutated sequences as shown in Table 1 were used as negative controls.TABLE 1EMSA probesGenePositionSequenceMCOX4i1-342/-313F 5′-TTTTGCTTCACGCCGGGCATCGCGACCCACGC-3′R 3′-CGAAGTGCGGCCCGTAGCGCTGGGTGCGTTTT-5′MCOX5a-155/-133F 5′-TTTTGCCGGCGACCGCATGGCGCCCC-3′R 3′-CGGCCGCTGGCGTACCGCGGGGTTTT-5′MCOX5b-110/-86F 5′-TTTTGCAGAACTGCGCATGTGCGGCGTC-3′R 3′-CGTCTTGACGCGTACGCGCCGCAGTTTT-5′MCOX6a1-166/-142F 5′-TTTTGGAACGGGGCGCATGCGCGCTCTC-3′R 3′-CCTTGCCCCGCGTACGCGCGAGAG′TTTT-5′MCOX6b-116/-94F 5′-TTTTTTAGGCAGAGGCATGCGGATTTCT-3′R 3′-AATCCGTCTCCGTACGCCTAAAGATTTT-5′MCOX6c+40/+64F 5′-TTTTCGACTCTTGCGCATGCGTGCTGCT-3′R 3′-GCTGAGAACGCGTACGCACGACGATTTT-5′MCOX7a2-66/-42F 5′-TTTTGGGTCCGGCGGCAGGCGCGGCAGG-3′R 3′-CCCAGGCCGCCGTCCGCGCCGTCCTTTT-5′MCOX7b+87/+111F 5′-TTTTCAAGGCAGCAGCATAGTCGCCGCA-3′R 3′-GTTCCGTCGTCGTATCAGCGGCGTTTTT-5′MCOX7c+141/+167F 5′-TTTTATCATGCTGCGCATAGGAGTTTCT-3′R 3′-TAGTACGACGCGTATCCTCAAAGATTTT-3′MCOX8a-161/-137F 5′-TTTTGCGTGGTGGCGCATGCCTTTAATC-3′R 3′-CGCACCACCGCGTACGGAAATTAGTTTT-5′Rat Cyt C-172/-147F 5′-TTTTCTGCTAGCCCGCATGCGCGCGCACCTTA-3′R 3′-GACGATCGGGCGTACGCGCGCGTGGAATTTTT-5′NRF-1 mutant (MCOX4i1)-342/-313F 5′-TTTTGCTTCATTACGGTTTTCGCGACCCACGC-3′R 3′-CGAAGTAATGCCCAAAAGCGCTGGGTGCGTTTT-5′NRF-1 mutant (MCOX5a)-155/-133F 5′-TTTTGCCGTTAACCTTTTGGCGCCCC-3′R 3′-CGGCAATTGGAAAACCGCGGGGTTTT-5′ Open table in a new tab ChIP AssaysChIP assays were performed similar to those previously described (23Scarpulla R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 24Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 337: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼750,000 N2a cells were used for each immunoprecipitation and were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) was used with minor modifications. Following formaldehyde fixation, cells were resuspended in a swelling buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors added right before use) and homogenized 10 times in small pestle Dounce tissue homogenizer (7 ml). Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation before being subjected to sonication. The sonicated lysate was immunoprecipitated with either 0.2 μg of NRF-1 polyclonal rabbit antibodies or 2 μg of anti-nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) p75 polyclonal goat antibodies (C20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using 1/20th of precipitated chromatin. Primers targeting promoter sequences near TSP of COX nuclear subunit genes were designed (Table 2) as previously described (14Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TFB2M promoter was used as a positive control, and exon 5 of β-actin gene was used as a negative control (Table 2). PCR reactions were carried out with the EX Taq hot-start polymerase (Takara Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) with the following cycling parameters: 30-s melting at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 59.5 °C, and 20-s extension at 72 °C (32–36 cycles per reaction). All reactions were hot-started by heating to 94 °C for 120 s. Because the proximal promoters of nuclear COX genes tend to be very GC-rich, reaction conditions for some amplicons were optimized by adding magnesium and/or 0.5 m betaine (Sigma) (reaction conditions are available upon request). Use of hot-start polymerase and PCR additives significantly improved the quality and reproducibility of ChIP. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.TABLE 2Primers for ChIP assaysGeneSequenceAmplicon lengthPositionbpMCOX4i1 promoterF 5′-GTCTTGGTCTTCCGGTTGC-3′110-43 to +49R 5′-GTCCAAGGCCGTCACCTG-3′MCOX5a promoterF 5′-CCACGCAGGAATGTTCACTA-3′237-246 to -27R 5′-ACGAGAAGCCGGTGTGAG-3′MCOX5b promoterF 5′-GTGCGGCGTCTACTTTTAGC-3′171-247 to -96R 5′-ACTCCGCGAAGTAACCTTGA-3′MCOX6a1 promoterF 5′-CAGGTCTGAGAAGGCGTTG-3′141-90 to +51R 5′-GTCAGCGTCTCGGGTCTCTC-3′MCOX6b promoterF 5′-ATAGGAGGTCGGGCTTCTTC-3′162-102 to +60R 5′-TAGCAAAGACGCCAATGTCA-3′MCOX6c promoterF 5′-ATGCGCGCTTGAATACTTTT-3′168-4 to +164R 5′-TGTCAAACCCCAGAATCTCC-3′MCOX7a2 promoterF 5′-GCTAGGAGGGAGTTCCGTTT-3′139+130 to +249R 5′-ACTCCAGTACCAGCCAAACC-3′MCOX7b promoterF 5′-AAATCTCGCGACATCTCACC-3′162-12 to +150R 5′-TTTTGGCTAAGGGCAACATC-3′MCOX7c promoterF 5′-ACAAAGCCCACAAACCTCAG-3′140-74 to +66R 5′-GAAATGGCCGTACCACCTAA-3′MCOX8a promoterF 5′-TGATGTCGGTTGGTTGTTTC-3′213-89 to +124R 5′-AGTGGCGTCAGGACAGACAT-3′MTFB2M promoterF 5′-GAAGCGAGTGAGCAAAGGAC-3′179-64 to +115R 5′-GGTCCCCTCATCCTCCTCTA-3′β-Actin exon 5F 5′-GCTCTTTTCCAGCCTTCCTT-3′187-134 to +53R 5′-CGGATGTCAACGTCACACTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction and Transfection of Luciferase Reporter Vectors for Promoter Mutagenesis StudyLuciferase reporter constructs of all 10 murine COX promoters (mCOX 4i1, 5a, 5b, 6a1, 6b, 6c, 7a2, 7b, 7c, and 8a) were made by PCR cloning the proximal promoter sequences using genomic DNA prepared from mouse N2a cells as template, digesting with KpnI and HindIII, and ligating the product directionally into pGL3 basic (Promega). Sequences of primers used for PCR cloning and mutagenesis primers are provided in Tables 3 and 4. Subunits COX5a and COX6a1 were cloned into EcoR1 site in pGEM-T Easy vector (TA cloning kit, Promega) to generate full-length construct. These pGEM-T vectors with inserts for both subunits were then subcloned into HindIII and KpnI sites and ligated to pGL3-basic vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative NRF-1 binding site on each promoter were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were verified by sequencing.TABLE 3Primers for PCR cloningCloning primersPrimer sequenceMCOX4i1F 5′-AAGGTACCCGGGTCTTGCAAATGTCTCT-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTGACAGCAAACACCTTTTAGCC-3′MCOX5aF 5′-GCACAGCACAATGTGGGTA-3′R 5′-GGAGTCTCCTACACGACTCCAG-3′MCOX5a subcloneF 5′-AAACGCGTGCACAGCACAATGTGGGTA-3′R 5′-AAAGATCTACCACAGCGCACTGGCT-3′MCOX5bF 5′-AAGGTACCCAACACTGAGCAATGGAGGA-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTGGAACAGGCTGAGCAAGATG-3′MCOX6a1F 5′-GTTCCATCTGCGTCTTCCTC-3′R 5′-AGAGACCCGAGACGCTGAC-3′MCOX6a1 subcloneF 5′-AAGGTACCGCGTCTTCCTCGCAGATACT-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTGGAACTACACCGGCGCGC-3′MCOX6bF 5′-AAGGTACCGCCAGCCCTTAATTGTTTTC-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTTCGCAACTAAAAGCTCCACA-3′MCOX6cF 5′-AAACGCGTGTGTGATGGTGCATGTGTCA-3′R 5′-AACTCGAGTAACCAGCAACAAACCGATG-3′MCOX7a2F 5′-AAACGCGTTTGCAAAAGGGTGGAAAGAC-3′R 5′-AACTCGAGAAAAATCGAAAGCCACCAGA-3′MCOX7bF 5′-AAACGCGTAGGGAGACCTGGCTTACACA-3′R 5′-AACTCGAGGGAGACGAAGATGGAACTGC-3′MCOX7cF 5′-AAGGTACCCACACAGTGACCCCCTTTTC-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTGAAATGGCCGTACCACCTAA-3′MCOX8aF 5′-AAGGTACCCCTGGGCTACTGGAGACCTT-3′R 5′-AAAAGCTTACCACGGACGAGGACCAGTT-3′ Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Mutagenesis primersMCOX411NRF-1MUTF 5′-CAGCTTCACGCCGGTTTTCGCGACCCACGCAC-3′R 5′-GTGCGTGGGTCGCGAAAACCGGCGTGAAGCTG-3′MCOX5aNRF-1MUTF 5′-AGCCGCCGGCGACCTTTTGGCGCCCCACC-3′R 5′-GGTGGGGCGCCAAAAGGTCGCCGGCGGCT-3′MCOX5bNRF-1MUTF 5′-CCACGAAGAGGCAGAACTGCTTTTGTGCGGCGTCTACT-3′R 5′-AGTAGACGCCGCACAAAAGCAGTTCTGCCTCTTCGTGG-3′MCOX6a1NRF-1MUTF 5′-CACAGGAACGGGGCTTTTGCGCGCTCTCGCTC-3′R 5′-GAGCGAGAGCGCGCAAAAGCCCCGTTCCTGTG-3′MCOX6bNRF-1MUTF 5′-CAGCACTAGTTAGGCAGAGTTTGGCGGATTTCTGAGTCTAC-3′R 5′-GTAGACTCAGAAATCCGCCAAACTCTGCCTAACTAGTGCTGG-3′MCOX6cNRF-1MUTF 5′-CCTCCATCGACTCTTGCTTTTGCGTGCTGCTGGAAGG-3′R 5′-CCTTCCAGCAGCACGCAAAAGCAAGAGTCGATGGAGG-3′MCOX7a2NRF-1MUTF 5′-TTCTGGGTCCGGCGTTTGGCGCGGCAGGG-3′R 5′-CCCTGCCGCGCCAAACGCCGGACCCAGAA-3′MCOX7bNRF-1MUTF 5′-GAATTTGCACCAAGGCAGCATTTTAGTCGCCGCAGTTCCATC-3′R 5′-GATGGAACTGCGGCGACTAAAATGCTGCCTTGGTGCAAATTC-3′MCOX7cNRF-1MUTF 5′-CTCCAACCTAATCATGCTGCTTTTAGGAGTTTCTATCTGTATGTCCTC-3′R 5′-GAGGACATACAGATAGAAACTCCTAAAAGCAGCATGATTAGGTTGGAG-3′MCOX8aNRF-1MUTF 5′-GCCGGGCGTGGTGGCTTTTGCCTTTAATCCCAGC-3′R 5′-GCTGGGATTAAAGGCAAAAGCCACCACGCCCGGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Each promoter construct was transfected into N2a cells in a 24-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000. Each well received 0.6 μg of reporter construct and 0.03 μg of pCMVβgal, which constitutively expressed β-galactosidase. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in the lysate was measured using luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured with Galacto-star reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For each sample, luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Data from six independent transfections were averaged for each promoter construct. p values were calculated from two-tailed t-tests using normalized data from individual transfections, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.Plasmid Construction of NRF-1 shRNAThe pLL3.7/U6 promoter vector with puromycin resistance was used to express murine NRF-1 shRNA (GenBank™ accession no. for NRF-1: NM_010938). Four shRNA sequences were selected: 5′-GAAAGCTGCAAGCCTATCT-3′; 5′-GCCACAGGAGGTTAATTCA-3′; 5′-GCATTACGGACCATAGTTA-3′; and 5′-AGAGCATGATCCTGGAAGA-3′. Empty vectors served as negative controls. A green fluorescent protein-containing reporter vector PLVTHM (gift of Dr. P. Aebischer, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) was used to identify transfected N2a cells. The basic gene clone method was followed and as described previously (15Ongwijitwat S. Liang H.L. Graboyes E.M. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 374: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of silencing NRF-1 expression on endogenous targets, N2a cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 to 8 × 106 cells/dish. Cells were co-transfected 3 days post-plating with either 4 μg of the shRNA plasmids (four sequences at equal amounts) or 4 μg of the empty vector and 1.5 μg of pLL3.7 Puro vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (15Ongwijitwat S. Liang H.L. Graboyes E.M. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 374: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Puromycin at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml was added to the culture medium on the second day after transfection to select for purely transfected cells. Transfection efficiency was monitored by observing green fluorescence. N2a cells were harvested after 48 h for RNA isolation.RNA Isolation and cDNA SynthesisTotal RNA was isolated by RNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three micrograms of total RNA was treated with DNase I and purified by phenol-chloroform. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and SuperScript™ II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Real-time Quantitative PCRReal-time quantitative PCRs were carried out in a Cepheid Smart Cycler Detection system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). SyBr Green (BioWhittaker Molecular Application) and EX Taq real-time quantitative PCR hot-start polymerase were used following the manufacturer's protocols and as described previously (21Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M.T. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are shown in Table 5. PCR runs: hot start 2 min at 95 °C, denaturation 10 s at 95 °C, annealing 15 s according to the Tm of each primer, and extension 10 s at 72 °C for 15–30 cycles. Melt curve analyses verified the formation of single desired PCR product. Mouse β-actin was the internal control, and the ΔΔCT method (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119102) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the relative amount of transcripts. The group means were then analyzed for overall statistical significance using analysis of variance and the Student's t test. p values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.TABLE 5Primers for real-time PCRGeneSequenceAmplicon lengthTmbp°Cβ-ActinF 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCTCCATCG-3′15459.5R 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′MCOX4i1F 5′-TCTACTTCGGTGTGCCTTCG-3′25359.5R 5′-ACTCATTGGTGCCCTTGTTC-3′MCOX5aF 5′-GGAGTTGCGTAAAGGGATGA-3′24760R 5′-CACTTTGTCAAGGCCCAGTT-3′MCOX5bF 5′-GGAGGTGGTGTCCCTACTGA-3′24159.5R 5′-CAGCCAGAACCAGATGACAG-3′MCOX6a1F 5′-TCAACGTGTTCCTCAAGTCGC-3′11560R 5′-AGGGTATGGTTACCGTCTCCC-3′MCOX6bF 5′-ATGGCCGAAGACATCAAGAC-3′25060R 5′-CAGGAAATGTGCCTTCTGCT-3′MCOX6cF 5′-AGCGTCTGCGGGTTCATA-3′15460R 5′-GCCTGCCTCATCTCTTCAAA-3′MCOX7a2F 5′-GAGGACCATCAGCACCACTT-3′23459.5R 5′-TGGAGACTGGGATGACGAC-3′MCOX7bF 5′-CGAAGCATTCAGCAAGTGGT-3′20959.5R 5′-TGGCATGACTACTGATCTCTCC-3′MCOX7cF 5′-TCTGCCTTCCGTCTCTGC-3′14560R 5′-AGAAAGGAGCAGCAAATCCA-3′MCOX8aF 5′-TCCTGCTTCGTGTGTTGTCT-3′7059R 5′-TCCCGCTTCTTGTAGCTTTC-3′NRF-2αF 5′-CTCCCGCTACACCGACTAC-3′14559.5R 5′-TCTGACCATTGTTTCCTGTTCTG-3′TFAMF 5′-CCGAAGTGTTTTTCCAGCAT-3′14460R 5′-CAGGGCTGCAATTTTCCTAA-3′TFB1MF 5′-AAGATGGCCCTTTCGTTTATGG-3′10260R 5′-GACTGTGCTGTTTGCTTCCTG-3′TFB2MF 5′-CCAAAACCCATCCCGTCAAAT-3′13560R 5′-AAGGGCTCCAAATGTGGAATAAA-3′SURF1F 5′-GGTTCCTGCTTTTAATCCCTGC-3′11961R 5′-GATGGGCTCAGCCATGACT-3′VDAC1F 5′-CTGAGTATGGGCTGACGTTTAC-3′18960R 5′-GGTGAGCTTCAGTCCACGAG-3′TOM20F 5′-GCCCTCTTCATCGGGTACTG-3′10161R 5′-ACCAAGCTGTATCTCTTCAAGGA-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot AssayControl and NRF-1 shRNA samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Blots were then reacted with ECL and exposed to autoradiographic film (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analyses of relative changes were done with an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).RESULTSIn Silico Promoter Analysis of Nuclear-encoded Mouse COX Subunit GenesIn silico analysis of the proximal promoters with DNA sequence 1 kb 5′ upstream and 100 bps beyond 3′ of TSP of murine nuclear-encoded COX 5b, 6a1, 6c, and 8a promoters showed typical sequence G/TGCGCATG/CC/TG/C/T, whereas COX 4i1, 5a, 6b, 7a2, 7b, and 7c showed atypical sequencesC/(A/T)/G/(C/A)C/(G/A) GCAT/GG/(C/A)C/GG/T/C, with the core GCA being the invariant sequence.In Vitro Binding of NRF-1 Transcription Factor on All Ten Nuclear-encoded COX Subunit PromotersElectrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) for NRF-1 interactions were carried out in vitro, using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes that encompassed putative NRF-1 binding sites on each of 10 murine COX promoters (4i1, 5a, 5b, 6a1, 6b, 6c, 7a2, 7b, 7c, and 8a). NRF-1 site from position –172/–147 of the rat cytochrome c promoter was used as a positive control, and it formed specific DNA/NRF-1 shift and supershift complexes (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). When an excess of unlabeled probe was added as a competitor, no band was found (Fig. 1A, lane 2). When labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with NRF-1 antibody but without HeLa nuclear extract, neither shift nor supershift band was observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 9 for COX 4i1- and COX 5a-specific oligonucleotides, respectively), ruling out nonspecific antibody-oligonucleotide interactions. As shown in Fig. 1 (A–C), all ten mouse COX promoters formed specific DNA-protein shift complexes when incubated with purified HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 10; Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10, respectively). These complexes were displaced by competition with excess unlabeled probes (Fig. 1A, lanes 6, 11, and 15; Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively), but were not displaced with scrambled unlabeled mutant NRF-1 probes (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 12).

https://openalex.org/W2121543427,"Observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during a life-threatening event. It is unknown whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion of remembering an emotionally salient event. Using a hand-held device to measure speed of visual perception, participants experienced free fall for 31 m before landing safely in a net. We found no evidence of increased temporal resolution, in apparent conflict with the fact that participants retrospectively estimated their own fall to last 36% longer than others' falls. The duration dilation during a frightening event, and the lack of concomitant increase in temporal resolution, indicate that subjective time is not a single entity that speeds or slows, but instead is composed of separable subcomponents. Our findings suggest that time-slowing is a function of recollection, not perception: a richer encoding of memory may cause a salient event to appear, retrospectively, as though it lasted longer."

When the differentiated cell phenotype is lost, the matrix becomes compromised and cartilage function begins to fail. We have recently shown that hypoxia promotes the differentiated phenotype through hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α)-mediated SOX9 induction of the main matrix genes. However, to date, only a few genes have been shown to be SOX9 targets, while little is known about SOX9-independent regulators. We therefore performed a detailed microarray study to address these issues. Analysis involved 35 arrays on chondrocytes obtained from seven healthy, non-elderly human cartilage samples. Genes were selected that were down-regulated with serial passage in culture (as this causes loss of the differentiated phenotype) and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia. The importance of key findings was further probed using the technique of RNA interference on these human articular chondrocytes. Our results show that hypoxia has a broader beneficial effect on the chondrocyte phenotype than has been previously described. Of especial note, we report new hypoxia-inducible and SOX9-regulated genes, Gdf10 and Chm-I. In addition, Mig6 and InhbA were induced by hypoxia, predominantly via HIF-2α, but were not regulated by SOX9. Therefore, hypoxia, and more specifically HIF-2α, promotes both SOX9-dependent and -independent factors important for cartilage homeostasis.

HIF-2α may therefore represent a new and promising therapeutic target for cartilage repair. The main function of articular cartilage is to protect the underlying bone by withstanding loading of the joint. Because it is the only cell type in the tissue, the chondrocyte is solely responsible for synthesis and maintenance of the resilient extracellular matrix that gives cartilage its mechanical integrity. The matrix predominantly consists of type II collagen fibers and aggrecan. The former enables resistance to tensional forces, whereas the latter draws water into cartilage and therefore gives the tissue its ability to withstand compressive forces (1Muir H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Buckwalter J.A. Mankin H.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, when the differentiated cell phenotype is lost, production of these proteins decreases greatly and the matrix becomes compromised, and therefore cartilage function begins to fail. An altered phenotype is found in diseased states such as arthritis, where the cartilage matrix wears away, eventually exposing the underlying bone (3Aigner T. Haag J. Martin J. Buckwalter J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, current cell-based therapies aimed at cartilage repair such as autologous chondrocyte implantation rely on subculture of chondrocytes ex vivo. However, the differentiated phenotype is also lost in such standard cell culture conditions (4von der Mark K. Gauss V. von der Mark H. Muller P.

An extensive microarray analysis was thus performed: 35 arrays from seven individual patient samples, with two time points, and primary chondrocytes from each patient acting as a positive control. The SOX9 dependence of the most promising candidates was subsequently assessed using the technique of RNA interference. In this manner, we identified novel SOX9-dependent and -independent genes relevant to expression of the differentiated human chondrocyte phenotype and hence to cartilage repair. Human Articular Chondrocyte Isolation and Expansion–Healthy articular cartilage was obtained from the femoral condyle and tibial plateau of seven patients amputated for osteosarcoma or soft tissue sarcoma that did not involve the joint (six male, one female, from 8 to 45 years old). Samples were obtained after informed patient consent and following local ethics committee guidelines. The cartilage specimens were dissected on the same day as surgery and cut into small pieces (1-2 mm2) before overnight digestion in 1.5 mg/ml collagenase 2 (Worthington®) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum (Biosera), with incubation on a shaker (∼50 rpm) at 37 °C. Freshly isolated cells were seeded at a density of 8×103/cm2 and with medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum) changed twice a week. Cultures were passaged upon reaching confluency (∼7 days). For subsequent subculture, cells were seeded at 5 × 103/cm2. Expansion of cells was performed in 20% oxygen (37 °C in humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide). After two rounds of subculture (second passage cells) the cells had undergone an ∼12-16-fold increase in number. Hypoxia Experiments–Dedifferentiated human articular chondrocytes (i.e. second passage cells) were seeded at high density (1 × 105/cm2) in either 20 or 1% oxygen, with primary chondrocytes (in 20% oxygen) acting as a positive control. The high density seeding prevented proliferation and cell spreading and therefore inhibited further dedifferentiation of the cells. Medium was pre-equilibrated at the appropriate oxygen tension before addition to cultures. Primary cultures were obtained by seeding freshly isolated chondrocytes as above and leaving for 1 week in 20% oxygen before RNA extraction and analysis. Second passage cells were lysed after 1 or 4 days of exposure to hypoxia (or control normoxia conditions). Microarray Sample Preparation–RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA quality was verified by measuring A260/A280 ratio with a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop ND-1000), and an aliquot was analyzed with the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 system. 100 ng of total RNA was used for preparing cDNA. The reaction was carried out with T7-oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II (Affymetrix). Second strand cDNA synthesis was done at 16 °C by adding DNA polymerase I and RNase H to the reaction. cDNA was then used for a first in vitro transcription of cRNA using the MEGA-script® T7 kit (Ambion). cRNA was treated with the Genechip® Sample Cleanup Module (Qiagen), and quality was analyzed with the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 system. 600 ng of cRNA was used for a second amplification cycle. For this round, double strand cDNA synthesis was followed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase (Affymetrix). After cleaning up cDNA with the Genechip® Sample Cleanup Module (Qiagen), in vitro transcription of cRNA was done in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides using the Genechip® IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix). cRNA was purified again with the Genechip® Sample Cleanup Module (Qiagen kit) and quantified (Nanodrop ND-1000). Quality of cRNA was analyzed with the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 system. cRNA was further tested by hybridizing to a Test 3.0 Array (Affymetrix). Once samples passed these control measures, 20 μg of biotinylated cRNA were hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (56921 transcripts representing 45500 genes; Affymetrix). Microarray Data Analysis–Gene expression analysis was performed using Resolver® software 7.0 (Rosetta). Data were obtained on human articular chondrocyte cultures from a total of seven patients. The following cultures were prepared for microarray analysis: primary chondrocytes (1°) in 20% oxygen (n = 7) and corresponding second passage (P2) chondrocytes after exposure to 20 and 1% oxygen (n = 7 each). These latter P2 comparisons were done after both 1 and 4 days of treatment, giving a total data set of (5 × 7) 35 arrays. Real-time PCR–This was performed on a real-time PCR Corbett Research thermocycler as previously described (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In all cases, pre-developed primer/probe sets were obtained from Applied Biosystems. cDNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA (Qiagen) using the Promega kit with random primers (Promega). Expression was normalized using ribosomal protein (RPLP0), as previous experiments had shown this gene was not regulated by hypoxia. siRNA Transfection–Human articular chondrocytes were transfected as previously described (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 3.5-cm dish. siRNA was transfected at a final concentration of 10 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h in serum-free OptiMEM I. siRNAs against HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and SOX9 were used (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). siRNA against luciferase (Dharmacon) was transfected as a non-targeting control. Efficiency of transfection was also assessed using a fluorescently labeled siRNA (siGlo) from Dharmacon. Four to six hours after transfection, medium was changed with pre-equilibrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (in 20 or 1% oxygen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and cells were incubated in 20 or 1% oxygen for 3 days. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting–Cells were lysed in urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl) for HIF analysis or otherwise in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. A protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added just prior to cell lysis. Protein (20 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting, and finally visualized using the ECL method. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-SOX9 (AB5535, 1:1000; Chemicon), mouse anti-HIF-1α (clone 54, 1:250; BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-HIF-2α (Sc-13596, 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). MIG6 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Ingvar Ferby. Statistical Analysis–Unless otherwise stated, data were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post test using Prism 4 software (GraphPad). Results are mean ± S.E. from four to seven independent experiments (i.e. using chondrocytes from four to seven individual patients). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Main Cartilage Matrix Genes Are Hypoxia-inducible–An extensive microarray analysis was performed using 35 genome-wide arrays on human articular chondrocytes obtained from seven patients (showing no signs of cartilage disease). Genes potentially relevant to the differentiated phenotype were identified as those whose expression was decreased with serial passage of chondrocytes in normoxia (dedifferentiation) and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia (redifferentiation) (Fig. 1A). A final list of 101 transcripts was obtained for which their expression met these criteria at both 1- and 4-day time points (n = 7, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). A threshold for hypoxic induction ≥1.5-fold was also applied. Results have been classified according to known function in Table 1, which also shows validation of microarray data by real-time PCR (for 23 genes). All of the established cartilage extracellular matrix genes (aggrecan, Col2a1, Col9a1, COl11a2), in addition to master chondrocyte regulator transcription factor Sox9 were identified as hypoxia-inducible genes (Table 1). In addition, the extracellular matrix protein Prelp was both highly expressed in primary human chondrocytes and hypoxia-inducible (Fig. 2D). Of the matrix proteins, higher expression in primary chondrocytes was only observed for aggrecan and Col2a1 (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively, and Table 1).TABLE 1Genes down-regulated with passage and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia in human articular chondrocytes 101 genes were identified whose expression was down-regulated in twice-passaged chondrocytes (P2 chondro) compared to primary cells (1° chondro) and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia after 1 and 4 days of treatment (n = 7, p < 0.01, hypoxic fold induction ≥ 1.5). Genes have been classified according to their function and/or cellular localization. Microarray expression intensities (AU, arbitrary units) for 1° cells are presented in the left column. Real-time PCR was performed for 23 genes by way of validation of the microarray data. The two righthand columns show real-time PCR data (obtained from cells from one patient), while the corresponding microarray data represent the average from n = 7 patients.

Relative mRNA levels (arbitrary units) for a subset of genes identified by microarray analysis. Genes were identified that were significantly down-regulated with passage and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia (p < 0.01, n = 7). Results are average ± S.E. of gene expression data and are presented in decreasing order of transcript abundance in primary chondrocytes (1°), aggrecan being the most abundant. Note: “1 day” and “4 days” data refer to expression of second passage chondrocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Applying an unsupervised genome-wide hierarchical cluster analysis, the cartilage-associated genes Hapln1 (link protein), Fgfr3, Ctgf, and the recently discovered cartilage collagen Col27a1 (20Jenkins E. Moss J.B. Pace J.M. Bridgewater L.C. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were shown to cluster tightly with the previously identified aggrecan, Col2a1, Col11a2, and Col9a2 (Fig. 3). Because this analysis was performed on the whole genome for the complete data set of 35 arrays, the cluster containing these genes indicates a very similar pattern of expression through the dedifferentiation/redifferentiation process, albeit with some variation between patient samples. Hypoxia-inducible Genes Gdf10 and Chm-I Are SOX9-dependent–Chm-I and Gdf10 were identified as hypoxia-inducible genes relevant to the differentiated chondrocyte phenotype (Fig. 2, G and H, respectively). To more directly assess the potential importance of these genes to cartilage function, we investigated their dependence on the master cartilage transcription factor SOX9 by depleting the latter using RNA interference. Fig. 4A shows that virtually all the cells were successfully transfected using Lipofectamine to deliver the siRNA oligonucleotides, with no detrimental effects on cell viability. SOX9 depletion was comprehensive as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). The expression of both Chm-I and Gdf10 was significantly reduced in both 20 and 1% oxygen in SOX9-depleted cells. Specifically, hypoxic induction of Chm-I was completely abolished by depletion of SOX9 (Fig. 4C), while that of Gdf10 was greatly reduced (Fig. 4D). INHBA and MIG6 Are Potential Chondrocyte Regulators Whose Expression Is Independent of SOX9–The highly expressed Mig6 (Fig. 2C) and InhbA (Fig. 2E) were both identified through microarray analysis as potential regulators of the chondrocyte phenotype. In addition, InhbA clustered with Col2a1 and aggrecan, among other cartilage-specific proteins, in a hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 3). Neither Mig6 (Fig. 5, C and D) nor InhbA (Fig. 5E) was found to be SOX9-dependent. However, when HIF-1α and HIF-2α were depleted in human chondrocytes (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), we showed that MIG6 hypoxic induction was specifically dependent on HIF-2α (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas InhbA was both HIF-1α- and 2α-dependent (Fig. 5E). The aim of this study was to identify novel regulators and markers of the differentiated human chondrocyte phenotype. This is important because repair of damaged and diseased cartilage relies on appropriate matrix synthesis from the resident chondrocytes. Using a microarray-based approach we identified a tightly regulated group of potentially important chondrocyte genes, whose regulation was further probed using the technique of RNA interference. We thus identified matrix protein Chm-I and growth factor Gdf10 as new SOX9-regulated genes and Mig6 and InhbA as hypoxia-inducible (predominantly through HIF-2α), but SOX-9-independent, genes defining the differentiated human chondrocyte phenotype. This study was performed using chondrocytes from healthy human cartilage, i.e. non-diseased and non-elderly tissue (mean age of 22 years). Typically, human cartilage research is done on the only tissue readily available: elderly, arthritic cartilage obtained following joint replacement. However, our samples were obtained from amputations due to sarcomas that did not involve the joint space. Thus this tissue represents a rarely obtained and highly therapeutically relevant research tool. With normal cartilage obtained from a total of seven different patients, we identified potential chondrocyte regulators by analyzing their changing expression in three different conditions: primary chondrocytes indicating the normal, differentiated phenotype; dedifferentiated cells obtained through serial subculture; and redifferentiating chondrocytes (by exposure of dedifferentiated cells to hypoxia). It has long been known that serial subculture of chondrocytes leads to loss of phenotype (4von der Mark K. Gauss V. von der Mark H. Muller P.

Med. 1983; 172: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence has shown that hypoxia promotes the differentiated phenotype (9Murphy C.L. Sambanis A. Tissue Eng. 2001; 7: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Murphy C.L. Polak J.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 199: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Domm C. Schunke M. Christesen K. Kurz B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and that the master chondrocyte regulator SOX9 is instrumental in this (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We therefore applied this double-comparison analysis (genes down-regulated with passage and subsequently up-regulated in hypoxia) to the present study to ensure that genes thus identified were not simply hypoxia-inducible but were also potentially relevant to the differentiated cell phenotype. This is in contrast to the single-comparison analyses that are normally made when adopting a microarray approach, e.g. diseased versus“normal” (21Aigner T. Fundel K. Saas J. Gebhard P.M. Haag J. Weiss T. Zien A. Obermayr F. Zimmer R. Bartnik E. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 22Aigner T. Zien A. Gehrsitz A. Gebhard P.M. McKenna L. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) or differentiated versus dedifferentiated chondrocytes (23Stokes D.G. Liu G. Coimbra I.B. Piera-Velazquez S. Crowl R.M. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 404-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The inclusion of two time points (1 and 4 days) and the use of cells from seven different patients further strengthened the analysis and gave a comprehensive data set based on 35 genome-wide arrays. The established and cartilage-specific matrix genes were thus identified as hypoxia-inducible (i.e. aggrecan, Col2a1, Col9a1, Col11a2), in addition to transcription factor SOX9, which controls expression of these genes (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The cluster analysis did reveal variations in the degree of this response between samples, which most likely reflects the fact that each sample represents cells from each of seven individual patients rather than, for example, a single cell line with replicates. Therefore these findings confirmed the validity of our approach of using hypoxia (1% oxygen) to restore the differentiated human articular chondrocyte phenotype. Because cartilage is avascular, the chondrocytes are exposed to low oxygen levels in vivo. A gradation of oxygen tension from 2 to 7% has been measured across the epiphyseal plate in rats and rabbits (7Brighton C.T. Heppenstall R.B. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1971; 53: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas lower tensions would be expected in (thicker) human cartilage. Our results highlight the importance of studying chondrocyte function in such physiological levels of oxygen (i.e. hypoxia) compared with standard in vitro conditions (20% oxygen). Using RNA interference, we provide the first evidence that Chm-I and Gdf10 are SOX9-regulated genes. In fact, their hypoxic induction was abolished by SOX9 depletion. Hypoxic induction of matrix protein Prelp was also reduced in SOX9-depeleted cells, although not to a statistically significantly degree (data not shown). ChM-I is a relatively cartilage-specific secreted protein that has been shown to have anti-angiogenic properties (24Shukunami C. Hiraki Y. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: S91-S101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, our current finding that it is hypoxia-inducible and that this is highly SOX9-dependent offers an entirely plausible mechanism for its regulation because the permanent articular cartilage, with its primary function of withstanding high mechanical loads, cannot afford a delicate blood supply and therefore must constantly inhibit vascular invasion throughout life. Although various growth factors (including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), TGF-β3, bone morphogenetic protein, and fibroblast growth factor family members) have been used in different human chondrocyte studies (25Francioli S.E.

Chem. 2007; 282: 20407-20415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), there is little evidence that these molecules are actually endogenously produced in significant amounts by adult human articular cartilage. In the current study we identified two TGF-β superfamily members, GDF10 and INHBA. The latter dimerizes to form activin-A. In a recent proteomic study, colleagues in our institute have identified activin-A as a major secreted factor from human cartilage explants (28Hermansson M. Sawaji Y. Bolton M. Alexander S. Wallace A. Begum S. Wait R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43514-43521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). They further demonstrated that activin-A induces tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in human chondrocytes. Activin-A may therefore act as an anti-catabolic factor in cartilage, because TIMP-1 inhibits the matrix-degrading enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Indeed, Chang et al. (29Chang D.M. Liu S.H. Lee H.S. Lai J.H. Chen C.H. Rheumatol. Int. 2007; 27: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) recently reported that activin-A inhibits MMP-3 in human chondrosarcoma cells and conclude that activin-A may have therapeutic potential as a chondroprotective agent. The present study provides the first evidence that this endogenously produced factor is hypoxia-inducible and furthermore that this induction is independent of SOX9. MIG6 was also identified as a potential chondrocyte regulator and was found to be very highly expressed in primary human chondrocytes. Although its mechanism of action in cartilage is not well defined, its importance to maintenance of the tissue is shown by the fact that deletion of the gene in mice leads to early onset joint disease with marked cartilage degradation (30Zhang Y.W. Su Y. Lanning N. Swiatek P.J. Bronson R.T. Sigler R. Martin R.W. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11740-11745Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies in different cell lines have shown MIG6 can be induced by stress stimuli such as mechanical/osmotic stress (31Makkinje A. Quinn D.A. Chen A. Cadilla C.L. Force T. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17838-17847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and hypoxia (32Saarikoski S.T. Rivera S.P. Hankinson O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present study is the first to show its hypoxic induction in chondrocytes. RNA interference experiments further established this occurred specifically through HIF-2α, not HIF-1α. Hypoxic induction of COL2A1, the main cartilage matrix protein, specifically involves HIF-2α, which increases COL2A1 levels via SOX9 (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, HIF-2α-mediated hypoxic induction of MIG6 does not require SOX9. In addition, because MIG6 depletion did not affect SOX9 levels (data not shown), it appears hypoxic induction of MIG6, like activin-A, represents a SOX9-independent pathway in chondrocytes important for cartilage homeostasis. In addition to Sox9, Mef2c was unexpectedly identified by our analysis. Interestingly, similarly to Sox9, in a range of mouse tissues we found Mef2c predominantly expressed in both heart muscle and cartilage (data not shown). Furthermore, Mef2c clustered with cartilage-specific genes Col2a1 and aggrecan in our microarray analysis. Although well established as a key transcription factor involved in muscle differentiation, MEF2C was recently shown to be required for craniofacial development (33Verzi M.P. Agarwal P. Brown C. McCulley D.J. Schwarz J.J. Black B.L. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 645-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and to play a role in chondrocyte hypertrophy (34Arnold M.A. Kim Y. Czubryt M.P. Phan D. McAnally J. Qi X. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that this classic muscle transcription factor plays a role in articular cartilage, and further work in this area is warranted. We have recently demonstrated that hypoxic induction of SOX9 specifically requires HIF-2α (11Lafont J.E. Talma S. Murphy C.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study, in addition to uncovering new SOX9-regulated genes (Gdf10 and Chm-I), we identify Mig6 and InhbA as HIF-2α-regulated, but SOX9-independent, genes (summarized in Fig. 6). Therefore, although SOX9 is crucial, hypoxia, and more specifically HIF-2α, also promotes SOX9-independent factors important for cartilage function. This raises the exciting possibility that manipulation of HIF-2α, rather that SOX9, may better promote the chondrocyte phenotype and, hence, cartilage repair. Future studies should address this important and clinically relevant issue. We thank Dr. Timothy P. Bonnert for helpful discussions and advice on the microarray analysis, the Clinical Sciences Centre/Imperial College Microarray Centre for hybridization of samples for microarray analysis, and Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W1967716290,"Background Adipose tissue patterning has a major influence on the risk of developing chronic disease. Environmental influences on both body fat patterning and appetite regulation are not fully understood. This study was performed to investigate the impact of resistant starch (RS) on adipose tissue deposition and central regulation of appetite in mice. Methodology and Principle Findings Forty mice were randomised to a diet supplemented with either the high resistant starch (HRS), or the readily digestible starch (LRS). Using 1H magnetic resonance (MR) methods, whole body adiposity, intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were measured. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) was used to investigate neuronal activity in hypothalamic regions involved in appetite control when fed ad libitum. At the end of the interventional period, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal adipose tissue and fasting plasma collected for hormonal and adipokine measurement. Mice on the HRS and LRS diet had similar body weights although total body adiposity, subcutaneous and visceral fat, IHCL, plasma leptin, plasma adiponectin plasma insulin/glucose ratios was significantly greater in the latter group. Adipocytes isolated from the LRS group were significantly larger and had lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. MEMRI data obtained from the ventromedial and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei suggests a satiating effect of the HRS diet despite a lower energy intake. Conclusion and Significance Dietary RS significantly impacts on adipose tissue patterning, adipocyte morphology and metabolism, glucose and insulin metabolism, as well as affecting appetite regulation, supported by changes in neuronal activity in hypothalamic appetite regulation centres which are suggestive of satiation."
https://openalex.org/W2146205339,"Aboveground litter production in forests is likely to increase as a consequence of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations, rising temperatures, and shifting rainfall patterns. As litterfall represents a major flux of carbon from vegetation to soil, changes in litter inputs are likely to have wide-reaching consequences for soil carbon dynamics. Such disturbances to the carbon balance may be particularly important in the tropics because tropical forests store almost 30% of the global soil carbon, making them a critical component of the global carbon cycle; nevertheless, the effects of increasing aboveground litter production on belowground carbon dynamics are poorly understood. We used long-term, large-scale monthly litter removal and addition treatments in a lowland tropical forest to assess the consequences of increased litterfall on belowground CO(2) production. Over the second to the fifth year of treatments, litter addition increased soil respiration more than litter removal decreased it; soil respiration was on average 20% lower in the litter removal and 43% higher in the litter addition treatment compared to the controls but litter addition did not change microbial biomass. We predicted a 9% increase in soil respiration in the litter addition plots, based on the 20% decrease in the litter removal plots and an 11% reduction due to lower fine root biomass in the litter addition plots. The 43% measured increase in soil respiration was therefore 34% higher than predicted and it is possible that this 'extra' CO(2) was a result of priming effects, i.e. stimulation of the decomposition of older soil organic matter by the addition of fresh organic matter. Our results show that increases in aboveground litter production as a result of global change have the potential to cause considerable losses of soil carbon to the atmosphere in tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W2007429193,"DNA helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent and directionally specific manner. Unwinding of double-stranded DNA is essential for the processes of DNA repair, recombination, transcription, and DNA replication. Five human DNA helicases sharing sequence similarity with the E. coli RecQ helicase have been identified. Three of the human RecQ helicases are implicated in hereditary diseases (Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome) which display clinical symptoms of premature aging and cancer. RECQ1 helicase is the most highly expressed of the human RecQ helicases; however, a genetic disease has yet not been linked to mutations in the RECQ1 gene, and the biological functions of human RECQ1 in cellular DNA metabolism are not known.In this study, we report that RECQ1 becomes phosphorylated upon DNA damage and forms irradiation-induced nuclear foci that associate with chromatin in human cells. Depletion of RECQ1 renders human cells sensitive to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin, and results in spontaneous gamma-H2AX foci and elevated sister chromatid exchanges, indicating aberrant repair of DNA breaks. Consistent with a role in homologous recombinational repair, endogenous RECQ1 is associated with the strand exchange protein Rad51 and the two proteins directly interact with high affinity.Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for a role of human RECQ1 in the response to DNA damage and chromosomal stability maintenance and point to the vital importance of RECQ1 in genome homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2009609785,"The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) modulates cell proliferation and migration, and it is involved in several human vascular pathologies including atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis. During intima layer thickening, HA increases dramatically in the neointima extracellular matrix. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the insurgence of vascular diseases, in which smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play a role by determining neointima formation through their migration and proliferation. Therefore, we established an in vitro aging model consisting of sequential passages of human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs). Comparing young and aged cells, we found that, during the aging process in vitro,HA synthesis significantly increases, as do HA synthetic enzymes (i.e. HAS2 and HAS3), the precursor synthetic enzyme (UDP-glucose dehydrogenase), and the HA receptor CD44. In aged cells, we also observed increased CD44 signaling that consisted of higher levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase ERK1/2. Further, aged AoSMCs migrated faster than young cells, and such migration could be modulated by HA, which alters the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. HA oligosaccharides of 6.8 kDa and an anti-CD44 blocking antibody prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation and inhibited AoSMCs migration. These results indicate that, during aging, HA can modulate cell migration involving CD44-mediated signaling through ERK1/2.

The amount and the molecular weight of HA are important factors that regulate the physiopathological effects that this molecule displays on cells (1Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In mammals, three specific HA synthases (HAS1, -2, and -3) and three hyaluronidases (HYAL1, 2, and PH20) regulate HA synthesis and degradation with specific biochemical properties and distributions in adult as well as in embryonic tissues (2Itano N.

Hydrated HA makes the ECM an ideal environment in which cells can move and proliferate. Moreover, HA is an important space filling molecule as is evident in the vitreous humor, the dermis and the synovial fluid of joints. Besides its chemical and mechanical properties, HA interacts with several receptors at the cellular level that specifically trigger various signal transduction responses (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The HA receptor CD44 is expressed on the surface of most cells, including immune system cells, and it mediates cell adhesion, proliferation and migration (5Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S.

Receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM) mediates cellular motility (6Nedvetzki S. Gonen E. Assayag N. Reich R. Williams R.O. Thurmond R.L. Huang J. Neudecker B.A. Wang F. Turley E.A. Naor D. Proc.

Lyve-1 is the specific HA receptor of the lymphatic system although very recent evidences indicate a more complex function of this protein unrelated to HA (7Johnson L.A. Prevo R. Clasper S.

Although it has a simple structure, it is clear that HA can modulate many cellular responses, and the amount of this GAG has to be strictly regulated. Cells during different stress responses synthesize HA cable-like structures that have a role in inflammation, acting as an adherent for monocytes and other immune system cells (12de la Motte C.A.

A large body of evidence describes a direct correlation between the amounts of HA and degree of malignancy in cancers. Considering the role of HA in cell proliferation and migration, the correlation between malignancy and HA content opened a new insight in tumor biology (16Heldin P. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2003; 36: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vascular pathology, HA accumulates during the formation of neointima, which reduces the vessel diameter and is a crucial event for the pathological outcome (17Riessen R. Wight T.N. Pastore C. Henley C. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the first steps of its formation, neointima tissue is composed mainly of proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that migrated from the tunica media of the vessel after a mechanical or other undefined injury. In this context, HA and CD44 have a pivotal role to induce SMC proliferation and migration (18Tzircotis G. Thorne R.F. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing HAS2 have high HA levels in the vasculature and developed more serious atherosclerotic lesions compared with controls (19Chai S. Chai Q. Danielsen C.C. Hjorth P. Nyengaard J.R. Ledet T. Yamaguchi Y. Rasmussen L.M. Wogensen L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, in other experiments, CD44 knock-out mice showed slower SMC proliferation rates than control mice and less severe atherosclerotic lesions (5Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Pure E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As aging is one of the major risk factors for the insurgence of vascular pathology (20Spagnoli L.G. Orlandi A. Mauriello A. Santeusanio G. Angelis C. Lucreziotti R. Ramacci M.T. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 89: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we have established a cell model for in vitro aging in order to investigate age related modifications in gene expression and cellular migration in primary human aortic SMCs (AoSMCs). Recently, we used this aging model to describe age related changes in expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the age-related changes in HA content, including the gene expression of enzymes involved in HA metabolism, and its effect on the migration properties of young and aged AoSMCs. The data obtained suggest that HA can regulate cell migration through a CD44 pathway that modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Cell Culture–Human primary aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs, donor age 17, male) were purchased from Cambrex and grown in SmGm2 complete culture medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). This cell culture medium was used in all the experiments. The cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Whenever cultures became nearly confluent, the cells were trypsinized, counted using trypan blue exclusion, and subcultured. Population doublings (PDs) were determined at each passage and were calculated as follows: PD = log (number of cells obtained/initial number of cells)/log 2. In the experiments, 4 PD and 18 PD cells were used and are referred to as young and aged AoSMCs, respectively. HA Quantification–HA and chondroitin sulfate were quantified by means of fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) and HPLC analysis (22Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, GAGs were purified starting from 300 μl of conditioned culture medium of young and aged AoSMCs by proteinase K (Fynnzyme) digestion and ethanol precipitation. GAGs associated with the cell layer were analyzed by resuspending the AoSMCs in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7, disrupting the cells with sonication, digesting with proteinase K, and recovering the GAGs by ethanol precipitation. GAGs were digested with hyaluronidase SD (Seikagaku) and by chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku). Disaccharides obtained by the enzymatic digestions were fluorotagged with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC, Molecular Probes). AMAC-tagged disaccharides were separated and quantified with FACE and HPLC. Determination of HA Molecular Size–Gel filtration chromatography was done on AMAC derivatized GAGs purified from young and aged AoSMC conditioned culture media as previously described (23Raio L. Cromi A. Grezzi F. Passi A. Karousou E. Viola M. Vigetti D. De Luca G. Bolis P. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using an FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) apparatus. Sample peaks were identified and quantified by comparing the absorbance at 280 nm with standard proteins. The identification and quantification of GAGs was done on eluted fractions (2 ml each) by digestion with hyaluronidase SD and chondroitinase ABC and analysis as described above. HA Localization–Immunofluorescence experiments were done as previously described by de la Motte et al. (12de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Briefly, young and aged AoSMCs grown on coverslips were fixed in cold methanol for 15 min. The coverslips were preincubated with PBS containing 2% FBS and then incubated in the same solution containing biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku) (5 μg/ml) and a CD44 monoclonal antibody (clone A3D8, Sigma; 10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed with PBS, and then incubated with a solution containing fluorescein-tagged streptavidin (1:500) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (H+L) (1:500) in PBS containing 2% FBS. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were mounted using mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). The slides were then sealed with nail polish and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Quantitative and Semiquantitative RT-PCR–Total RNA from both young and aged AoSMCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from human normal fetal aorta (Stratagene) and total RNA from human adult aorta (Ambion) were used to quantify the gene expression in vivo. To remove DNA contamination, DNase (Ambion) treatment was done in all samples. One μg of total RNA was retrotranscribed using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems) for 2 h at 37 °C. Quantitative RT-PCR was done on an Abi Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Probes and primers were from TaqMan gene expression assay reagents (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan gene expression assays were used: HAS1 (Hs00155410), HAS2 (Hs00193435), HAS3 (Hs00193436), HYAL2 (Hs00186841), PH20 (Hs00162139), smooth muscle α-actin (Hs00224622), ICAM (Hs00164932), VCAM (Hs00174239), CD44 (Hs00174139), RHAMM (Hs00234864), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) (Hs00163365) and RNAseP (Hs00706565_s1). Fluorescent signals generated during PCR amplifications were monitored and analyzed with Abi Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Comparison of the amount of each gene transcript among different samples was made using RNAseP as the reference. In order to determine the efficiency of each Taqman gene expression assay, standard curves were generated by serial dilution of cDNA, and quantitative evaluations of target and housekeeping gene levels were obtained by measuring threshold cycle numbers (Ct). As the differences among efficiencies of each Taqman gene expression assay were <0.1, we used the relative quantification method ΔΔCts to quantify gene expression (24Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The Taqman assay for HYAL1 detects mRNAs coding for both the active and the inactive splicing variants. Therefore, we designed two primers (5′-ACTTTCTAAGCCCCAACTACACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCTTGTATTTTCCCAGCTC-3′) to detect only the active HYAL1 wild-type transcript (25Lokeshwar V.B. Schroeder G.L. Carey R.I. Soloway M.S. Iida N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33654-33663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in canonical semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments using RED-Taq (Sigma). Moreover, to detect HYAL3 we designed 5′-TGTCCCAGGATGACCTTGTG-3′ and 5′-TCTACCCCTCAGGGATTCCA-3′-specific primers, and to detect HYAL4 we designed 5′-GCGCCCAGTTACCTTCACTT-3′ and 5′-GCAACTTAAATATTCCAATAAGGAGGA-3′ primers. For standardization, β-actin was also amplified by using 5′-GGCACCCAGCACAATGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3′ primers. Detection of Hyaluronidase Activity by Zymography–Cell lysates from young and aged AoSMC cultures were obtained by disrupting the cells with sonication in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Medium samples were concentrated 10× in a filtration apparatus with a cut-off of 10,000 Da. Aliquots of these samples were electrophoresed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml of HA (26Miura R.O. Yamagata S. Miura Y. Harada T. Yamagata T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The gel was rinsed for 2 h in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm citric acid-Na2HPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5, or in 0.1 m sodium formate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 3.5. Each gel was treated with 0.1 mg/ml Pronase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 2 h at 37 °C and stained with Alcian Blue. The electrophoretic assay of hyaluronidase activity was also used as described (27Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of HA from human umbilical cord (Sigma) was incubated with young or aged AoSMC-conditioned medium or with 30 μg of cell lysate proteins prepared by exposing young or aged AoSMC cultures to a PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C at pH 3.5 (using formate buffer, see above) or at pH 5 (using citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffer, see above), the samples were boiled and electrophoresed in standard 0.5% agarose Tris acetate-EDTA gels, and HA was stained with 0.005% Stains-All (Sigma). Migration Assay–Cell migration was measured with the Transwell (Costar) system, which allows cells to migrate through 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membranes as described previously (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells were resuspended in serum-free SmGm2 and added to the upper chamber of Transwells. The lower chamber was filled with 1.5 ml serum-free SmGm2 or 1.5 ml serum-free SmGm2 containing 10 μg/ml of purified, low endotoxin 34-mer HA oligosaccharide (28Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or 10 μg/ml of high molecular weight HA (Healon, Amersham Biosciences), or anti CD44 monoclonal antibodies (clone A3D8 at 15 μg/ml or clone BRIC235 at 5 μg/ml), or 15 μg/ml of an isotype-matched control antibody against tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma), or 15 μm (final concentration) of U0126 (Sigma), or 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB (Euroclone), or 20% FBS (Euroclone). In control experiments, HWHA was digested with 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 16 h to obtain HA disaccharides. After 6 h, filters were removed, and cells remaining on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cell scraper. The cells present beneath the membrane were fixed with cold methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Cells were counted in 10 high-power microscope fields. Western Blotting–Young and aged AoSMC cultures were lysed in ice-cold PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and a phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by means of sonication. Total protein contents were determined by the Bradford method. 30 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with specific anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) at the dilutions reported by the manufacturer. Signals were revealed using secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, and the bands visualized by chemoluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Developed films were scanned using a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analyses–Unpaired Student's t tests were done for statistical analyses. Probability values of p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. Experiments were done in triplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.E. HA Quantification and Characterization–As previously described (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we cultured commercial AoSMCs (Cambrex) in complete-SmGm2 medium (Cambrex) for several population doublings (PD) and consider as “young,” cells with 4 PD after thawing, and as “aged,” cells with 18 PD after thawing. During cell passages, AoSMCs began to show senescence associated β-galactosidase activity, which is considered a typical senescence marker (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar), increasing from about 10% in young AoSMCs to about 90% in aged cells indicating a substantial absence of senescence in the cells that we defined as young (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of cyclin p16INK4a, another senescence marker, was significantly higher in aged than in young AoSMCs (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, we exclude any dedifferentiation events because a SMC specific marker, α SM actin, and the distribution of actin filaments did not change during cell passages (21Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By FACE analyses, we found that aged cells secrete more HA into the culture medium (Fig. 1A). These findings were confirmed by quantitative HPLC analyses of disaccharides, which measured a significant 20% increase of HA secreted into the culture medium of aged relative to young AoSMCs (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the HPLC analyses also showed that the ratios of disaccharides obtained from chondroitin 4 and 6 sulfate (ΔCS-4S/ΔCS-6S) decreased during aging from 7.0 ± 0.5 in young AoSMCs to 5.4 ± 0.4 in aged cells (data not shown). The relative increase of chondroitin 6-sulfate is known to be linked with the aging process as well as with growth relative to puberty in cartilage (30Tovar A.M. Cesar D.C. Leta G.C. Mourao P.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 604-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Qualitative assessment of immunofluorescence of cultures showed that HA associated with AoSMCs was higher in aged than in young cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, some HA in aged AoSMCs was distributed in spots within cells, as previously reported in mitotic rat aortic SMCs (14Hascall V.C. Majors A.K. De La Motte C.A. Evanko S.P. Wang A. Drazba J.A. Strong S.A. Wight T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As the HA molecular weight is an important factor in HA cell responses, we characterized the size distribution of HA released in cell culture medium by young and aged AoSMC cultures with gel filtration. The average HA molecular weight was about 2.2 × 106 Da in the medium of both young and aged cells (results not shown). Gene Expression Studies of the HA-metabolizing Enzymes–Quantitative RT-PCR was used to characterize the differences in the expression of HA metabolizing enzymes between young and aged AoSMC cultures. We quantified transcripts coding for the HA synthetic enzymes (HAS1, -2, and -3) and the degrading enzymes (HYAL1, -2, and PH20) using Taqman gene expression assays. In young AoSMCs, HAS3 mRNA is the most abundant transcript for the HA synthetic enzymes, and is expressed about 10-fold higher than HAS2 mRNA (Fig. 2A, white bars). HAS2 mRNA, in turn, was expressed about 10-fold higher than HAS1 mRNA. In aged AoSMCs, HAS3 mRNA is expressed only about 1.2-fold higher than HAS2 mRNA, which is expressed about 10-fold higher than HAS1 mRNA (Fig. 2A, black bars). Fig. 2B shows a statistically significant increase of HAS2 mRNA and HAS3 mRNA expression in aged compared with young AoSMCs. Another protein involved in the onset of atherosclerosis is CD44, the HA receptor (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). This receptor may have a role in vascular cell activation and could mediate inflammatory cell recruitment (5Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Pure E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To verify whether CD44 expression during aging could be altered, we quantified its mRNA level by quantitative RT-PCR and found a statistically significant increase (∼3×) in aged AoSMCs (Fig. 2B). Western blot analyses of proteins extracted from young and aged AoSMC cultures confirmed the gene expression data (results not shown). The mRNA expression of the other HA receptor RHAMM did not change during AoSMC aging (Fig. 2E). We quantified the gene expression of the enzyme that synthesizes the UDP-sugar precursor, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, UGDH) and found a significantly higher mRNA expression (∼4×) in aged AoSMCs (Fig. 2B). To verify whether our in vitro cell aging system represents the gene expression in vivo, quantitative RT-PCR was done on human normal aorta RNA prepared from healthy donors of different ages. As a young sample, we used a pool of 5 different fetal aorta RNAs purchased from Invitrogen; as an adult sample we used a pool of 5 different aorta RNAs from donors of >65 years old (Ambion). Fig. 2C highlights the relative ratios for HAS1, -2, and -3 and Fig. 2D shows a statistically significant increase in the expression of mRNA coding for HAS1 enzymes in aged aorta, whereas HAS2 mRNA and HAS3 mRNA appear to be unchanged. Interestingly, in aorta samples, UGDH and CD44 expressions resembled those obtained in the cells aged in vitro (Fig. 2, B and D). Because SMCs in the atherosclerotic lesion change from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype (5Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Pure E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we investigated whether during in vitro aging AoSMCs undergo such a phenotypic transition. The expression of critical genes (α-SM actin, VCAM, and ICAM) characteristic of the synthetic phenotype were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR. All three of these genes did not change their expression significantly between young and aged AoSMCs, even though a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease of α-SM actin was found in aged AoSMCs (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that during in vitro aging no contractile to synthetic phenotype occurs. To confirm that the increase of HA in aged AoSMCs could be due to an up-regulation of HAS genes rather than a down-regulation of HYAL genes, we checked the expression of hyaluronidases in AoSMC cultures. HYAL2 mRNA expression was not statistically different in aged compared with young AoSMCs both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3A). For a control, mRNA coding for PH20, a testis specific hyaluronidase, was quantitated; and, as expected, no signals were found both in young and aged cells (results not shown). HYAL1 mRNA can be alternatively spliced to generate a wild-type functional isoform (HYALl1wt) and five nonfunctional isoform variants (HYAL1v1-5) (25Lokeshwar V.B. Schroe"

https://openalex.org/W2033867070,"Despite recent advances in understanding high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors, there is no consensus on the origin of the superconducting 'glue': that is, the mediator that binds electrons into superconducting pairs. The main contenders are lattice vibrations (phonons) and spin-excitations, with the additional possibility of pairing without mediators. In conventional superconductors, phonon-mediated pairing was unequivocally established by data from tunnelling experiments. Proponents of phonons as the high-T(c) glue were therefore encouraged by the recent scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on hole-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-delta (BSCCO) that reveal an oxygen lattice vibrational mode whose energy is anticorrelated with the superconducting gap energy scale. Here we report high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements of the electron-doped high-T(c) superconductor Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4 (PLCCO) (T(c) = 24 K) that reveal a bosonic excitation (mode) at energies of 10.5 +/- 2.5 meV. This energy is consistent with both spin-excitations in PLCCO measured by inelastic neutron scattering (resonance mode) and a low-energy acoustic phonon mode, but differs substantially from the oxygen vibrational mode identified in BSCCO. Our analysis of the variation of the local mode energy and intensity with the local gap energy scale indicates an electronic origin of the mode consistent with spin-excitations rather than phonons."
https://openalex.org/W2017007825,"MurM is an aminoacyl ligase that adds l-serine or l-alanine as the first amino acid of a dipeptide branch to the stem peptide lysine of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan. MurM activity is essential for clinical pneumococcal penicillin resistance. Analysis of peptidoglycan from the highly penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strain 159 revealed that in vivo and in vitro, in the presence of the appropriate acyl-tRNA, MurM159 alanylated the peptidoglycan ϵ-amino group of the stem peptide lysine in preference to its serylation. However, in contrast, identical analyses of the penicillin-susceptible strain Pn16 revealed that MurMPn16 activity supported serylation more than alanylation both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, both MurMPn16 acylation activities were far lower than the alanylation activity of MurM159. The resulting differing stem peptide structures of 159 and Pn16 were caused by the profoundly greater catalytic efficiency of MurM159 compared with MurMPn16 bought about by sequence variation between these enzymes and, to a lesser extent, differences in the in vivo tRNAAla:tRNASer ratio in 159 and Pn16. Kinetic analysis revealed that MurM159 acted during the lipid-linked stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, that the d-alanyl-d-alanine of the stem peptide and the lipid II N-acetylglucosaminyl group were not essential for substrate recognition, that ϵ-carboxylation of the lysine of the stem peptide was not tolerated, and that lipid II-alanine was a substrate, suggesting an evolutionary link to staphylococcal homologues of MurM such as FemA. Kinetic analysis also revealed that MurM recognized the acceptor stem and/or the TΨC loop stem of the tRNAAla. It is anticipated that definition of the minimal structural features of MurM substrates will allow development of novel resistance inhibitors that will restore the efficacy of β-lactams for treatment of pneumococcal infection.

The peptidoglycan in Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Gram-positive pathogens is composed of a carbohydrate polymer consisting of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid. Appended to the N-acetylmuramic acid residue is the “stem peptide” composed of up to five amino acids, l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine. The stem peptides are themselves cross-linked between the ϵ-amino group of the lysine of a pentapeptide and the carbonyl group of the fourth position d-alanine of an adjacent stem (1Bugg T.D.H. Pinto M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier, Oxford, UK1999: 241-294Google Scholar). The pneumococcal stem peptide is further modified in S. pneumoniae where the lysyl residue ϵ-amino group is substituted by a dipeptide branch consisting of l-alanine or l-serine followed invariably by l-alanine (2Garcia-Bustos J. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5415-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J.

The stem peptide is constructed in the cytoplasm appended to a UDP nucleotide (Fig. 1) in a series of reactions catalyzed by MurA to F, where MurC, -D, -E, and -F are responsible for the ATP-dependent ligation of l-alanine, d-glutamate, l-lysine, and d-alanyl-d-alanine, respectively, to form UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine (UDP-MurNAcAEKAA) (1Bugg T.D.H. Pinto M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier, Oxford, UK1999: 241-294Google Scholar). The phospho-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is transferred from this species by MraY to a membrane-bound undecaprenyl-phosphate carrier to form lipid I (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine), which is then glycosylated with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by MurG to form lipid II (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-N-acetylmuramyl (N-acetylglucosaminyl)-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine) (1Bugg T.D.H. Pinto M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier, Oxford, UK1999: 241-294Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).

After transport to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane, lipid II is polymerized by transglycosylation. This nascent peptidoglycan is given structural rigidity by transpeptidation between the position 3 lysine (with or without a dipeptide branch) and the fourth position d-alanine of adjacent stem peptides (Fig. 1) (1Bugg T.D.H. Pinto M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier, Oxford, UK1999: 241-294Google Scholar).

Despite the medical importance of this protein, knowledge of the enzyme biochemistry of MurM is sketchy and inferred. Unavailability of the peptidoglycan precursor substrates of MurM has previously restricted analysis of this protein to what can be deduced from molecular genetics, bioinformatics, and analysis of peptidoglycan precursor pools within S. pneumoniae. Recent successes in the in vitro synthesis of these precursors in our laboratory and elsewhere have, however, made the analysis of MurM enzymology a realistic proposition (17Reddy S.G. Waddell S.T.

We have therefore carried out a characterization of the enzymatic properties of MurM from two clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, one highly penicillin-resistant (159) and the other penicillin-sensitive (Pn16), that has allowed us in this paper to 1) confirm the type of enzymatic reaction carried out by MurM; 2) correlate the enzyme biochemistry of MurM with the final composition of the peptidoglycan of these two strains; 3) deduce the specificity of MurM for its peptidoglycan precursor substrates, allowing delineation of what is required for substrate binding by this enzyme; and 4) define those regions of the tRNAAla substrate of MurM that are required for binding and catalysis.

DNA sequence between these primers was amplified by Pwo DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. and a product of the correct size (1.6 kb) was purified using a Qiagen spin column and sequenced in both directions. To construct an expression vector carrying a murM allele with a 3′ sequence encoding a hexahistidine (His6) peptide, 1.3-kb fragments containing the murM allele from Pn16 and 159 were amplified by PCR from the appropriate pneumococcal DNA. Because of sequence divergence at the 5′ end of the open reading frame between the murM alleles, a 5′ primer for each gene was designed incorporating an NdeI restriction site for amplification of murMPn16 and murM159, respectively (primers 3 and 4, supplemental Table 1). A single 3′ primer for the amplification of both alleles was designed to incorporate a 3′ XhoI site and eliminate the 3′ stop codon (primer 5, supplemental Table 1).

Four tRNASer genes, tRNASer(1), tRNASer(2), tRNASer(3), and tRNASer(4) corresponding to (anticodon/locus tag) GCU/SP2253, UGA/SP2258, UGA/SP2291, and GGA/SP2247, respectively, and four UGC anticodon tRNAAla genes (1-4 with locus tags SP2270, SP2282, SP2295, and SP2243, respectively) were identified in the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome (26Tettelin H.

Of these, tRNAAla(2)UGC and tRNAAla(3)UGC were located within blocks of sequence that were identical for 3.294 kb 5′ and 1.995 kb 3′ to the gene of interest, and were not amenable to PCR amplification. For the remaining genes, primers 12-23 were designed starting at 250 bp upstream and 250 bp downstream of the mature tRNA sequence (supplemental Table 1), and genes encoding Pn16 tRNAAla(1), Pn16 tRNAAla(4), Pn16 tRNASer(1-4), and 159 tRNAAla(1) were amplified with TaqDNA polymerase; 159 tRNAAla(4) and 159 tRNASer(2) were amplified by platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, and 159 tRNASer(4) was amplified with PWO DNA polymerase. All products were of the expected size (0.6 kb) and were sequenced. No conditions could be found for the amplification of 159 tRNASer(3). 159 tRNASer(1) was amplified with platinum Pfx DNA polymerase; however, most unexpectedly, a clean 2-kb product was obtained, the 3′ termini of which were tagged with ATP and TA cloned into a linearized pCR®2.1 vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The 2-kb insert was then sequenced using the vector-specific m13 primer sequences (supplemental Table 1) either side of the insert. Techniques employed to isolate, preparatively acylate, and assay tRNAAla and tRNASer are described in supplemental Materials and Methods. This assay followed the cycling of tRNASer between MurM and SerRS. To a 0.2-ml assay was added 50 mm HEPES, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.25 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm ATP, 6.2 mg·ml-1 total tRNA159 (1.5 μm in terms of tRNASer159), 10 mm l-serine, 4.89 μm SerRS, 52.5 μmol·min-1·ml-1 myokinase, 6.60 μmol·min-1·ml-1 pyruvate kinase, 10.50 μmol·min-1·ml -1 lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.14 μm MurM159. The ΔA340 of NADH (ϵ340 nm = 6220 m-1·cm-1) was followed at 37 °C, and MurM159 activity was then initiated with 25 μm lipid II. These assays were designed to follow the transfer of label from [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla and [3H]seryl-tRNASer to the peptidoglycan precursor. Initial experiments examining the stability of the aminoacyl linkage to the tRNA suggested that at 37 °C at the pH employed in the spectrophotometric method (7.6) the half-life of M. flavus [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla was 9.8 min. However, this could be extended to 46 min by dropping the pH of the assay to 6.8.3 Therefore, to avoid interference by depletion of acyl-tRNA substrate in MurM assays, initial rate data were usually obtained at pH 6.8 within the first 10 min of reaction, where loss of alanyl-tRNAAla through chemical deacylation was <5%. Transfer of 3H-Amino-acid between [3H]Acyl-tRNA and Lipid-linked Peptidoglycan Precursors—To follow generation of 3H-alanylated lipid precursors, an assay mix typically in a final volume of 35 μl routinely contained 50 mm MOPS, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8, 1.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm l-alanine, 10 μm lipid substrate, and MurM (as indicated). Reactions were initiated by (unless otherwise indicated) the addition of 0.45 μm [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla (800-1000 cpm·pmol-1 unless stated otherwise) and were incubated at 37 °C for times specified in the text (although initial rate data were usually taken from the first 2 min of reaction). Reactions were terminated at the appropriate time by the addition of 35 μl of ice-cold 6 m pyridinium acetate, pH 4.5, and 70 μl of ice-cold butan-1-ol. The incubations were rapidly mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 1 °C at 13,000 × g, after which the butan-1-ol phase was washed with 70 μl of water and then assayed for 3H by liquid scintillation counting. To follow generation of 3H-serylated lipid precursors, exactly the same procedure was followed, except that the 1 mm l-alanine and 0.45 μm [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla were replaced with 1 mm l-serine and 0.45 μm [3H]seryl-tRNASer. Transfer of 3H-Amino-acid between [3H]Acyl-tRNA and UDP-linked Peptidoglycan Precursors—To follow generation of 3H-alanylated UDP-MurNAc peptide precursors, an assay mix to follow the MurM-catalyzed UDP-MurNAc-peptide-dependent loss of label from M. flavus [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla was devised. In a final volume of 80 μl, assays contained 50 mm MOPS, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8, 1.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm l-alanine, UDP-MurNAc peptide substrate (as indicated in the text), and 0.58 μm MurM159. Reactions were initiated by 0.45 μm [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla and were incubated at 37 °C where 10-μl samples were taken up to 3 min. Remaining [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described in supplemental Materials and Methods relative to control incubations carried out without MurM or UDP-MurNAc peptide. Nonlinear regression analyses of dependences of MurM initial velocity on substrate concentration were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. To gain insight into the activity of MurM in vivo, we examined the peptide structure of muramidase digests of Pn16 and 159 peptidoglycan by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2). This revealed that the major cross-linked species in Pn16 peptidoglycan is dimeric, composed of two adjacent peptides, without any dipeptide branch between them (peak 4).

Numerous regulatory proteins interact with the Notch receptor and its ligands and control signaling at multiple levels. Ubiquitination and endocytosis followed by endosomal sorting of both the receptor and its ligands is essential for Notch-mediated signaling. The E3 ubiquitin ligases, Neuralized (Neur) and Mind Bomb (Mib1), are crucial for regulating the activity and stability of Notch ligands in Drosophila; however, biochemical evidence that the Notch ligands are directly targeted for ubiquitination by Neur and/or Mib1 has been lacking. In this report, we explore the function of Neurl1, a mouse ortholog of Drosophila Neur. We show that Neurl1 can function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to activate monoubiquitination in vitro of Jagged1, but not other mammalian Notch ligands. Neurl1 expression decreases Jagged1 levels in cells and blocks signaling from Jagged1-expressing cells to neighboring Notch-expressing cells. We demonstrate that Neurl1 is myristoylated at its N terminus, and that myristoylation of Neurl1 targets it to the plasma membrane. Point mutations abolishing either Neurl1 myristoylation and plasma membrane localization or Neurl1 ubiquitin ligase activity impair its ability to down-regulate Jagged1 expression and to block signaling. Taken together, our results argue that Neurl1 at the plasma membrane can affect the signaling activity of Jagged1 by directly enhancing its ubiquitination and subsequent turnover.

Cells have evolved a complex machinery of signaling pathways to achieve coordination and fine programming of events that specify different cell types. Notch signaling plays an important role in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptotic events at all stages of development (1Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Notch proteins are members of a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptors that bind ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag1 (DSL) 5The abbreviations used are: DSLDelta/Serrate/Lag1NHRneuralized homology repeatNeurl1neuralized-like 1HAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferase. type presented on juxtaposed cells and specify cell fate in a wide variety of tissues through local cell-cell interactions (2Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that small differences in Notch receptor or ligand expression in adjacent cells are sufficient to alter Notch signaling, resulting in changes in cell fate decisions (3Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 4Heitzler P. Simpson P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, activation of the Notch pathway can also be fine-tuned by additional mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and control of intracellular localization, because dramatic differences in signaling and signal reception between cells do not always correlate with obvious differences in the expression levels of ligands or receptors (5Schweisguth F.

Ubiquitination of the ligands seems to be necessary not only for their turnover, but also for downstream trafficking events that render the ligands active for signaling; however, the nature of these downstream events remains unclear (6Le Borgne R.

Like Drosophila Neur, they encode proteins that consist of a C-terminal RING finger domain and two neuralized homology repeat (NHR) domains, NHR1 and NHR2. Recently, Neurl2 has been shown to exhibit a nonspecific ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Coexpression of Neurl2 with mammalian Delta-like 1 (Dll1) was shown to promote increased Dll1 ubiquitination in cells. In addition, Neurl2 functioned cooperatively with Mib1 to promote endocytosis of XDelta to Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate)-positive early endosomes (22Song R. Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoon M.-J. Yoo K.-W. Kim H.-T. Oh H.-J. Kim Y.-Y. Han J.-K. Kim C.-H. Kong Y.-Y. J. Biol.

Although Neurl1 has also been shown to exhibit a nonspecific ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (22Song R. Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoon M.-J. Yoo K.-W. Kim H.-T. Oh H.-J. Kim Y.-Y. Han J.-K. Kim C.-H. Kong Y.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36391-36400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), putative Neurl1 substrates have not been identified. In addition, whether Neurl1 plays a role in Notch signaling is unclear, because Neurl1–/– mice exhibit no abnormal cell fate specifications during neurogenesis and somitogenesis, two processes in which Notch signaling has been shown to be involved (21Ruan Y. Tecott L. Jiang M.-M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Vollrath B. Pudney J. Asa S. Leder P. Fitzgerald K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7481-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Neurl1 is a RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that can regulate Notch signaling in mammals. Neurl1 specifically targets the intracellular domain of Jagged1, but not of other Notch ligands, for monoubiquitination in vitro. Further, we show that Neurl1 expression promotes lysosomal degradation of Jagged1 in cells and blocks signaling from Jagged1-expressing cells to neighboring Notch-expressing cells. Finally, we present evidence that Neurl-dependent turnover of Jagged1 and inhibition of Notch signaling depends upon N-terminal myristoylation and plasma membrane localization of Neurl1. Plasmid Construction–The Neurl1 cDNA was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (MGC:66919 IMAGE: 6831952). The Neurl1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and introduced into pCR 2.1-TOPO Plasmids expressing Flag-tagged full-length or truncated forms of Neurl1 were amplified via PCR from pCR2.1-TOPO containing Neurl1 and subcloned with an N- or C-terminal Flag tag into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or into pBacPAK8 (Clontech) (seesupplemental Table S1 for more details). Plasmids encoding Neurl1-Rm-F and Neurl1G2A-F were generated from pcDNA3.1 Neurl1-F using site-directed mutagenesis as described (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). pBOS-SN3T, a mammalian expression vector encoding HA-tagged Jagged1 ligand (pBOS-SN3T, (25Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J.

Plasmid pIRES J1-HA was generated by introducing J1-HA cDNA in XbaI restriction site of pIRES vector (Clontech) and Neurl1-FpIRESJ1-HA plasmid was generated by introducing Neurl1-Flag in NheI and XhoI restriction sites of pIRES vector. Cell Lines–Parental cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and propagated as recommended. To generate clonal L cell lines stably expressing C-terminally HA-tagged Jagged1 (J1-HA) or C-terminally Flag-tagged Neurl1 and C-terminally HA-tagged Jagged1 (J1-HA-Neurl1-F), plasmids pIRES-J1HA or Neurl1-F-pIRES-J1HA were introduced into cells by electroporation, and G-418 resistant clones were isolated. Jagged1-HA or Neurl1-Flag expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with agarose beads conjugated to anti-HA (Sigma A2220) or anti-Flag (Sigma A2095) antibodies, followed by immunoblotting. Transfection, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation–Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with appropriate amounts of plasmid DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Sciences). At 36-h post-transfection, cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, 539131). Protein samples were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to Protran Nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) and visualized by immunoblotting with either Supersignal West Dura or Supersignal West Femto chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids and harvested 36 h after transfection in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem 539131). Lysates were incubated for 4–5 h with 50 μl of anti-Flag (M2)-agarose beads equilibrated in the same buffer. The beads were washed three times with 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100 containing 0.2 mg/ml Flag peptide (Sigma, F3290). Immunofluorescence–HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.2% Triton and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-T) and stained using mouse anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma, F3165) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using a laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Sf21 Insect Cells–Recombinant baculoviruses were generated with the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (Clontech). Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Sixty hours after infection with appropriate recombinant baculoviruses, Sf21 cells were collected in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, 539131). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was mixed with 0.2 ml of anti-Flag (M2)-agarose or anti-HA agarose beads for 4–5 h. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and bound proteins were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 0.2 mg/ml Flag peptide or 0.4 mg/ml HA peptide. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays–Wild type or mutant Neurl1, expressed in and purified from Sf21 cells, was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with ≈50 nm Uba1, ≈0.2 μm UbcH5a, UbcH2, UbcH3, UbcH6 or UbcH7, and 0.25 mg/ml ubiquitin, with or without 2 μg of JAG1ICD-HA in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.9), 5% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 60 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.3 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase. N-terminally (His)6-tagged mouse E1 was expressed in Sf21 insect cells and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography as described (27Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

Recombinant human UbcH3, UbcH6, and UbcH7 were purchased from Sigma (U2383, U9007, and U9132, respectively), and GST-tagged human UbcH2 was purchased from Boston Biochem (E2–605). In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays–HEK293T cells were transiently transfected in 150-mm dishes with plasmids encoding His-Ub and either F-Mib1 or Neurl1-F. Cells were lysed in 800 μl/dish of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, 539131). Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). His-Ub-conjugated proteins were purified by nickel chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Nickel-binding proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Flag antibody. Coculture Assay–C33A cells were plated at 70% confluency. The next day, parental L cells or cells stably expressing either J1-HA or J1-HA and Neurl1-F were added at a density equal to the monolayer of C33A cells. RNA was extracted after 0, 8, or 12 h of co-culture. When HEK293T cells were used in the coculture assay instead of L cells, they were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids and plated on C33A monolayers 36-h post-transfection. RT-PCR was performed using 50–100 ng of RNA with the ImProm II Reverse Transcription system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the following primers: HES1 forward, 5′-GATGCTCTGAAGAAAGATAGCTCGCGG-3′; HES1 reverse, 5′-CACCGCCCCCACCGGGACC-3′. Real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green SuperMix and the MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All real-time PCR assays were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. Notch-induced activation of HES1 is expressed as a ratio of HES1 RNA, normalized to actin and detected in ligand-expressing cells, compared with HES1 RNA, normalized to actin and detected in parental L cells. Identification of Neurl1 Myristoylation Site by Mass Spectrometry–C-terminally Flag-tagged Neurl1 was immuno-purified from stably transformed HEK293 cells and analyzed by MudPIT mass spectrometry (28Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotech. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar, 29Wolters D.A. Washburn M.P. Yates J.R. II I Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) as described in supplemental methods andsupplemental Table S2 to identify peptides containing myristoylated glycines (+210). Neurl1 Targets Jagged1 ICD for Ubiquitination in Vitro–In initial experiments, we found that Neurl1, expressed in and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells as a C-terminally Flag-tagged protein (Neurl-F, Fig. 1A), promotes formation of polyubiquitin chains when incubated with ubiquitin, ATP, the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1, and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5a (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 1B). To determine whether the activity of Neurl1 is RING-dependent we employed a truncated form of Neurl1 lacking the RING domain (NHR1 + 2-F) and a Neurl1 mutant in which two highly conserved RING domain cysteine residues, Cys521 and Cys524, have been changed to serine (Neurl1Rm-F, Fig. 1A). As expected, neither NHR1 + 2-F nor Neurl1Rm-F supported formation of polyubiquitin chains in vitro (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, a Neurl1 mutant, F-NHR2+R, which has an intact RING domain but lacks NHR1, was fully active (Fig. 1B, lane 6), consistent with previous reports that an intact RING domain is usually sufficient for nonspecific ubiquitin ligase activity (30Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Neurl1-F itself, particularly when reactions were performed at high E2 concentrations (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 9, and 10), suggesting that Neurl1 can be autoubiquitinated. To gain insight into the potential role of Neurl1 in ubiquitination of Notch ligands, we used a biochemical approach to investigate whether any of the ligands can be directly targeted by mammalian Neurl1. Incubation of recombinant Jagged1 intracellular domain (ICD), expressed in and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8), but not the ICDs of Dll1, Dll4, or Jagged2 (supplemental Fig. S2), with recombinant ubiquitin, E1, E2, and Neurl1-F led to the appearance of a more slowly migrating species of the size expected of monoubiquitinated Jagged1 ICD. Confirming that this species was indeed monoubiquitinated, we observed that it migrated still more slowly when we replaced ubiquitin with Flag epitope-tagged ubiquitin, which has a slightly larger molecular mass than untagged ubiquitin (Fig. 1C, lane 6). As expected, monoubiquitination of Jagged1 ICD depends on the integrity of the Neurl1 RING domain, because Neurl1Rm failed to support ICD ubiquitination (Fig. 1C, lane 5). Although it appears from our biochemical assays that Neurl1 ubiquitin ligase activity is specific for Jagged1, it is important to note that substrate recognition by many ubiquitin ligases depends upon appropriate post-translational modification of the substrate (31Deshaies R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that Neurl1 fails to support ubiquitination of other DSL ligands in our assays because they are not suitably modified when expressed in insect cells. The Neurl1 NHR2 Domain Mediates Interaction with Jagged1–Drosophila and Xenopus Neuralized have been reported to interact with Delta through the Neur NHR1 domain (32Commisso C. Boulianne G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To define the region of Neurl1 needed for interaction with Jagged1, we co-expressed Flag-tagged Neurl1 or Neurl1 mutants with HA-tagged Jagged1 ICD in Sf21 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and with full-length HA-tagged Jagged1 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2C). As expected, we were able to detect stable binding of Neurl1-F and HA-tagged Jagged or Jagged1 ICD in coimmunoprecipitations from HEK293 or insect cell lysates, respectively. The RING domain was dispensable for these interactions. In lysates of baculovirus-infected insect cells, the NHR1 domain interacted weakly with the Jagged1 ICD (Fig. 2B, lane 5); however the interaction was much more robust when NHR2 was present (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Similarly, a small amount of full-length Jagged1 coimmunoprecipitated with NHR1 from HEK293T cells, while a more robust interaction was detected when both NHR domains or NHR2 alone was present (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 8). Taken together, these results suggest that NHR2 is primarily responsible for the interaction of Neurl1 with the Jagged1 ICD. Neurl1 Is N-terminally Myristoylated and Targeted to the Plasma Membrane–In silico analysis of the mouse Neurl1 N-terminal sequence predicted that Neurl1 might be myristoylated at its second glycine residue (Fig. 3A). MS/MS analysis confirmed that this residue is indeed myristoylated in Neurl1 expressed in cells (Fig. 3B andsupplemental Table S2). Peptides containing unmodified G2 were never detected, suggesting that all or most Neurl1 is myristoylated. Whether other Neuralized proteins are myristoylated remains to be determined; however, in silico analyses predict with high confidence that one of the two isoforms of Drosophila Neuralized, but not mouse Neurl2, has a myristoylation site, while Xenopus Neurl has a possible myristoylation site (supplemental Table S3). Although Drosophila Neur has been localized to the plasma membrane, Neurl1 has been reported to have a largely cytoplasmic or nuclear localization based on analyses of Neurl1 fused at its N terminus to EGFP or other tags (20Pavlopoulos E. Kokkinaki M. Koutelou E. Mitsiadis T.A. Prinos P. Delidakis C. Kilpatrick M.W. Tsipouras P. Moschonas N.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7481-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which would be predicted to interfere with myristoylation. To begin to explore the functional significance of Neurl1 myristoylation, we compared the subcellular localization of C-terminally Flag-tagged Neurl1 and a Neurl1 mutant in which the second glycine was changed to alanine (Neurl1G2A). By confocal microscopy of transfected cells, we observed that a substantial fraction of wild-type Neurl1 was localized to the plasma membrane in 94 ± 2% of transfected cells. In contrast, Neurl1G2A was localized to the plasma membrane in only 4 ± 2% of transfected cells and instead was detected primarily in vesicular structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S4, andsupplemental Table S4). Mutation of the myristoylation site affected not only Neurl1 localization, but also levels of Neurl1 protein in cells. Drosophila and Xenopus Neuralized are expressed at very low levels due to rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome (18Lai E.C. Deblandre G.A. Kintner C. Rubin G.M. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 783-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 36Talora Claudio Sgroi Dennis C. Crum Christopher P. Dotto a.G. P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed that wild-type Neurl1 is ubiquitinated and expressed at very low levels when introduced by transient transfection into HEK293T cells, but that it is stabilized by treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (supplemental Fig. S3). Deletion or mutation of the RING domain had a modest effect on Neurl1 expression (Fig. 3, D and E). Neurl1G2A, as well as Neurl1 mutants lacking the N-terminal NHR1 domain, accumulated to substantially higher levels (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting that Neurl1 localized to the plasma membrane by myristoylation is destabilized. Neurl1 Down-regulates Jagged1 Expression–Our observations that Neurl1 interacts with Jagged1 and supports monoubiquitination of the Jagged1 ICD in vitro suggested that Neurl1 might ubiquitinate Jagged1 and regulate its stability in cells. Consistent with that possibility, we observe that expression of Jagged1 with wild-type Neurl1, but not Neurl1 with a mutated RING domain, leads to decreased accumulation of Jagged1 protein in cells. In the experiments of Fig. 4, A and B, HEK293 T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged Jagged1, with or without plasmids encoding Neurl1 or Neurl1 mutants, and the level of Jagged1 expression was determined by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies at various times after transfection. Thirty-six hours after transfection, Jagged1 was readily detectable whether or not Neurl1 was present (Fig. 4A). In the absence of Neurl1, Jagged1 levels remained relatively constant throughout the time course of the experiment, whereas in cells expressing Neurl1, Jagged1 was dramatically reduced by 48-h post-transfection (Fig. 4A). Jagged1 levels remained constant in the presence of Neurl1Rm, suggesting that loss of Jagged1 depends on Neurl1 ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 4B). In addition, although Neurl1G2A can interact with Jagged1 (Fig. 4C), Jagged1 levels remained constant in the presence of Neurl1G2A (Fig. 4B). Thus, Neurl1-dependent regulation of Jagged1 d"
https://openalex.org/W1986881659,"Background Many gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ Type III secretion systems (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into host cells in infectious processes. Methodology/Principal Findings By screening a transposon mutant library of P. aeruginosa, we found that mutation of spuDEFGH, which encode a major spermidine uptake system, abolished the expression of the exsCEBA operon that codes for key T3SS regulators under inducing conditions (low calcium). Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that inactivation of the spermidine uptake system significantly decreased the transcriptional expression of most, if not all, T3SS genes. Consistently, the spermidine uptake mutants showed decreased expression of the T3SS genes in responding to host cell extract and attenuated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, exogenous addition of spermidine to the wild type strain PAO1 enhanced the expression of exsCEBA and also the effector protein genes. Conclusion/Significance Cumulatively, these data have depicted a novel spermidine transporter-dependent signaling pathway, which appears to play an essential role in modulation of T3SS expression in P. aeruginosa."

Although small molecule chemicals with the ability to control neural stem cell fate are considered extremely useful tools in this field, few were reported. AICAR is an adenosine analog and extensively used to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic “fuel gauge” of the biological system. In the present study, we found an unrecognized astrogliogenic activity of AICAR on not only immortalized neural stem cell line C17.2 (C17.2-NSC), but also primary neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from post-natal (P0) rat hippocampus (P0-NSC) and embryonic day 14 (E14) rat embryonic cortex (E14-NSC). However, another AMPK activator, Metformin, did not alter either the C17.2-NSC or E14-NSC undifferentiated state although both Metformin and AICAR can activate the AMPK pathway in NSC. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of AMPK in C17.2-NSC was unable to block the gliogenic effects of AICAR. We also found AICAR could activate the Janus kinase (JAK) STAT3 pathway in both C17.2-NSC and E14-NSC but Metformin fails. JAK inhibitor I abolished the gliogenic effects of AICAR. Taken together, these results suggest that the astroglial differentiation effect of AICAR on neural stem cells was acting independently of AMPK and that the JAK-STAT3 pathway is essential for the gliogenic effect of AICAR.

In recent years, neuronal tropic factors have been widely studied to examine their effects on neural stem cell differentiation and related mechanism. The neurotrophin family is one of the most important inducible signals for the differentiation. Among them, nerve growth factor is well known to induce neurogenesis, and neurotrophin 3 is involved in oligodendrocyte development. Another important differentiation signal family is the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) 2The abbreviations used are:CNTFciliary neurotrophic factorLIFleukemia inhibitory factorAICAR5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosideJAKJanus kinaseSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionAMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumNSCneural stem cellbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinDNdominant-negative.2The abbreviations used are:CNTFciliary neurotrophic factorLIFleukemia inhibitory factorAICAR5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosideJAKJanus kinaseSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionAMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumNSCneural stem cellbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinDNdominant-negative.-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine family, which plays a pivotal role in regulating gliogenesis in the developing mammalian central nervous system.

AMPK is activated in response to reduced energy availability (high cellular AMP:ATP ratios) and hence serves to produce a positive energy balance by switching off ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways as well as switching on ATP-generating catabolic pathways (13Hardie D.G.

Its effects are diverse including lipid and glucose metabolism, regulation proinflammatory response, cytokine production, cell proliferation and apoptosis. So far, most evidence pointed to its activity in activating AMPK. We performed a series of experiments to test the role of AICAR in influencing neural stem cell differentiation. The evidence has uncovered a new activity of AICAR, namely its ability to induce astroglial differentiation via activating the JAK/STAT3 pathway independently of AMPK activation. Chemicals—AICAR, Metformin, and CNTF were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and JAK inhibitor I was from Calbiochem. Neural Stem Cell Culture—Three multiple self-renewing neural stem cells have been used in this study. Murine immortalized neural stem cell line C17.2 (C17.2-NSC) was originally described by Snyder et al. (19Snyder E.Y. Deitcher D.L. Walsh C. Arnold-Aldea S. Hartwieg E.A. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 33-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The C17.2-NSCs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, from Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and split when the cells reached ∼90% confluency. Adult primary neural stem cells were isolated from the hippocampus of post-natal (P0–P1) SD rats according to methods described previously (20Hu X. Jin L. Feng L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and all experiments were performed with cells that had undergone two passages. Embryonic primary neural stem cells were isolated from the cerebral cortices of E14 (embryonic day 14) SD rats. Cells were mechanically dissociated by tritration. The neurospheres derived from primary neural stem cells (P0-NSC or E14-NSC) were maintained on uncoated 25 ml-flasks (Corning) in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) that contained N2 and B27 supplements (Invitrogen) plus penicillin (Sigma, 100 μg/ml), streptomycin (Sigma, 100 μg/ml), bFGF (Promega, 10 ng/ml), and EGF (Promega, 10 ng/ml). The floating neurospheres were passaged by mechanical dissociation every 3–4 days. For monolayer growth of E14-NSC, the cells were mechanically dissociated from the E14-neurospheres and plated at a density of 20 × 104 cells/ml on 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) coated glass coverslips or 6-well plate (Corning). The monolayers maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) that contained N2 and B27 supplement (Invitrogen) plus penicillin (100 μg/ml, Sigma), streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Sigma), bFGF (20 ng/ml, Promega) and EGF (20 ng/ml, Promega). Supplement the medium with bFGF and EGF each day. For differentiation of C17.2-NSC, 1 mm AICAR, 2 mm Metformin, or medium as control was directly added to the culture. For differentiation of neurospheres derived from primary NSC (P0 or E14), the growth factor bFGF and EGF were withdrawn (N2 and B27-supplement DMEM/F12 medium as the differentiation medium) and 1 mm AICAR, 1 mm Metformin, 100 ng/ml CNTF, or medium as control were added to the culture. For differentiation of monolayer derived from E14-NSC, the growth factors were withdrawn and 1 mm AICAR, 1 mm Metformin, 100 ng/ml CNTF, or medium as control were added to the culture after NSCs were seeded and adhered in the growth factor-contained medium for 48 h (E14 + 2 DIV, day in vitro). Plasmid Construction and Transfection—cDNA encoding human AMPK α1, containing a mutation that alters aspartic acid 159 to an alanine (D159A) (21Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L.

Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection as directed by the manufacturer. Immunocytochemistry—All cell samples were seeded on 12-mm poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips for immunofluoresence analysis. C17.2-NSC were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml. E14-NSC were seeded at 20 × 104 cells/ml. Neurospheres derived from P0-NSC and E14-NSC were seeded at a density of 20–50 clones in 24-well plate. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (20Hu X. Jin L. Feng L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used to detect antigen: β-III tubulin (Chemicon, 1:200), Nestin (Chemicon, 1:200), O4 (Chemicon, 1:100), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (DAKO, 1:500), Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:200). Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, 5 μg/ml) staining was used to label nuclei. Images were captured on an Olympus fluorescent microscope (IX51) equipped with a Coolsnap camera spot system (Roper Scientific Inc, USA), 20× and 40× objectives. Images were combined for figures using Adobe Photoshop CS2. Western Blot Analysis—20–100 μg of protein per lane was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were processed for immunoblotting as described previously (20Hu X. Jin L. Feng L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used at 1:1000 dilutions unless otherwise indicated: AMPK-α, phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172), ACC, phospho-ACC (Ser-79), STAT3, phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705), GFAP (DAKO, 1:1000), β-III tubulin (Chemicon, 1:1000), Nestin (Chemicon, 1:1000) and anti-actin (Sigma, 1:5000). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).

Initial experiments to examine AICAR roles were performed by monitoring the morphology of the immortalized C17.2 neural stem cells in the presence and absence of the AICAR. Treatment of 1 mm AICAR for 48 h caused dramatic changes in morphology (Fig. 1A), because morphage is one of the criteria indicating the differentiation of C17.2-NSC. Immunochemistry result shows without AICAR treatment but in the presence of serum, nearly all C17.2 cells express Nestin, a marker for NSCs and neural progenitors (Fig. 1B, panel a), but neither the early neuronal marker β-III tubulin (Fig. 1B, panel e) nor the astrocytic marker GFAP (Fig. 1B, panel c). At 48 h of treatment with AICAR in the presence of serum, we found that 80 ± 2% of C17.2 cells displayed morphological changes and expressed GFAP (Fig. 1B, panel d). And most of them were Nestin negative (Fig. 1B, panel b). In comparison 15 ± 5% of C17.2 cells expressed β-III tubulin (Fig. 1B, panel f), very few C17.2 cells expressed O4, a marker of the oligodendrocyte lineage (data not shown). It is obvious that after AICAR treatment, Nestin+ cells decreased over time, accompanied by an increase in GFAP+ cells. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of the AICAR-treated or untreated C17.2-NSC is in agreement (Fig. 1C). The reciprocal marker appearance indicative of different cell lineage dependent on AICAR provides the evidence of the C17.2 to astrocyte transition. The AICAR activity appears dominant over that of serum. AICAR Induces Astroglial Differentiation of Both Adult and Embryonic Primary NSC—To be more definitive about the effects that AICAR induced differentiation and to test any cell type difference between C17.2-NSC and primary stem cells, we exposed two kinds of native neural stem cells separated from different developmental stages to AICAR, one from post-natal rat hippocampus (P0-NSC) and the other from embryonic day 14 rat cortex (E14-NSC). E14-NSCs were seeded and grew as monolayer system in the growth factor contained medium. At 2 DIV (day in vitro), both the bFGF and EGF were withdrawn. E14-NSCs were left untreated or treated with AICAR (1 mm) for 48 h. The quite obvious astrogliogenesis enhancement by AICAR was observed (Fig. 2, A and B): fewer Nestin+ neural stem cells were left, while fewer β-III tubulin+ early neurons and more GFAP+ early astrocytes were differentiated from AICAR-treated E14-NSC monolayer than that of untreated NSCs (Fig. 2, A, panels e–h and B, panels e–h), just like the results after CNTF treatment (Fig. 2, A, panels i–l and B, panels i–l). Western blot analysis further supported our results from immunocytochemistry, demonstrating that upon AICAR treatment for 2 days, expression of GFAP dramatically increased and the other two cell markers Nestin and β-III tubulin decreased compared with the untreated control cells (Fig. 2C). As expected, the similar results were observed on the AICAR-treated P0-NSCs (supplemental Fig. S1): The promotion of astrogliogenesis by AICAR was obvious compared with the untreated control ones. These results indicated that AICAR enhances astroglial differentiation of both primary adult NSCs (P0-NSCs) and embryonic NSCs (E14-NSCs), which is in agreement with the results observed from immortalized C17.2-NSCs. AICAR Activates the AMPK Pathway in Both C17.2-NSC and E14-NSC—AICAR, is the earliest known AMPK activator, the most of its effects have been shown to be because of AMPK activation, although few reports of its AMPK-independent effects exist (23Xiang X.

J. 2007; 404: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), To investigate if AICAR can activate the AMPK pathway in NSC as it does in other cell types, phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target ACC, an enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, was taken as an indicator of AMPK activation. As expected, AICAR induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in a time-dependent manner in both C17.2-NSC (Fig. 3A) and E14-NSC (Fig. 3B). Metformin Also Activates the AMPK Pathway in Both C17.2-NSC and E14-NSC—To investigate if AMPK activation is responsible for the effects of AICAR to induce differentiation on NSCs, we treated both of the two independent NSCs: C17.2-NSC and E14-NSC with another AMPK activator Metformin (29Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar). As expected, Metformin treatment of C17.2 led to a marked increase in AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, respectively (Fig. 3C), so did it in E14-NSC (Fig. 3D). Metformin Fails to Induce the Astroglial Differentiation of Both C17.2-NSC and E14-NSC—We then examined whether Metformin could induce NSC differentiation into astrocytes as AICAR does. Unfortunately, after 2 days treatment of 2 mm Metformin, C17.2-NSCs had no difference from the control not only on morphage (Fig. 4A) but also on marker expression (Fig. 4B). Almost all Metformin-treated C17.2 cells still highly expressed the neural stem cell marker Nestin (Fig. 4B, panel b), similar with the control (Fig. 4B, panel a). Few GFAP+ cells were observed (Fig. 4B, panels e and d). However, AICAR treated-C17.2-NSCs had significant changes in phenotype marker expression: Nestin+ cells decreased (Fig. 4B, panel c) and GFAP+ cells increased (Fig. 4B, panel f). And the similar conclusion can be drawn from both the Metformin-treated primary neurospheres (Fig. 4C) and monolayer neural stem cells derived from E14-NSCs (Fig. 4D). After 2 d treatment with Metformin, E14-NSCs showed no difference from the untreated control cells in the growth factor withdrawn differentiation medium: More Nestin+ neural stem cells left and more spontaneous differentiated β-III tubulin+ early neurons but fewer astrocytes than AICAR-treated NSCs. Dominant-negative Mutant of AMPK Fails to Block Astrogliogenic Effects of AICAR on NSCs—To further determine whether the catalytic activity of AMPK is necessary for AICAR-induced astrocytic differentiation, dominant-negative AMPK (DN-AMPK) were transiently expressed (Fig. 5A) by using dicistronic vector for simultaneous green fluorescent protein expression to mark the transfected cells. To affirm the decrease of AMPK activity by dominant suppression, cell lysates from transfected cells after 48 h of treatment with AICAR, are examined and revealed a dramatic decrease in AMPK activity (Fig. 5B). There is no obvious difference in either decreasing Nestin expression (Fig. 5C, panels b and d) or increasing GFAP expression (Fig. 5C, panels f and h), between DN-AMPK and empty vector transfection groups. These experiments reveal that reduction of endogenous AMPK activity to hinder AICAR effect on AMPK activation is no sufficient to prevent the AICAR-induced differentiation. AICAR Induces STAT3 Phosphorylation in Neural Stem Cells but Metformin Fails—Although AICAR is the most common AMPK activator, and its most known effects have been shown to be caused by AMPK activation, here it seemed that the effect of AICAR-induced astrogliogenesis is AMPK-independent. We next studied the signaling pathways underlying the effect of AICAR on NSC differentiation. It has been reported previously that the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway controls the onset of astrogliogenesis, and many experiments results have placed the JAK-STAT3 pathway at the center of the astrogliogenic machinery (30Bonni A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3178-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether the JAK-STAT3 pathway is activated by AICAR in neural stem cells. The Western blot analysis of the E14-NSC that is treated with AICAR for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 180 min showed AICAR-induced activation and phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 6A). In the contrast, another AMPK activator, Metformin, which activates AMPK, but fails to induce astrogliogenesis, could not activate the STAT3 pathway in NSC (Fig. 6B). The Gliogenic Effects of AICAR Could Be Completely Blocked by the Inhibitor of the JAK-STAT3 Pathway—We used a pan-specific JAK inhibitor, JAK inhibitor I, to further determine weather the activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway contributes to the AICAR-induced astrocytic differentiation. Western blot analysis showed that pretreatment with JAK inhibitor I blocked AICAR-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in C17.2-NSC (Fig. 7A). We then examined whether JAK inhibitor I can block AICAR-induced astrocyte differentiation. We cultured E14-NSCs in the presence of either AICAR alone or AICAR plus JAK inhibitor I for 2 days and then analyzed the expression of GFAP. It is clearly that with AICAR treatment, expression of GFAP dramatically increased. However, in the presence of AICAR and JAK inhibitor I, the expression of GFAP is no more than that of the control (JAK inhibitor I alone in differentiation medium) (Fig. 7B). The immunofluorescence detection of both Nestin and GFAP (Fig. 7C) also supported our result from the Western blot. All above demonstrated that JAK inhibitor I can abolish the gliogenic effect of AICAR on NSC and that the JAK-STAT3 pathway seems essential for the gliogenic effect of AICAR. AICAR is a most commonly utilized and quite specific agent to induce activation of AMPK, and its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism have been the hot focus of many studies. Besides, AICAR is known to exert various other effects, including regulation of proinflammatory response, cytokine production, cell proliferation and apoptosis. On neuronal cell types, AICAR has been reported to exhibit a protective effect to against apoptosis induced by fatty acids in astrocytes (35Blázquez C. Geelen M.J. Velasco G. Guzmán M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and by glucose deprivation in hippocampal neurons (36Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, thus far there are few reports about the effect of AICAR or any other metabolic regulator on neural stem cells or other stem cells. The present study has first demonstrated, cell-permeable small molecule, AICAR, can alter the fate of neural stem cells and directly induce astroglial differentiation of neural stem cells, reminiscent of that by neurotrophic factor CNTF. We first observed this astrogliogenic effect of AICAR on an immortalized murine-derived neural stem cell line, C17.2-NSC. This NSC clone, originally derived from the external germinal layer of the neonatal cerebellum and immortalized with a recombinant retrovirus containing the v-myc oncogene (19Snyder E.Y. Deitcher D.L. Walsh C. Arnold-Aldea S. Hartwieg E.A. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 33-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 37Ryder E.F. Snyder E.Y. Cepko C.L. J. Neurobiol. 1990; 21: 356-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), evinces the prototypical, stable and defining features of a stem cell: self-renewal, expression of stem cell antigens, and responsiveness to various stem cell trophins and could differentiate into noncerebellar neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo (38Snyder E.Y. Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 39Snyder E.Y. Yoon C. Flax J.D. Macklis J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 40Taylor R.M. Snyder E.Y. Transplant. Proc. 1997; 29: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Vescovi A. Snyder E.Y. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 569-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our experiment, AICAR causes about 80% of these cells to differentiate into astrocytes, as specified by GFAP expression (Fig. 1). To further confirm this result received from C17.2-NSC, we then tested AICAR on another two different primary neural stem cells derived from rat brains of different developmental stage, P0-NSCs as a model of adult neural stem cells and E14-NSCs as a model of embryonic neural stem cells. During embryonic development, the generation of three major neural cell types (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) in the CNS occurs sequentially, whereby almost all neurons are generated before the appearance of glial cells, with the exception of a few sites of postnatal and adult neurogenesis such as the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the forebrain. The “neurons-first, glia-second” differentiation theme for neural progenitors can be recapitulated in culture. So E14-NSCs, which were isolated from relatively early embryonic stages (embryonic day 14), spontaneously easily give rise to neurons, whereas neural progenitors isolated from perinatal stages (P0-NSC) tend to differentiate into astrocytes. Although adult and embryonic stem cells display similar patterns of gene expression, there still are probably some distinct differences. A striking example is their response to LIF. LIF induces astrocytic differentiation in adult progenitor cells but fails to produce a similar response in embryonic day 12 cells (42Molne′ M. Studer L. Tabar V. Ting Y.T. Eiden M.V. McKay R.D.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). So here, we exposed both adult and embryonic NSC to AICAR (supplemental Fig. S1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4C, panels c and f) to investigate whether the difference occurs. Furthermore, in order to exclude the effect from the different size of the seeded-neurospheres in aggregate culture systems, we also test AICAR on monolayer culture system (Figs. 2B and 4D, panels c and f). From all above the experiments, we can draw the same conclusion that AICAR obviously enhances the astroglial differentiation of both primary adult NSCs and embryonic NSCs, which strongly supported the results observed from immortalized C17.2-NSC. Besides, we found some morphological difference between AICAR-induced astrocytes and CNTF-induced astrocytes from E14-NSC. It is still unclear that the astrocytes produced by AICAR belong to type I or II astrocytes while it was reported that CNTF promote the differentiation into type I astrocytes in embryonic NSCs (25López J.M. Santidrián A.F. Campàs C. Gil J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but into type II in adult NSCs (43Aberg M.A. Ryttsén F. Hellgren G. Lindell K. Rosengren L.E. MacLennan A.J. Carlsson B. Orwar O. Eriksson P.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). And another possibility may be that AICAR could further change the morphology of the differentiated astrocytes since recently AICAR was reported to induce the stellation of primary astrocytes (44Favero C.B. Mandell J.W. Brain Res. 2007; 1168: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although AICAR is the most common AMPK activator and its most known effects have been associated with AMPK activation, our results appear to suggest the contrary, i.e. astrocytic differentiation by AICAR is independent of AMPK (Figs. 4 and 5). Although AICAR treatment did activate AMPK activity not only in C17.2-NSC but also in primary neural stem cells (Fig. 3, A and B), several lines of evidence suggest that this enzyme is not essential in astrogliogenic effect of AICAR. First, Metformin, even though it strongly stimulated AMPK activation in both C17.2-NSC (Fig. 3C) and E14-NSC (Fig. 3D), could not induce the astrocytic differentiation, which is confirmed not only on C17.2-NSC (Fig. 4, A and B) but also on E14-NSC (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of AMPK were unable to prevent the AICAR-induced differentiation of C17.2-NSC (Fig. 5). We also used AMPK-specific inhibitor, compound C, to further investigate the role of AMPK, and it failed to block the astrogliogenic effect of AICAR on E14-NSC (data not shown). JAK-STAT signaling is a critical part of the astrogliogenic machinery (25López J.M. Santidrián A.F. Campàs C. Gil J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 45Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 1986; 10: 3129-3140Crossref Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Factors that promote astrogliogenesis, including BMPs, bFGF, and Notch signaling, all require preactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway (46Ge W. Martinowich K. Wu X. He F. Miyamoto A. Fan G. Weinmaster G. Sun Y.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 848-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 47Kamakura S. Oishi K. Yoshimatsu T. Nakafuku M. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 48Song M.R. Ghosh A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 49Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further investigated whether the astrogliogenic effect of AICAR is also dependent on JAK-STAT3. Actually, we found that AICAR treatment induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 6A), as CNTF and LIF did (25López J.M. Santidrián A.F. Campàs C. Gil J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, Metformin could not induce the activation of STAT3 (Fig. 6B). We supposed that the difference between the ability of AICAR and Metformin to activate this signaling pathway is the reason why AICAR could induce astrogliogenesis but Metformin could not. It was confirmed by the study with a specific inhibitor of JAKs, JAK inhibitor I, which blocked not only the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 7A), but also the gliogenic effect of AICAR. JAK-STAT3 activation seems essential for gliogenic effect of AICAR (Fig. 7, B and C). Actually, there is no previous report about the effect of AICAR on the JAK-STAT pathway, the details how AICAR activates the pathway are still unclear and will be further investigated. Recently, two published reports (27Jacobs R.L. Lingrell S. Dyck J.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4516-4523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Guigas B. Taleux N. Foretz M. Detaille D. Andreelli F. Viollet B. Hue L. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of AICAR on hepatic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and phosphatidylcholine synthesis were independent of AMPK, respectively. They concluded that the AMPK-independent but AICAR-induced effects likely result from the accumulation of ZMP and the depletion of intracellular Pi. ZMP, as an AMP analogue, could directly modulate enzymes with AMP binding site such as glucokinase (50Vincent M.F. Bontemps F. den Berghe Van G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), glycogen phosphorylase (51Longnus S.L. Wambolt R.B. Parsons H.L. Brownsey R.W. Allard M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 284: R936-R944Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 52Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12076-12080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is also some other possibilities reported, Jhun et al. observed that AICAR but not its phosphorylated form ZMP is responsible for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α production through inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (50Vincent M.F. Bontemps F. den Berghe Van G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Their results suggest that AICAR may not only an activator of AMPK but also exert directly on other targets. Although the whole mechanism of AICAR induced NSC differentiation is still unclear, our data reported here and evidence of others clearly support the rationale for further investigation of AICAR action. In summary, this study has revealed a previously unknown effect of AICAR, i.e. inducing astroglial differentiation of neural stem cells independently of its classical target AMPK, but via activating the JAK-STAT3 pathway. This finding suggests AICAR, besides its common known activation of AMPK, regulate other molecules and processes as well. Naturally, small molecule AICAR could be a useful tool to further our understanding on the mechanism to control the fate of neural stem cell and induce gliogenesis.

Among the therapies considered for use in pandemic influenza is the co-administration of ion channel and neuraminidase inhibitors, both to potentially increase efficacy as well as to decrease the emergence of resistant isolates. To better understand the potential for drug interactions, a cross-over, randomized, open-label trial was conducted with amantadine, 100 mg po bid, and oseltamivir, 75 mg po bid, given alone or in combination for 5 days. Each subject (N = 17) served as their own control and was administered each drug alone or in combination, with appropriate wash-out. Co-administration with oseltamivir had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of amantadine [mean ratios (90% CI) for AUC0-12 0.93 (0.89, 0.98) and Cmax 0.96 (0.90, 1.02)]. Similarly, amantadine co-administration did not affect oseltamivir PK [AUC0-12 0.92 (0.86, 0.99) and Cmax 0.85 (0.73, 0.99)] or the PK of the metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate [AUC0-12 0.98 (0.95, 1.02) and Cmax 0.95 (0.89, 1.01)]. In this small trial there was no evidence of an increase in adverse events. Although many more subjects would need to be studied to rule out a synergistic increase in adverse events, the combination in this small human drug-drug interaction trial appears safe and without pharmacokinetic consequences.

https://openalex.org/W2058820978,"Human mesotrypsin is an isoform of trypsin that displays unusual resistance to polypeptide trypsin inhibitors and has been observed to cleave several such inhibitors as substrates. Whereas substitution of arginine for the highly conserved glycine 193 in the trypsin active site has been implicated as a critical factor in the inhibitor resistance of mesotrypsin, how this substitution leads to accelerated inhibitor cleavage is not clear. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) forms an extremely stable and cleavage-resistant complex with trypsin, and thus provides a rigorous challenge of mesotrypsin catalytic activity toward polypeptide inhibitors. Here, we report kinetic constants for mesotrypsin and the highly homologous (but inhibitor sensitive) human cationic trypsin, describing inhibition by, and cleavage of BPTI, as well as crystal structures of the mesotrypsin-BPTI and human cationic trypsin-BPTI complexes. We find that mesotrypsin cleaves BPTI with a rate constant accelerated 350-fold over that of human cationic trypsin and 150,000-fold over that of bovine trypsin. From the crystal structures, we see that small conformational adjustments limited to several side chains enable mesotrypsin-BPTI complex formation, surmounting the predicted steric clash introduced by Arg-193. Our results show that the mesotrypsin-BPTI interface favors catalysis through (a) electrostatic repulsion between the closely spaced mesotrypsin Arg-193 and BPTI Arg-17, and (b) elimination of two hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the amine leaving group portion of BPTI. Our model predicts that these deleterious interactions accelerate leaving group dissociation and deacylation."

Prostate carcinomas are considered to arise from cancer precursors including prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) 2The abbreviations used are: PINprostatic intraepithelial neoplasiaE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHAhemagglutininPMLpromyelocytic leukemia. and proliferative inflammatory atrophy (2De Marzo A.M.

Molecular alterations, including hereditary and somatic gene mutations, gene deletions, gene amplification, chromosomal rearrangements, as well as epigenetic changes, have been implicated in prostate cancer initiation and progression (3Nelson W.G.

The NK class homeobox gene NKX3.1 has been studied extensively over the past decade for its roles in prostate development and carcinogenesis (4Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression of the murine Nkx3.1 gene is androgen-dependent and is restricted largely to prostate epithelial cells in adults (5Bieberich C.J. Fujita K. He W.W. Jay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31779-31782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Dev.

Deletion of Nkx3.1 by gene targeting leads to prostate ductal morphological defects, as well as prostatic dysplasia and hyperplasia that resembles human PIN (8Bhatia-Gaur R. Donjacour A.A. Sciavolino P.J. Kim M. Desai N. Young P. Norton C.R. Gridley T. Cardiff R.D. Cunha G.R. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka M.

Dev. 2000; 95: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterozygous Nkx3.1 mice also develop hyperplasia and PIN-like lesions (8Bhatia-Gaur R. Donjacour A.A. Sciavolino P.J. Kim M. Desai N. Young P. Norton C.R. Gridley T. Cardiff R.D. Cunha G.R. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The human NKX3.1 gene maps to 8p21.2 within a region where loss of heterozygosity occurs in PIN and is common in prostate carcinomas; however, no mutations have been found in the coding region of the NKX3.1 allele remaining (11Ornstein D.K. Cinquanta M. Weiler S. Duray P.H. Emmert-Buck M.R. Vocke C.D. Linehan W.M. Ferretti J.A. J. Urol. 2001; 165: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Voeller H.J. Augustus M. Madike V. Bova G.S. Carter K.C. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4455-4459PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these observations, NKX3.1 has been proposed to function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. In support of a dose-dependent growth regulatory function of NKX3.1, reduced but not complete loss of NKX3.1 protein expression is now well documented in most human prostate cancer samples in a manner inversely correlated with Gleason score (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and also with disease progression (14Bowen C. Bubendorf L. Voeller H.J. Slack R. Willi N. Sauter G. Gasser T.C. Koivisto P. Lack E.E. Kononen J. Kallioniemi O.P. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6111-6115PubMed Google Scholar). Diminished NKX3.1 expression is thought to be an early event in prostate carcinogenesis, and reduced NKX3.1 immunostaining was observed in most proliferative inflammatory atrophy and PIN lesions analyzed (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The diminished NKX3.1 expression may be partly attributed to selective CpG methylation of the NKX3.1 promoter in some prostate cancer cases (15Asatiani E. Huang W.X. Wang A. Rodriguez Ortner E. Cavalli L.R. Haddad B.R. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1164-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, quantitative analyses of mRNA and protein levels of NKX3.1 in prostate carcinoma lesions revealed a lack of concordance between mRNA and protein levels (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In particular, decreased protein accumulation was found in four of six cases with a normal or increased mRNA level, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of NKX3.1 occurs in a significant percentage of prostate carcinomas (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It appears that NKX3.1 protein levels are regulated by multiple mechanisms in normal prostate, prostate cancer precursors, and carcinomas (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the regulation of NKX3.1, we have studied its post-translational modification. NKX3.1 is known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and this modification regulates DNA binding activity (16Gelmann E.P. Steadman D.J. Ma J. Ahronovitz N. Voeller H.J. Swope S. Abbaszadegan M. Brown K.M. Strand K. Hayes R.B. Stampfer M.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2654-2659PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that the stability of NKX3.1 protein is regulated by protein kinase CK2 in LNCaP cells, and CK2 phosphorylation prevents ubiquitin-mediated NKX3.1 degradation by the 26S proteasome (17Li X. Guan B. Maghami S. Bieberich C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is an 8-kDa small-molecule modifier that can be covalently attached to lysine residues of a substrate protein. Ubiquitination is catalyzed by three enzymes working in a cascade: ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin carrier enzyme E2, and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase E3. Ubiquitin itself contains 7 lysine residues, and the ubiquitin chain can be lengthened by the E2 and E3, leading to polyubiquitination of a substrate protein. Typically, a minimum of four sequentially attached ubiquitin moieties allows the target protein to be recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome (18Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Although the most recognized function of ubiquitination remains as a signal for protein degradation, protein ubiquitination has recently been realized to regulate diverse protein functions and cellular processes, including the cell cycle, DNA repair, transcription, endocytosis, and sorting (19Welchman R.L. Gordon C. Mayer R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). As the specificity of ubiquitination is largely conferred by the recognition of substrates by E3, we attempted to identify candidate ubiquitin E3 ligases for NKX3.1 using a “guilt by association” strategy. NKX3.1 has recently been demonstrated to interact with topoisomerase I and enhance topoisomerase I DNA-unwinding activity (20Bowen C. Stuart A. Ju J.H. Tuan J. Blonder J. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I is thought to interact with the RING domain-containing protein TOPORS (21Haluska Jr., P. Saleem A. Rasheed Z. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.F. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is known to interact with the tumor suppressor p53 (22Zhou R. Wen H. Ao S.Z. Gene. 1999; 235: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and later was found to ubiquitinate p53 (23Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H. Rasheed Z. Brownell J. Liu L.F. Lutzker S. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36440-36444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). TOPORS is widely expressed in various tissues including the prostate (24Saleem A. Dutta J. Malegaonkar D. Rasheed F. Rasheed Z. Rajendra R. Marshall H. Luo M. Li H. Rubin E.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5293-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We postulated that TOPORS may act as a ubiquitin E3 ligase toward NKX3.1. Here we have reported that the tumor suppressor NKX3.1 is negatively regulated by TOPORS in prostate cancer cells. We have demonstrated that TOPORS directly interacts with and acts as a robust E3 ubiquitin ligase for NKX3.1. Overexpression of TOPORS in LNCaP cells promotes proteasomal degradation of NKX3.1. Conversely, knockdown of TOPORS by siRNA increases NKX3.1 steady-state level and half-life. Expression Constructs and Protein Expression–Recombinant His-NKX3.1 protein was expressed and purified from bacteria as described (25Chen H. Bieberich C.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-NKX3.1 (residues 1–123) was purified from bacteria using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) beads. Recombinant GST-TOPORS protein was expressed and purified as described (23Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H. Rasheed Z. Brownell J. Liu L.F. Lutzker S. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Biol.

The pcDNA3-HA-NKX3.1 expression vector was described by Chen et al. (26Chen H. Nandi A.K. Li X. Bieberich C.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 338-340PubMed Google Scholar), pEGFP-TOPORS by Rasheed et al.

In Vitro and in Vivo Ubiquitination Assay–In vitro ubiquitination reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ZnCl2, and 4 mm ATP, with 100 nm rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 200 nm human recombinant UbcH5a, 250 μm wild-type human recombinant ubiquitin or no-lysine ubiquitin (E1, E2, and ubiquitin; Boston Biochem). In vitro reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60–90 min in a 10-μl volume. In vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as described (17Li X. Guan B. Maghami S. Bieberich C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection–LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% newborn calf serum in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.10 μm MG132 (Sigma) was administered from Me2SO stock, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem) was administered from stock made in RPMI 1640. DNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) or the Amaxa nucleofection system (Amaxa). The double transfection method for siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 was as described (17Li X. Guan B. Maghami S. Bieberich C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). siRNA was synthesized at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Biopolymer Core Facility. The sequence for TOPORS was CAA GGA GCC UGU CUA GUA A dTdT, and the negative control sequence was GCU CAG AUC AAU ACG GAG A dTdT. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR–Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed using SYBR Green I and the iCycler (Bio-Rad) with intron-spanning primers for TOPORS (5′-CGA CAC CGA CCT AGC TTT CT and 5′-CCT TAG CAG CTG ATG CCA TT). The primers for the normalization control TATA-binding protein have been described (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). TOPORS mRNA was quantified using the standard curve method, and equal mRNA inputs were verified using TATA-binding protein mRNA. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining–LNCaP cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 plus 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min on ice. The coverslips were blocked with 1% normal goat serum, and then rabbit anti-NKX3.1 antibody (1:100 dilution) (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 20 antibody at 1:100 dilution (Vector). Epifluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Western Blots–Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Signal intensities on films were quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). To quantify the effects of TOPORS siRNA knockdown on NKX3.1 accumulation, the Western blot signal was quantified in three independent experiments and normalized to β-actin. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t test. The source and dilutions of antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-NKX3.1, 1:1000 (13Bethel C.R. Faith D. Li X. Guan B. Hicks J.L. Lan F. Jenkins R.B. Bieberich C.J. De Marzo A.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10683-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); mouse anti-p53, 1:1000 (DO-1; Invitrogen); mouse anti-β-actin, 1:20,000 (Sigma); rat anti-HA, 1:1000 (Roche); and mouse anti-GFP, 1:2000 (Covance). TOPORS Interacts with and Ubiquitinates NKX3.1–To determine whether TOPORS can interact with NKX3.1, GST-pulldown assays were conducted. Recombinant GST-tagged TOPORS was purified and immobilized on glutathione beads as bait (Fig. 1A). Recombinant His-tagged NKX3.1 protein was specifically captured by GST-TOPORS in the pulldown assay (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that NKX3.1 can interact directly with TOPORS in vitro. Because TOPORS is a known E3 ubiquitin ligase for the transcription factors p53 (23Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H. Rasheed Z. Brownell J. Liu L.F. Lutzker S. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36440-36444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Hairy (29Secombe J. Parkhurst S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17126-17133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether TOPORS can also ubiquitinate NKX3.1. In the presence of ubiquitin, E1, and E2 (UbcH5a) enzymes, TOPORS induced the appearance of higher molecular weight species of NKX3.1 (Fig. 1C), indicating TOPORS functions as a ubiquitin ligase for NKX3.1 in vitro. Given that NKX3.1 contains 14 lysine residues (Fig. 2A), the high molecular weight forms of NKX3.1 seen in Fig. 1C could represent either polyubiquitinated or multiply monoubiquitinated forms of NKX3.1. As monoubiquitination or multiply monoubiquitination of a substrate may have functional outcomes other than proteasomal degradation (30Hoeller D. Hecker C.M. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 776-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we examined the pattern of NKX3.1 ubiquitin laddering either in the presence of wild-type ubiquitin or no-lysine ubiquitin. As TOPORS concentration was increased in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction, more ubiquitinated forms of NKX3.1 accumulated (Fig. 1D). Comparison between wild-type ubiquitin- and no-lysine ubiquitin-containing reactions revealed that TOPORS can both mono- and polyubiquitinate NKX3.1. TOPORS appeared to be capable of ubiquitinating up to 10 lysine residues in NKX3.1, based on the apparent molecular mass of the largest ubiquitinated NKX3.1 species (120 kDa) present in the Western blot of the reactions containing no-lysine ubiquitin (Fig. 1D). NKX3.1 is a 234-amino acid protein with the homeodomain spanning residues 124–184 (Fig. 2A). To study the domains in NKX3.1 responsible for TOPORS interaction, His- or HA-tagged NKX3.1 truncation fragments (Fig. 2A) were generated and used for GST-pulldown assays (Fig. 2, B and C). The HA-tagged full-length NKX3.1, fragments 1–183, and 124–234 could be efficiently translated in vitro (Fig. 2E); however, the in vitro translation efficiency for HA-tagged 1–123 and 124–183 fragments was too low to obtain comparable materials for GST-pulldown assays (data not shown). Thus bacteria-purified recombinant His-tagged NKX3.1 (residues 1–123) was used, and HA-NKX3.1 (residues 124–183) was excluded from the GST-pulldown analyses. The N terminus alone (Fig. 2B, construct b (1–123)) could interact with TOPORS, although the interaction was weaker than with full-length NKX3.1. Both the N terminus plus homeodomain (Fig. 2C, construct c: 1–183) and the homeodomain plus C terminus (Fig. 2C, construct d: 124–234) readily interacted with TOPORS. In the in vitro ubiquitination assays, the N terminus alone was not ubiquitinated by TOPORS, suggesting that the N-terminal lysines are not likely to be ubiquitin acceptors. In contrast, all other constructs containing the homeodomain were readily ubiquitinated (Fig. 2C). The homeodomain alone was ubiquitinated by TOPORS, although at a lower efficiency compared with other constructs (Fig. 2C). This may be due to the fact that the in vitro translation efficiency for the homeodomain alone construct is relatively low, or alternatively, because the N or C termini may stabilize the interaction with TOPORS. TOPORS Targets NKX3.1 for Degradation in Cells–To study the effect of TOPORS on NKX3.1 in vivo, an NKX3.1-negative cell line (NIH/3T3) was transfected with an NKX3.1 expression construct along with increasing amounts of a GFP-tagged TOPORS expression construct. Overexpression of TOPORS resulted in a reduction of the steady-state levels of exogenous NKX3.1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The level of endogenous NKX3.1 in LNCaP cells was also quantified and was shown to be consistently down-regulated (∼50%) by TOPORS overexpression, and the effect was partially reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3B). Considering that the transfection efficiency of LNCaP cells is less than 100%, the down-regulation of NKX3.1 by TOPORS overexpression measured by Western blot analysis is likely to be an underestimate. To examine whether the effect of down-regulation of NKX3.1 by TOPORS is mediated by ubiquitination in cells, LNCaP cells were cotransfected with NKX3.1, His-ubiquitin, and TOPORS expression vectors and treated with MG132. Ubiquitinated NKX3.1 was then analyzed by Western blotting after ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down using Ni-NTA beads. TOPORS led to an increase in the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of NKX3.1 in vivo (Fig. 3C). The down-regulation of NKX3.1 by GFP-TOPORS was also confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-NKX3.1 antibodies. Under standard culture conditions, NKX3.1 showed nuclear staining with varying intensity among LNCaP cells (Fig. 4A). However, NKX3.1 staining was undetectable in all GFP-TOPORS positive cells (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Interestingly, NKX3.1 was found to colocalize with GFP-TOPORS in distinct nuclear bodies upon the addition of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of TOPORS in LNCaP Cells Stabilizes NKX3.1–To study the effect of endogenous TOPORS on NKX3.1 in cells, an siRNA approach was used to knock down TOPORS in LNCaP cells. Transfection of TOPORS siRNA resulted in over 90% reduction of TOPORS mRNA analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5A). Western blot analyses of parallel samples demonstrated that the NKX3.1 steady-state level increased 2.6-fold (Student's t test, p = 0.002) in the presence of TOPORS siRNA (Fig. 5B). As a control, the protein level of the known TOPORS substrate, p53, was also analyzed and shown to be similarly increased (Fig. 5B). To further confirm that the negative regulation of NKX3.1 by TOPORS is indeed mediated by protein degradation, we examined the rate of degradation of NKX3.1. After TOPORS siRNA transfection, protein synthesis was inhibited using cycloheximide treatment, and the levels of NKX3.1 and p53 were then analyzed at the indicated times. The half-life of NKX3.1 was increased 1.5-fold (Student's t test, p = 0.004) in TOPORS siRNA-treated samples (Fig. 5, C and D). These data together demonstrate that TOPORS negatively regulates NKX3.1 in LNCaP cells. Deregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been linked to the genesis of multiple forms of human cancer (30Hoeller D. Hecker C.M. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 776-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 31Mani A. Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 4776-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Here we have reported the interaction of the prostate-specific tumor suppressor NKX3.1 with the ubiquitously expressed E3 ubiquitin ligase TOPORS. Overall, our data support a negative regulatory role for TOPORS on NKX3.1 in prostate cancer cells through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We have demonstrated that TOPORS and NKX3.1 directly interact in vitro and that the homeodomain of NKX3.1 is essential for the interaction (Fig. 2). The homeodomain of NKX3.1 is known to be involved in mediating the interaction with multiple protein partners, including prostate-derived Ets factor (25Chen H. Bieberich C.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), serum response factor (32Ju J.H. Maeng J.S. Zemedkun M. Ahronovitz N. Mack J.W. Ferretti J.A. Gelmann E.P. Gruschus J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Sp proteins (33Simmons S.O. Horowitz J.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and topoisomerase I (20Bowen C. Stuart A. Ju J.H. Tuan J. Blonder J. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The colocalization of NKX3.1 and GFP-TOPORS after MG132 treatment further supports their interaction in vivo. Interestingly, NKX3.1 has been reported to colocalize with topoisomerase I in nuclear speckles when LNCaP cells were cultured in the presence of the androgen analog R1881 (20Bowen C. Stuart A. Ju J.H. Tuan J. Blonder J. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that endogenous NKX3.1, topoisomerase I, and TOPORS may colocalize in the nuclear bodies. However, using a different antibody, we did not observe NKX3.1 localization in nuclear speckles without MG132 treatment under our culture conditions. TOPORS is known to be associated with PML nuclear bodies (27Rasheed Z.A. Saleem A. Ravee Y. Pandolfi P.P. Rubin E.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and nuclear proteasomal degradation foci partially overlap with PML bodies (34Rockel T.D. Stuhlmann D. von Mikecz A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5231-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); thus our data suggest that TOPORS may actively degrade a pool of NKX3.1 protein in the PML bodies. Using no-lysine-containing ubiquitin in the in vitro reaction, we estimate that TOPORS may ubiquitinate as many as 10 of the 14 lysine residues in NKX3.1 (Fig. 1D). Given that 5 lysines lie outside of the homeodomain, these data suggest that at least 5 of the lysine residues within the homeodomain could be ubiquitinated. Indeed, TOPORS can ubiquitinate the homeodomain alone (Fig. 2E). Despite considerable effort, consensus motifs for ubiquitination have not been defined (35Witze E.S. Old W.M. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Nat. Meth. 2007; 4: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). However, analyses of known ubiquitin acceptor sites in yeast demonstrated that loops and helices are preferred structures harboring ubiquitination sites (36Catic A. Collins C. Church G.M. Ploegh H.L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The homeodomain is comprised of three α helices connected by short loops. The NKX3.1 homeodomain may serve as a paradigm to dissect structural features that mediate E3 ligase-substrate interactions. Our observations raise the possibility that TOPORS may be able to ubiquitinate other homeoproteins, although their interaction in vivo could be further regulated by other means, for example by cellular localization and other protein-protein interactions. Ubiquitination of NKX3.1 in the homeodomain by TOPORS could affect the interaction of NKX3.1 with DNA or with other proteins. However, the exact sites of ubiquitination and their functional significance in vivo require further study. Determination of ubiquitination sites could be achieved by mass spectrometric analysis of ubiquitinated NKX3.1 or by site-directed mutagenesis. Given the established tumor suppressor function of NKX3.1, the negative regulation of NKX3.1 by TOPORS suggests that TOPORS may be proto-oncogenic in prostate cancer. However, TOPORS maps to chromosome 9p21 and is located between microsatellite markers D9S270 and D9S273, which show loss of heterozygosity in 21.8 and 13.8% of prostate cancer samples examined, respectively (37Perinchery G. Bukurov N. Nakajima K. Chang J. Li L.C. Dahiya R. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, TOPORS protein has been shown to be diminished in colon cancer, where it may have tumor suppressor function (24Saleem A. Dutta J. Malegaonkar D. Rasheed F. Rasheed Z. Rajendra R. Marshall H. Luo M. Li H. Rubin E.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5293-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TOPORS has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor in human gliomas and non-small cell lung cancers (38Bredel M. Bredel C. Juric D. Harsh G.R. Vogel H. Recht L.D. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4088-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Oyanagi H. Takenaka K. Ishikawa S. Kawano Y. Adachi Y. Ueda K. Wada H. Tanaka F. Lung Cancer. 2004; 46: 21-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, anti-TOPORS antibodies capable of detecting expression in situ have not been described. To obtain more insight regarding TOPORS expression in human cancers, we queried a publicly available cDNA microarray data base, Oncomine (40Rhodes D.R. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Mahavisno V. Varambally R. Yu J. Briggs B.B. Barrette T.R. Anstet M.J. Kincead-Beal C. Kulkarni P. Varambally S. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. Neoplasia (N.Y.). 2007; 9: 166-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Queries in Oncomine showed that TOPORS mRNA is down-regulated in seminomas and ovarian cancer; however, TOPORS mRNA is overexpressed in bladder, myeloma, endometrial, prostate, and salivary gland tumors, as well as in carcinoid and small cell lung cancers at a 0.01 p value threshold. It is possible that TOPORS may be both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive, depending on the cellular context. It is also possible that the effects of TOPORS on a particular substrate may vary depending on the level of TOPORS, in a manner analogous to the MDM2-p53 relationship (41Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Although robust TOPORS expression leads to loss of NKX3.1, lower levels could have a different functional outcome. In addition, TOPORS also has SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) E3 ligase activity (42Weger S. Hammer E. Heilbronn R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Pungaliya P. Kulkarni D. Park H.J. Marshall H. Zheng H. Lackland H. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3918-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and sumoylation is known to regulate transcription factor activity and localization (44Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 45Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In summary, we established the biochemical interaction between the prostate tumor suppressor NKX3.1 and the ubiquitin E3 ligase TOPORS. We also demonstrated a negative regulatory role of TOPORS on NKX3.1 in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells. Increasing evidence points to NKX3.1 as a haploinsufficient cell growth/differentiation regulator. cDNA profiling from tissues of Nkx3.1 heterozygous and homozygous knock-out mice indicates that NKX3.1 regulates a class of genes in a dosage-sensitive manner (46Magee J.A. Abdulkadir S.A. Milbrandt J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NKX3.1 in prostate tumor cells decreases proliferation (47Kim M.J. Bhatia-Gaur R. Banach-Petrosky W.A. Desai N. Wang Y. Hayward S.W. Cunha G.R. Cardiff R.D. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2999-3004PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently, the restoration of NKX3.1 by retroviral transduction in Pten-/- prostate epithelium was shown to lead to decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death and to block Pten loss-induced tumor initiation in vivo (48Lei Q. Jiao J. Xin L. Chang C.J. Wang S. Gao J. Gleave M.E. Witte O.N. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, it appears that restoring NKX3.1 protein levels, perhaps even partially, may be a viable therapeutic strategy. A clear understanding of the cellular mechanisms, including degradation pathways, that modulate NKX3.1 could facilitate the design of these approaches. The recognition of TOPORS as a mediator of NKX3.1 degradation is an important first step in this direction."
https://openalex.org/W2005374621,"Recent experimental advances have allowed the estimation of the in vivo rates of killing of infected target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We present several refinements to a method applied previously to quantify killing of targets in the spleen using a dynamical model. We reanalyse data previously used to estimate killing rates of CTL specific for two epitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice and show that, contrary to previous estimates the ""killing rate"" of effector CTL is approximately twice that of memory CTL. Further, our method allows the fits to be visualized, and reveals one potentially interesting discrepancy between fits and data. We discuss extensions to the basic CTL killing model to explain this discrepancy and propose experimental tests to distinguish between them."
https://openalex.org/W1966941149,"Background In single-cell human genome analysis using whole-genome amplified product, a strong amplification bias involving allele dropout and preferential amplification hampers the quality of results. Using an oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we systematically examined the nature of this amplification bias, including frequency, degree, and preference for genomic location, and we assessed the effects of this amplification bias on subsequent genotype and chromosomal copy number analyses. Methodology/Principal Findings We found a large variability in amplification bias among the amplified products obtained by multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and this bias had a severe effect on the genotype and chromosomal copy number analyses. We established optimal experimental conditions for pre-screening for high-quality amplified products, processing array data, and analyzing chromosomal structural alterations. Using this optimized protocol, we successfully detected previously unidentified chromosomal structural alterations in single cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line. These alterations were subsequently confirmed by karyotype analysis. In addition, we successfully obtained reproducible chromosomal copy number profiles of single cells from the cell line with a complex karyotype, indicating the applicability and potential of our optimized workflow. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the quality of amplification products should be critically assessed before using them for genomic analyses. The method of MDA-based whole-genome amplification followed by SNP array analysis described here will be useful for exploring chromosomal alterations in single cells."

We carried out a randomized trial to compare two drug regimens for clearance of parasitaemia in order to identify the optimum regimen for use in mass drug administration in the dry season.A two-arm open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted during the dry season in an area of distinct seasonal malaria in two villages in Gedarif State in eastern Sudan. Participants were asymptomatic adults and children aged over 6 months, with low-density P. falciparum infection detected by PCR. Participants were randomized to receive artesunate/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) combination for three days with or without a dose of primaquine (PQ) on the fourth day. Parasitaemia detected by PCR on days 3, 7 and 14 after the start of treatment and gametocytes detected by RT-PCR on days 7 and 14 were then recorded. 104 individuals who had low density parasitaemia at screening were randomized and treated during the dry season. On day 7, 8.3% were positive by PCR in the AS+SP+PQ group and 6.5% in the AS+SP group (risk difference 1.8%, 95%CI -10.3% to +13.8%). At enrolment, 12% (12/100) were carrying gametocytes. This was reduced to 6.4% and 4.4% by day 14 (Risk difference 1.9% (95%CI -9.3% to +13.2%) in AS+SP+PQ and AS+SP groups, respectively.Addition of primaquine to artemisinin combination treatment did not improve elimination of parasitaemia and prevention of gametocyte carriage in carriers with low-density parasitaemia in the dry season.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00330902."
https://openalex.org/W2104671322,"Mouse-human chimeric antibodies composed of murine variable (V) and human (C) chains are useful therapeutic reagents. Consequently, we investigated whether heterologous C-regions from mice and humans affected specificity and affinity, and determined the contribution of CH glycosylation to antigen binding. The interaction of a 12-mer peptide mimetic with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18B7 to Cryptococcus neoformans glucuronoxylomannan, and its chimeric (ch) and deglycosylated forms were studied by surface plasmon resonance. The equilibrium and rate association constants for the chAb were higher than for mAb 18B7. V region affinity was not affected by CH region glycosylation whereas heterologous C region of the same isotype altered the Ab binding affinity and the specificity for self-antigens. Structural models displayed local differences that implied changes on the connectivity of residues. These findings suggest that V region conformational changes can be dictated by the CH domains through an allosteric effect involving networks of highly connected amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2073956892,"During protein N-glycosylation, dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) is discharged in the lumenal monolayer of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dol-P-P is then cleaved to Dol-P by Dol-P-P phosphatase (DPPase). Studies with the yeast mutant cwh8Delta, lacking DPPase activity, indicate that recycling of Dol-P produced by DPPase contributes significantly to the pool of Dol-P utilized for lipid intermediate biosynthesis on the cytoplasmic leaflet. Whether Dol-P formed in the lumen diffuses directly back to the cytoplasmic leaflet or is first dephosphorylated to dolichol has not been determined. Incubation of sealed ER vesicles from calf brain with acetyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH(2), an N-glycosylatable peptide, to generate Dol-P-P in the lumenal monolayer produced corresponding increases in the rates of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and GlcNAc-P-P-Dol synthesis in the absence of CTP. No changes in dolichol kinase activity were observed. When streptolysin-O permeabilized CHO cells were incubated with an acceptor peptide, N-glycopeptide synthesis, requiring multiple cycles of the dolichol pathway, occurred in the absence of CTP. The results obtained with sealed microsomes and CHO cells indicate that Dol-P, formed from Dol-P-P, returns to the cytoplasmic leaflet where it can be reutilized for lipid intermediate biosynthesis, and dolichol kinase is not required for recycling. It is possible that the flip-flopping of the carrier lipid is mediated by a flippase, which would provide a mechanism for the recycling of Dol-P derived from Man-P-Dol-mediated reactions in N-, O-, and C-mannosylation of proteins, GPI anchor assembly, and the three Glc-P-Dol-mediated reactions in Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-P-P-Dol (DLO) biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2077839252,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases often result in accumulation of disease-associated PrP (PrP(d)) in the lymphoreticular system (LRS), specifically in association with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and tingible body macrophages (TBMs) of secondary follicles. We studied the effects of sheep scrapie on lymphoid tissue in tonsils and lymph nodes by light and electron microscopy. FDCs of sheep were grouped according to morphology as immature, mature or regressing. Scrapie was associated with FDC dendrite hypertrophy and electron dense deposit or vesicles. PrP(d) was located using immunogold labelling at the plasmalemma of FDC dendrites and, infrequently, mature B cells. Abnormal electron dense deposits surrounding FDC dendrites were identified as immunoglobulins suggesting that excess immune complexes are retained and are indicative of an FDC dysfunction. Within scrapie-affected lymph nodes, macrophages outside the follicle and a proportion of germinal centre TBMs accumulated PrP(d) within endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, TBMs showed PrP(d) in association with the cell membrane, non-coated pits and vesicles, and also with discrete, large and random endoplasmic reticulum networks, which co-localised with ubiquitin. These observations suggest that PrP(d) is internalised via the caveolin-mediated pathway, and causes an abnormal disease-related alteration in endoplasmic reticulum structure. In contrast to current dogma, this study shows that sheep scrapie is associated with cytopathology of germinal centres, which we attribute to abnormal antigen complex trapping by FDCs and abnormal endocytic events in TBMs. The nature of the sub-cellular changes in FDCs and TBMs differs from those of scrapie infected neurones and glial cells suggesting that different PrP(d)/cell membrane interactions occur in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2086652045,"IL-24, also known as melanoma differentiation antigen 7 (mda-7), is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines and is mainly produced by Th(2) cells as well as by activated monocytes. Binding of IL-24 to either of its two possible heterodimeric receptors IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R/IL-20R2 activates STAT3 and/or STAT1 in target tissues such as lung, testis, ovary, keratinocytes and skin. To date, the physiological properties of IL-24 are still not well understood but available data suggest that IL-24 affects epidermal functions by increasing proliferation of dermal cells. In stark contrast to its ""normal"" and physiological behaviour, IL-24 has been reported to selectively and efficiently kill a vast variety of cancer cells, especially melanoma cells, independent of receptor expression and Jak-STAT signalling. These intriguing properties have led to the development of adenovirally-expressed IL-24, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Using three different methods, we have analysed a large panel of melanoma cell lines with respect to IL-24 and IL-24 receptor expression and found that none of the investigated cell lines expressed sufficient amounts of functional receptor pairs and therefore did not react to IL-24 stimulation with Jak/STAT activation. Results for three cell lines contrasted with previous studies, which reported presence of IL-24 receptors and activation of STAT3 following IL-24 stimulation. Furthermore, evaluating four different sources and modes of IL-24 administration (commercial recombinant IL-24, bacterially expressed GST-IL-24 fusion protein, IL-24 produced from transfected Hek cells, transiently over-expressed IL-24) no induction or increase in cell death was detected when compared to appropriate control treatments. Thus, we conclude that the cytokine IL-24 itself has no cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing properties in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132585826,"Background Interspecific hybrid crosses often produce offspring with reduced but non-zero survivorship. In this paper we ask why such partial inviability occurs. This partial inviability could arise from incomplete penetrance of lethal Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) shared by all members of a hybrid cross. Alternatively, siblings may differ with respect to the presence or number of DMIs, leading to genotype-dependent variation in viability and hence non-Mendelian segregation of parental alleles in surviving F1 hybrids. Methodology/Principal Findings We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) to test for segregation distortion in one hybrid cross between green and longear sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus and L. megalotis). Hybrids showed partial viability, and twice as much segregation distortion (36.8%) of AFLPs as an intraspecific control cross (18.8%). Incomplete penetrance of DMIs, which should cause genotype-independent mortality, is insufficient to explain the observed segregation distortion. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that F1 hybrid sunfish are polymorphic for DMIs, either due to sex-linked DMI loci (causing Haldane's Rule), or polymorphic autosomal DMI loci. Because few AFLP markers were sex-linked (2%), the most parsimonious conclusion is that parents may have been heterozygous for loci causing hybrid inviability."
https://openalex.org/W2016459834,"The inheritance pattern of a number of major genetic disorders suggests the possible involvement of genes that are expressed from one allele and silent on the other, but such genes are difficult to detect. Since DNA methylation in regulatory regions is often a mark of gene silencing, we modified existing microarray-based assays to detect both methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences in the same sample, a variation we term the MAUD assay. We probed a 65 Mb region of mouse Chr 7 for gene-associated sequences that show two distinct DNA methylation patterns in the mouse CNS. Selected genes were then tested for allele-specific expression in clonal neural stem cell lines derived from reciprocal F(1) (C57BL/6xJF1) hybrid mice. In addition, using a separate approach, we directly analyzed allele-specific expression of a group of genes interspersed within clusters of OlfR genes, since the latter are subject to allelic exclusion. Altogether, of the 500 known genes in the chromosomal region surveyed, five show monoallelic expression, four identified by the MAUD assay (Agc1, p (pink-eyed dilution), P4ha3 and Thrsp), and one by its proximity to OlfR genes (Trim12). Thrsp (thyroid hormone responsive SPOT14 homolog) is expressed in hippocampus, but the human protein homolog, S14, has also been implicated in aggressive breast cancer. Monoallelic expression of the five genes is not coordinated at a chromosome-wide level, but rather regulated at individual loci. Taken together, our results suggest that at least 1% of previously untested genes are subject to allelic exclusion, and demonstrate a dual approach to expedite their identification."
https://openalex.org/W2105837919,"Background Violence is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa and needs to be researched from a public health perspective. Typically in violence research, socioeconomic position is used in the analysis to control for confounding. Social epidemiology approaches this variable as a primary determinant of interest and is used in this research to better understand the aetiology of violence in South Africa. We hypothesised that measures of socioeconomic position (employment, education and household wealth) would be inversely related to violence at the individual and household levels. Methodology/Principal Findings Data came from the1998 South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS). Measures of socioeconomic position used were employment, education and household wealth. Eighty-eight people (0.2%) received treatment for a violent injury in the previous 30 days and 103 households (0.9%) experienced a violent death in the previous year. Risk factors for violence at the individual level included employment (41% of those who experienced violence were employed vs. 27% of those who did not, p = 0.02), and education (those who experienced violence had on average, one year more education than those who did not, p = 0.04). Belonging to a household in the wealthiest quintile was protective against violence (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12–0.89). In contrast, at the household level all three measures of socioeconomic position were protective against the experience of a violent death. The only association to persist in the multivariate analysis was that between the wealth of the household and violence at the individual level. Conclusions/Significance Our hypothesis was supported if household wealth was used as the measure of socioeconomic position at the individual level. While more research is needed to inform the conflicting results observed between the individual and household levels, this analysis has begun to identify the disparities across the socioeconomic structure with respect to violent outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2142513773,"Background Nitrosylcobalamin (NO-Cbl) is a chemotherapeutic pro-drug derived from vitamin B12 that preferentially delivers nitric oxide (NO) to tumor cells, based upon increased receptor expression. NO-Cbl induces Apo2L/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and inhibits survival signaling in a variety of malignant cell lines. Chemotherapeutic agents often simultaneously induce an apoptotic signal and activation of NF-κB, which has the undesired effect of promoting cell survival. The specific aims of this study were to 1) measure the anti-tumor effects of NO-Cbl alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, and to 2) examine the mechanism of action of NO-Cbl as a single agent and in combination therapy. Methodology Using anti-proliferative assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), immunoblot analysis and kinase assays, we demonstrate an increase in the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with NO-Cbl as a result of suppressed NF-κB activation. Results Eighteen chemotherapeutic agents were tested in combination with NO-Cbl, in thirteen malignant cell lines, resulting in a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in 78% of the combinations tested. NO-Cbl pre-treatment resulted in decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity, inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK) enzymatic activity, decreased AKT activation, increased caspase-8 and PARP cleavage, and decreased cellular XIAP protein levels. Conclusion The use of NO-Cbl to inhibit survival signaling may enhance drug efficacy by preventing concomitant activation of NF-κB or AKT."

We provide recommendations for the analysis and reporting of microarray data from knockout mice.
https://openalex.org/W1996467836,"Background Aside from the ecological impacts, invasive species fascinate ecologists because of the unique opportunities that invasives offer in the study of community ecology. Some hypotheses have been proposed to illustrate the mechanisms that allow exotics to become invasive. However, positive interactions between exotic and native insects are rarely utilized to explain invasiveness of pests. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we present information on a recently formed association between a native and an exotic bark beetle on their shared host, Pinus tabuliformis, in China. In field examinations, we found that 35–40% of P. tabuliformis attacked by an exotic bark beetle, Dendroctonus valens, were also attacked by a native pine bark beetle, Hylastes parallelus. In the laboratory, we found that the antennal and walking responses of H. parallelus to host- and beetle-produced compounds were similar to those of the exotic D. valens in China. In addition, D. valens was attracted to volatiles produced by the native H. parallelus. Conclusions/Significance We report, for the first time, facilitation between an exotic and a native bark beetle seems to involve overlap in the use of host attractants and pheromones, which is cross-attraction. The concept of this interspecific facilitation could be explored as a novel invasive mechanism which helps explain invasiveness of not only exotic bark beetles but also other introduced pests in principle. The results reported here also have particularly important implications for risk assessments and management strategies for invasive species."
