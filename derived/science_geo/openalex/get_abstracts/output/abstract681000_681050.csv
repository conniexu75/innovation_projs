Toward understanding the underlying molecular alterations that drive PDAC oncogenesis, we conducted comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of 140 pancreatic cancers, 67 normal adjacent tissues, and 9 normal pancreatic ductal tissues. Proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and glycoproteomic analyses were used to characterize proteins and their modifications. In addition, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, methylation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) were performed on the same tissues to facilitate an integrated proteogenomic analysis and determine the impact of genomic alterations on protein expression, signaling pathways, and post-translational modifications. To ensure robust downstream analyses, tumor neoplastic cellularity was assessed via multiple orthogonal strategies using molecular features and verified via pathological estimation of tumor cellularity based on histological review. This integrated proteogenomic characterization of PDAC will serve as a valuable resource for the community, paving the way for early detection and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

With a 5-year survival rate below 10%, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest solid malignancies and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer death by 2030 (Quante et al., 2016Quante A.S.

Due to the lack of early symptoms and dearth of reliable and effective methods for screening and early detection, the majority of patients (80%–85%) present with locally advanced or distant metastatic disease and are unresectable (Hruban et al., 2019Hruban R.H.

Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy serves as first-line treatment of metastatic PDAC and is responsible for only a modest improvement in survival (Roth et al., 2020Roth M.T. Cardin D.B. Berlin J.D. Recent advances in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.F1000Res. 2020; 9: 131Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The median overall survival achieved in patients with metastatic disease is still less than 12 months (Conroy et al., 2011Conroy T. Desseigne F. Ychou M. Bouché O. Guimbaud R. Bécouarn Y. Adenis A.

Over the last decade, comprehensive characterization of well-annotated tumor specimens has led to a better understanding of the key genomic alterations in PDAC, including somatic mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4, and molecular classifications of tumors based on gene expression patterns (Thompson et al., 2020Thompson E.D. Roberts N.J. Wood L.D. Eshleman J.R. Goggins M.G. Kern S.E. Klein A.P. Hruban R.H. The genetics of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the year 2020: dramatic progress, but far to go.Mod. Pathol. 2020; 33: 2544-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies have revealed tumor-specific therapeutic targets (Balachandran et al., 2019Balachandran V.P.

Med. 2019; 381: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, targeted therapies are only available for a small number of pancreatic cancers, and resistance can emerge when single agents are given (Tao et al., 2020Tao H. Liu S. Huang D. Han X. Wu X. Shao Y.W. Hu Y. Acquired multiple secondary BRCA2 mutations upon PARPi resistance in a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient harboring a BRCA2 germline mutation.Am. J. Transl. Res. 2020; 12: 612-617PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic KRAS activating point mutations are the predominant genetic alteration in PDAC. However, KRAS is considered an undruggable target, except for a specific mutant form, G12C (Janes et al., 2018Janes M.R. Zhang J. Li L.S. Hansen R. Peters U. Guo X. Chen Y. Babbar A. Firdaus S.J. Darjania L. et al.Targeting KRAS Mutant Cancers with a Covalent G12C-Specific Inhibitor.Cell. 2018; 172: 578-589.e17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition to downstream intracellular changes, it has been increasingly appreciated that KRAS mutations also have a broad impact on the tumor microenvironment, contributing to promotion and maintenance of cancer malignancy, responses to immunotherapy, and drug delivery. Since most pancreatic cancers are notoriously immunologically “cold,” molecular classifiers are needed to identify the small fraction of patients with relative “hot” cancers that may benefit from immunotherapy and reveal mechanisms driving immune exclusion in the majority of PDACs (Ho et al., 2020Ho W.J. Jaffee E.M. Zheng L. The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - clinical challenges and opportunities.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 17: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although genomic and transcriptomic features are needed to identify critical signaling pathways active in PDAC that can be targeted and have started to unravel the importance of stroma and the immune environment, they alone are insufficient to fully elucidate this cancer and support advancements in precision oncology. A proteogenomic approach that integrates proteomics and post-translational modification (PTM) analysis provides a more comprehensive view of pancreatic cancer biology and supports discovery of targets for early detection and treatment. Here, we performed a comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of treatment-naive PDACs, paired normal adjacent tissues (NATs), and macrodissected normal pancreatic duct tissues. We addressed the characteristic low neoplastic cellularity of pancreatic cancer by focusing on tumors with sufficient neoplastic cellularity as defined by several cross-validated methods, and we explored the proteogenomic features specific to neoplastic ductal epithelial cells by applying molecular and histological deconvolution. The use of tissue isolated from normal pancreatic ducts allowed us to overcome the high acinar cell content of normal pancreatic parenchyma and compare directly neoplastic ductal epithelium with non-neoplastic ductal epithelium, confirming clinically relevant protein markers identified using PDACs and NATs. Moreover, integrated proteogenomic characterization revealed the phenotypic effects of genomic and epigenetic perturbations on proteins and protein modifications, and delineated PDAC molecular subtypes and cell microenvironment compositions. This dataset constitutes a rich resource for future studies focused on early detection and tumor-classification-based patient stratification to guide treatment selection. For proteogenomic characterization of PDAC, 140 treatment-naive pancreatic tumors (135 PDACs and 5 pancreatic adenosquamous carcinomas), 67 paired NATs, and 9 normal pancreatic duct tissues were collected and homogenized via cryopulverization for genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Clinical data are summarized in Table S1. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq), DNA methylation, isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeling-based proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and glycoproteomics produced eight sets of omics data (Figure 1A). Proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and glycoproteomics analyses identified and quantified a total of 11,662 proteins, 51,469 phosphosites, and 34,024 glycopeptides (Table S1). We found high measurement reproducibility of the quality-control samples across the TMT plexes and no observable TMT-plex effect (Figure S1A). In this study, the median correlation between RNA and protein is 0.35 (Figure S1B), indicating a discrepancy between RNA and protein abundance, which was also observed in other cancer types (Vasaikar et al., 2019Vasaikar S.

When gene-wise correlation was performed separately for tumors and NATs (Figure S1B), a decreased median correlation within the NAT-only group relative to the tumor-only group was observed, which was noted in other tumor types (Clark et al., 2019Clark D.J.

A unique feature of this study is that samples were collected prospectively from multiple source sites worldwide, controlling for ischemia time to ensure high-quality PTM analysis of proteins (Figure 1B). Our patient cohort reflected demographics of previous large-scale reports, with 75% of the resected tumors derived from the head of the pancreas (Becker et al., 2014Becker A.E. Hernandez Y.G.

As these were surgically resected cancers, the vast majority of patients were stage I–III, with only nine stage IV patients, and 42% of patients were alive at the time of the data freeze for the analysis reported in this study (Figure 1B). To address the characteristic low neoplastic cellularity of pancreatic cancer, we identified 105 samples with sufficient neoplastic purity based on several criteria: KRAS variant allele fraction (VAF) ≥ 0.075 (equivalent to 15% neoplastic cellularity) or significant mutation burden and copy-number variations (CNVs) (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition, we used histology-based as well as DNA-methylation- and RNA-based molecular deconvolution methods (Onuchic et al., 2016Onuchic V. Hartmaier R.J. Boone D.N. Samuels M.L. Patel R.Y. White W.M. Garovic V.D. Oesterreich S. Roth M.E. Lee A.V. Milosavljevic A.

These estimates of neoplastic cellularity significantly correlated with KRAS VAF estimates (Figure S1C). In particular, KRAS VAF was highly correlated with DNA-methylation-based deconvolution (Spearman r = 0.81). We herein denote the remaining 35 tumors as “low purity” but emphasize that they do indeed contain neoplastic cells, as evidenced by presence of other significantly mutated gene (SMG) alterations, low KRAS VAF, and pathology review (Figure 1C). Principal-component analysis (PCA) at RNA, protein, phosphorylation, and glycosylation levels showed that high-purity tumors and NAT samples were separated but low-purity samples were spatially localized between the high-purity tumors and NAT samples, supporting our purity classification (Figure S1D). Low-purity samples were retained for selected analyses aimed at dissecting the tumor microenvironment and for tumor subtyping. We included nine normal macrodissected ductal tissues to serve as a true ductal/epithelial normal, in addition to NATs. Among 105 tissue samples with sufficient tumor cellularity, somatic genomic alterations were detected in known pancreatic cancer driver genes KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 at rates of 97%, 83%, 48%, and 29%, respectively (Figure 2A). These rates are comparable to previous reports, with somewhat higher percentages of CDKN2A and SMAD4 alterations due to the inclusion of CNVs and fusions (Thompson et al., 2020Thompson E.D. Roberts N.J. Wood L.D. Eshleman J.R. Goggins M.G. Kern S.E. Klein A.P. Hruban R.H. The genetics of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the year 2020: dramatic progress, but far to go.Mod. Pathol. 2020; 33: 2544-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We found assessment and integration of CNVs to be critical, as evidenced by the presence of more CDKN2A focal deletions than intragenic mutations in our cohort (Caldas et al., 1994Caldas C. Hahn S.A. da Costa L.T. Redston M.S. Schutte M. Seymour A.B. Weinstein C.L. Hruban R.H. Yeo C.J. Kern S.E. Frequent somatic mutations and homozygous deletions of the p16 (MTS1) gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Aside from these four major SMGs, we also detected ARID1A, RNF43, GNAS, KMT2C, KMT2D, TGFBR2, and RBM10 alterations in at least 5% of the tumors (Figure 2A). We comprehensively characterized the impact of genetic alterations on RNA, protein, and phosphosite levels of the corresponding gene product (cis) or other interacting genes (trans) (Figures 2B and 2C) (STAR Methods). TP53 alterations had the most trans-effects at protein and phosphosite levels, with different targets identified at the RNA/protein levels and phosphosite levels, likely due to extensive post-translational regulation. Interestingly, mutations in TP53 were associated with an increase in phosphorylation of proteins involved in DNA damage repair pathways (e.g., MSH6, TP53, and TP53BP1), which suggests that these alterations play a role in maintaining genome integrity and preventing apoptosis (Figure 2C). In TP53 mutant tumors, we also observed higher phosphorylation of MKI67, a marker for cellular proliferation, which implies that these mutations may lead to increased cell growth rates (Herr et al., 2020Herr P. Boström J. Rullman E. Rudd S.G. Vesterlund M. Lehtiö J. Helleday T. Maddalo G. Altun M. Cell Cycle Profiling Reveals Protein Oscillation, Phosphorylation, and Localization Dynamics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2020; 19: 608-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We further explored the effects of TP53 missense mutations compared to truncating mutations and observed a significantly greater cis-effect with higher TP53 protein expression and TP53-S315 phosphosite expression in the TP53 missense group compared to the wild-type group (Figure S2A), while there were no significant TP53 protein changes in cis-effects between the truncation and wild-type groups (Figure S2A). Interestingly, we observed similar trans-effects by both missense and truncation groups, which were associated with higher phosphorylation levels of the proteins in DNA damage repair pathways (Figure S2A). SMAD4 mutations were associated with downregulation of SERPINE1, a known transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway target (Dennler et al., 1998Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Direct binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to critical TGF beta-inducible elements in the promoter of human plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 gene.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), at both the RNA and protein levels, as well as the upregulation of MAPK3 protein expression and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (E2F4 phosphorylation). These associations have been reported in vitro (Chen et al., 2002Chen C.R. Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Massagué J. E2F4/5 and p107 as Smad cofactors linking the TGFbeta receptor to c-myc repression.Cell. 2002; 110: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and in other cancer types (Gomis et al., 2006Gomis R.R. Alarcón C. Nadal C. Van Poznak C. Massagué J. C/EBPbeta at the core of the TGFbeta cytostatic response and its evasion in metastatic breast cancer cells.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). We also identified several arm-level and focal-level CNVs, including amplifications in 9p, 11q, 18q, and 22q arms; GATA6 focal amplifications; and CDKN2A deletions (Figures 2D and 2E) that led to significant expression changes in genes, proteins, and phosphoproteins (Figure S2B). Since we observed a much larger number of amplifications, we focused on identifying putative new CNV drivers within the amplified foci (Figures 2E and 2F). Of 543 genes within amplification peaks, 165 showed significant correlation of copy number with corresponding RNA levels, including 23 that displayed concordant protein expression (Figure 2F). Proteins identified by this approach are representative of potentially novel cis-effects of CNV events and associated with actin filament process and cytoskeleton organization (Figures 2F and 2G), with reorganization of actin fibers having been previously implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Manoli et al., 2019Manoli S. Coppola S. Duranti C. Lulli M. Magni L. Kuppalu N. Nielsen N. Schmidt T. Schwab A. Becchetti A. Arcangeli A.

Veltman D. Machesky L.M. Actin-bundling proteins in cancer progression at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, most of the proteins regulated in trans by CNVs were located within chromosomes 7, 9, 17, and 18, while trans-effects of CNVs at the phospho level were sporadic (Figure S2C; Table S2). In particular, the CNV loss of SMAD4 and CDKN2A was associated with lower SMAD4 and CDNK2A mRNA levels in samples with SMAD4 deletion and CNDK2A deletion, respectively (Figure 2H). Regarding trans-effects of these deletions, higher phosphorylation of HDAC1 at S406, S410, and S421 and of SMARCA4 at S613 were associated with SMAD4 deletions, while CDKN2A deletions were associated with higher phosphorylation of NPM1 at S70 and S214 (Figure 2I). To identify proteins possibly regulated by DNA methylation in tumors, we correlated RNA, protein, and phosphoprotein levels with promoter DNA methylation (Figure S2D). Among others, GSTM1 methylation resulted in downregulation of the corresponding RNA and protein, in agreement with reports that implicate GSTM1 in multiple cancers (Wang et al., 2016Wang S.C. Huang C.C. Shen C.H. Lin L.C. Zhao P.W. Chen S.Y. Deng Y.C. Liu Y.W.

GSTT1, GSTP1, and GSTM1 genetic variants are associated with survival in previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 105905-105914Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The extent of promoter DNA methylation was lower in NATs than in tumors (Figures S2E and S2F). We identified 86 epigenetically silenced genes, of which 22 were previously reported by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Table S2). Two genes (ZNF544 and THNSL2) that were epigenetically silenced in more than 10% of tumors were significantly associated with patient survival (Figures S2G–S2I). Two clusters (cluster M1 and M2) were identified by methylation-based subtyping, with cluster M2 harboring more extensive DNA hypermethylation (Table S2). We also observed a positive association between tumor cellularity and methylation status in these tumors (Table S2), in line with the TCGA study (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.

Approximately 80% of PDAC tumors are unresectable, as patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (Hruban et al., 2019Hruban R.H. Gaida M.M. Thompson E. Hong S.M. Noë M. Brosens L.A. Jongepier M. Offerhaus G.J.A. Wood L.D. Why is pancreatic cancer so deadly? The pathologist’s view.J. Pathol. 2019; 248: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, a panel of highly robust biomarkers for early detection may improve survival as treatment modalities for these patients emerge. Proteins, phosphorylation sites, and glycosylation sites that are dysregulated in tumors relative to NATs represent putative candidates for early detection/prognosis. Relative to NATs, 2,218 and 2,244 proteins were significantly down- and upregulated, respectively, in PDACs (Figure 3A; Table S3). As expected, proteins with high abundance in NATs were related to normal pancreatic functions, while many of those upregulated in tumors were enriched for proteins involved in epidermal and endodermal development. To identify proteins associated with PDACs, we focused on 222 proteins with >2-fold increase in abundance in tumors relative to NATs (Figure 3A). Twenty-seven proteins remained significantly upregulated by >2-fold in PDACs after adjusting for stromal and immune content. We additionally found that the differential expression between PDACs and NATs was similar to that between PDACs and normal ducts (Figure S3A), and 21 of 27 proteins were also upregulated >2-fold in PDACs compared to normal ducts (Figures 3B and S3B; Table S3). Importantly, these proteins were similarly upregulated in early-stage tumors (Figure 3B). In particular, 12 of these are secreted proteins and could serve as early detection markers in serum or pancreatic juice (González-Borja et al., 2019González-Borja I. Viúdez A. Goñi S. Santamaria E. Carrasco-García E. Pérez-Sanz J. Hernández-García I. Sala-Elarre P. Arrazubi V.

Eleven proteins are reported as elevated in the Pancreatic Cancer Database, with six proteins (HK2, LOXL2, COL12A1, C19orf33, TSPAN1, and MDK) previously supported only by RNA or cell line proteomic evidence (Harsha et al., 2009Harsha H.C.

Ther. 2014; 15: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with LOXL2 protein abundance associating with shorter overall survival (Figure 3C). Fourteen out of 21 tumor-associated proteins highlighted in Figure 3B as potential protein targets for early detection or prognostic markers were validated by the orthogonal method of data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry analysis, indicating the reliability of our reported tumor-associated proteins (Table S3). Compared to NATs, 4,908 phosphorylation sites and 1,727 N-linked glycosites showed significantly increased abundance in PDACs (Table S3; adjusted p < 0.01). In general, the differential abundance of PTMs was similar to the differential abundance at the protein level, while 45 N-linked glycosites and 645 phosphosites were up"

Some highly transmissible variants, such as Delta, also raised concerns about the effectiveness provided by current vaccines. Understanding immunological correlates of protection and how laboratory findings correspond to clinical effectiveness is imperative to shape future vaccination strategies. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, new variants continue to emerge. Some highly transmissible variants, such as Delta, also raised concerns about the effectiveness provided by current vaccines. Understanding immunological correlates of protection and how laboratory findings correspond to clinical effectiveness is imperative to shape future vaccination strategies. SARS-CoV-2—like all RNA viruses—is prone to introducing random errors in its genetic code during replication. Many of these mutations are corrected by proofreading mechanisms, but advantageous sequence variations are accumulating as the virus continues its global spread. As of August 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated four SARS-CoV-2 variants as “variants of concern” (VOCs): Alpha (B.1.1.7, first detected in the UK), Beta (B.1.351, first detected in South Africa), Gamma (P.1, first detected in Brazil), and Delta (B.1.617.2, first detected in India). Public health agencies around the world have their own lists, which also include “variants of interest” or “variants under investigation” that could be upgraded to a VOC if there is evidence of enhanced transmission, immune escape, or pathogenicity. Most concerningly, a “variant of high consequence” that has strong evidence of significantly reducing the effectiveness of preventative measures—a status that no SARS-CoV-2 variant has yet achieved. National regulators have given emergency use authorizations for 21 COVID-19 vaccines; 6 of those have been approved by at least one WHO-recognized authority. These include mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273), viral vector vaccines (Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222 and J&J/Janssen’s Ad26.COV2.S), recombinant spike vaccines (Novavax NVX-CoV2373), and inactivated vaccines (Sinovac [CoronaVac] and Sinopharm). While these vaccines, based on wild-type virus (sequenced in January 2020) are remarkably efficacy against early variants, their effectiveness against some new variants is being established. While vaccine efficacy (applies to specific clinical outcomes in a controlled environment) has been established in clinical trials, it is impossible to make direct comparisons between different vaccines due to different clinical endpoints, location, population studied, and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants at the time of the trial. It is also highly challenging to assess the real-time vaccine effectiveness (performance of vaccines at limiting infections or disease in the real world) against newly emerging variants, considering other pressures influencing the epidemic dynamics such as variant transmissibility, human behavior, and immunity status of the population. In addition, while early preliminary laboratory data primarily based on antibody responses could be helpful, they only provide a limited understanding of clinical effectiveness, especially considering that immunological correlates of protection are poorly understood. Furthermore, T cell responses triggered by vaccines contribute significantly to protection from viral replication and symptomatic disease, maintaining immunological memory and assisting in viral clearance. Therefore, decreased in vitro neutralizing activity does not on its own predict that vaccines will be completely ineffective. When considering vaccine effectiveness against new variants, there are at least three elements to consider: (1) whether antibodies triggered by current vaccines can recognize and neutralize these new variants, (2) whether there are cross-reactive cellular immune responses to these variants, and (3), most importantly, the real-world impact of variants on the clinical protection provided by vaccines. This commentary discusses what we know about these three elements for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and other emerging elements that factor into effectiveness with the aim of informing vaccination strategies in an evolving pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 contains four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S proteins are responsible for recognizing the host cellular receptor to initiate virus entry and are the primary target for most COVID-19 vaccines (exceptions being for inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines that use the whole virus). Compared to the evolution of resistance to therapeutic agents like antimicrobials or antivirals, the emergence of immune escape variants in direct response to vaccines is different and expected to occur more slowly. This is because vaccines prevent infection, while (most) drugs are used to treat established infections. In addition, even some vaccines that only encode S proteins still produce a range of antibody and T cell responses recognizing different parts of the protein, making it less likely that single mutational changes will substantially reduce protection. This means that the opportunity for variants to emerge under within-host selection from vaccines is many orders of magnitude smaller than drugs. Nevertheless, the accumulation of mutations in the S protein that evolve through a variety of mechanisms, including for enhanced transmission, could influence vaccine effectiveness. It has been shown that some amino acid substitutions in the S receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain result in a more significant reduction of virus neutralizing capacity in laboratory assays. E484K is one such mutation, which has emerged repeatedly across many different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including Beta, Gamma, and Iota (B.1.526; variant of interest in the US). The most significant decline in neutralization was measured against Beta, much less so against Gamma and Iota. On the other hand, most sequenced Alpha variants do not have the E484K mutation, which is one potential reason it is more susceptible to the current COVID-19 vaccines. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (AZD1222; viral vector) and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2; mRNA) show only a slight decrease in in vitro antibody neutralization against Alpha. Delta, which also does not have the E484K or a related E484Q mutation, has a modest ability to avoid neutralizing activity induced by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines and is neutralized by inactivated vaccines (Tregoning et al., 2021Tregoning J.S. Flight K.E. Higham S.L. Wang Z. Pierce B.F. Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; (Published online August 9, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00592-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). While some studies showed a significant reduction in peak neutralizing antibodies induced by the Pfizer-BioNTech against Delta that is similar to that seen with Beta, others only showed a marginal decline. According to a comprehensive analysis, variants with E484K and N501Y mutations, like Beta and Gamma, had the most significant reduction in neutralization capacity (Lucas et al., 2021Lucas C. Vogels C.B.F. Yildirim I. Rothman J.E. Lu P. Monteiro V. Gelhausen J.R. Campbell M. Silva J. Tabachikova A. et al.Impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants on mRNA vaccine-induced immunity in uninfected and previously infected individuals.medRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.14.21260307Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Despite a decline in in vitro neutralization response, all vaccinated individuals retained neutralization capability against the Beta variant. This is likely due to vaccination stimulating cross-variant neutralizing antibodies and cellular response. For instance, mRNA vaccines enhance neutralizing activity against Gamma and Beta (Stamatatos et al., 2021Stamatatos L. Czartoski J. Wan Y.-H. Homad L.J. Rubin V. Glantz H. Neradilek M. Seydoux E. Jennewein M.F. MacCamy A.J. et al.mRNA vaccination boosts cross-variant neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection.Science. 2021; (Published online March 25, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). While no sufficient neutralizing antibodies against Beta were detected after the first dose, immunization with the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines achieve sufficient immunity that controls replication (Corbett et al., 2021Corbett K.S. Werner A. O’Connell S. Gagne M. Lai L. Moliva J. Flynn B. Choi A. Koch M. Foulds K.E. et al.Evaluation of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 Infection in Nonhuman Primates.bioRxiv. 2021; (2021.05.21.445189)Google Scholar). In comparison, neutralizing antibody response to Gamma is much better than Beta after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021Dejnirattisai W. Zhou D. Supasa P. Liu C. Mentzer A.J. Ginn H.M. Zhao Y. Duyvesteyn H.M.E. Tuekprakhon A. Nutalai R. et al.Antibody evasion by the P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2.Cell. 2021; 184: 2939-2954.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies induced by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines generate durable neutralizing antibody response against Beta as well as Gamma, Iota, and Epsilon (B.1.429, which does not have E484K), at least 8 and 6 months later, respectively. The emerging evidence supports the importance of neutralizing antibodies for preventing infection, demonstrating an association between neutralizing antibody levels and breakthrough infections (Khoury et al., 2021Khoury D.S. Cromer D. Reynaldi A. Schlub T.E. Wheatley A.K. Juno J.A. Subbarao K. Kent S.J. Triccas J.A. Davenport M.P. Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Nat. Med. 2021; 27: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). However, neutralizing antibodies are likely not the only mechanism of protection, and T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies are likely also playing a significant role especially in regard to protection against symptomatic infection and severe disease. For instance, T cells appear to be the major contributors to controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection (Tan et al., 2021Tan A.T. Linster M. Tan C.W. Le Bert N. Chia W.N. Kunasegaran K. Zhuang Y. Tham C.Y.L. Chia A.

Vaccines can also elicit cross-protective B and T cell responses, which has been found for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines (Reynolds et al., 2021Reynolds C.J. Pade C. Gibbons J.M. Butler D.K. Otter A.D. Menacho K. Fontana M. Smit A. Sackville-West J.E. Cutino-Moguel T. et al.Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rescues B and T cell responses to variants after first vaccine dose.Science. 2021; (Published online April 30, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abh1282Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar; Stamatatos et al., 2021Stamatatos L. Czartoski J. Wan Y.-H. Homad L.J. Rubin V. Glantz H. Neradilek M. Seydoux E. Jennewein M.F. MacCamy A.J. et al.mRNA vaccination boosts cross-variant neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection.Science. 2021; (Published online March 25, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Importantly, B and T cells can recognize different SARS-CoV-2 variants and are minimally affected by S mutations (Tarke et al., 2021Tarke A. Sidney J. Methot N. Yu E.D. Zhang Y. Dan J.M. Goodwin B. Rubiro P. Sutherland A. Wang E. et al.Impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the total CD4 + and CD8 + T cell reactivity in infected or vaccinated individuals.Cell Rep Med. 2021; 2100355https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, current evidence suggests that Alpha and Beta do not escape T cell responses induced by vaccines (Geers et al., 2021Geers D. Shamier M.C. Bogers S. den Hartog G. Gommers L. Nieuwkoop N.N. Schmitz K.S. Rijsbergen L.C. van Osch J.A.T.

Immunol. 2021; 6: eabj1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite reduced antibody titers against some of these variants, vaccine-induced immunity will likely be conserved against currently circulating variants, supported by clinical data (Table 1).Table 1Vaccine effectiveness in % (95% CI) or meanOutcomeAlphaDeltaBeta/GammaSymptomatic infectionPfizer-BioNTech90 (85–95)85 (80–90)85 (70–93)Oxford80 (70–85)70 (60–75)<70 [−76.8–54.8] (mild COVID-19 only)bPlease see the text for detailed explanation of this study.Moderna91 (84, 95)70 (45–85)78 (60–88) [1 dose]J&JN/AN/A52 (30.3–67.4)Novavax866060SinovacN/AN/A65.9 (65.2–66.6)?Severe diseasePfizer-BioNTech95 (90–99)95 (90–99)98 (82–100)Oxford95 (80–99)95 (80–99)N/AModerna94 (90, 97)96 (72–99) [1 dose]94 (75–99) [1 dose]J&JN/A7165–66 (hospitalization)91–95 (mortality)SinovacN/AN/A87.5 (86.7–88.2)InfectionPfizer-BioNTechVariableaVaccine effectiveness against infection is a dynamic figure that varies by setting, testing criteria, behavior, community prevalence, exposure risk, immunity status, and time from vaccination.55–80VariableaVaccine effectiveness against infection is a dynamic figure that varies by setting, testing criteria, behavior, community prevalence, exposure risk, immunity status, and time from vaccination.50–87VariableaVaccine effectiveness against infection is a dynamic figure that varies by setting, testing criteria, behavior, community prevalence, exposure risk, immunity status, and time from vaccination.70–79 (limited data)OxfordModernaa Vaccine effectiveness against infection is a dynamic figure that varies by setting, testing criteria, behavior, community prevalence, exposure risk, immunity status, and time from vaccination.b Please see the text for detailed explanation of this study. Open table in a new tab There is a growing body of evidence that Alpha has only a limited ability to escape from vaccine-induced immunity, and vaccines remain clinically effective against this variant. Interim results of the Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373; recombinant spike) shows 86% efficacy against Alpha (Tregoning et al., 2021Tregoning J.S. Flight K.E. Higham S.L. Wang Z. Pierce B.F. Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; (Published online August 9, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00592-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Likewise, when Alpha was dominant in Israel, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine showed 92% protection against asymptomatic infection, 97% against symptomatic, and 97% against severe disease. In Scotland, AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines demonstrated a 94% and 85% reduction in hospitalizations, respectively, against Alpha. In Qatar, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against any documented infection with the Alpha variant was 89.5% and against the severe disease was 97.4%. Early real-world data also suggest these vaccines significantly reduce transmission of Alpha. An exploratory analysis of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trial demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic infection in South Africa, where Beta is dominant, with no cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group. In Qatar, while protection after first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was reduced, after the second dose, it provided 75.0% protection against any documented infection with the Beta and 97.4% protection against severe disease (Abu-Raddad et al., 2021Abu-Raddad L.J. Chemaitelly H. Butt A.A. Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Interim results of J&J/Janssen’s vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S; viral vector) clinical trial showed 65%–66% protection against hospitalization and 91%–95% against mortality in South Africa, similar to the reported efficacy in the United States (Tregoning et al., 2021Tregoning J.S. Flight K.E. Higham S.L. Wang Z. Pierce B.F. Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; (Published online August 9, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00592-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In a phase 2a/b study, the efficacy of the Novavax vaccine against mild-to-moderate disease due to Beta was modestly reduced (Tregoning et al., 2021Tregoning J.S. Flight K.E. Higham S.L. Wang Z. Pierce B.F. Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; (Published online August 9, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00592-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the AstraZeneca vaccine trial in South Africa did not achieve efficacy greater than 60% (the hypothesis being tested and for which the study was powered to address) against mild and moderate disease when Beta was in circulation (Madhi et al., 2021Madhi S.A. Baillie V. Cutland C.L. Voysey M. Koen A.L. Fairlie L. Padayachee S.D. Dheda K. Barnabas S.L. Bhorat Q.E. et al.Efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.351 Variant.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384: 1885-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). However, this small phase 1/2a study was not designed to address clinical efficacy against severe disease and was primarily aimed at assessing safety. Hence, the actual clinical efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine against Beta requires further investigation. For example, in a hamster model, sera from non-human primates after inoculation with the AstraZeneca vaccine neutralized Beta, and this provided complete protection against disease caused by Beta. Additionally, it is unknown whether an enhanced antibody response resulting from a longer interval between the first and second doses of AstraZeneca might confer better clinical efficacy against the Beta variant. Comparable efficacy to the J&J/Janssen vaccine was reported in Brazil when Gamma was dominant. The Sinovac vaccine (CoronaVac; inactivated virus) and AstraZeneca vaccine showed comparable real-world effectiveness in Brazil against symptomatic COVID-19 during wide Gamma circulation (Tregoning et al., 2021Tregoning J.S. Flight K.E. Higham S.L. Wang Z. Pierce B.F. Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; (Published online August 9, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00592-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The evidence so far suggests that effectiveness against hospitalizations and symptomatic illness is highly preserved against Delta based on data from England, Scotland, Canada, Qatar, Israel, and the United States. An analysis from England showed sustained protection against hospitalization with Delta compared with Alpha, 96% and 92% after the second doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. In New York, high effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against hospitalization was shown when Delta was in circulation (91.9%–95.3%). According to the analysis from England and Canada, protection against symptomatic disease was significantly lower after one dose of vaccine with Delta compared to Alpha. Nevertheless, effectiveness was recovered after the second dose with an effectiveness of 85%–90% and 61%–72% with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, with a modest decline seen compared to Alpha (Lopez Bernal et al., 2021Lopez Bernal J. Andrews N. Gower C. Gallagher E. Simmons R. Thelwall S. Stowe J. Tessier E. Groves N. Dabrera G. et al.Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Although the preliminary data published by the Ministry of Health in Israel caused much concern suggesting a significant decline of effectiveness against symptomatic Delta infection, further preprint published did not report effectiveness figures against symptomatic infection as symptoms reporting was not reliable in the national database. Vaccine effectiveness against infection is much harder to measure as these estimates are affected by various biases such as testing criteria, behavior, exposure risk, immunity status of the population, and community prevalence. Studies showed an estimated 55%–80% effectiveness against infection before Delta was dominant, and there is a modest decline seen in prevention against infection with Delta. In Scotland, vaccine effectiveness in preventing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection was 79% with BNT162b2 and 60% with AstraZeneca after two doses. A recent analysis based on systematic testing in England demonstrated that Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines remain highly protective against any infection similar to that seen with Alpha, including those with high viral load (Ct < 30). A test-negative case-control study from Qatar demonstrated high effectiveness against swab positivity with Delta, 60% and 86% with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively. Based on routine surveillance data in the United States, two doses of mRNA vaccines were 75% effective against infection in early 2021, which declined to 53% when Delta predominated, which may also be affected by waning plasma neutralizing titers. However, these analyses did not account for prior infection in the unvaccinated cohort, which could influence effectiveness estimates. It is important to note that effectiveness against infection is a dynamic figure, that is influenced by several factors, making it challenging to compare various studies. As natural immunity builds in the population, SARS-CoV-2 variants may be increasingly selected as immune escape variants. Vaccination, on the other hand, even when partial, is unlikely to contribute significantly to the emergence of escape variants owing to the vaccines’ ability to strongly restrict the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2, reducing the emergence of such variants. It has also been shown that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity remains limited during acute infections in healthy hosts. Thus, the sudden emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, often with several key mutations, is hypothesized to be rare during transmission among primarily healthy individuals (Braun et al., 2021Braun K. Moreno G. Wagner C. Accola M.A. Rehrauer W.M. Baker D. Koelle K. O’Connor D.H. Bedford T. Friedrich T.C. et al.Limited within-host diversity and tight transmission bottlenecks limit SARS-CoV-2 evolution in acutely infected individuals.bioRxiv. 2021; (2021.04.30.440988)PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, SARS-CoV-2 evolution during chronic infections of immunocompromised individuals has been found to drive significantly more genetic diversity, including the generation of mutations commonly found in VOCs, such as E484K. This highlights the importance of vaccinating clinically vulnerable groups as a priority globally, which has the most potential to limit the emergence of new variants that may evolve some immune resistance. Preventing these variants from taking hold will be critically important in the future as immunity developed from natural infection or vaccination is variable and tends to fade over time. The limited magnitude of neutralizing activity after the first dose of vaccines against Beta and Delta underscores the importance of the complete two-dose regimen for protection against these variants. Reassuringly, a significant drop seen in neutralizing data has only been translated to a modest decline in effectiveness against symptomatic illness and severe disease. Beta seems to be the most antigenically distant variant so far, yet vaccines’ effectiveness against severe illness is broadly conserved. Similarly, vaccines’ effectiveness is conserved against symptomatic illness and severe disease caused by Delta; however, there is a modest decline seen in prevention against infection. Importantly, protection from hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 is easier to achieve than protection against infection and is expected to be long lasting. Several options could improve the strategies used with current vaccines especially in elderly and immunocompromised. These include late booster dose (i.e., with same vaccine and strain), additional variant-specific booster dose, heterologous prime-boost strategy (HPBS), and varying the time between first and second dose. There are early indications that infection with Beta elicits antibodies that cross-neutralize other variants, which may be a promising target for future vaccines. For example, a booster dose of a modified Moderna vaccine candidate matched to Beta (mRNA-1273.351) achieves higher titers against Beta and Gamma than a prototype booster dose. ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against Beta (AZD2816) also showed strong immunogenicity against Beta, Delta, and Kappa. However, as the current vaccines offer strong protection against severe and symptomatic disease, there may be a limited return on a new variant booster in the near future. Murine models show better immunogenicity of the HPBS in which different vaccines are given as first and second dose, and their clinical relevance has been demonstrated in a non-human primate model. In the medium term, it seems essential to test additional boosting with HPBS by comparing the efficacy of boosting with currently available vaccines and those expressing variant-specific spike proteins. Future vaccine strategies that elicit mucosal immune responses within the respiratory tract also hold promise for providing broadly cross-reactive protection against variant viruses. It has been possible to reduce the burden of many infectious diseases by vaccines without significant escape mutations emerging. Nevertheless, viral variation requiring changes in vaccines does occur, most notably necessitating the annual adjustment of influenza vaccines, though the antigenic variation of influenza virus is not driven by vaccine use but by immunity following natural infection. Given that cellular immunity can mitigate severe or prolonged infection, protection against severe-to-critical illness is likely to be conserved against new SARS-CoV-2 variants even in the presence of very low in vitro neutralizing titers. In addition, with more transmissible variants like Delta, protection against infection and subsequent transmission may be reduced, influencing the epidemic trajectory, especially in countries where vaccine coverage remains limited. To help keep pace with future epidemic “waves” driven by emerging variants, there is a need for a solid correlate of protection and clinical tests to determine an individual’s response to vaccines. This will be important to help determine when booster doses are needed, both on individual and population levels. While this may be needed to defend against variants with the ability to evade immunity, variants with increased transmission potential might pose a greater challenge to our ability to maintain vaccine effectiveness. Variants like Delta with intrinsic transmissibility advantages can challenge vaccines by increasing SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the community and thus increasing exposure risk to vaccinated individuals. Unless variants with the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies can compete on a population level, transmissibility will always be favored. This is because a variant with intrinsic transmissibility advantage will always compete with other variants, further emphasizing the crucial role that increased transmissibility plays in hospitalizations, irrespective of any direct effect on virulence or vaccine effectiveness. During the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has surprised some evolutionary virologists in its ability to consistently generate variants that have accumulated 10–20 new mutations during a short period, which encode new phenotypes leading to enhanced transmission, immune escape, or increased pathogenicity. For now, these variants are mainly susceptible to some degree to immunity conferred by infection with original strains of the virus and to current vaccines. While some variants show a degree of escape from protective antibody induced by natural infection (and, to a lesser degree after immunization), T cell responses are retained. This would likely reduce the disease burden in future waves once most of the population, especially clinically vulnerable, is vaccinated. While immune escape mutations will continue to appear, vaccine-induced immunity currently has important benefits in protection against variants. However, a continued adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human transmission and immune escape seems inevitable. It is vital that we remain vigilant and monitor and evaluate variants arising around the globe. In the meantime, rapid global deployment of licensed and effective vaccines remains an urgent and vital public health priority."
https://openalex.org/W3201015884,"CD8 T cell responses against different tumor neoantigens occur simultaneously, yet little is known about the interplay between responses and its impact on T cell function and tumor control. In mouse lung adenocarcinoma, we found that immunodominance is established in tumors, wherein CD8 T cell expansion is predominantly driven by the antigen that most stably binds MHC. T cells responding to subdominant antigens were enriched for a TCF1+ progenitor phenotype correlated with response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the subdominant T cell response did not preferentially benefit from ICB due to a dysfunctional subset of TCF1+ cells marked by CCR6 and Tc17 differentiation. Analysis of human samples and sequencing datasets revealed that CCR6+ TCF1+ cells exist across human cancers and are not correlated with ICB response. Vaccination eliminated CCR6+ TCF1+ cells and dramatically improved the subdominant response, highlighting a strategy to optimally engage concurrent neoantigen responses against tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3200555245,"Certain obligate parasites induce complex and substantial phenotypic changes in their hosts in ways that favor their transmission to other trophic levels. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate how SAP05 protein effectors from insect-vectored plant pathogenic phytoplasmas take control of several plant developmental processes. These effectors simultaneously prolong the host lifespan and induce witches' broom-like proliferations of leaf and sterile shoots, organs colonized by phytoplasmas and vectors. SAP05 acts by mediating the concurrent degradation of SPL and GATA developmental regulators via a process that relies on hijacking the plant ubiquitin receptor RPN10 independent of substrate ubiquitination. RPN10 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but SAP05 does not bind insect vector RPN10. A two-amino-acid substitution within plant RPN10 generates a functional variant that is resistant to SAP05 activities. Therefore, one effector protein enables obligate parasitic phytoplasmas to induce a plethora of developmental phenotypes in their hosts."

We developed the massively parallel reporter assay for 3'UTRs (MPRAu) to sensitively assay 12,173 3'UTR variants. We applied MPRAu to six human cell lines, focusing on genetic variants associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and human evolutionary adaptation. MPRAu expands our understanding of 3'UTR function, suggesting that simple sequences predominately explain 3'UTR regulatory activity. We adapt MPRAu to uncover diverse molecular mechanisms at base pair resolution, including an adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich element of LEPR linked to potential metabolic evolutionary adaptations in East Asians. We nominate hundreds of 3'UTR causal variants with genetically fine-mapped phenotype associations. Using endogenous allelic replacements, we characterize one variant that disrupts a miRNA site regulating the viral defense gene TRIM14 and one that alters PILRB abundance, nominating a causal variant underlying transcriptional changes in age-related macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3200902126,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted cancer care worldwide. Disruptions have been seen across all facets of care. While the long-term impact of COVID-19 remains unclear, the immediate impacts on patients, their carers and the healthcare workforce are increasingly evident. This study describes disruptions and reorganisation of cancer services in Australia since the onset of COVID-19, from the perspectives of people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Two separate online cross-sectional surveys were completed by: a) cancer patients, survivors, carers, family members or friends (n = 852) and b) healthcare workers (n = 150). Descriptive analyses of quantitative survey data were conducted, followed by inductive thematic content analyses of qualitative survey responses relating to cancer care disruption and perceptions of telehealth. Overall, 42% of cancer patients and survivors reported experiencing some level of care disruption. A further 43% of healthcare workers reported atypical delays in delivering cancer care, and 50% agreed that patient access to research and clinical trials had been reduced. Almost three quarters (73%) of patients and carers reported using telehealth following the onset of COVID-19, with high overall satisfaction. However, gaps were identified in provision of psychological support and 20% of participants reported that they were unlikely to use telehealth again. The reorganisation of cancer care increased the psychological and practical burden on carers, with hospital visitation restrictions and appointment changes reducing their ability to provide essential support. COVID-19 has exacerbated a stressful and uncertain time for people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Service reconfiguration and the adoption of telehealth have been essential adaptations for the pandemic response, offering long-term value. However, our findings highlight the need to better integrate psychosocial support and the important role of carers into evolving pandemic response measures. Learnings from this study could inform service improvements that would benefit patients and carers longer-term."
https://openalex.org/W3199605172,"In the neocortex, subcerebral axonal projections originate largely from layer 5 (L5) extratelencephalic-projecting (ET) neurons. The unique morpho-electric properties of these neurons have been mainly described in rodents, where retrograde tracers or transgenic lines can label them. Similar labeling strategies are infeasible in the human neocortex, rendering the translational relevance of findings in rodents unclear. We leveraged the recent discovery of a transcriptomically defined L5 ET neuron type to study the properties of human L5 ET neurons in neocortical brain slices derived from neurosurgeries. Patch-seq recordings, where transcriptome, physiology, and morphology were assayed from the same cell, revealed many conserved morpho-electric properties of human and rodent L5 ET neurons. Divergent properties were often subtler than differences between L5 cell types within these two species. These data suggest a conserved function of L5 ET neurons in the neocortical hierarchy but also highlight phenotypic divergence possibly related to functional specialization of human neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W3195859649,"Dopamine is required for working memory, but how it modulates the large-scale cortex is unknown. Here, we report that dopamine receptor density per neuron, measured by autoradiography, displays a macroscopic gradient along the macaque cortical hierarchy. This gradient is incorporated in a connectome-based large-scale cortex model endowed with multiple neuron types. The model captures an inverted U-shaped dependence of working memory on dopamine and spatial patterns of persistent activity observed in over 90 experimental studies. Moreover, we show that dopamine is crucial for filtering out irrelevant stimuli by enhancing inhibition from dendrite-targeting interneurons. Our model revealed that an activity-silent memory trace can be realized by facilitation of inter-areal connections and that adjusting cortical dopamine induces a switch from this internal memory state to distributed persistent activity. Our work represents a cross-level understanding from molecules and cell types to recurrent circuit dynamics underlying a core cognitive function distributed across the primate cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3199707790,"Natural goal-directed behaviors often involve complex sequences of many stimulus-triggered components. Understanding how brain circuits organize such behaviors requires mapping the interactions between an animal, its environment, and its nervous system. Here, we use brain-wide neuronal imaging to study the full performance of mating by the C. elegans male. We show that as mating unfolds in a sequence of component behaviors, the brain operates similarly between instances of each component but distinctly between different components. When the full sensory and behavioral context is taken into account, unique roles emerge for each neuron. Functional correlations between neurons are not fixed but change with behavioral dynamics. From individual neurons to circuits, our study shows how diverse brain-wide dynamics emerge from the integration of sensory perception and motor actions in their natural context."
https://openalex.org/W3199934858,"The theory of predictive processing posits that the brain computes expectations to process information predictively. Empirical evidence in support of this theory, however, is scarce and largely limited to sensory areas. Here, we report a precise and adaptive mechanism in the frontal cortex of non-human primates consistent with predictive processing of temporal events. We found that the speed of neural dynamics is precisely adjusted according to the average time of an expected stimulus. This speed adjustment, in turn, enables neurons to encode stimuli in terms of deviations from expectation. This lawful relationship was evident across multiple experiments and held true during learning: when temporal statistics underwent covert changes, neural responses underwent predictable changes that reflected the new mean. Together, these results highlight a precise mathematical relationship between temporal statistics in the environment and neural activity in the frontal cortex that may serve as a mechanism for predictive temporal processing."
https://openalex.org/W3199138113,"<h2>Summary</h2> Emerging evidence implicates experience-dependent myelination in learning and memory. However, the specific signals underlying this process remain unresolved. We demonstrate that the neuropeptide dynorphin, which is released from neurons upon high levels of activity, promotes experience-dependent myelination. Following forced swim stress, an experience that induces striatal dynorphin release, we observe increased striatal oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination, which is abolished by deleting dynorphin or blocking its endogenous receptor, kappa opioid receptor (KOR). We find that dynorphin also promotes developmental OPC differentiation and myelination and demonstrate that this effect requires KOR expression specifically in OPCs. We characterize dynorphin-expressing neurons and use genetic sparse labeling to trace their axonal projections. Surprisingly, we find that they are unmyelinated normally and following forced swim stress. We propose a new model whereby experience-dependent and developmental myelination is mediated by unmyelinated, neuropeptide-expressing neurons that promote OPC differentiation for the myelination of neighboring axons."

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fifth most common malignancy in women worldwide accounting for 1% to 2% of all deaths from cancer (1Lee T.Y. Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Schilder R.J. Kim C.H.

The incidence of EC has steadily increased and is noted to be much higher in developed countries than in developing countries in the past 10 years, and nearly 11.7% of the cases occur in China (3He Y.

Clinicopathologic features of endometrial cancer in Chinese patients younger than 50 years with a family history of cancer.Medicine. 2018; 97e12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The risk factors for developing EC include age, high socioeconomic status, and factors related to an excess of estrogen exposure, diabetes, or hypertension, but relatively little is known about inherited risk factors for this disease (4Potischman N.

Thus, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the occurrence and development of EC. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) represent the majority of transcripts in a cell and are known to be involved in the development of EC (5Li N. Zheng J. Li H. Deng J. Hu M. Wu H. Li W. Li F. Lan X. Lu J.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of widespread ncRNAs that regulate gene expression in mammals. They are closed RNA transcripts generated by back-splicing of a single pre-mRNA. About 85% of circRNAs are aligned in sense orientation to known protein-coding genes and span 1 to 5 exons of the housed protein-coding genes. The expression of circRNAs is often highly conserved across species (7Servick K. Circular RNAs hint at new realm of genetics.Science. 2017; 355: 1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). They are naturally resistant to degradation by exonucleases, thus representing a class of stable RNAs (8Memczak S. Jens M. Elefsinioti A. Torti F. Krueger J. Rybak A. Maier L. Mackowiak S.D. Gregersen L.H. Munschauer M. Loewer A. Ziebold U. Landthaler M. Kocks C.

Some circRNAs are known to harbor microRNAs (miRNAs) and function as a sponge to neutralize miRNA (8Memczak S. Jens M. Elefsinioti A. Torti F. Krueger J. Rybak A. Maier L. Mackowiak S.D. Gregersen L.H. Munschauer M. Loewer A. Ziebold U. Landthaler M. Kocks C.

Bramsen J.B. Finsen B. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges.Nature. 2013; 495: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (4703) Google Scholar). For instance, the circRNA CiRS-7 can function as a sponge of miR-7, and the circRNA of testes-specific Sry gene acts as a sponge for miR-138 in mice (11Capel B. Swain A. Nicolis S. Hacker A. Walter M. Koopman P. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Circular transcripts of the testis-determining gene Sry in adult mouse testis.Cell. 1993; 73: 1019-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Besides this, some circRNAs have also been reported to bind to and sequester RNA-binding proteins. For example, circ-Foxo3 interacted with both p21 and CDK2 to form a ternary complex, resulting in the inhibition of cell cycle progression (12Du W.W. Yang W. Liu E. Yang Z. Dhaliwal P. Yang B.B. Foxo3 circular RNA retards cell cycle progression via forming ternary complexes with p21 and CDK2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 2846-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). However, the biological function of most circRNAs is still undetermined. With the development of ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs sequencing (RNC-seq) and Ribosome footprints profiling (Ribo-seq), recent studies have demonstrated that functional peptides can be encoded by short open reading frames (sORFs) in ncRNAs (13Aspden J.L. Eyre-Walker Y.C. Phillips R.J. Amin U. Mumtaz M.A. Brocard M. Couso J.P. Extensive translation of small open reading frames revealed by poly-ribo-seq.Elife. 2014; 3e03528Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Andrews S.J. Rothnagel J.A. Emerging evidence for functional peptides encoded by short open reading frames.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Consequently, owing to its cytoplasmic location, the sORFs of some circRNAs can be translated through the internal ribosome entry sites by N6-methyladenosine (15Yang Y. Fan X. Mao M. Song X. Wu P. Zhang Y. Jin Y. Yang Y. Chen L.L. Wang Y. Wong C.C. Xiao X. Wang Z. Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N(6)-methyladenosine.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 626-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). For example, both circZNF609 and circMbl were reported to be translatable (16Legnini I. Di Timoteo G. Rossi F. Morlando M. Briganti F. Sthandier O. Fatica A. Santini T. Andronache A. Wade M. Laneve P. Rajewsky N. Bozzoni I. Circ-ZNF609 is a circular RNA that can be translated and functions in myogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2017; 66: 22-37.e29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Circ-FBXW7, driven by an internal ribosome entry site, encodes a novel 21-kDa protein (17Yang Y. Gao X. Zhang M. Yan S. Sun C. Xiao F. Huang N. Yang X. Zhao K. Zhou H. Huang S. Xie B. Zhang N. Novel role of FBXW7 circular RNA in repressing glioma tumorigenesis.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2018; 110: 304-315Crossref Scopus (602) Google Scholar). circPINTexon2, generated from the long ncRNA LINC-PINT, contains a sORF encoding a tumor-suppressive peptide in human cells (18Zhang M. Zhao K. Xu X. Yang Y. Yan S. Wei P. Liu H. Xu J. Xiao F. Zhou H. Yang X. Huang N. Liu J. He K. Xie K. et al.A peptide encoded by circular form of LINC-PINT suppresses oncogenic transcriptional elongation in glioblastoma.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this work, we generated deep RNA sequencing data from four EC samples and their paired adjacent normal tissues and identified approximately 3169 circRNA candidates. We found that the human circRNA hsa-circ-0000437 is differentially expressed in cancer and paracancerous tissues. Hsa-circ-0000437 contains a sORF encoding a peptide that is termed CORO1C-47aa. We further analyzed the functional role of this peptide in EC development and determined that CORO1C-47aa competes with TACC3 to interact with the PAS-B domain of ARNT, leading to transcriptional suppression of VEGF and inhibition of angiogenesis in EC. To identify the circRNAs that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of EC, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on the ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA from four human EC samples and their paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. The number of candidate circRNAs identified from all samples varied from 89 to 675 with the lower amount in three of four tumors compared with their matched adjacent normal tissues (Fig. S1A). About 65.9% (2087/3169) of the identified circRNAs is known circRNAs in the publicly available circRNA database, circBase (http://www.circbase.org) (19Glazar P. Papavasileiou P. Rajewsky N. circBase: A database for circular RNAs.RNA. 2014; 20: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1B). Most of all identified circRNAs originated from protein-coding exons and others aligned with introns, intergenic region (Fig. S1C). The median length of circRNAs is close to 600 nt, and there was no significant difference between the tumor group and the normal group (Fig. S1D). Next, we compared the expression of circRNAs in EC and their matched adjacent normal tissues. Unsupervised clustering of all identified circRNAs results in clustering of tumors versus noncancerous controls (Fig. 1A). The supervised analysis further identified hsa-circ-0000437 as the top differentially expressed circRNA that showed significant lower expression in tumors than matched normal control (log2FC = −4, p < 0.05, Fig. 1B), and circRNA chr17-25967597-26073249+ as the most significantly elevated circRNA in tumors versus normal controls (log2FC = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). To validate whether circ-0000437 is differentially expressed in EC compared with their matched adjacent noncancerous tissues, we performed RT-qPCR assay using two divergent primer sets that amplify only the circular product of hsa-circ-0000437 to determine the levels of circ-0000437 in a total of 198 paired EC samples and matched noncancerous tissues. Circ-0000437 was significantly underexpressed in EC compared with their matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (Fig. 1C, n = 198, p < 0.05). However, the other circRNA chr17-25967597-26073249+ cannot be detected by qRCR (data not shown). Circ-0000437 originates from the circularization of the seventh and eighth exons of its host gene CORO1C. To determine whether circ-0000437 is expressed in EC, we designed two sets of primers for hsa-circ-0000437 locus: a divergent set that amplifies only the circular transcript and a convergent set that amplifies the linear transcript. Our results showed that the circular form was amplified using the divergent primers. cDNA and genomic DNA of EC were used as templates, and as expected, no amplification was observed with the divergent primers on genomic DNA (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in contrast to the linear control RNAs, the circRNA was resistant to the treatment of RNase R (Fig. 1E), a highly processive 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease that does not act on circRNAs (20Vincent H.A. Deutscher M.P. Substrate recognition and catalysis by the exoribonuclease RNase R.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29769-29775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Vincent H.A. Deutscher M.P. Insights into how RNase R degrades structured RNA: Analysis of the nuclease domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thus validating the circular nature of circ-0000437. Sanger sequencing of the circular PCR product of hsa-circ-0000437 confirmed the sequence of circ-0000437 (Fig. 1D, lower panel) that matched the reported sequence in circbase database. Next, we investigated the stability of transcripts from the hsa-circ-0000437 locus. Cells were treated with actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, and harvested at indicated time points for total RNA isolation. There was little change in circ-0000437 levels following incubation with actinomycin D for 24 h, while the quantity of the linear transcript from the same locus decreased dramatically with only 10% to 20% remaining 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1F). To determine the cellular localization of circ-0000437, we isolated the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction of EC cells. The levels of the nuclear control transcript (U6) and cytoplasmic control transcript (GAPDH mRNA) were also quantitated by RT-qPCR, which indicated a successful fractionation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1G). The qRT-PCR analysis of circ-0000437 by real-time RT-qPCR showed that the circ-0000437 was mostly present in the cytosol (Fig. 1G). Next, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were performed to verify the cellular localization of circ-0000437. In agreement with the cellular fractionation data, circ-0000437 was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of EC cells via FISH assays (Fig. 1H). Endogenous circ-0000437 was further detected using a junction-specific biotin-labeled probe in Northern blotting (Fig. 1I, EV). We also overexpressed circ-0000437 using a synthetic circRNA expression vector, which was induced by side flanking repeat sequences with splicing acceptor and donor. However, the control vector that lacked the downstream flanking sequences was not overexpressed (Fig. 1I). It is known that circRNAs can act as miRNA sponges to regulate gene expression in different cell types (22Xu H. Guo S. Li W. Yu P. The circular RNA Cdr1as, via miR-7 and its targets, regulates insulin transcription and secretion in islet cells.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 12453Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To determine whether circ-0000437 regulates EC development through the same mechanism, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation assays using an anti-AGO2 antibody. CDR1as, a molecular sponge of miR-7 (16Legnini I. Di Timoteo G. Rossi F. Morlando M. Briganti F. Sthandier O. Fatica A. Santini T. Andronache A. Wade M. Laneve P. Rajewsky N. Bozzoni I. Circ-ZNF609 is a circular RNA that can be translated and functions in myogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2017; 66: 22-37.e29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), was enriched in AGO2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. S2A), validating a successful pulldown of AGO2–RNA interaction complexes. However, circ-0000437 was not detected in AGO2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. S2A), suggesting that circ-0000437 may regulate the occurrence and development of EC tumors through other mechanisms. As some circRNAs have been reported to encode functional peptides, we searched the genomic sequence of cir-0000437 and found a putative 144-nt sORF with the potential to encode a 47-aa peptide in circ-0000437, spanning from the AUG codon in the exon 8 of the host gene over the splice junction to a STOP codon in the exon 7 of the host gene, which we termed as CORO1C-47aa (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3, A and B). Moreover, no homologous nucleotide sequences with the human 144-nt ORF sequences that encode CORO1C-47aa peptide were found in any other species. To determine whether this putative sORF (circORF) is functional, we first used sucrose gradient fractionation to test circ-0000437 loading onto polysomes. The mRNA-protein particles (mRNPs) were separated into three fractions: nonribosome (mRNPs without any ribosome), 40S-80S (mRNPs associated with ribosome but not being translated), and polysome (mRNPs being actively translated). Quantitation of HRPT1 and a circRNA with no ORF, circ-HIPK3, in these three fractions by qRT-PCR showed that HRPT1, but not circ-HIPK3, was abundantly detected in the polysome fraction (Fig. 2B), indicating a successful fractionation of mRNPs. Accordingly, a small but significant portion of circ-0000437 was sedimented in the polysome fraction (Fig. 2B), suggesting that cicr-0000437 may be actively translated. Recent studies have demonstrated that the translation of circRNAs depends on the presence of an internal ribosomal entrance site (IRES), a translation regulatory sequence that is required for 5′-cap independent translation (23Gilbert W.V. Zhou K. Butler T.K. Doudna J.A. Cap-independent translation is required for starvation-induced differentiation in yeast.Science. 2007; 317: 1224-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). circ-000437 was matched in circRNADb, one database for human circRNAs. circRNADb provided the IRES elements of circ-000437. Accordingly, we identified a putative IRES upstream of the translation start site of circ-0000437 (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, sequence in green color; Fig. S3C). To verify whether this candidate IRES is functional, we cloned the full-length wildtype or mutated putative circ-0000437 IRES sequences between the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and Firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter genes of a dual-luciferase vector system (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3B). Therefore, the ratio of Luc/Rluc activity will indicate the efficiency of the translation of firefly luciferase. Consequently, the luciferase assay results showed that cells transfected with the full-length wildtype circ-0000437 IRES induced the Luc/Rluc activity dramatically compared with the empty control (Fig. 2C). In contrast, mutation or partial deletion of the IRES significantly reduced the activity of firefly luciferase induced by wildtype IRES (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the IRES of circ-0000437 is bioactive. To test the protein-coding ability of circ-0000437, we cloned the full-length circ-0000437 into a pLCDH-ciR vector (plasmid 3) that was able to produce circular transcripts. We also constructed two more FLAG-tagged plasmids: one has disrupted splicing site (plasmid 2) and the other has linearized circ-0000437-aa sequencing (plasmid 4) (Fig. 2D, upper panel). As the FLAG-coding sequence is put immediately upstream of the STOP codon, a flagged protein can be produced only upon the formation of a circular transcript in plasmids 2 and 3. Transfection of the wildtype circ-0000437 overexpression (OE, plasmid 3) increased the expression of circ-0000437 by 4.6-fold in HEC-1B and Ishikawa EC cells (Fig. 2F, left panel; Fig. S2C), which was not impacted by introducing a mutation into the IRES. Consequently, the CORO1C-47aa can be detected in either circ-0000437 OE vector (plasmid 3) or its linearized counterpart (plasmid 4) transfected cells by anti-FLAG antibody. Moreover, we generated an antibody against the 47-aa peptide, which detected the expression of both endogenous and FLAG-tagged proteins (Fig. 2D, down panel). Next, we determined whether an in-frame mutation of the ATG codon of CORO1C-47aa can impair the initiation of translation. We constructed an ORF mutation expression vector, in which the sequences encoding start codons ATGGTG were mutated to ATTGTT, and a FLAG-tag to the C terminus of CORO1C-47aa. Expression of CORO1C-47aa was detected in cells transfected with the wildtype CORO1C-47aa-FLAG plasmid, but not in cells transfected with the plasmid carrying ORF mutation, by anti-FLAG Western blotting (Fig. 2E). Because CORO1C-47aa is downregulated in EC tissues compared with normal EC tissues (Fig. S2E), we generated cell lines with stable overexpression of either wildtype circ-0000437 OE vector or a circ-000043 OE plasmid with IRES mutation. Although the IRES mutation did not influence the expression of circ-0000437 (Fig. 1I), only overexpression of wildtype circ-0000437 OE plasmid led to upregulation of CORO1C-47aa (Fig. 2G). Through FLAG-labeling immunofluorescence assay, we found that CORO1C-47aa was predominantly localized inside the nucleus of both HEC-1-B and Ishikawa EC cells (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, we used two siRNAs that specifically target the circular junction of circ-0000437. These two siRNAs successfully reduced both circ-0000437 expression (Fig. 2F, right panel) and the CORO1C-47aa peptide level with no significant impact on the expression of the host gene CORO1C (Fig. S2, F and G). The expression of neither circ-0000437 nor the 47-aa peptide was altered by two siRNAs specifically designed to target and silence CORO1C gene. Furthermore, stable overexpression of CORO1C did not elevate CORO1C-47aa expression (Fig. S2, H and I). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the circ-0000437 encodes the peptide CORO1C-47aa independently of its host gene. To determine the impact of CORO1C-47aa on cell proliferation, we first performed CCK-8 assays on the HEC-1B and Ishikawa cells that stably expressed CORO1C-47aa. The results from the CCK-8 assays revealed no significant difference in the cell proliferation of cells overexpressing either wildtype or IRES mutant circ-0000437 compared with the control cells (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined the biological effect of CORO1C-47aa overexpression on tumor growth in mice. The subcutaneous xenografts of EC cells overexpressing the wildtype circ-0000437 plasmid significantly grew slower than those of their counterparts expressing empty vector or IRES mutant circ-0000437 plasmid (Fig. 3B, n = 5), suggesting that CORO1C-47aa overexpression, but not the circRNA transcript itself, suppressed the tumor growth. The tumor volume doubling time (200 mm3 → 400 mm3) increased from 5 days in control HEC-1B cells to 8 days in CORO1C-47aa overexpression cells (p < 0.05). The tumor volume doubling time (200 mm3 → 400 mm3) increased from 6 days in control Ishikawa cells to 9 days in CORO1C-47aa overexpression cells (p < 0.05). Given that CORO1C-47a decreased the growth of EC cells in vivo but not in vitro, we speculated that CORO1C-47aa may negatively regulate tumor development via controlling the formation of blood vessels running through endometrium tumors. To address whether the growth inhibition by CORO1C-47aa was attributed to the disruption of angiogenesis, we analyzed the expression of CD31, a marker of microvessel density (24Chen H. Cong Q. Du Z. Liao W. Zhang L. Yao Y. Ding K. Sulfated fucoidan FP08S2 inhibits lung cancer cell growth in vivo by disrupting angiogenesis via targeting VEGFR2/VEGF and blocking VEGFR2/Erk/VEGF signaling.Cancer Lett. 2016; 382: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), by immunofluorescence. Compared with the IRES mutated and control groups, the expression of CD31 was significantly reduced in the CORO1C-47aa overexpression group (Fig. 3C). In addition, an endothelial tube formation assay was performed to determine whether CORO1C-47aa overexpression influences endothelial network formation on matrix matrigel. The results showed that CORO1C-47aa overexpression significantly impaired the ability of HUVEC cells to form capillary tubes compared with the control (Fig. 3D). Angiogenesis was inseparable from endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Therefore, we cultured endothelial cells in condition medium from HEC-1-B and Ishikawa cells transfected with CORO1C-47aa overexpression vectors. First, we performed HUVEC cells proliferation assay. The endothelial cell proliferation was significantly decreased in the condition medium collected from either cell line overexpressing CORO1C-47aa (Fig. 3E). Next, to investigate the influence of CORO1C-47aa expression on HUVEC cell migration, we conducted wound healing assays and transwell assays using HUVEC cells cultured in conditioned medium. As shown in Figure 3, F and G, both the wound healing assays and transwell assays demonstrated that the migration capabilities of HUVEC cells were significantly suppressed in the conditioned medium collected from cells with CORO1C-47aa overexpression compared with those transfected with an empty vector or an IRES mutation plasmid. Furthermore, we next determined the effect of CORO1C-47aa on the endothelial cell cytoskeleton. In HUVEC cells cultured in condition medium from empty vector–expressing cells, F-actin fluorescent staining showed that the skeleton surrounding the cells formed into a nest column (Fig. 4H), which is not conducive to cell migration (25Dorland Y.L. Huveneers S. Cell-cell junctional mechanotransduction in endothelial remodeling.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2017; 74: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the skeleton of HUVEC cells treatment with CORO1C-47aa-overexpressing medium failed to form apparent rearrangement of F-actin (Fig. 3H). We next determined the intercellular junction of HUVEC cells by electron microscopy. Tight intercellular connections were detected in both the control and IRES mutation groups, whereas the intercellular connections of HUVEC cells were significantly induced with decreased intercellular spacing when cultured in medium from CORO1C-47aa-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3I). To further support the notion that CORO1C-47aa can suppress angiogenesis, Matrigel plug assays were performed to measure neovascularization in mice. As shown in Figure 3J, the neovascularization in mice injected subcutaneously with Matrigel is significantly inhibited in the CORO1C-47aa overexpression group (Fig. S4, A and B). Finally, the effect of CORO1C-47aa was evaluated in an in vitro tridimensional model of angiogenesis in which HUVEC spheroids invade a three-dimensional fibrin matrix, generating endothelial sprouts as a result of the localized breakdown of the extracellular matrix that occurs together with HUVEC migration and growth (26Chiodelli P. Rezzola S. Urbinati C. Federici Signori F. Monti E. Ronca R. Presta M. Rusnati M. Contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 sialylation to the process of angiogenesis.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 6531-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3K and Fig. S4C, CORO1C-47aa caused a reduction of HUVEC sprouting. Taken together, these results indicated that CORO1C-47aa is capable of inhibiting angiogenesis at the initiation stage by suppressing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. To explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the antiangiogenesis functions of CORO1C-47aa, we performed coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody in HEC-1-B and Ishikawa cells overexpressing CORO1C47aa-FLAG to identify the interacting molecules of CORO1C-47aa by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4A). We identified 76 and 7 specific CORO1C-47aa-interacting proteins in Ishikawa and HEC-1B cells, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table S3). Only one protein, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), interacted with CORO1C-47aa-FLAG in both cell lines. Subsequent IP using the anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the interaction between CORO1C-47aa-FLAG and endogenous ARNT in both cell lines (Fig. 4C, upper panel). The reciprocal IP using an anti-HA antibody in cells cotransfected with ARNT and CORO1C-47aa also identified FLAG-tagged CORO1C-47aa (Fig. 4C, bottom panel), further confirming the interaction between CORO1C-47aa and ARNT. ARNT is the obligate heterodimeric partner for the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)-PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) proteins aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF-α), which serve as environmental sensors for xenobiotics and hypoxia, respectively (27Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. The mammalian basic helix-loop-helix/PAS family of transcriptional regulators.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To identify the key functional domain that mediates the interaction, we constructed plasmids expressing truncated ARNT"

To gain understanding on how two LR systems perform, a total of 154 two-person, 147 three-person, and 127 four-person mixture profiles of varying DNA quality, DNA quantity, and mixture ratios were obtained from the filtered (.CSV) files of the GlobalFiler 29 cycles 15s PROVEDIt dataset and deconvolved in two independently developed fully continuous programs, STRmix v2.6 and EuroForMix v2.1.0. Various parameters were set in each software and LR computations obtained from the two software were based on same/fixed EPG features, same pair of propositions, number of contributors, theta, and population allele frequencies. The ability of each LR system to discriminate between contributor (H1-true) and non-contributor (H2-true) scenarios was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Differences in the numeric LR values and their corresponding verbal classifications between the two LR systems were compared. The magnitude of the differences in the assigned LRs and the potential explanations for the observed differences greater than or equal to 3 on the log10 scale were described. Cases of LR < 1 for H1-true tests and LR > 1 for H2-true tests were also discussed. Our intent is to demonstrate the value of using a publicly available ground truth known mixture dataset to assess discrimination performance of any LR system and show the steps used to understand similarities and differences between different LR systems. We share our observations with the forensic community and describe how examining more than one PGS with similar discrimination power can be beneficial, help analysts compare interpretation especially with low-template profiles or minor contributor cases, and be a potential additional diagnostic check even if software in use does contain certain diagnostic statistics as part of the output."
https://openalex.org/W3199437894,"In non-neuronal cells, clathrin has established roles in endocytosis, with clathrin cages enclosing plasma membrane infoldings, followed by rapid disassembly and reuse of monomers. However, in neurons, clathrin is conveyed in slow axonal transport over days to weeks, and the underlying transport/targeting mechanisms, mobile cargo structures, and even its precise presynaptic localization and physiologic role are unclear. Combining live imaging, photobleaching/conversion, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and super-resolution imaging, we found that unlike in dendrites, where clathrin cages rapidly assemble and disassemble, in axons, clathrin and related proteins organize into stable ""transport packets"" that are unrelated to endocytosis and move intermittently on microtubules, generating an overall slow anterograde flow. At synapses, multiple clathrin packets abut synaptic vesicle (SV) clusters, and clathrin packets also exchange between synaptic boutons in a microtubule-dependent ""superpool."" Within synaptic boundaries, clathrin is surprisingly dynamic, continuously exchanging between local clathrin assemblies, and its depletion impairs SV recycling. Our data provide a conceptual framework for understanding clathrin trafficking and presynaptic targeting that has functional implications."

Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the tongue and gingival mucosa, the oral cavity is a potential entry point for SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of general ingredients of toothpastes and mouthwashes on the spike protein-ACE2 interaction and the TMPRSS2 protease activity using an in vitro assay. Both assays detected inhibitory effects of sodium tetradecene sulfonate, sodium N-lauroyl-N-methyltaurate, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and copper gluconate. Molecular docking simulations suggested that these ingredients could bind to inhibitor-binding site of ACE2. Furthermore, tranexamic acid exerted inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Our findings suggest that these toothpaste and mouthwash ingredients could help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3200519789,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which started in late December, 2019, has spread to affect 216 countries and territories around the world. Globally, the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been growing exponentially. There is pressure on countries to flatten the curves and break transmission. Most countries are practicing partial or total lockdown, vaccination, massive education on hygiene, social distancing, isolation of cases, quarantine of exposed and various screening approaches such as temperature and symptom-based screening to break the transmission. Some studies outside Africa have found the screening for fever using non-contact thermometers to lack good sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of clinical symptoms in accurately predicting a final diagnosis of COVID-19 disease in the Ghanaian setting.The study analysed screening and test data of COVID-19 suspected, probable and contacts for the months of March to August 2020. A total of 1,986 participants presenting to Tamale Teaching hospital were included in the study. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis were carried out.Overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 16.8%. Those with symptoms had significantly higher positivity rate (21.6%) compared with asymptomatic (17.0%) [chi-squared 15.5, p-value, <0.001]. Patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were 5.9 [3.9-8.8] times more likely to have loss of sense of smell and 5.9 [3.8-9.3] times more likely to having loss of sense of taste. Using history of fever as a screening tool correctly picked up only 14.8% of all true positives of SARS-CoV-2 infection and failed to pick up 86.2% of positive cases. Using cough alone would detect 22.4% and miss 87.6%. Non-contact thermometer used alone, as a screening tool for COVID-19 at a cut-off of 37.8 would only pick 4.8% of positive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.The use of fever alone or other symptoms individually [or in combination] as a screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection is not worthwhile based on ROC analysis. Use of temperature check as a COVID-19 screening tool to allow people into public space irrespective of the temperature cut-off is of little benefit in diagnosing infected persons. We recommend the use of facemask, hand hygiene, social distancing as effective means of preventing infection."

Many crisis standards of care suggest the use of SOFA scores to allocate medical resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research question Are SOFA scores elevated among Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to Non-Hispanic White patients? Study design and methods Retrospective cohort study conducted in Yale New Haven Health System, including 5 hospitals with total of 2681 beds. Study population drawn from consecutive patients aged ≥18 admitted with COVID-19 from March 29 th to August 1 st , 2020. Patients excluded from the analysis if not their first admission with COVID-19, if they did not have SOFA score recorded within 24 hours of admission, if race and ethnicity data were not Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Hispanic, or if they had other missing data. The primary outcome was SOFA score, with peak score within 24 hours of admission dichotomized as &lt;6 or ≥6. Results Of 2982 patients admitted with COVID-19, 2320 met inclusion criteria and were analyzed, of whom 1058 (45.6%) were Non-Hispanic White, 645 (27.8%) were Hispanic, and 617 (26.6%) were Non-Hispanic Black. Median age was 65.0 and 1226 (52.8%) were female. In univariate logistic screen and in full multivariate model, Non-Hispanic Black patients but not Hispanic patients had greater odds of an elevated SOFA score ≥6 when compared to Non-Hispanic White patients (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.11–1.99). Interpretation Given current unequal patterns in social determinants of health, US crisis standards of care utilizing the SOFA score to allocate medical resources would be more likely to deny these resources to Non-Hispanic Black patients."
https://openalex.org/W3199784371,"Background Brazil, as many other countries, have been heavily affected by COVID-19. This study aimed to analyze the impact of Primary health care and the family health strategy (FHS) coverage, the scores of the National Program for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ), and socioeconomic and social indicators in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian largest cities. Methods This is an ecological study, carried out through the analysis of secondary data on the population of all Brazilian main cities, based on the analysis of a 26-week epidemiological epidemic week series by COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed using Generalized Linear Models with an Autoregressive work correlation matrix. Results It was shown that greater PHC coverage and greater FHS coverage together with an above average PMAQ score are associated with slower dissemination and lower burden of COVID-19. Conclusion It is evident that cities with less social inequality and restrictions of social protection combined with social development have a milder pandemic scenario. It is necessary to act quickly on these conditions for COVID-19 dissemination by timely actions with high capillarity. Expanding access to PHC and social support strategies for the vulnerable are essential."

Swab specimens of the nares were obtained from the participants and bacteriologically-cultured. Identification and characterization of S. aureus and MRSA were based on standard bacteriological methods; antimicrobial susceptibility testing was by the Kirby-Bauer method.The prevalence of staphylococcal carriage, the diabetes group relative to the non-diabetes group, were 31.0% and 10.4% (S. aureus), and 3.3% and 0.0% (MRSA). Presence of diabetes predisposed to S. aureus carriage, but not MRSA nor coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) carriage (OR = 3.88; p < 0.0001). Colonization with CoNS was protective of S. aureus (OR = 0.039, p < 0.001) and MRSA (OR = 0.115, p = 0.043) colonization among the diabetics. The antimicrobial resistance patterns recorded among the S. aureus isolated from the diabetic individuals relative to the non-diabetics were as follows: penicillin (95% vs. 91%), tetracycline (37% vs. 27%), cotrimoxazole (30% vs. 36%), erythromycin (17% vs. 0%), norfloxacin (13% vs. 0%), clindamycin (12% vs. 0%), gentamicin (9% vs. 0%), fusidic acid (10% vs. 9%), linezolid (4% vs. 0%), and rifampicin (5% vs. 0%). The proportion of multidrug resistant S. aureus was 41% (n = 38) in the diabetes group and 0% in the non-diabetes group; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01).The presence of diabetes predisposed the participants to S. aureus carriage by almost four folds, but not MRSA carriage. Colonization with CoNS was protective of S. aureus and MRSA carriage in the diabetes group. Finally, linezolid remains a good therapeutic agent for anti-MRSA therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3199530804,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat causing worldwide morbidity and mortality. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples, the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples. Here, we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions to achieve specific, rapid (30 min), and sensitive (<100 copies) fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples. When compared to RT-qPCR, positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98% (n = 41/42) concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87% (n = 59/68) concordance for the same samples. Importantly, the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR. We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WA1/2020), and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR. RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-qPCR including isothermal amplification, speed (<30 min), reduced costs, and similar sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3201414624,"The role of the cerebellum in predictive motor control and coordination has been thoroughly studied during movements of a single body part. In the real world, however, actions are often more complex. Here, we show that a small area in the rostral anterior interpositus nucleus (rAIN) of the mouse cerebellum is responsible for generating a predictive motor synergy that serves to protect the eye by precisely coordinating muscles of the eyelid, neck, and forelimb. Within the rAIN region, we discovered a new functional category of neurons with unique properties specialized for control of motor synergies. These neurons integrated inhibitory cutaneous inputs from multiple parts of the body, and their activity was correlated with the vigor of the defensive motor synergy on a trial-by-trial basis. We propose that some regions of the cerebellum are organized in poly-somatotopic ""action maps"" to reduce dimensionality and simplify motor control during ethologically relevant behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3199738962,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) fulfills various physiological roles that are unrelated to its glycolytic function. However, to date, the nonglycolytic function of GAPDH in trypanosomal parasites is absent from the literature. Exosomes secreted from Leishmania, like entire parasites, were found to have a significant impact on macrophage cell signaling and function, indicating cross talk with the host immune system. In this study, we demonstrate that the Leishmania GAPDH (LmGAPDH) protein is highly enriched within the extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted during infection. To understand the function of LmGAPDH in EVs, we generated control, overexpressed, half-knockout (HKO), and complement cell lines. HKO cells displayed lower virulence compared with control cells when macrophages and BALB/c mice were infected with them, implying a crucial role for LmGAPDH in Leishmania infection and disease progression. Furthermore, upon infection of macrophages with HKO mutant Leishmania and its EVs, despite no differences in TNFA mRNA expression, there was a considerable increase in TNF-α protein expression compared with control, overexpressed, and complement parasites as determined by ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunoblot data. In vitro protein translation studies suggest that LmGAPDH-mediated TNF-α suppression occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, mRNA binding assays also verified that LmGAPDH binds to the AU-rich 3'-UTR region of TNFA mRNA, limiting its production. Together, these findings confirmed that the LmGAPDH contained in EVs inhibits TNF-α expression in macrophages during infection via posttranscriptional repression."
https://openalex.org/W3199977629,"Background Girls and women subjected to female genital cutting (FGC) risk experiencing obstetrical, gynecological, sexual, and psychological health problems. Therefore, Norway has established low-threshold specialized healthcare services where girls and women with FGC-related health problems can directly seek medical attention. Nevertheless, we lack data about access to these services, especially for non-maternity-related purposes. In this article, we explore experiences of seeking medical attention for health problems that are potentially FGC-related, aiming to identify factors that hinder or facilitate access to FGC-specialized services. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in three Norwegian cities employing semi-structured repeat interviews with 26 girls and women subjected to FGC, participant observation, and three validation focus group discussions with 17 additional participants. We thematically analyzed the data and approached access as a dynamic process of interactions between individuals and the healthcare system that lasts from an initial perception of need until reception of healthcare appropriate to that need. Findings We identified several barriers to healthcare, including 1) uncertainty about FGC as a cause of experienced health problems, 2) unfamiliarity with FGC-specialized services, 3) lack of assessment by general practitioners of FGC as a potential cause of health problems, and 4) negative interactions with healthcare providers. In contrast, factors facilitating healthcare included: 1) receiving information on FGC-related health problems and FGC-specialized services from a non-profit immigrant organization, 2) referral to gynecologists with good knowledge of FGC, and 3) positive interactions with healthcare providers. Conclusion Assessing whether FGC is the cause for experienced health problems requires diagnostic competency and should not be left entirely to the patients. We recommend that Norwegian policymakers acknowledge the central role of GPs in the clinical management of patients with FGC-related health problems and provide them with comprehensive training on FGC."
https://openalex.org/W3200128766,"Greatly simplified ecosystems are often neglected for biodiversity studies. However, these simplified systems dominate in many regions of the world, and a lack of understanding of what shapes species occurrence in these systems can have consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services at a massive scale. In Fennoscandia, ~90% of the boreal forest (~21Mha) is structurally simplified with little knowledge of how forest structural elements shape the occurrence and diversity of for example epiphytic lichens in these managed forests. One form of structural simplification is the reduction of the number and frequency of different tree species. As many lichen species have host tree preferences, it is particularly likely that this simplification has a huge effect on the lichen community in managed forests. In a 40–70 years old boreal forest in Sweden, we therefore related the occurrence and richness of all observed epiphytic lichens to the host tree species and beta and gamma lichen diversity at the forest stand level to the stand’s tree species composition and stem diameter. Picea abies hosted the highest lichen richness followed by Pinus sylvestris , Quercus robur , Alnus glutinosa , Betula spp., and Populus tremula . However, P . tremula hosted twice as many uncommon species as any of the other tree species. Stand level beta and gamma diversity was twice as high on stands with four compared to one tree species, and was highest when either coniferous or deciduous trees made up 40–50% of the trees. The stem diameter was positively related to lichen richness at the tree and stand level, but negatively to beta diversity. For biodiversity, these findings imply that leaving a few trees of a different species during forest thinning is unlikely as effective as combining life-boat trees for endangered species with an even tree species mixture."

We recruited 35 participants with LBP (LBP group; 26 males, 9 females) and 20 healthy controls (HC group) via posters at our hospital. The task required lifting an object. We used a 3D motion capture system to calculate the peak angular velocity of trunk flexion and extension during a lifting task. Pain-related factors for the LBP group were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain intensity over the past 4 weeks and during the task, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20). We compared kinematic variables between groups with a generalized linear mixed model and investigated the relationship between kinematic variables, VAS scores, and psychological factors by performing a mediation analysis.The peak angular velocity of trunk extension showed significant main effects on the group factors (LBP group vs. HC group) and their interactions; the value of the kinematic variable was lower at Trial 1 in the LBP group. No LBP participant reported pain during the experiment. The mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between the VAS score for pain intensity over the past 4 weeks and the peak angular velocity of trunk extension in the first trial was completely mediated by the TSK (complete mediation model, 95% bootstrapped CI: 0.07-0.56).Individuals with LBP had reduced trunk extension during a lifting task. Generalized fear of movement-related pain may contribute to such impaired trunk movement. Our findings suggest that intervention to ameliorate fear of movement may be needed to improve LBP-associated disability."
https://openalex.org/W3201315595,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are promising therapeutic tools in regenerative medicine because they possess self-renewal, differentiation and immunomodulatory capacities. After isolation, ASCs are passaged multiple times in vitro passages to obtain a sufficient amount of cells for clinical applications. During this time-consuming procedure, ASCs become senescent and less proliferative, compromising their clinical efficacy. Here, we sought to investigate how in vitro passages impact ASC proliferation/senescence and expression of immune regulatory proteins. MicroRNAs are pivotal regulators of ASC physiology. Particularly, miR-200c is known to maintain pluripotency and targets the immune checkpoint Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). We therefore investigated its involvement in these critical characteristics of ASCs during in vitro passages. We found that when transiently expressed, miR-200c-3p promotes proliferation, maintains stemness, and contrasts senescence in late passaged ASCs. Additionally, this miRNA modulates PD-L1 and Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO1) expression, thus most likely interfering with the immunoregulatory capacity of ASCs. Based on our results, we suggest that expression of miR-200c-3p may prime ASC towards a self-renewing phenotype by improving their in vitro expansion. Contrarily, its inhibition is associated with senescence, reduced proliferation and induction of immune regulators. Our data underline the potential use of miR-200c-3p as a switch for ASCs reprogramming and their clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W3200368200,"The transcription factors PAX5, IKZF1, and EBF1 are frequently mutated in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We demonstrate that compound heterozygous loss of multiple genes critical for B and T cell development drives transformation, including Pax5+/-xEbf1+/-, Pax5+/-xIkzf1+/-, and Ebf1+/-xIkzf1+/- mice for B-ALL, or Tcf7+/-xIkzf1+/- mice for T-ALL. To identify genetic defects that cooperate with Pax5 and Ebf1 compound heterozygosity to initiate leukemia, we performed a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon screen that identified cooperating partners including gain-of-function mutations in Stat5b (~65%) and Jak1 (~68%), or loss-of-function mutations in Cblb (61%) and Myb (32%). These findings underscore the role of JAK/STAT5B signaling in B cell transformation and demonstrate roles for loss-of-function mutations in Cblb and Myb in transformation. RNA-Seq studies demonstrated upregulation of a PDK1>SGK3>MYC pathway; treatment of Pax5+/-xEbf1+/- leukemia cells with PDK1 inhibitors blocked proliferation in vitro. In addition, we identified a conserved transcriptional gene signature between human and murine leukemias characterized by upregulation of myeloid genes, most notably involving the GM-CSF pathway, that resemble a B cell/myeloid mixed-lineage leukemia. Thus, our findings identify multiple mechanisms that cooperate with defects in B cell transcription factors to generate either progenitor B cell or mixed B/myeloid-like leukemias."

In the present paper, an “MCHP platform” (MCHP was an acronym for Monte Carlo simulations + Human Phantoms) was proposed to provide assistance to the students through visualization. The platform involved Monte Carlo simulations of interactions between ionizing radiations and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) adult male human phantom. As an example to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed MCHP platform, the present paper investigated the variation of the absorbed photon dose per photon from a 137 Cs source in three selected organs, namely, brain, spine and thyroid of an adult male for concrete and lead shields with varying thicknesses. The results were interesting but not readily comprehensible without direct visualization. Graphical visualization snapshots as well as video clips of real time interactions between the photons and the human phantom were presented for the involved cases, and the results were explained with the help of such snapshots and video clips. It is envisaged that, if the platform is found useful and effective by the readers, the readers can also propose examples to be gradually added onto this platform in future, with the ultimate goal of enhancing students’ understanding and learning the concepts in an undergraduate nuclear radiation physics course or a related course."
https://openalex.org/W3201378665,"Context Aphasia is a post-stroke condition that can dramatically impact a person with aphasia’s (PWA) communication abilities. To date, few if any studies have considered the cost and cost-effectiveness of functional change in aphasia nor considered measures of patient’s value for aphasia treatment. Objective To assess the cost, cost-effectiveness, and perceived value associated with improved functional communication in individuals receiving telerehabilitation treatment for aphasia. Design Twenty PWA completed between 5 and 12 telehealth rehabilitation sessions of 45–60 minutes within a 6-week time frame using a Language-Oriented Treatment (LOT) designed to address a range of language issues among individuals with aphasia. National Outcomes Measures (NOMS) comprehension and verbal expression and the ASHA Quality of Communication Life (QCL) were completed prior to and at the completion of rehabilitation to obtain baseline and treatment measures. Results Age, education, and race are significantly correlated with improvement in the NOMS verbal expression. African Americans (OR = 2.0917) are twice as likely as Whites to experience improvement after treatment. The likelihood of improvement also increases with each additional year of education (OR = 1.002) but decrease with age (OR = 0.9463). A total of 15 PWA showed improvement in NOMS comprehension and nine patients showed improvement in NOMS verbal expression. Improving patients attended between five and 12 treatment sessions. The average cost of improvement in NOMS comprehension was $1,152 per patient and NOMS verbal expression was $1,128 per patient with individual treatment costs varying between $540 and $1,296. However, on average, the monetary equivalent in patient’s improved QCL was between $1,790.39 to $3,912,54—far exceeding the financial cost of treatment. Conclusions When measuring the functional improvement of patients with aphasia, patient’s quality of communication life received from treatment exceeded financial cost of services provided."
https://openalex.org/W3201469048,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. Most countries employed measures to prevent spread of Covid-19 infection which include shielding, quarantine, lockdown, travel restrictions, physical distancing and the use of personal protective equipment. This study was carried out to assess the change in patient attendance and the efficacy of newly implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on services at the Lanka Hospital Blood Cancer Centre (LHBCC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Methodology Telephone consultation, infection control, personal protective measures and emergency admission policy were implemented with the aim of having a Covid-19 free ward and to prevent cross-infections. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 1399 patient episodes (in-patient care or day-case review). We analysed patients treated as in-patient as well as day-case basis between 01 st April 2020 and 31 st December 2020. Results There were 977 day-case based episodes and 422 in-patient based episodes. There was a 14% drop in episode numbers compared to same period in 2019. There was no cross infection and no patients with Covid-19 related symptoms or positive test results entered the LHBCC during the study period. Conclusion Services in blood cancer care were maintained to prevent late stage presentation and adverse outcome. Measures implemented to prevent Covid-19 were effective to allow continuation of treatment. This study highlights the importance of implementing strict protocols, clinical screening, use of appropriate personal protective equipment in delivering blood cancer care during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the only documented study relating to outcome and successful applicability of measures to prevent spread of Covid-19 infection and maintaining services among blood cancer patients in Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W3199551313,"Background Time of day has been associated with variations in certain clinical practices such as cancer screening rates. In this study, we assessed how more general process measures of physician activity, particularly rates of diagnostic test ordering and diagnostic assessments, might be affected by time of day. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 3,342 appointments by 20 attending physicians at five outpatient clinics, matching appointments by physician and comparing the average diagnostic tests ordered and average diagnoses assessed per appointment in the first hour of the day versus the last hour of the day. Statistical analyses used sign tests, two-sample t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, Kruskal Wallis tests, and multivariate linear regression. Results Examining physicians individually, four and six physicians, respectively, had statistically significant first- versus last-hour differences in the number of diagnostic tests ordered and number of diagnoses assessed per patient visit ( p ≤ 0.04). As a group, 16 of 20 physicians ordered more tests on average in the first versus last hour ( p = 0.012 for equal chance to order more in each time period). Substantial intra-clinic heterogeneity was found in both outcomes for four of five clinics ( p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions There is some statistical evidence on an individual and group level to support the presence of time-of-day effects on the number of diagnostic tests ordered per patient visit. These findings suggest that time of day may be a factor influencing fundamental physician behavior and processes. Notably, many physicians exhibited significant variation in the primary outcomes compared to same-specialty peers. Additional work is necessary to clarify temporal and inter-physician variation in the outcomes of interest."
https://openalex.org/W3129953726,"By combining the discrete element method (DEM) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this study proposes a three-dimensional CFD-DEM fluid-solid coupling microscopic computational model for analyzing the micromechanisms of instability and failure in a coal-bearing soil slope during rainfall. The CFD-DEM fluid-solid coupling model indicated that the main failure mode of the coal-bearing soil slopes was rainwater washing, and the slope sliding surface was predicted as an approximately linear segment. The adaptability of this numerical method was verified by comparing its results with those of rain-washed slopes in an outdoor model test. Rainfall changed the microscopic parameters such as the force chain, coordination number, and porosity of the slope soil particles. The porosity of the slope's top particles increased from 0.35 in the initial state to 0.80 in the unstable state. This change was directly related to the macroscopic mechanics of the slope soil. By analyzing the changes in the microscopic parameters of the particles, the failure evolution law of the coal-bearing soil slopes during rainfall was explored from a microscopic perspective. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for the protection design and construction of coal-bearing soil slopes in the region but can also analyze macroscopic mechanical laws of discrete media from a micro-macro perspective in geotechnical engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3199451161,"The left-behind phenomenon, caused by parent out-migration, has become a common social issue and might lead to long-term and potential risks for children in rural areas of China. It is important to investigate the effect of social interaction on prefrontal activation of left-behind children in China because of possible effects of parent out-migration on children's social cognition. We recruited 81 rural Chinese preschoolers aged 52-76 months (mean = 64.98 ± 6.321 months) preschoolers with three different statuses of parental out-migration (including non-, partially, and completely left-behind children). Using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), we compared behavior and brain activation and in three groups (non-, partially-, completely-left-behind children) under two different social interaction conditions (child-teacher and child-stranger situation). Results revealed that initiating joint attention (IJA) may evoke higher brain activation than responding to joint attention (RJA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially in the case of initiating joint attention with the stranger. In addition, the activation of joint attention was positively correlated with children's language score, cognitive flexibility, and facial expression recognition. More importantly, partially-left-behind children evoked higher brain activation in the IJA condition and presented a higher language level than completely/non-left-behind children. The current study provides insight into the neural basis of left-behind children's development and revealed for the first time that family economic level and left-behind status may contribute to the lower social cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3200025651,"Introduction Tuberculosis screening of people living with human immunodeficiency virus is an intervention recommended by the WHO to control the dual epidemic of TB and HIV. The extent to which the intervention is adhered to by the HIV healthcare providers (fidelity) determines the intervention’s effectiveness as measured by patient outcomes, but literature on fidelity is scarce. This study assessed provider implementation fidelity to national guidelines on TB screening at HIV clinics in Ghana. Methods It was a cross-sectional study that used structured questionnaires to gather data, involving 226 of 243 HIV healthcare providers in 27 HIV clinics across Ghana. The overall fidelity score comprised sixteen items with a maximum score of 48 grouped into three components of the screening intervention (TB diagnosis, TB awareness and TB symptoms questionnaire). Simple summation of item scores was done to determine fidelity score per provider. In this paper, we define the level of fidelity as low if the scores were below the median score and were otherwise categorized as high. Background factors potentially associated with implementation fidelity level were assessed using cluster-based logistic regression. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of association. Results Of the 226 healthcare providers interviewed, 60% (135) were females with a mean age of 34.5 years (SD = 8.3). Most of them were clinicians [63% (142)] and had post-secondary non-tertiary education [62% (141)]. Overall, 53% (119) of the healthcare providers were categorized to have implemented the intervention with high fidelity. Also, 56% (126), 53% (120), and 59% (134) of the providers implemented the TB diagnosis, TB awareness and TB symptoms questionnaire components respectively with high fidelity. After adjusting for cluster effect, female providers (AOR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.09–5.10, p = &lt;0.029), those with tertiary education (AOR = 4.31, 95%CI: 2.12–9.10, p = 0.040), and clinicians (AOR = 1.78, 95%CI: 1.07–3.50, p = 0.045) were more likely to adhere to the guidelines compared to their counterparts. Conclusion The number of providers with fidelity scores above the median was marginally greater (6%) than the number with fidelity score below the median. Similarly, for each of the components, the number of providers with fidelity scores higher than the median was marginally higher. This could explain the existing fluctuations in the intervention outcomes in Ghana. We found gender, profession and education were associated with provider implementation fidelity. To improve fidelity level among HIV healthcare providers, and realize the aims of the TB screening intervention among PLHIV in Ghana, further training on implementing all components of the intervention is critical."
https://openalex.org/W3201245820,"The emergence of the diagonal of open/dry vegetations, including Chaco, Cerrado and Caatinga, is suggested to have acted as a dispersal barrier for terrestrial organisms by fragmenting a single large forest that existed in South America into the present Atlantic and Amazon forests. Here we tested the hypothesis that the expansion of the South American diagonal of open/dry landscapes acted as a vicariant process for forest lanceheads of the genus Bothrops , by analyzing the temporal range dynamics of those snakes. We estimated ancestral geographic ranges of the focal lancehead clade and its sister clade using a Bayesian dated phylogeny and the BioGeoBEARS package. We compared nine Maximum Likelihood models to infer ancestral range probabilities and their related biogeographic processes. The best fitting models (DECTS and DIVALIKETS) recovered the ancestor of our focal clade in the Amazon biogeographic region of northwestern South America. Vicariant processes in two different subclades resulted in disjunct geographic distributions in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. Dispersal processes must have occurred mostly within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest and not between them. Our results suggest the fragmentation of a single ancient large forest into the Atlantic and Amazon forests acting as a driver of vicariant processes for the snake lineage studied, highlighting the importance of the diagonal of open/dry landscapes in shaping distribution patterns of terrestrial biota in South America."

Despite the widely utilization, the minimum effective concentration for 90% patients (MEC 90 ) of ropivacaine for CEB remains unknown. Objective To estimate MEC of ropivacaine for CEB in anorectal surgery. Design A prospective dose-finding study using biased coin design up-and-down sequential method. Setting Operating room and postoperative recovery area of Chengdu Shangjin Nanfu Hospital, from October 2019 to January 2020. Patients 50 males and 51 females scheduled for anorectal surgery. Interventions We conducted two independent biased coin design up-and down trials by genders. The concentration of ropivacaine administered to the first patient of male and female were 0.25% with fixed volume of 14ml for male and 12ml for female patients based on our previous study. In case of failure, the concentration was increased by 0.05% in the next subject. Otherwise, the next subject was randomized to a concentration 0.05% less with a probability of 0.11, or the same concentration with a probability of 0.89. Success was defined as complete sensory blockade of perineal area 15 min after the block evidenced by the presence of a lax anal sphincter and pain-free surgery. Main outcome measures The MEC of ropivacaine to achieve a successful CEB in 90%(MEC 90 ) of the patients. Results The MEC 90 of ropivacaine for CEB were estimated to be 0.35% (95% CI 0.29 to 0.4%) for male and 0.353% (95%CI 0.22 to 0.4%) for female. By extrapolation to MEC in 99% of subjects (MEC99) and pooled adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) adjusted responses, it would be optimal to choose 0.4% ropivacaine with a volume of 14ml for male and 12ml for female. Conclusions A concentration of 0.35% ropivacaine with a volume of 14ml provided a successful CEB in 90% of the male patients, while 0.353% ropivacaine with a volume of 12ml provided a successful CEB in 90% of the female patients. A concentration of 0.4% and a volume of 14ml for male and 12 ml for female would be successful in 99% of the patients. Trial registration Chictr.org.cn identifier: No. ChiCTR 1900024315."

Ghana introduced the universal HBV vaccination in the national Expanded Programme on Immunization in 2002. The current study sought to determine the sero-protection rate and the prevalence of HBV infection among fully vaccinated children in the West Gonja District in the Savanna Region of Ghana. This cross-sectional study recruited three hundred and fifty (350) fully vaccinated children who visited West Gonja Catholic Hospital from September to December 2019 for healthcare. Structured questionnaires were administered to obtain information on the demographics. The clinical history of the participants was obtained from the hospital records. Sera were separated from 2-5ml of blood sample collected from each participant after informed consent had been sought from their parents/guardians. Sera were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc using ELISA. Samples positive for HBsAg or anti-HBc were tested for HBV DNA by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. The overall sero-protection rate (anti-HBs titers ≥ 10 mIU/mL) among the studied participants was 56% with anti-HBs geometric mean titer (GMT) of 95.7 mIU/mL (± 6.0; 95% CI) compared with GMT of 2.8 mIU/mL (± 0.2; 95% CI) among non-seroprotected participants. There was no statistically significant difference in sero-protection rate between males and females (p-value = 0.93) and in relation to age (p-value = 0.20). The prevalence of HBV infection among studied participants as determined by the HBV DNA/HBsAg positivity was 1.4% while anti-HBc sero-positivity was 2%. Even though the sero-protection rate and HBV infection rate reported in the current study compares with that of other international studies further studies need to be conducted to understand the factors related to sero-protection and HBV infection rate in the Savanna Region of Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3199940960,"The field of synthetic biology is increasingly being positioned as a key driver of a more sustainable, bio-based economy, and has seen rapid industry growth over the past 15 years. In this paper we undertake an exploratory investigation of the relationship between sustainability and synthetic biology, identifying and analyzing sustainability-related language on the public websites of 24, US-based synthetic biology companies. We observe that sustainability is a visible part of the self-presentation of the nascent synthetic biology industry, explicitly mentioned by 18 of the 24 companies. The dominant framing of sustainability on these company websites emphasizes environmental gains and “free-market” approaches to sustainability, with little explicit mention of social dimensions of sustainability such as access, justice or intergenerational equity. Furthermore, the model of sustainability presented focuses on incremental transition towards environmental sustainability through direct substitution of products and processes using bioengineered alternatives ( n = 16 companies), with no change in societal consumption or policy frameworks required in order to see sustainability gains. One-third of the companies analyzed ( n = 8) mention “nature” on their websites, variously framing it as a resource to be managed or as a source of inspiration; whether the latter signals a potentially more complex relationship with nature than advanced free-market models of sustainability remains to be seen. As the synthetic biology industry begins to grow in size and visibility, we suggest this is an opportune time for the community to engage in explicit deliberation about its approach to sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3200029073,"Kamlang Suea Khrong (KSK) crude drug, a traditional Thai medicine used for oral tonic and analgesic purposes, is obtained from three origins: the inner stem bark of Betula alnoides (BA) or the stems of Strychnos axillaris (SA) or Ziziphus attopensis (ZA). According to the previous reports, SA contains strychnine-type alkaloids that probably cause poisoning; however, only organoleptic approaches are insufficient to differentiate SA from the other plant materials. To ensure the botanical origin of KSK crude drug, powerful and reliable tools are desperately needed. Therefore, molecular and chemical identification methods, DNA barcoding and thin-layer chromatography (TLC), were investigated. Reference databases, i.e., the ITS region and phytochemical profile of the authentic plant species, were conducted. In case of molecular analysis, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on species-specific primers was applied. Regarding species-specific primers designation, the suitability of three candidate barcode regions (ITS, ITS1, and ITS2) was evaluated by genetic distance using K2P model. ITS2 presented the highest interspecific variability was verified its discrimination power by tree topology. Accordingly, ITS2 was used to create primers that successfully specified plant species of authentic samples. For chemical analysis, TLC with toluene:ethyl acetate:ammonia (1:9:0.025) and hierarchical clustering were operated to identify the authentic crude drugs. The developed multiplex PCR and TLC methods were then applied to identify five commercial KSK crude drugs (CK1-CK5). Both methods correspondingly indicated that CK1-CK2 and CK3-CK5 were originated from BA and ZA, respectively. Molecular and chemical approaches are convenient and effective identification methods that can be performed for the routine quality-control of the KSK crude drugs for consumer reliance. According to chemical analysis, the results indicated BA, SA, and ZA have distinct chemical profiles, leading to differences in pharmacological activities. Consequently, further scientific investigations are required to ensure the quality and safety of Thai ethnobotanical medicine known as KSK."
https://openalex.org/W3200062602,"Background Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapy is widely used in the management of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, up to a third of patients do not respond to induction therapy and another third of patients lose response over time. To aid patient stratification, polygenetic risk scores have been identified as predictors of response to anti-TNFα therapy. We aimed to replicate the association between polygenetic risk scores and response to anti-TNFα therapy in an independent cohort of patients, to establish its clinical validity. Materials and methods Primary non-response, primary response, durable response and loss of response to anti-TNFα therapy was retrospectively assessed for each patient using stringent definitions. Genome wide genotyping was performed and previously described polygenetic risk scores for primary non-response and durable response were calculated. We compared polygenetic risk scores between patients with primary response and primary non-response, and between patients with durable response and loss of response, using separate analyses for CD and UC. Results Out of 334 patients with CD, 15 (4%) patients met criteria for primary non-response, 221 (66%) for primary response, 115 (34%) for durable response and 35 (10%) for loss of response. Out of 112 patients with UC, 12 (11%) met criteria for primary non-response, 68 (61%) for primary response, 19 (17%) for durable response and 20 (18%) for loss of response. No significant differences in polygenetic risk scores were found between primary non-responders and primary responders, and between durable responders and loss of responders. Conclusions We could not replicate the previously reported association between polygenetic risk scores and response to anti-TNFα therapy in an independent cohort of patients with CD or UC. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to use polygenetic risk scores to predict response to anti-TNFα therapy in patients with IBD."

A total of 46 studies, including 11,558 patients were included in this study. Here, we showed that TRIM59 was significantly upregulated in 15 type of human solid tumors in comparison to their adjacent tissues. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) results provided further evidence for the use of TRIM59 as a potential tumor diagnosis biomarker. Overall survival (OS) was compared between TRIM59 high expression and low expression groups. High expression of TRIM59 indicated a poor prognosis in multiple solid tumors. Taken together, these analyses showed that TRIM59 was upregulated in various types of tumors and had the potential to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in human solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3201244906,"Pseudoextinction analyses, which simulate extinction in extant taxa, use molecular phylogenetics to assess the accuracy of morphological phylogenetics. Previous pseudoextinction analyses have shown a failure of morphological phylogenetics to place some individual placental orders in the correct superordinal clade. Recent work suggests that the inclusion of hypothetical ancestors of extant placental clades, estimated by ancestral state reconstructions of morphological characters, may increase the accuracy of morphological phylogenetic analyses. However, these studies reconstructed direct hypothetical ancestors for each extant taxon based on a well-corroborated molecular phylogeny, which is not possible for extinct taxa that lack molecular data. It remains to be determined if pseudoextinct taxa, and by proxy extinct taxa, can be accurately placed when their immediate hypothetical ancestors are unknown. To investigate this, we employed molecular scaffolds with the largest available morphological data set for placental mammals. Each placental order was sequentially treated as pseudoextinct by exempting it from the molecular scaffold and recoding soft morphological characters as missing for all its constituent species. For each pseudoextinct data set, we omitted the pseudoextinct taxon and performed a parsimony ancestral state reconstruction to obtain hypothetical predicted ancestors. Each pseudoextinct order was then evaluated in seven parsimony analyses that employed combinations of fossil taxa, hypothetical predicted ancestors, and a molecular scaffold. In treatments that included fossils, hypothetical predicted ancestors, and a molecular scaffold, only 8 of 19 pseudoextinct placental orders (42%) retained the same interordinal placement as on the molecular scaffold. In treatments that included hypothetical predicted ancestors but not fossils or a scaffold, only four placental orders (21%) were recovered in positions that are congruent with the scaffold. These results indicate that hypothetical predicted ancestors do not increase the accuracy of pseudoextinct taxon placement when the immediate hypothetical ancestor of the taxon is unknown. Hypothetical predicted ancestors are not a panacea for morphological phylogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W3199609769,"Our daily activities require vigilance. Therefore, it is useful to externally monitor and predict our vigilance level using a straightforward method. It is known that the vigilance level is linked to pupillary fluctuations via Locus Coeruleus and Norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. However, previous methods of estimating long-term vigilance require monitoring pupillary fluctuations at rest over a long period. We developed a method of predicting the short-term vigilance level by monitoring pupillary fluctuation for a shorter period consisting of several seconds. The LC activity also fluctuates at a timescale of seconds. Therefore, we hypothesized that the short-term vigilance level could be estimated using pupillary fluctuations in a short period and quantified their amplitude as the Micro-Pupillary Unrest Index (M-PUI). We found an intra-individual trial-by-trial positive correlation between Reaction Time (RT) reflecting the short-term vigilance level and M-PUI in the period immediately before the target onset in a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). This relationship was most evident when the fluctuation was smoothed by a Hanning window of approximately 50 to 100 ms (including cases of down-sampled data at 100 and 50 Hz), and M-PUI was calculated in the period up to one or two seconds before the target onset. These results suggest that M-PUI can monitor and predict fluctuating levels of vigilance. M-PUI is also useful for examining pupillary fluctuations in a short period for elucidating the psychophysiological mechanisms of short-term vigilance."

Zhejiang, ranked fourth highest in COVID-19 incidence, is located in the Yangtze River Delta region of southeast China. This study was undertaken to identify the space-time characteristics of COVID-19 in Zhejiang.Data on COVID-19 cases in Zhejiang Province from January to July 2020 were obtained from this network system. Individual information on cases and deaths was imported, and surveillance information, including demographic characteristics and geographic and temporal distributions, was computed by the system. The Knox test was used to identify possible space-time interactions to test whether cases that are close in distance were also close in time. Network analysis was performed to determine the relationship among the cases in a transmission community and to try to identify the key nodes.In total, 1475 COVID-19 cases and 1 fatal case were reported from January to July 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. Most of the cases occurred before February 15th, which accounted for 90.10%. The imported cases increased and became the main risk in Zhejiang Province after February 2020. The risk areas showed strong heterogeneity according to the Knox test. The areas at short distances within 1 kilometer and at brief periods within 5 days presented relatively high risk. The numbers of subcommunities for the four clusters were 12, 9, 6 and 4. There was obvious heterogeneity in the modularity of subcommunities. The maximum values of the node centrality for the four clusters were 2.9474, 4.3706, 4.1080 and 2.7500.COVID-19 was brought under control over a short period in Zhejiang Province. Imported infections from outside of mainland China then became a new challenge. The effects of spatiotemporal interaction exhibited interval heterogeneity. The characteristics of transmission showed short range and short term risks. The importance to the cluster of each case was detected, and the key patients were identified. It is suggested that we should focus on key patients in complex conditions and in situations with limited control resources."
https://openalex.org/W3200603243,"Background Myocardial infarction (MI) is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease globally and is considered a public health problem. In Peru, MI is the second leading cause of death at the national level, with a mortality rate that exceeds 10% in the hospital setting. The study aims to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in tertiary care facilities belonging to the Peruvian public health system. Methods and analysis This will be a prospective, observational, multicenter study, with baseline and two follow-up assessments: at admission to the health service, and 30 days and 12 months after admission. This multicenter study will be conducted in 27 hospitals located in the main cities of Peru. The patients included in the study will be over 18 years of age, of either sex, and will have been admitted to the health facility with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the cumulative in-hospital mortality of patients at 30 days and 12 months of follow-up, and the log-rank test will be used to evaluate the differences between the survival curves between reperfused and non-reperfused patients. Subsequently, to evaluate the risk factors for successful reperfusion and cardiovascular adverse events, generalized linear models of the binomial family with log link function will be used to estimate the bivariate and multivariate relative risk (RR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals. This project was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the National Cardiovascular Institute (Instituto Nacional Cardiovascular “Carlos Alberto Peschiera Carrillo”—INCOR [in Spanish]; Approval report 21/2019-CEI). Discussion Among the strengths, the observational design will allow the inclusion of a large sample of patients, which will significantly contribute to the knowledge base on STEMI in Peru. It should be noted that this study is the first to examine the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of STEMI in high-resolution hospital centers in Peru with follow-up one year after the event, providing knowledge of these observable characteristics in daily clinical routine. Likewise, the multicenter nature of the study will increase the external validity of the findings. In terms of limitations, the observational design of the study can only describe associations and not causality. Furthermore, since data from medical records will be used, there could be imprecision in the data."

https://openalex.org/W3199904131,"Vibroarthrography measures joint sounds caused by sliding of the joint surfaces over each other. and can be affected by joint health, load and type of movement. Since both warm-up and muscle fatigue lead to local changes in the knee joint (e.g., temperature increase, lubrication of the joint, muscle activation), these may impact knee joint sounds. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of warm-up and muscle fatiguing exercise on knee joint sounds during an activity of daily living. Seventeen healthy, physically active volunteers (25.7 ± 2 years, 7 males) performed a control and an intervention session with a wash-out phase of one week. The control session consisted of sitting on a chair, while the intervention session contained a warm-up (walking on a treadmill) followed by a fatiguing exercise (modified sit-to-stand) protocol. Knee sounds were recorded by vibroarthrography (at the medial tibia plateau and at the patella) at three time points in each session during a sit-to-stand movement. The primary outcome was the mean signal amplitude (MSA, dB). Differences between sessions were determined by repeated measures ANOVA with intra-individual pre-post differences for the warm-up and for the muscle fatigue effect. We found a significant difference for MSA at the medial tibia plateau (intervention: mean 1.51 dB, standard deviation 2.51 dB; control: mean -1.28 dB, SD 2.61 dB; F = 9.5; p = .007; η 2 = .37) during extension (from sit to stand) after the warm-up. There was no significant difference for any parameter after the muscle fatiguing exercise (p &gt; .05). The increase in MSA may mostly be explained by an increase in internal knee load and joint friction. However, neuromuscular changes may also have played a role. It appears that the muscle fatiguing exercise has no impact on knee joint sounds in young, active, symptom-free participants during sit to stand."

In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), visual deprivation-dependent modulation of OPCs has not been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that undifferentiated OPCs developmentally peaked around postnatal day (P) 25, and binocular enucleation (BE) from the time of eye opening (P14-15) elevated symmetrically-divided undifferentiated OPCs in a reversible G0/G1 state even more at the bottom lamina of the cortex by reducing maturing oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells. Experiments using the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling inhibitor cyclopamine in vivo suggested that Shh signaling pathway was involved in the BE-induced undifferentiation process. The undifferentiated OPCs then differentiated within 5 days, independent of the experience, becoming mostly quiescent cells in control mice, while altering the mode of sister cell symmetry and forming quiescent as well as maturing cells in the enucleated mice. At P50, BE increased mature OLs via symmetric and asymmetric modes of cell segregation, resulting in more populated mature OLs at the bottom layer of the cortex. These data suggest that fourth postnatal week, corresponding to the early critical period of ocular dominance plasticity, is a developmentally sensitive period for OPC state changes. Overall, the visual loss promoted undifferentiation at the early period, but later increased the formation of mature OLs via a change in the mode of cell type symmetry at the bottom layer of mouse V1."

The present study was aimed to explore the need of individualization and optimization of the dose of anti-gout medications among gout patients. Methods Cross-sectional study was carried out among 384 randomly selected new gout patients visiting two gout treatment centers at Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Nepal and who were taking antigout medications. Patients not taking anti-gout medications and not showing willingness to participate were excluded. The eGFR was calculated with the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation (2009). Doses to be individualized were decided based on the Renal Drug Handbook and verified with the BNF 80. Data were analyzed via R 4.0.3 by applying the multinomial logistic regression to analyze statistical significance of risk with various predictors, and considering a p-value &lt;0.05 statistically significant. Comorbidities were coded as per the ICD-11 coding and medicines were coded according to the WHO Guidelines for ATC classification and DDD assignment 2020. Results The high risk of progression to CKD increased in the age range 54–63 and ≥84 years by 17.77 and 43.02 times, respectively. Also, high risk increased by 29.83 and 20.2 times for the overweight and the obese respectively. Aceclofenac 100mg was prescribed for maximum patients (30.5%). Need of dose individualization was realized in 30 patients, with maximum (7) in case of etoricoxib 90mg. Various glucocorticoids were prescribed for 36.9% patients, out of whom 3.8%required dose individualization and 15.9% patients with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, out of whom 1.3% required dose individualization. Conclusion Thirty cases required dose individualization, which was although minimal but could have meaningful impact on the clinical success of the individual patient. Based on the recommendation on dose individualization, those patients could be optimized on their therapy on future follow ups."
