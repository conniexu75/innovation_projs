https://openalex.org/W2044596347,"We have shown that the DNA sequences adjacent to the telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes are highly conserved and contain a high density of replication origins. The salient features of these telomeres can be summarized as follows. There are three moderately repetitive elements present at the telomeres: the 131 sequence (1 to 1.5 kb), the highly conserved Y sequence (5.2 kb), and the less conserved X sequence (0.3 to 3.75 kb). There is a high density of replication origins spaced about 6.7 kb apart at the telomeres. These replication origins are part of the X or the Y sequences. Some of the 131-Y repetitive units are tandemly arranged. The terminal sequence T (about 0.33 to 0.6 kb) is different from the 131, X, or Y sequences and is heterogeneous in length. The order of these sequences from the telomeric end towards the centromere is T-(Y-131)n-X-, where n ranges from 1 to no more than 4. Although these telomeric sequences are conserved among S. cerevisiae strains, they show striking divergence in certain closely related yeast species."
https://openalex.org/W2167247054,"From the nucleotide sequences of three cDNA clones of rat brain-specific mRNAs, we deduced the partial amino acid sequences of two previously unknown proteins. We raised antisera to synthetic peptides mimicking short regions of these putative brain-specific proteins, and used these sera in immunocytochemical studies to localize each protein in the brain. One protein is found in large neurons throughout the brain, asymmetrically distributed toward the dendritic pole of the cell cytoplasm, suggesting involvement in the synthesis and/or directional transport of dendritic substances. The sequence of the second protein contains pairs of basic residues similar to precursors for neurotransmitters. The protein is located in (and may be the precursor for the neurotransmitter of) a novel fiber network of major extent with ramifications in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex, and in cell bodies in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and caudate nucleus. Our approach provides a direct method for characterizing rare brain molecules which may not have been anticipated and for which there are no known functional assays."
https://openalex.org/W2027539993,"A strong immunological cross-reaction between a major glycolipid antigen of Chlamydia and the innermost (Re) core of the lipopolysaccharide of enteric bacteria was demonstrated with the aid of mutants in which the Re structure is exposed. The chlamydial glycolipid resembled the Re lipopolysaccharide in molecular size, solubility, and endotoxic properties and may thus be functionally equivalent to lipopolysaccharide, an essential and characteristic component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1503877960,"We have determined the complete structure of a glycolipid (designated lipid X) previously found to accumulate in certain Escherichia coli mutants defective in phosphatidylglycerol synthesis (Nishijima, M., and Raetz, C.R.H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7837-7844). Based on fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies, this substance is an acylated metabolite of glucosamine 1-phosphate. Lipid X of E. coli has a Mr = 711.87 as the free acid (C34H66NO12P) and contains two beta-hydroxymyristate moieties, one attached as an amide at the 2 position and the other as an ester at the 3 position of the sugar. It has free hydroxyl groups at the 4 and 6 positions, and the anomeric configuration is alpha. The structure of lipid X from E. coli closely resembles the reducing end subunit of lipid A, and it might represent a very early precursor in the biosynthesis of lipid A. To our knowledge, fatty acyl derivatives of glucosamine 1-phosphate have not been reported previously."

https://openalex.org/W1540983066,"The cytochrome b gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B was previously shown to be composed of three exons and two introns (Nobrega, F.G., and Tzagoloff, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9828-9837). In the present study nuclear respiratory deficient mutants of this strain have been screened for defects in processing of the cytochrome b pre-mRNA. Fifteen independently isolated mutants lacking cytochrome b have been assigned to a single genetic complementation group (G36). Members of this complementation group are blocked in the excision of the second intervening sequence of cytochrome b and consequently are unable to produce the mature mRNA. The wild type gene defined by this class of mutants has been named CBP2. A recombinant plasmid with the CBP2 gene has been selected from a library of wild type nuclear DNA and further subcloned by transformation of a cbp2 mutant to respiratory competency. The smallest plasmid (pG36/T5) capable of complementing cbp2 mutants and of restoring their ability to complete processing of the cytochrome b pre-mRNA has a nuclear DNA fragment of 2.6 kilobase pairs inserted at the BamHI site of the yeast vector YEp13. The sequence of the cloned DNA fragment has revealed an 1890-nucleotide-long reading frame encoding a basic protein with a molecular weight of 74,000. Deletion analysis confirms that the entire reading frame is required for complementation of cbp2 mutants. This reading frame is proposed to code for the CBP2 gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1562281848,"Adenylate cyclase in particulate extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilized either MnATP or MgATP as substrate. A mutation in the CYR1 gene, which codes for the catalytic unit of yeast adenylate cyclase (Matsumoto, K., Uno, I., and Ishikawa, T. (1983) Cell 32, 417-423), eliminated utilization of both MgATP and MnATP, indicating that a single enzyme was responsible for both activities. GTP and guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate stimulated yeast adenylate cyclase, while a GDP analog, guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), competitively inhibited this stimulation. Thermal inactivation studies distinguished putative guanine-nucleotide regulatory protein (N) from the catalytic unit (C) of yeast adenylate cyclase. Yeast N, which conferred guanine nucleotide regulation and the ability to utilize MgATP on yeast C, was quickly inactivated by incubation of particulate extracts at 30 degrees C. In contrast, yeast C, which apparently utilized MnATP as substrate in the absence of a functional N protein, resisted inactivation at 30 degrees C. These observations suggested that physically distinct protein components mediated the catalytic activity of yeast adenylate cyclase and its regulation by guanine nucleotides. These findings indicate a striking homology between the adenylate cyclase systems of S. cerevisiae and those of vertebrate cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568987948,"We have measured the movement of newly synthesized phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules from sites of intracellular synthesis to the plasma membrane in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts. Plasma membrane PE was distinguished from intracellular PE by its derivatization with an amino-reactive reagent, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, under nonpermeating conditions. Within minutes after the addition of radiolabeled precursors of PE to the culture medium, radiolabeled PE appeared at the plasma membrane. The fraction of radiolabeled PE molecules appearing at the plasma membrane increased rapidly over a 2-h period and then increased very slowly for several days to a constant specific radioactivity. By measuring the release of radiolabeled secretory proteins, we determined that the transport of newly synthesized proteins to the cell surface occurred more slowly than the transport of PE. Preincubation of cells with either cytochalasin B, cytochalasin D, colchicine, oncobendazole, sodium azide, 2-deoxyglucose, dinitrophenol, p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or monensin did not block the transport of de novo synthesized PE; however, incubation of cells in culture medium at 2 degrees C effectively halted the appearance of new PE molecules at the plasma membrane. When cells which had been incubated at 2 degrees C were warmed, PE molecules from intracellular PE pools once again began to appear at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the rapid transport of newly synthesized PE molecules to the plasma membrane occurs by a mechanism independent of that used for the transport of newly synthesized proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2125722685,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase was purified about 2,700-fold to apparent homogeneity from extracts of bovine kidney mitochondria. The kinase consists of two subunits (alpha beta) with molecular weights of 48,000 (alpha) and 45,000 (beta) as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinase activity resides in the alpha subunit. The alpha subunit is sensitive to proteolysis by chymotrypsin, whereas the beta subunit is selectively modified by trypsin. These observations, together with the results of peptide mapping, indicate that the two subunits are distinctly different proteins. It is proposed that the beta subunit is a regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1590170821,"Washed human platelets that have been separated from plasma in the presence of prostacyclin are activated by the addition of platelet activating factor (PAF). Activation (shape change, serotonin release, and aggregation) correlates closely with the formation of phosphatidic acid and the phosphorylation of a 40,000-dalton protein. Platelet shape change, formation of phosphatidic acid, and protein phosphorylation precede aggregation and are induced at lower concentrations of PAF than those required to induce release of serotonin and platelet aggregation. Platelet shape change, formation of phosphatidic acid, and protein phosphorylation induced by PAF are not affected by trifluoperazine or indomethacin. This indicates that these responses are independent of the liberation of arachidonic acid from platelet phospholipids and the metabolism of arachidonic acid via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. These responses are, however, inhibited by prostacyclin. Platelet shape change is the first measurable physiologic response to platelet agonists and may be associated with the stimulation of phospholipase C, inducing formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and its phosphorylated product, phosphatidic acid. Transient formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol may also induce the specific activation of the protein kinase C that phosphorylates a 40,000-dalton protein."
https://openalex.org/W1568846447,"We have determined the amino acid sequence of the N alpha-terminal portion of band 3, the anion transport protein of the human erythrocyte membrane. The material analyzed was a 201-residue, 23,053-Da fragment cleaved from the cytoplasmic end of band 3 by S-cyanylation. The sequence had these notable features. 1) The N alpha-terminal region was extraordinarily acidic, second only to a segment of similar size from the sigma factor of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The first 33 residues contained 6 aspartic acid and 12 glutamic acid residues, no basic residue, and a blocked N alpha-amino group. 2) The first 11 residues of the protein had a striking resemblance to the following 11 residues. 3) In contrast to the acidic N alpha-terminal third, the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the 23,053-Da fragment had a predominantly basic character. The highly acidic character of the N alpha-terminal portion of band 3 accounts for the capacity of this part of the protein to bind glycolytic enzymes in a highly electrostatic fashion, presumably through interaction with their cationic substrate-binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2069488901,Nucleotide sequences of translated regions of the trp operon in 12 wild strains of Escherichia coli reveal striking uniformity among eight strains (suggesting recent common ancestry and supporting the importance of periodic selection in natural populations) and clustered substitutions in four strains (implicating events affecting runs of nucleotides).
https://openalex.org/W2055200282,"Insulin administered to rats reliably elicits ingestion of food. To determine whether the neural mechanisms sufficient to control insulin-elicited ingestion are located in or caudal to the forebrain, decerebrate rats were treated with insulin and ingestive responses were measured. Insulin treatment produced hypoglycemia that was comparable, in magnitude and duration, in control and decerebrate rats. Decerebrate and control rats ingested significantly more sucrose solution while hypoglycemic than while normoglycemic. In contrast, insulin did not augment the water consumption of either group. These data indicate that neural systems caudal to the forebrain are sufficient to control ingestive consummatory behavior through the integration of metabolic signals generated by insulin treatment and taste afferent input from the oropharynx."
https://openalex.org/W2139813093,"The nuclear lamina is a rigid, proteinaceous layer underlying the inner nuclear membrane of eucaryotic cells. It is present in somatic cell nuclei, disappears during mitosis, and is absent from male meiotic cells. We have investigated the disappearance and reformation of the nuclear lamina during meiosis in oocytes, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We find that the status of the nuclear lamina during meiosis of oocytes differs from the reversible depolymerization seen in mitosis in two respects. First, the lamina disappears during meiotic prophase without affecting the structure of the nuclear membranes or the nuclear pores. Second, the proteins of the dissociated lamina are undetectable by immunological methods in pachytene oocytes, whereas they persist in the cytoplasm during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1551858625,"RNA polymerase was purified from rifampicin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli which exhibit altered transcription termination at the trp operon attenuator in vivo. These mutant polymerases were used to investigate transcription pausing at the trp leader pause site and transcription termination at the trp attenuator. The mutant polymerases examined in vitro mimic their in vivo termination responses; i.e. RNA polymerase isolated from a mutant which displays high transcriptional read-through of the trp operon in vivo allows greater transcriptional read-through in vitro, while RNA polymerase prepared from a mutant which has reduced read-through in vivo exhibits greater termination of transcription in vitro. The observed differences are not due to the presence of--or response to--alternate secondary structures in the trp leader transcript since deletion of the DNA segment corresponding to some of these alternate structures does not affect termination efficiency. The mutant polymerases also have comparable effects on the kinetics of transcription pausing at the trp leader pause site; the termination-deficient polymerase exhibits diminished pausing while the termination-proficient polymerase displays enhanced pausing. We suggest that this correlation reflects polymerase recognition of similar features of RNA secondary structures in the pause and termination events. In addition, since single mutational changes in RNA polymerase affect two activities, pausing and termination, it is likely that a single site or region of the polymerase is involved in both events."
https://openalex.org/W1573490182,"Vesicles were prepared from a 9:1 (mole/mol) mixture of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and the radioactively labeled phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-omega-(m-diazirinophenoxy)undecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC-I) or 1-palmitoyl-2-omega-(2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluropropionyloxy)lauroyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC-II). Rabbit liver cytochrome b5 was inserted into these vesicles spontaneously and the resulting vesicles containing the cytochrome b5 in the transferable form were photolyzed. Cytochrome b5 containing covalently cross-linked phospholipids was isolated by Sephadex LH-60 column chromatography using ethanol/formic acid as the solvent. Of the total radioactivity, 4.6% (PC-I) or 11.3% (PC-II) was linked to the protein; of the former, up to 51% was base-labile, while in the latter, 22% was base-labile. The sites of cross-linking of PC-I to the protein were investigated by fragmentation with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureas V8 protease, CNBr, and o-iodosobenzoic acid followed by Sephadex LH-60 chromatography and Edman sequencing (solid phase) of the appropriate fragments. The distribution of cross-linking was broad (Ser-104 to Met-130), showing a bell-shaped pattern with a significant peak at Ser-118. The labeling pattern is consistent with the previously proposed loop-back model for the membranous segment in the transferable form of cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1525712799,"Partial proteolytic fragmentation of the two chick oviduct progesterone receptor subunits was used to identify structural features shared by the two proteins. Both subunits can be photoaffinity labeled at their hormone-binding sites (Birnbaumer, M., Schrader, W. T., and O'Malley, B. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1637-1644) using the radioactive steroid [methyl-3H] 17 alpha, 21-dimethyl-19-nor-pregn-4,9-diene-3,20-dione. Native subunits A (Mr = 79,000) and B (Mr = 108,000) were partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, and then subjected to various mild proteolytic digestions. Labeled fragments were analyzed by fluorography after electrophoresis of the digests under denaturing conditions. Digestion patterns were characteristic for each protease tested. However, fragments from both A and B were indistinguishable for all peptides of less than Mr = 60,000. Time course studies demonstrated the sequential production of progressively smaller discrete fragments in a manner consistent with a precursor-product relationship among them and established the existence of similar structural domains resistant to proteolysis in both proteins. Autoradiographic peptide maps were obtained by 125I-labeling of pure A and B protein isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by exhaustive tryptic digestion and two-dimensional separation. These studies revealed that a significant proportion of the smaller A protein differs in its primary sequence from that of the B protein which excludes the possibility of their sharing a precursor-product relationship. We conclude that B and A subunits are separate proteins with common structural features in the native state, but with considerable amino acid sequence differences. The simplest hypothesis consistent with these findings is that B and A are the products of two separate genes which have diverged to give rise to two different but related proteins that fold in such a manner as to be almost indistinguishable by proteolytic attack of their native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1520011127,"Mycobacterium leprae in infected armadillo tissue produces extracellular phthiocerol-containing lipids in amounts well in excess of the bacterial mass. The principal component (1.38 mg in 1 g of liver, wet weight, containing 3.7 X 10(10) M. leprae bacilli) consists of a mixture of two phthiocerol homologs, 3-methoxyl-4-methyl-9, 11-dihydroxyoctacosane and 3-methoxyl-4-methyl-9, 11-dihydroxytriacontane, (formula: see text); in which the hydroxyl functions are acylated by a mixture of three 'mycocerosic acids': 2,4,6,8-tetramethylhexacosanoate, 2,4,6,8-tetramethyloctacosanoate, and 2,4,6,8-tetramethyltriacontanoate. The structures were established by saponification of the native lipid, direct probe electron impact- or chemical ionization-mass spectrometry of the phthiocerol or its permethylated derivative, and gas-liquid chromatography-electron impact-mass spectrometry of the methyl esters of the fatty acids. In addition to the previously reported M. leprae-specific triglycosylphenolicdiacyl phthiocerol (Hunter, S. W., Fujiwara, T., and Brennan, P. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 15072-15078), the extracellular products contain small amounts (about 60 micrograms/g of infected liver, wet weight) of two other phenolic glycolipids, one of which (Phenolic Glycolipid III) has been structurally elucidated, (formula: see text); assuming certain enantiomeric configurations for the sugar substituents; the R-acyl functions are identical with those in the diacylphthiocerol. Phenolic Glycolipid-III reacts in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with sera from patients with leprosy and with rabbit antisera raised against whole M. leprae. The phthiocerol-containing lipids may be synonymous with the electron transparent capsules of M. leprae, and their unreactive state may confer on them the role of passive protectors of the bacillus."

https://openalex.org/W1522979021,"Membrane preparations from rough endoplasmic reticulum of hen oviduct resemble those of dog pancreas in their capacity to translocate nascent secretory proteins into membrane vesicles present during cell-free protein synthesis. As with the dog membranes, the precursor form of human placental lactogen is transported into the vesicles and processed to the native secretory form by an associated peptidase. The oviduct microsomal membranes glycosylate nascent ovomucoid and ovalbumin in vitro. Attempts to extract the signal peptidase from these membrane vesicles revealed that it is one of the least easily solubilized proteins. A protocol for enrichment of signal peptidase was developed that took advantage of its tight association with these vesicles. These studies indicate that the enzyme has the characteristics of an integral membrane protein which remains active in membrane vesicles even after extraction with low concentrations of detergent that do not dissolve the lipid bilayer or after disruption of membrane vesicles in ice-cold 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5 (Fujiki, Y., Hubbard, A. L., Fowler, S., and Lazarow, P.B. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 93, 97-102), which releases the majority of membrane-associated proteins. Solubilization requires concentrations of nondenaturing detergents that totally dissolve the lipid bilayer. The detergent-solubilized enzyme retains the activity and the characteristic specificity of the membrane-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W2093775509,"The nucleotide sequence of the oncogene of the Rasheed strain of rat sarcoma virus was determined. The oncogene (Ra-v-ras) encodes a 29,000-dalton (p29) transforming protein. This protein is distinct from the immunologically related 21,000-dalton protein (p21) of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus in its amino terminus and in having additional mutations in its carboxyl terminus. Although the functional significance of these changes is unknown, they appear to occur only in rat sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W2095371748,"Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was applied to alter the cleavage site in the signal peptide of the major outer membrane lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. Replacing the glycine residue at the cleavage site with an alanine residue did not affect the processing of the signal peptide. However, when the same cleavage site was constructed by the deletion of the glycine residue, the signal peptide was no longer cleaved. These results indicate that stringent structural integrity at the cleavage site in the lipoprotein signal sequence is required for correct processing of prolipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1579725637,"Five nuclear mutants falling into five different complementation groups are shown to block the maturation of long form mitochondrial cob RNA at five different processing steps. At the same time they prevent complete processing of the oxi 3 RNA, thus exhibiting the same phenotype as mitochondrial box mutants (cyt b- and oxi 3-). The different nuclear factors in question have varying ranges of specificity for the removal of introns from cob RNA, from only one to at the most three introns. Two mutated nuclear elements are shown to be specific for the processing of introns present only in the long form cob gene. One such mutation shows, as expected, no deleterious effect on the processing of the short form cob RNA exchanged into the mutant via cytoduction. The role of nuclear coded factors in the possible translation or activity of introncoded products (maturases) is discussed for two mutants. Striking parallels are found between diverse polypeptide products, presumably translated from accumulated cob RNA intermediates, in pet- and mit- mutants blocked in the excision of the same intron."
https://openalex.org/W1587690483,"A complex formed between the dimeric aspartyl-tRNA synthetase from yeast (Mr congruent to 125,000) and two molecules of its cognate yeast tRNAAsp (Mr = 24,160) was crystallized using ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. The crucial parameter which governs a successful crystallization is the enzyme tRNA stoichiometry. Crystals are only obtained when the starting solution precisely contains two tRNA molecules for one enzyme molecule. It was demonstrated by electrophoresis, biological activity assays, and crystallographic data that the crystals contain the two components in the same two to one stoichiometric ratio. The crystals, of cubic shape with edges up to 0.8 mm, belong to space group 1432. The cell parameter is 354 A and the asymmetric unit contains one particle of complex. The solvent content is about 78%, higher than the values commonly observed. Although particularly soft, the quality of the crystals is suitable for x-ray diffraction studies up to 7-A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1605954889,"The formation of alternative secondary structures in the transcript of the tryptophan (trp) operon leader region regulates expression of the trp operons of Escherichia coli and other bacterial species. During in vitro transcription RNA polymerase pauses near base pair 90 after the first hairpin secondary structure in E. coli trp leader mRNA is formed. The E. coli L-factor enhances transcription pausing at this site (Farnham, P. J., Greenblatt, J., and Platt, T. (1982) Cell 29, 945-951); presumably it does so by facilitating recognition of the RNA hairpin by polymerase. We show that addition of a DNA oligomer complementary to the proximal segment of the RNA hairpin relieves transcription pausing in vitro both in the presence and absence of L-factor. The oligomer apparently interferes with formation of the RNA hairpin which we believe is recognized by polymerase as the pause signal. The oligomer also relieves pausing in L-factor-induced paused complexes, suggesting that the oligomer can disrupt a preformed secondary structure in the transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2091638583,"Ligase activity was detected in extracts of Escherichia coli, Clostridium tartarivorum, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Chromatium gracile, and Chlorobium limicola. Ligase was measured by joining of tRNA halves produced from yeast IVS-containing tRNA precursors by a yeast endonuclease. The structure of tRNATyr halves joined by an E. coli extract was examined. The ligated junction is resistant to nuclease P1 and RNAase T2 but sensitive to venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline hydrolysis, consistent with a 2',5' linkage. The nuclease-resistant junction dinucleotide comigrates with authentic (2',5') APA marker in thin-layer chromatography. The phosphate in the newly formed phosphodiester bond is derived from the pre-tRNA substrate. The widespread existence of a bacterial ligase raises the possibility of a novel class of RNA processing reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1597929214,"An inhibitor (inhibitor-1) of phosphorylase a phosphatase has been identified in rat epididymal fat pads. This heat-stable, acid-soluble protein only exhibits phosphatase inhibitory activity when it itself is phosphorylated. Inhibitor-1 in rat adipose tissue migrates at 32,000 Da on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and at 64,000 Da on gel filtration. Exposure of fat pads to insulin (1 milliunit/ml) resulted in a 50% decrease in inhibitor-1 activity, compared to control (p less than 0.001). Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) caused a 25% increase in inhibitor-1 activity (p less than 0.05). Electrophoresis of heat-stable proteins prepared from hormone-treated 32P-labeled fat cells showed that insulin caused a dephosphorylation of the 32,000 Da phosphoprotein by 30% (p less than 0.01), whereas isoproterenol stimulated 32P incorporation in this protein by 35% compared to control (p less than 0.05). Thus, insulin appears to dephosphorylate and inactivate inhibitor-1, and might thereby result in an increase of protein phosphatase activity. Insulin regulation of inhibitor-1 is a mechanism which may underlie other of insulin's effects in adipose tissue, such as the activation of glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2009955942,"The 70,000-dalton core polypeptide of neurofilaments, thought to exist only in neurons, has been detected in chicken erythrocytes, where it coexists with vimentin and synemin as a component of the intermediate filament network. It is present in the circulating erythroid cells of embryos and young chickens but is nearly absent from the erythroid cells of adults. These findings are inconsistent with current models of intermediate filament expression, but provide another example of unexpected similarities between the nervous and hemopoietic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1516580953,"ATP-activated DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) forms a stable initiation complex with primed DNA with concomitant hydrolysis of the ATP (Burgers, P. M. J., and Kornberg, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11468-11478). Upon replication of primed single-stranded circular DNA to a duplex circle with a small gap (RFII), the holoenzyme remains stably bound. Dissociation requires binding by ATP or the generally nonhydrolyzable analog, adenosine 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate). Transfer of holoenzyme to another primed DNA absolutely requires ATP (or dATP) and takes about 2 min at 30 degrees C. The rate of cycling of holoenzyme is only slightly dependent on the concentration of primed DNA. However, the transfer time is reduced to only 2 to 5 s when it is intramolecular, as shown by movement to other primers on the same template chain. A rapid transfer of holoenzyme from a completed chain to another primer on the same template molecule is anticipated from the frequency of initiating nascent chains at the replicating fork of the cellular chromosome (about 1 per s at 37 degrees C) and the low cellular abundance of holoenzyme (about 10 to 20 molecules per cell)."
https://openalex.org/W1537117040,"The insulin receptor can exist in either a lower or a higher affinity state. Hormone binding alters the equilibrium between the two states of the insulin receptor, favoring the formation of that of higher affinity (Corin, R.E., and Donner, D.B. (1982), J. Biol. Chem. 257, 104-110). After brief or extended incubations with hormone, during which the fraction of higher affinity receptors increased, 125I-insulin was covalently coupled to the alpha subunits of its receptor using disuccinimidyl suberate. Some 125I-insulin remained bound to higher affinity receptors after dissociation of hormone from lower affinity sites. This hormone could also be covalently coupled to the alpha subunit of the receptor. During extended incubations between 125I-insulin and liver plasma membranes, components of the receptor were cleaved to yield degradation products of 120,000 and 23,000 Da. The significance of this process remains undetermined. Unoccupied insulin receptors were cleaved by trypsin to produce fragments of 94,000 and 37,000 Da which remained membrane-bound and could be covalently coupled to 125I-insulin. Trypsin treatment after binding yielded an additional receptor fragment of 64,000 Da. As the incubation time between 125I-insulin and membranes was lengthened, components of the receptor became progressively less sensitive to trypsin. Higher affinity binding sites isolated after release of rapid dissociating insulin were less sensitive to trypsin than were mixtures of higher and lower affinity receptors. These observations suggest that hormone binding produces two conformational changes (alterations of tryptic lability) in the hepatic insulin receptor. The first change is rapid and exposes parts of the receptor to tryptic degradation. The second, slower conformational change renders the receptor less sensitive to trypsin and occurs with the same time course as the increase of receptor affinity mediated by site occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1491426643,"Extracts of Dictyostelium discoideum grown axenically in a chemically defined medium were evaluated for binding to discoidin I and discoidin II, endogenous lectins of this slime mold. Binding activity was measured by competitive inhibition of 125I-lactosyl-bovine serum albumin binding to the immobilized lectins. With the solubilization procedure used extracts of vegetative cells and of early aggregates had no significant inhibitory activity, but an abundant discoidin-binding substance was detected in late aggregates and fruiting bodies. This material was purified by ethanol and acid precipitation followed by precipitation with discoidin. It is a polysaccharide composed of 77% galactose, 15% N-acetylgalactosamine, 5% glucose, and 3% N-acetylglucosamine and may be a biologically functional ligand for the slime mold lectins, in particular discoidin II. Use of axenic cells was critical in these experiments, since extracts of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes, commonly used as food for D. discoideum, were found to contain substances that react with discoidin. This would complicate isolation of endogenous discoidin ligands from cells raised on bacteria."

Both enzyme sources display oxidative activity on either substrate with a constant ratio between these activities. We have found that both enzymatic activities present the same electrophoretic mobility when crude extracts were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels and the gels stained for enzyme activities. Furthermore, both enzymatic activities co-chromatograph in a DEAE-Sephadex column. If lactaldehyde dehydrogenase of wild type cells is purified near homogeneity and the purification procedure is screened for both aldehydes as substrates, only one enzyme is apparent, giving again a constant ratio between lactaldehyde and glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase activities. Genetic evidence of the fact that both activities are functions of the same protein is provided by the observation that mutation to thermosensitivity for the production of lactaldehyde dehydrogenase affected in the same way the production of glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase. Glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase from mutant cells is purified in a procedure coincident with the lactaldehyde dehydrogenase purification, yielding a single enzyme electrophoretically indistinguishable from the purified lactaldehyde dehydrogenase. Peptide mapping of the purified preparation after digestion with chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 gives an indistinguishable band pattern between both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1574259249,"Alloxan was found to inhibit a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase recently identified in pancreatic islets. This effect of alloxan may be specifically related to the inhibitory action of alloxan on insulin secretion from islets since: 1) in islet-cell subcellular fractions, alloxan at micromolar concentrations irreversibly inhibits the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity; 2) pretreatment of intact islets with alloxan at concentrations that inhibit insulin secretion similarly inhibits the protein kinase activity; and 3) alloxan inhibition of both insulin secretion and protein kinase activity in intact islets can be prevented by D-glucose. This inhibition by alloxan appears to be a direct effect on the enzyme since alloxan treatment of either the islet homogenate or the microsomal fraction enriched in protein kinase activity inhibited the kinase activity with similar concentration dependence. These results suggest that alloxan-induced inhibition of a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase may represent a critical inhibitory site which mediates alloxan-induced inhibition of insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1544952490,"Human high molecular weight urokinase, a plasminogen activator, when minimally reduced with 0.01 M 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 h at pH 8.0 and 25 degrees C and then carboxymethylated with sodium iodoacetate, gave two chains, a functionally active heavy chain with about 80% of the original activity and a light chain. These two chains were found to be linked by a single interchain disulfide bond. The functionally active heavy chain can be isolated by an affinity chromatography method with [N alpha-(epsilon-aminocaproyl)-DL-homoarginine hexylester]-Sepharose. The light chain, which has no enzyme activity, is not adsorbed to the affinity matrix, whereas the active heavy chain was adsorbed and subsequently eluted. The active heavy chain was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. This preparation was found to be homogeneous by both analytical and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the active heavy chain was determined to be 33,000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and 31,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Its specific activity, with L-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, was determined to be 208,000 IU/mg of protein. Approximately 87% active sites were found by p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidino-benzoate titration with a molar activity of 7.41 X 10(9) IU/mmol of active site. The active heavy chain when compared to low molecular weight urokinase has a similar molecular weight, specific activity, and amino acid composition. The NH2-terminal residue found in the active heavy chain was lysine which was the same as that found in low molecular weight urokinase, whereas the NH2-terminal residues found in high molecular weight urokinase were serine and lysine. Serine is the NH2-terminal residue of the light chain of high molecular weight urokinase. The steady state kinetic parameters of activation of human Glu-plasminogen by the active heavy chain were also similar to low molecular weight urokinase, as were the amidase parameters of these enzymes. The Michaelis constants of activation (Kplg) were 2.11 and 2.21 microM, respectively; the catalytic rate constants of activation (kplg) were 51.7 and 44.1 min-1, respectively, with second order rate constants, kplg/Kplg of 24.5 and 20.2 microM-1 min-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1560434293,"Binding of 125I-insulin to insulin receptor was studied at equilibrium using plasma membrane protein, from human placenta, solubilized in Triton X-100. Measured at 1 nM 125I-insulin, the amount of radioligand bound specifically was dependent upon pH, the optimal association at 4 degrees C occurring in the pH range 8.2-8.7. The Adair equation was employed for analysis of binding isotherms generated at several pH values for concentrations of radioligand varying from 0.01-8.0 nM. Association constants derived from these analyses showed the same pH dependence described above and were found to be independent of receptor concentration. Hill plots derived from these titrations consistently yielded Hill coefficients of 1 and Scatchard plots gave virtually straight lines. Close correspondence was found between theoretical analyses and observations under all experimental conditions and graphical methods employed. These results are consistent with a single class of noninteracting 125I-insulin binding sites on the solubilized insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1528513211,"A marked resistance to the stimulatory action of insulin on glucose metabolism has previously been shown in guinea pig, compared to rat, adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes. The mechanism of insulin resistance in isolated guinea pig adipocytes has, therefore, been examined by measuring 125I-insulin binding, the stimulatory effect of insulin on 3-0-methylglucose transport and on lipogenesis from [3-3H]glucose, the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucagon-stimulated glycerol release, and the translocation of glucose transporters in response to insulin. The translocation of glucose transporters was assessed by measuring the distribution of specific D-glucose-inhibitable [3H]cytochalasin B binding sites among the plasma, and high and low density microsomal membrane fractions prepared by differential centrifugation from basal and insulin-stimulated cells. At a glucose concentration (0.5 mM) where transport is thought to be rate-limiting for metabolism, insulin stimulates lipogenesis from 30 to 80 fmol/cell/90 min in guinea pig cells and from 25 to 380 fmol/cell/90 min in rat cells with half-maximal effects at approximately 100 pM in both cell types. Insulin similarly stimulates 3-O-methylglucose transport from 0.40 to 0.70 fmol/cell/min and from 0.24 to 3.60 fmol/cell/min in guinea pig and rat fat cells, respectively. Nevertheless, guinea pig cells bind more insulin per cell than rat cells, and insulin fully inhibits glucagon-stimulated glycerol release. In addition, the differences between guinea pig and rat cells in the stimulatory effect of insulin on lipogenesis and 3-O-methylglucose transport cannot be explained by the greater cell size of the former compared to the latter (0.18 and 0.09 micrograms of lipid/cell, respectively). However, the number of glucose transporters in the low density microsomal membrane fraction prepared from basal guinea pig cells is markedly reduced compared to that from rat fat cells (12 and 70 pmol/mg of membrane protein, respectively) and the translocation of intracellular glucose transporters to the plasma membrane fraction in response to insulin is correspondingly reduced. These results suggest that guinea pig adipocytes are markedly resistant to the stimulatory action of insulin on glucose transport and that this resistance is the consequence of a relative depletion in the number of intracellular glucose transporters."

https://openalex.org/W1555853910,"The soluble components of the RNA polymerase activity (N4 RNA polymerase II) required for coliphage N4 middle RNA synthesis have been purified to homogeneity using a complementation assay described elsewhere. These soluble components are found to exhibit the properties of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is resistant to both rifampicin and streptolydigin and transcribes denatured N4 DNA with marked preference but with little selectivity for the middle region of the N4 genome. In its native form, the activity is composed of one Mr = 40,000 polypeptide (p4, the product of N4 cistron 4) and one Mr = 30,000 polypeptide (p7, the product of N4 cistron 3). Its physical properties and the mechanism of transcription selectivity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608820817,"The amino acid sequence of deoxycytidylate deaminase isolated from T2 phage-infected Escherichia coli has been determined. The enzyme is a hexamer, consisting of identical polypeptide subunits, each composed of 188 amino acids with a calculated Mr = 20,560. The primary structure was established by automatic Edman degradation of the intact carboxymethylated protein and of peptides derived from the protein by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, the Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine. Knowledge of the primary structure of deoxycytidylate deaminase should aid in determining the allosteric binding site of the negative effector, dTTP, recently reported (Maley, F., and Maley, G.F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11876-11878), and eventually that of the enzyme's positive regulator, dCTP, as well as its substrate. The deaminase has been crystallized through the use of polyethylene glycol; a scanning electron micrograph is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1550419558,"The effects of phenobarbital, trans-stilbene oxide, and 3-methylcholanthrene on epoxide hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.3) within centrilobular, midzonal, and periportal hepatocytes were investigated employing rabbit anti-serum produced against rat hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase in unlabeled antibody peroxidase-anti-peroxidase and indirect fluorescent antibody-staining techniques. In livers of control rats, midzonal and periportal hepatocytes bound the anti-epoxide hydrolase to similar extents while centrilobular hepatocytes bound approximately 25% more antibody. 3-Methylcholanthrene did not cause significant alterations in immunohistochemical staining for epoxide hydrolase within any region of the liver lobule, whereas phenobarbital and trans-stilbene oxide produced significant alterations in both the intensity and pattern of intralobular staining for the enzyme. After 4 days of phenobarbital pretreatment, anti-epoxide hydrolase binding to hepatocytes was slightly, but significantly, elevated, especially within midzonal regions. After 7 days of phenobarbital pretreatment, anti-epoxide hydrolase binding was increased by approximately 65% within midzonal regions and by approximately 41 and 24%, respectively, within centrilobular and periportal regions. In livers of trans-stilbene oxide-pretreated rats, anti-epoxide hydrolase binding was increased by approximately 80% within both the midzonal and periportal regions and by approximately 43% within centrilobular regions. These immunohistochemical findings demonstrate that phenobarbital and trans-stilbene oxide both induce epoxide hydrolase nonuniformly within the liver lobule. However, while phenobarbital induces the enzyme to the greatest extent within midzonal hepatocytes and to the least extent within periportal hepatocytes, trans-stilbene oxide induces epoxide hydrolase equally within midzonal and periportal hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2168341971,"Abstract A highly specific inducible membrane-bound 4-pyridoxic acid dehydrogenase has been solubilized and purified to apparent homogeneity from Pseudomonas MA-1 grown with pyridoxine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The undenatured enzyme migrates as a single band on gel electrophoresis; denatured preparations show two barely resolved bands (Mr = 63,000 and 61,000). Undenatured preparations aggregate readily, as evidenced by Mr values of 148,000, 470,000, and greater than 670,000 obtained by density gradient centrifugation or by gel filtration under various conditions. The enzyme contains FAD but no Fe or acid-labile S; an average minimum molecular weight of 131,000 was calculated from the FAD content. In the presence of 2,6-dichloroindophenol, the enzyme dehydrogenates 4-pyridoxic acid to the corresponding aldehyde; this reaction is not inhibited by CN-. At the pH optimum of 8.0, a Vm of approximately 7.0 mumol min-1 mg-1 and a Km of 9 microM were obtained. 2,6-Dichloroindophenol, phenazine methosulfate, and menadione are effective electron acceptors; ubiquinones are less active, while NAD, FAD, and O2 are inactive. However, in membrane fractions, oxygen supports 4-pyridoxic acid oxidation via a CN--sensitive electron transport chain, indicating that the dehydrogenase probably is coupled to ATP generation in such preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1979864536,"Recombination between the IS50 sequences that flank Tn5 has been found to occur readily after the transformation of E. coli recA strains with a plasmid that contains direct repeats of these sequences. Analysis of mutants of IS50 indicates that the polypeptide encoded by IS50 that is required for transposition is also required for the recombination. Surprisingly, the mechanism of recombination appears to be similar to general homologous recombination rather than site-specific recombination. This IS50 recombination system may be responsible for resolving transient cointegrate structures containing direct repeats of IS50 or Tn5 during the transposition of IS50 and Tn5."
https://openalex.org/W1554424294,"The x-ray structure of the periplasmic galactose binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium, the specific receptor for taxis toward, and high-affinity transport of, galactose has been solved at 3.0-A resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement. The path of the polypeptide chain has been traced, and a model structure consisting of 292 amino acids has been fit to the electron density map. The overall shape of the molecule is that of a prolate ellipsoid, with dimensions 35 X 35 X 65 A. The protein consists of two similar domains of roughly equal size, related by an axis of pseudosymmetry, and separated by a deep cleft about 8 A wide. Each domain has a core of parallel beta sheet surrounded by five alpha helices, built by alternating strands of sheet and helix in a repeating pattern. Approximately 36% of the residues are involved in alpha helices, and 27% in beta sheet. The tertiary structure has been compared to that of the Escherichia coli arabinose binding protein (Gilliland, G.L., and Quiocho, F. A. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 146, 341-362), a periplasmic receptor which is involved in transport, but not in chemotaxis. The overall folding of these two molecules is very similar, with the exception of two areas on the surface of the molecule on the long sides of the prolate ellipsoid. The observed variations are adequate to explain the differences in interaction of L-arabinose binding protein and galactose binding protein with the membrane proteins for transport and chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1544260392,"The mutant recA 441 and recA 430 proteins from Escherichia coli have single amino acid substitutions which distinguish each of them from the wild type recA protein. recA 441 mutants express SOS functions at 42 degrees C even without DNA damage whereas recA 430 mutants are totally unable to express SOS functions at any temperature. Both mutant recA proteins have altered protease functions. However, the amino acid substitutions in each protein are located at a considerable linear distance from one another in their respective polypeptide chains, the recA 441 protein having a lysine in place of a glutamic acid residue at position 68, while the recA 430 protein has a serine in place of a glycine at position 204."
https://openalex.org/W1554929343,"The activation of inactive prorenin by active renin was investigated. Inactive prorenin extensively purified from human plasma was activated by active renin which had been purified from mouse submaxillary glands by multiple chromatographic steps. The apparent lack of protease activity in renin was puzzling in view of the close similarity of its active site structure with that of acid proteases. After a series of affinity chromatographic steps designed to eliminate minute contaminants, renin was found to contain a very low but finite level of a neutral protease activity which was equivalent to 1/40,000 of that of cathepsin D tested by hemoglobinolytic activity. The protease activity was considered as intrinsic to renin since it co-purified with renin persistently at a constant ratio to the renin activity, was precipitated by a monoclonal antibody specific for renin, showed a neutral pH optimum of the enzyme activity in the same pH range as that of renin, and was inhibited by pepstatin. The neutral protease activity is likely to mediate the activation of inactive prorenin."

https://openalex.org/W1626672809,"The involvement of undermodified tRNA in the regulation of the ilvGEDA operon has been investigated using Escherichia coli C6, a relA-, Cys-, Met- mutant. This strain accumulates thionucleotide-deficient or methyl-deficient tRNA when starved for cysteine or methionine, respectively. The levels of threonine deaminase, the ilvA gene product, and transaminase B, the ilvE gene product, were both lower in cysteine-starved cells, as compared with either growing or methionine-starved cultures. When cysteine was added to cysteine-starved cells, growth ensued promptly and both enzyme activities returned to control levels. Treatment of recovering cultures with valine limited growth by isoleucine limitation, but did not cause a derepression of the ilvGEDA operon. Valine treatment of nonstarved or methionine-starved cells led to the expected increase in threonine deaminase and transaminase B activities. Cysteine-starved cells slowly regained the ability to derepress the operon after 3 h of recovery in complete medium. In contrast, the induction of the lac operon was normal in cysteine-starved cultures, even in the presence of valine. The loss of derepressibility of the ilvGEDA operon was correlated with the presence of a kinetically and chromatographically altered tRNAIle in cysteine-starved cells. No changes in tRNAIle were observed after methionine starvation. Using the periodate method, we found that the charging of tRNAIle increased from the normal level of 60 to 80% or greater after starvation for cysteine. Under conditions where the ilvGEDA operon was fully derepressed in nonstarved cells, the charging of tRNAIle fell to 27%. Unexpectedly, nearly identical results were obtained with cysteine-starved cells after an identical derepression test. These results suggest that factors other than the aminoacylation state of tRNAIle may be important in the regulation of this operon. In particular, modifications to tRNA which involve cysteine may be necessary for controlling the expression of the ilvGEDA operon in E. coli."
