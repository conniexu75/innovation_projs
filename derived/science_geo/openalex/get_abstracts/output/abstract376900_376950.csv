https://openalex.org/W2027455260,"There is currently much interest in the understanding of genetic mechanisms that underlie variation at the gene expression level. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature use RNA sequencing to study global gene expression in two contrasting populations. Pickrell et al. sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals who have been extensively genotyped as part of the HapMap Project. By pooling data from all the individuals it was possible to identify many genetic determinants of variation in gene expression. Montgomery et al. characterize the mRNA fraction of RNA isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 63 HapMap individuals of Caucasian origin. They obtain a fine-scale view of the transcriptome and identify genetic variants that affect alternative splicing. There is much interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie individual variations in gene expression. Here, RNA sequencing has been used to study gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Nigerian individuals for whom extensive genotype information is known. Numerous genetic determinants of variation in gene expression were identified, including variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression. Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal1. Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project2. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals."

Roach et al. (p. 636 , published online 10 March) present the sequence of a family with two offspring affected with two genetic disorders: Miller syndrome and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Sequence analysis of the children and their parents not only showed that the intergenerational mutation rate was lower than anticipated but also revealed recombination sites and the occurrence of rare polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W1965621126,"The domestication of the chicken over a period of several thousand years and its later specialization into meat producing (broiler) and egg producing (layer) lines is an informative model of domestication and phenotypic evolution. A study using massively parallel sequencing of domestic chicken and its wild ancestor, the red jungle fowl, reveals a number of 'selective sweeps', where benign genetic variations closely linked to a mutation that dramatically enhances survival increase in frequency relative to other alleles. Most striking of these — found in all domestic chickens — is one at a locus encoding thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, which has a key role in metabolism and vertebrate reproductive timing. This sweep may be related to a classic feature of domesticated animals, the absence of the strict regulation of seasonal reproduction found in wild populations. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlap genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. Here, the genomes of birds representing eight populations of domestic chickens are compared with the genome of their wild ancestor, the red jungle fowl. The results reveal selective sweeps of favourable alleles and mutations that may have contributed to domestication. One selective sweep, for instance, occurred at the locus encoding the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, which is important in metabolism and in the timing of vertebrate reproduction. Domestic animals are excellent models for genetic studies of phenotypic evolution1,2,3. They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor4. We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2065776802,"Gene expression is an important phenotype that informs about genetic and environmental effects on cellular state. Many studies have previously identified genetic variants for gene expression phenotypes using custom and commercially available microarrays. Second generation sequencing technologies are now providing unprecedented access to the fine structure of the transcriptome. We have sequenced the mRNA fraction of the transcriptome in 60 extended HapMap individuals of European descent and have combined these data with genetic variants from the HapMap3 project. We have quantified exon abundance based on read depth and have also developed methods to quantify whole transcript abundance. We have found that approximately 10 million reads of sequencing can provide access to the same dynamic range as arrays with better quantification of alternative and highly abundant transcripts. Correlation with SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery of eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) than with arrays. We also detect a substantial number of variants that influence the structure of mature transcripts indicating variants responsible for alternative splicing. Finally, measures of allele-specific expression allowed the identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences in transcript structure. This analysis shows that high throughput sequencing technologies reveal new properties of genetic effects on the transcriptome and allow the exploration of genetic effects in cellular processes."

Notoriously, as chlorofluorocarbons, they were implicated in ozone depletion in the stratosphere. New observations suggest that chlorine may be a more potent force lower down in the atmosphere than was thought. The presence of gaseous chlorine atom precursors in the troposphere is generally considered a marine air phenomenon. But measurements made near Boulder, Colorado, reveal significant production of atmospheric nitryl chloride (ClNO2) in a continental setting, 1,400 km from the nearest coastline. This finding, incorporated into model studies, suggests that nitryl chloride production in the contiguous United States alone — probably arising from anthropogenic pollutants — is at a level similar to previous global estimates for marine regions. The presence of gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere was thought only to occur in marine areas but now nitryl chloride has been found at a distance of 1,400 km from the nearest coastline. A model study shows that the amount of nitryl chloride production in the continental USA alone is similar to previous global estimates for marine regions. A significant fraction of tropospheric chlorine atoms may arise directly from anthropogenic pollutants. Halogen atoms and oxides are highly reactive and can profoundly affect atmospheric composition. Chlorine atoms can decrease the lifetimes of gaseous elemental mercury1 and hydrocarbons such as the greenhouse gas methane2. Chlorine atoms also influence cycles that catalytically destroy or produce tropospheric ozone3, a greenhouse gas potentially toxic to plant and animal life. Conversion of inorganic chloride into gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere is generally considered a coastal or marine air phenomenon4. Here we report mid-continental observations of the chlorine atom precursor nitryl chloride at a distance of 1,400 km from the nearest coastline. We observe persistent and significant nitryl chloride production relative to the consumption of its nitrogen oxide precursors. Comparison of these findings to model predictions based on aerosol and precipitation composition data from long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl chloride production in the contiguous USA alone is at a level similar to previous global estimates for coastal and marine regions5. We also suggest that a significant fraction of tropospheric chlorine atoms6 may arise directly from anthropogenic pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W1969438318,"Prostate cancer (CaP) progresses from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia through locally invasive adenocarcinoma to castration-resistant metastatic carcinoma. Although radical prostatectomy, radiation and androgen ablation are effective therapies for androgen-dependent CaP, metastatic castration-resistant CaP is a major complication with high mortality. Androgens stimulate growth and survival of prostate epithelium and early CaP. Although most patients initially respond to androgen ablation, many develop castration-resistant CaP within 12-18 months. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of castration-resistant CaP remain poorly understood and their elucidation is critical for developing improved therapies. Curiously, castration-resistant CaP remains androgen-receptor dependent, and potent androgen-receptor antagonists induce tumour regression in castrated mice. The role of inflammation in castration-resistant CaP has not been addressed, although it was reported that intrinsic NF-kappaB activation supports its growth. Inflammation is a localized protective reaction to injury or infection, but it also has a pathogenic role in many diseases, including cancer. Whereas acute inflammation is critical for host defence, chronic inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. The inflammation-responsive IkappaB kinase (IKK)-beta and its target NF-kappaB have important tumour-promoting functions within malignant cells and inflammatory cells. The latter, including macrophages and lymphocytes, are important elements of the tumour microenvironment, but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain obscure, although they are thought to depend on chemokine and cytokine production. We found that CaP progression is associated with inflammatory infiltration and activation of IKK-alpha, which stimulates metastasis by an NF-kappaB-independent, cell autonomous mechanism. Here we show that androgen ablation causes infiltration of regressing androgen-dependent tumours with leukocytes, including B cells, in which IKK-beta activation results in production of cytokines that activate IKK-alpha and STAT3 in CaP cells to enhance hormone-free survival."

https://openalex.org/W2034077004,"Although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its applicability on cosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. Such a test has recently been proposed, using a quantity, EG, that combines measures of large-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate. The combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust to the uncertainty in this parameter. Modified theories of gravity generally predict values of EG different from the general relativistic prediction because, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference between the two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) is non-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength of the gravitational lensing effect3. Here we report that EG = 0.39 +/- 0.06 on length scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the general relativistic prediction of EG $\approx$ 0.4. The measured value excludes a model within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies both Newtonian and Einstein gravity. However, the relatively large uncertainty still permits models within f(R) theory, which is an extension of general relativity. A fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models."

https://openalex.org/W2019595204,"Contemporary in-depth sequencing of environmental samples has provided novel insights into microbial community structures, revealing that their diversity had been previously underestimated. Communities in marine environments are commonly composed of a few dominant taxa and a high number of taxonomically diverse, low-abundance organisms. However, studying the roles and genomic information of these ""rare"" organisms remains challenging, because little is known about their ecological niches and the environmental conditions to which they respond. Given the current threat to coral reef ecosystems, we investigated the potential of corals to provide highly specialized habitats for bacterial taxa including those that are rarely detected or absent in surrounding reef waters. The analysis of more than 350,000 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequence tags and almost 2,000 nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that rare seawater biosphere members are highly abundant or even dominant in diverse Caribbean corals. Closely related corals (in the same genus/family) harbored similar bacterial communities. At higher taxonomic levels, however, the similarities of these communities did not correlate with the phylogenetic relationships among corals, opening novel questions about the evolutionary stability of coral-microbial associations. Large proportions of OTUs (28.7-49.1%) were unique to the coral species of origin. Analysis of the most dominant ribotypes suggests that many uncovered bacterial taxa exist in coral habitats and await future exploration. Our results indicate that coral species, and by extension other animal hosts, act as specialized habitats of otherwise rare microbes in marine ecosystems. Here, deep sequencing provided insights into coral microbiota at an unparalleled resolution and revealed that corals harbor many bacterial taxa previously not known. Given that two of the coral species investigated are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, our results add an important microbial diversity-based perspective to the significance of conserving coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2152354289,"Angiogenesis is crucial to many physiological and pathological processes including development and cancer cell survival. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is the predominant mediator of angiogenesis in the VEGF family. During development, adverse environmental conditions like nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and increased protein secretion occur. IRE1alpha, PERK, and ATF6alpha, master regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR), are activated under these conditions and are proposed to have a role in mediating angiogenesis.Here we show that IRE1alpha, PERK, and ATF6alpha powerfully regulate VEGFA mRNA expression under various stress conditions. In Ire1alpha(-/-) and Perk(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts and ATF6alpha-knockdown HepG2 cells, induction of VEGFA mRNA by endoplasmic reticulum stress is attenuated as compared to control cells. Embryonic lethality of Ire1alpha-/- mice is due to the lack of VEGFA induction in labyrinthine trophoblast cells of the developing placenta. Rescue of IRE1alpha and PERK in Ire1alpha(-/-) and Perk(-/-) cells respectively, prevents VEGFA mRNA attenuation. We further report that the induction of VEGFA by IRE1alpha, PERK and ATF6 involves activation of transcription factors, spliced-XBP-1, ATF4 and cleaved ATF6 respectively.Our results reveal that the IRE1alpha-XBP-1, PERK-ATF4, and ATF6alpha pathways constitute novel upstream regulatory pathways of angiogenesis by modulating VEGF transcription. Activation of these pathways helps the rapidly growing cells to obtain sufficient nutrients and growth factors for their survival under the prevailing hostile environmental conditions. These results establish an important role of the UPR in angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2086836468,"Recent isothiocyanate covalent labeling studies have suggested that a classical cannabinoid, (−)-7′-isothiocyanato-11-hydroxy-1′,1′dimethylheptyl-hexahydrocannabinol (AM841), enters the cannabinoid CB2 receptor via the lipid bilayer (Pei, Y., Mercier, R.

However, the sequence of steps involved in such a lipid pathway entry has not yet been elucidated. Here, we test the hypothesis that the endogenous cannabinoid sn-2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) attains access to the CB2 receptor via the lipid bilayer. To this end, we have employed microsecond time scale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the interaction of 2-AG with CB2 via a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer. Results suggest the following: 1) 2-AG first partitions out of bulk lipid at the transmembrane α-helix (TMH) 6/7 interface; 2) 2-AG then enters the CB2 receptor binding pocket by passing between TMH6 and TMH7; 3) the entrance of the 2-AG headgroup into the CB2 binding pocket is sufficient to trigger breaking of the intracellular TMH3/6 ionic lock and the movement of the TMH6 intracellular end away from TMH3; and 4) subsequent to protonation at D3.49/D6.30, further 2-AG entry into the ligand binding pocket results in both a W6.48 toggle switch change and a large influx of water.

For preliminary calculations, the CB2 model was embedded in a bilayer containing 99 stearoyl-docosahexaenoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SDPC) lipid molecules; the membrane was generated de novo using a library of lipid conformations from previous neat lipid simulations, as described in Grossfield et al. (36Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The system was warmed over the course of 1 ns, using velocity resampling every 5 ps, and then run in the NVT ensemble for ∼300 ns at 310 K with the box size fixed at 54 × 76.2 × 95.5 Å. The system was equilibrated for 20 ns before a 286-ns production run was initiated. After the 286-ns trajectory of CB2 in lipid (trajectory A, described above) was complete, production simulations were initiated that contained the complete CB2 model, using the final protein conformation from trajectory A, embedded in a bilayer containing 123 palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine lipid molecules and 38 2-AG molecules. The bilayer system was solvated by 9965 water molecules, 14 sodium ions, and 31 chloride ions to yield an electrically neutral system with roughly 100 mm salt. The CHARMM27 force field for proteins and lipids was used (37MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. R.L. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S.

Repulsion-dispersion interactions were smoothly truncated at 10 Å, and the particle-particle-particle-mesh Ewald method was used to compute long range electrostatics, using a 1283 grid for the fast Fourier transform, a charge interpolation distance of four mesh points, and the Ewald α value set to 0.35 Å−1. The temperature was held at 310 K using velocity resampling every 1 ns, and the system volume was held fixed at 74.1 × 74.1 × 96.7 Å. The dynamics were integrated using the velocity Verlet integrator (40Swope W.C. Andersen H. Berens P.H. Wilson K.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1982; 76: 637-649Crossref Scopus (2999) Google Scholar), with a time step of 2 fs and bonds to hydrogen constrained using RATTLE with the tolerance set to 10−10 (41Andersen H. J. Comput.

Previous work has shown that this protocol leads to excellent energy conservation, with temperature drifts of roughly 1 K over a microsecond of dynamics (30Grossfield A. Pitman M.C. Feller S.E.

In developing the protocol, we have specifically investigated the consequences of long time constant volume simulations for membrane-GPCR systems, after the volume has been equilibrated to 1 atm of pressure. We found, and it has been reviewed in the citations above, that with an initial equilibration of the system volume under normal pressure, the volume may be fixed for the production period of the simulation. This was monitored by the order parameters of the lipid chains, which respond to changes in pressure by expansion or contraction, which is reflected by changes in lipid order. Lipid order parameters remain stable after system equilibration, and therefore NVT or NVE is not problematic in the present case. After warm-up and equilibration, two separate simulations (trajectory B and C) were constructed using identical protein structures and regenerating the lipid and 2-AG conformations using different random number seeds (36Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Trajectory B showed no 2-AG partitioning out of bulk lipid. In contrast, in trajectory C (at 276 ns), one 2-AG molecule partitioned out of bulk lipid and associated with the TMH6/TMH7 CB2 lipid face. This frame was used as the starting point for two separate simulations (trajectories D and E) begun by randomly selecting new initial velocities from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at physiological temperature (37 °C). In trajectory E, 2-AG entered CB2. In trajectory D, 2-AG did not enter CB2; therefore, trajectory D is used here as a control. To generate a protonated form of activated CB2, the trajectory E frame at 127 ns was extracted, and both D3.49(130) and D6.30(240) were protonated with a corresponding removal of two sodium ions from bulk to preserve system neutrality. The initial protonated structure was equilibrated (NVT) first with velocity resampling at 310 K with a resampling interval of 200 fs for a duration of a few hundred ps (365 ps), followed by a resampling interval of 1 ps for a few nanoseconds (5.488 ns). Equilibration was followed by production with a 1-ns resampling for nearly 2 μs (1954 ns) NVT. NVE conditions were then applied to the end of trajectory F, giving trajectory G (no further velocity resampling). Trajectory G production resumed for nearly 1.7 μs (1668 ns) under NVE conditions with excellent energy conservation. Consistent with previous NVE production simulations with the present conditions, the temperature increased <1 K over the 1.7 μs of NVE for trajectory G. Musafia et al. (48Musafia B. Buchner V. Arad D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have reported that the average interatomic N-O distance for a simple Arg-Asp salt bridge is 2.93 Å. All measurements of salt bridge distances were made using Visual Molecular Dynamics (49Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39890) Google Scholar). Trajectory frames for which the N(R3.55)-O(D6.30) distance was 4 Å or greater were considered to lack salt bridge interactions. Solvent-accessible surface area calculations were performed with the built in measure commands available in Visual Molecular Dynamics (49Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39890) Google Scholar). A 1.4-Å probe radius was used. The percent contact data for 2-AG entering CB2 was obtained as follows: a residue was counted in contact with 2-AG if any of its heavy atoms were within 4.0 Å of the specified 2-AG atoms. This contact was recorded for each frame in the trajectory, from which a percentage was calculated. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using a 3.5-Å cutoff for heavy atom distance and a D-H···A angle limit of 120° (i.e. D-H ···A angle >120°). The water “density” visualizations in Fig. 11 were constructed by first aligning each frame of the trajectory such that the CB2 transmembrane α-carbons were superimposed upon an average structure. A 1-Å resolution density grid was then superimposed over the system. At each time point (trajectory frame), internal waters were picked out by only considering water oxygen atoms that were within a 30-Å radius of the principal axis formed from all CB2 α-carbons. There was no height cutoff imposed along the principal axis, so a “cap” of bulk waters are included to help visualize the bulk water interface. A 2-Å sphere of density was then superimposed about the coordinates of each water oxygen that was then averaged into the grid. The resulting density map was then scaled so all density values ranged from 0 to 1. All analyses were performed using the “Lightweight Object Oriented Structure Analysis” package (or “LOOS”) (50Romo T.D. Grossfield A. 31st Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, Minneapolis, MN. Springer-Verlag, New York2009: 2332-2335Google Scholar) and available via SourceForge and custom software. The sequence of trajectories reported here is summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that the root mean square deviation of the CB2 inactive state model stabilized within the first 50 ns of trajectory A. Certain interactions in the CB2 inactive state model input for the MD runs remained stable, such as the salt bridge between K3.28(109) and D(275) in the CB2 EC-3 loop. Other interactions that have important implications for both ligand recognition and activation of CB2 changed early in the simulation. First, although the simulation was begun with an aromatic stacking interaction between F3.36(117) and W6.48(258) (analogous to the CB1 toggle switch (51McAllister S.D. Hurst D.P. Barnett-Norris J. Lynch D. Reggio P.H. Abood M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48024-48037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)), F3.36(117) shifted toward TMH5 during the equilibration, and W6.48(258) established a hydrogen bond with N7.45(291). Second, although the simulation was begun with a salt bridge between R3.50(131) and D6.30(240) at the intracellular ends of TMH3/6 analogous to the R3.50/E6.30 salt bridge in the dark state of rhodopsin (12Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), the receptor rearranged quickly to form a salt bridge between R3.55(136) and D6.30(240), with Y3.51(132) hydrogen bonding to the exposed backbone carbonyl of L6.29(239). This produces a network that reinforces the interaction between the IC ends of TMH3 and TMH6 (Fig. 3). Third, the IC-3 loop assumed additional structure by the addition of at least two helical turns to the original end of TMH5 (Fig. 3 in red).FIGURE 3Relationship between the intracellular ends of TMH3 and TMH6 at designated points along the simulation is illustrated here. The CB2 TMH bundle is shown in ribbon format with phosphorus atoms of the bilayer highlighted in gold. TMHs shown in color include TMH3 (blue), TMH5 (green with red intracellular extension), and TMH6 (magenta). Top and lower left, although we began trajectory A with a salt bridge between R3.50(131) and D6.30(240) at the IC ends of TMH3/6, the receptor rearranged to form a salt bridge between R3.55(136) and D6.30(240), with Y3.51(132) hydrogen bonding to the exposed backbone carbonyl of L6.29(239). In addition, the IC-3 loop assumed two additional helical turns (shown here in red). Lower right, this figure shows the broken R3.55(136)/D6.30(240) salt bridge and the broken Y3.51(132)/L6.29(239) carbonyl interaction at 184 ns into trajectory E (compare with lower left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The final protein conformation at the end of trajectory A (286 ns) was used as input to new simulations. Thirty eight 2-AG and 123 palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine molecules were distributed randomly around the CB2 receptor bundle (36Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). After warm-up and equilibration, two separate simulations (trajectory B and C) were constructed using identical protein structures and regenerating the lipid and 2-AG conformations using a different random number of seeds (see Fig. 1) (36Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Trajectory B showed no 2-AG partitioning out of bulk lipid and is used as a control here. In contrast, in trajectory C (at 40 ns), a 2-AG molecule partitioned out of bulk lipid and established a long lasting direct interaction with the CB2 TMH6/TMH7 lipid face. Subsequent to this partitioning, at 50 ns (trajectory C), an opening formed between TMH6/TMH7 above W6.48 and in the 310-helical region of TMH7 (C7.42-M7.47) (Fig. 4, top). Fig. 4, bottom, shows that this increase in distance between TMH6/7 occurs extracellular to W6.48 in trajectory C, and Fig. 4, middle, shows no corresponding change in TMH6/7 distance in trajectory B. No 2-AG entry into CB2 occurred in trajectory C. As a result, a frame from trajectory C (at 276 ns) was used as the starting point for two separate simulations (trajectories D and E) that were begun by randomly selecting new initial velocities from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at physiological temperature (37 °C). In trajectory D, no 2-AG entry occurred, so this trajectory is used here as a control. In trajectory E, the partitioned 2-AG entered CB2 by passing between TMH6/TMH7. This simulation exhibits many of the elements associated with GPCR activation, as will be discussed below. Fig. 5 illustrates the progress of 2-AG into the binding pocket at four different time periods during the simulations, and supplemental Table S1 details the 2-AG hydrogen bonding patterns that occur for the same time periods. In trajectory C (Fig. 5A; 40–275 ns), the 2-AG partitioned out of bulk lipid and spends the highest percentage time within 4 Å of residues in or near the TMH6/7 interface, particularly, F7.35(281) and C7.38(284). The headgroup hydroxyls of 2-AG are engaged in hydrogen bonds predominantly with water and also with each other (i.e. intramolecular hydrogen bonding). In trajectory E (0–52 ns; Fig. 5B) up to the point of headgroup insertion, 2-AG interaction with residues in the TMH6/7 interface increases with 2-AG in gre"
https://openalex.org/W1980941241,"The biological mode of action of artemisinin, a potent antimalarial, has long been controversial. Previously we established a yeast model addressing its mechanism of action and found mitochondria the key in executing artemisinin's action. Here we present data showing that artemisinin directly acts on mitochondria and it inhibits malaria in a similar way as yeast. Specifically, artemisinin and its homologues exhibit correlated activities against malaria and yeast, with the peroxide bridge playing a key role for their inhibitory action in both organisms. In addition, we showed that artemisinins are distributed to malarial mitochondria and directly impair their functions when isolated mitochondria were tested. In efforts to explore how the action specificity of artemisinin is achieved, we found strikingly rapid and dramatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is induced with artemisinin in isolated yeast and malarial but not mammalian mitochondria, and ROS scavengers can ameliorate the effects of artemisinin. Deoxyartemisinin, which lacks an endoperoxide bridge, has no effect on membrane potential or ROS production in malarial mitochondria. OZ209, a distantly related antimalarial endoperoxide, also causes ROS production and depolarization in isolated malarial mitochondria. Finally, interference of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) can alter the sensitivity of the parasite towards artemisinin. Addition of iron chelator desferrioxamine drastically reduces ETC activity as well as mitigates artemisinin-induced ROS production. Taken together, our results indicate that mitochondrion is an important direct target, if not the sole one, in the antimalarial action of artemisinins. We suggest that fundamental differences among mitochondria from different species delineate the action specificity of this class of drugs, and differing from many other drugs, the action specificity of artemisinins originates from their activation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2022229717,"In the mammalian model of sex determination, embryos are considered to be sexually indifferent until the transient action of a sex-determining gene initiates gonadal differentiation. Although this model is thought to apply to all vertebrates, this has yet to be established. Here we have examined three lateral gynandromorph chickens (a rare, naturally occurring phenomenon in which one side of the animal appears male and the other female) to investigate the sex-determining mechanism in birds. These studies demonstrated that gynandromorph birds are genuine male:female chimaeras, and indicated that male and female avian somatic cells may have an inherent sex identity. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted presumptive mesoderm between embryos of reciprocal sexes to generate embryos containing male:female chimaeric gonads. In contrast to the outcome for mammalian mixed-sex chimaeras, in chicken mixed-sex chimaeras the donor cells were excluded from the functional structures of the host gonad. In an example where female tissue was transplanted into a male host, donor cells contributing to the developing testis retained a female identity and expressed a marker of female function. Our study demonstrates that avian somatic cells possess an inherent sex identity and that, in birds, sexual differentiation is substantively cell autonomous."

https://openalex.org/W2056511371,"Since 1899 ringing (or banding) remained the most important source of information about migration routes, stopover sites and wintering grounds for birds that are too small to carry satellite-based tracking systems. Despite the large quantity of migrating birds ringed in their breeding areas in Europe, the number of ring recoveries from sub-Saharan Africa is very low and therefore the whereabouts of most small bird species outside the breeding season remain a mystery. With new miniaturized light-level geolocators it is now possible to look beyond the limits of ring recovery data. Here we show for the first time year round tracks of a near passerine trans-Saharan migrant, the European Hoopoe (Upupa epops epops). Three birds wintered in the Sahel zone of Western Africa where they remained stationary for most of the time. One bird chose a south-easterly route following the Italian peninsula. Birds from the same breeding population used different migration routes and wintering sites, suggesting a low level of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas. Our tracking of a near passerine bird, the European Hoopoe, with light-level geolocators opens a new chapter in the research of Palaearctic-African bird migration as this new tool revolutionizes our ability to discover migration routes, stopover sites and wintering grounds of small birds."
https://openalex.org/W2049138891,"Background Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Previous studies suggested that intestinal bacteria produced more alcohol in obese mice than lean animals. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate whether alcohol is involved in the pathogenesis of NASH, the expression of inflammation, fibrosis and alcohol metabolism related genes in the liver tissues of NASH patients and normal controls (NCs) were examined by microarray (NASH, n = 7; NC, n = 4) and quantitative real-time PCR (NASH, n = 6; NC, n = 6). Genes related to liver inflammation and fibrosis were found to be elevated in NASH livers compared to normal livers. The most striking finding is the increased gene transcription of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes, genes for catalase and cytochrome P450 2E1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase genes. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the increased expression of ADH1 and ADH4 in NASH livers (NASH, n = 9; NC, n = 4). Conclusions/Significance The augmented activity of all the available genes of the pathways for alcohol catabolism suggest that 1) alcohol concentration was elevated in the circulation of NASH patients; 2) there was a high priority for the NASH livers to scavenge alcohol from the circulation. Our data is the first human evidence that suggests alcohol may contribute to the development of NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W2038293369,"Background How particular changes in functional morphology can repeatedly promote ecological diversification is an active area of evolutionary investigation. The African rift-lake cichlids offer a calibrated time series of the most dramatic adaptive radiations of vertebrate trophic morphology yet described, and the replicate nature of these events provides a unique opportunity to test whether common changes in functional morphology have repeatedly facilitated their ecological success. Methodology/Principal Findings Specimens from 87 genera of cichlid fishes endemic to Lakes Tanganyka, Malawi and Victoria were dissected in order to examine the functional morphology of cichlid feeding. We quantified shape using geometric morphometrics and compared patterns of morphological diversity using a series of analytical tests. The primary axes of divergence were conserved among all three radiations, and the most prevalent changes involved the size of the preorbital region of the skull. Even the fishes from the youngest of these lakes (Victoria), which exhibit the lowest amount of skull shape disparity, have undergone extensive preorbital evolution relative to other craniofacial traits. Such changes have large effects on feeding biomechanics, and can promote expansion into a wide array of niches along a bentho-pelagic ecomorphological axis. Conclusions/Significance Here we show that specific changes in trophic anatomy have evolved repeatedly in the African rift lakes, and our results suggest that simple morphological alterations that have large ecological consequences are likely to constitute critical components of adaptive radiations in functional morphology. Such shifts may precede more complex shape changes as lineages diversify into unoccupied niches. The data presented here, combined with observations of other fish lineages, suggest that the preorbital region represents an evolutionary module that can respond quickly to natural selection when fishes colonize new lakes. Characterizing the changes in cichlid trophic morphology that have contributed to their extraordinary adaptive radiations has broad evolutionary implications, and such studies are necessary for directing future investigations into the proximate mechanisms that have shaped these spectacular phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2086486075,"The predictive power of current stellar evolution models is limited by the fact that little is known about the mixing process occurring at the stellar core. In theory, massive stars such as HD 50230 — seven times the mass of the Sun — should be ideal models for seismic probing of the stellar core via the distinct signature they leave in the gravity mode spectrum as it propagates from the core to the stellar surface. These gravity modes have now been detected observationally, in a continuous photometric light curve for HD 50230 collected with the CoRoT satellite. The data make it possible to estimate the extent of the convective core and constrain the location of the chemical transition zone at about 10% of the stellar radius. Measuring the oscillations of a star can allow the various mixing processes in its interior to be disentangled, through the signature they leave on period spacings in the gravity mode spectrum. Here numerous gravity modes in a young star of about seven solar masses are reported: the mean period spacing enables the extent of the convective core to be determined, and the clear periodic deviation from the mean constrains the location of the chemical transition zone — at about 10 per cent of the radius. The life of a star is dominantly determined by the physical processes in the stellar interior. Unfortunately, we still have a poor understanding of how the stellar gas mixes near the stellar core, preventing precise predictions of stellar evolution1. The unknown nature of the mixing processes as well as the extent of the central mixed region is particularly problematic for massive stars2. Oscillations in stars with masses a few times that of the Sun offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the nature of various mixing processes, through the distinct signature they leave on period spacings in the gravity mode spectrum3. Here we report the detection of numerous gravity modes in a young star with a mass of about seven solar masses. The mean period spacing allows us to estimate the extent of the convective core, and the clear periodic deviation from the mean constrains the location of the chemical transition zone to be at about 10 per cent of the radius and rules out a clear-cut profile."
https://openalex.org/W2090330749,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a siderophore-binding antimicrobial protein that is up-regulated in epithelial tissues during inflammation. We demonstrated previously that the gene encoding NGAL (LCN2) is strongly up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-1β in an NF-κB-dependent manner but not by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, another potent activator of NF-κB. This is due to an IL-1β-specific synthesis of the NF-κB-binding co-factor IκB-ζ, which is essential for NGAL induction. We demonstrate here that NGAL is strongly induced by stimulation with TNF-α in the presence of IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by the newly discovered subset of CD4+ T helper cells, TH-17. In contrast to the murine NGAL orthologue, 24p3/lipocalin 2, we found no requirement for C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ for NGAL induction by IL-17 and TNF-α as neither small interfering RNAs against the two C/EBP mRNAs nor mutation of the C/EBP sites in the LCN2 promoter abolished IL-17- and TNF-α-induced up-regulation of NGAL. NGAL induction is governed solely by NF-κB and its co-factor IκB-ζ. This was demonstrated by a pronounced reduction in the amount of NGAL mRNA and NGAL protein synthesized in cells treated with small interfering RNA against IκB-ζ and a total lack of activation of an LCN2 promoter construct with a mutated NF-κB site. As IL-17 stimulation stabilizes the IκB-ζ transcript, we propose a model where TNF-α induces activation and binding of NF-κB to the promoters of both NFKBIZ and LCN2 genes but induce only transcription of IκB-ζ. Co-stimulation with IL-17 leads to accumulation of IκB-ζ mRNA and IκB-ζ protein, which can bind to NF-κB on the LCN2 promoter and thus induce NGAL expression. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a siderophore-binding antimicrobial protein that is up-regulated in epithelial tissues during inflammation. We demonstrated previously that the gene encoding NGAL (LCN2) is strongly up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-1β in an NF-κB-dependent manner but not by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, another potent activator of NF-κB. This is due to an IL-1β-specific synthesis of the NF-κB-binding co-factor IκB-ζ, which is essential for NGAL induction. We demonstrate here that NGAL is strongly induced by stimulation with TNF-α in the presence of IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by the newly discovered subset of CD4+ T helper cells, TH-17. In contrast to the murine NGAL orthologue, 24p3/lipocalin 2, we found no requirement for C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ for NGAL induction by IL-17 and TNF-α as neither small interfering RNAs against the two C/EBP mRNAs nor mutation of the C/EBP sites in the LCN2 promoter abolished IL-17- and TNF-α-induced up-regulation of NGAL.

This was demonstrated by a pronounced reduction in the amount of NGAL mRNA and NGAL protein synthesized in cells treated with small interfering RNA against IκB-ζ and a total lack of activation of an LCN2 promoter construct with a mutated NF-κB site. As IL-17 stimulation stabilizes the IκB-ζ transcript, we propose a model where TNF-α induces activation and binding of NF-κB to the promoters of both NFKBIZ and LCN2 genes but induce only transcription of IκB-ζ. Co-stimulation with IL-17 leads to accumulation of IκB-ζ mRNA and IκB-ζ protein, which can bind to NF-κB on the LCN2 promoter and thus induce NGAL expression. The innate immune system has evolved in higher eukaryotes to combat microorganisms. It is activated rapidly and acts as the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Cells of the epithelial lining are among the initial players of the innate immune response. Receptors on epithelial cells, interstitial macrophages, and dendritic cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns on microorganisms and respond by de novo synthesis of antimicrobial proteins and peptides as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequently, specialized mobile phagocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes appear at the scene to muster a more full-blown counterattack against the microorganisms. Growing evidence indicates that the response of epithelial cells to the invading pathogen is fine tuned to eliminate the specific pathogen. As a consequence, expression of genes encoding the antimicrobial proteins is differentially regulated to match the specific stimuli encountered by the cells (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M.

NGAL is a 25-kDa glycoprotein originally identified as a matrix protein of specific granules of human neutrophils (5Kjeldsen L. Bainton D.F. Sengeløv H. Borregaard N. Blood. 1994; 83: 799-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later also as a protein strongly up-regulated in epithelial cells during inflammation (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M.

NGAL belongs to the lipocalin superfamily whose members share a barrel-shaped tertiary structure with a hydrophobic pocket that can bind lipophilic molecules (9Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). The ligand of NGAL is bacterial ferric siderophores, which are used by bacteria for uptake of iron, an essential nutrient (10Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K.

Expression of human NGAL in epithelial cells is induced by IL-1β in an NF-κB-dependent manner but not by TNF-α despite the well known ability of both cytokines to induce activation and binding of NF-κB to the LCN2 promoter (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Sørensen O.E. Cowland J.B. Theilgaard-Mönch K. Liu L. Ganz T. Borregaard N. J.

The reason for this IL-1β specificity is a requirement for co-factor IκB-ζ (which itself is induced specifically by IL-1β) for activation of the LCN2 promoter through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Recently, a new subgroup of T helper cells (TH-17) was characterized that act in the interface between the adaptive and innate immune system. When activated by pathogens and specific cytokines, naive CD4+ T cells develop into TH-17 cells that produce IL-17 and release it to the surroundings (13Bettelli E. Korn T. Oukka M. Kuchroo V.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). IL-17 can stimulate epithelial cells to synthesize cytokines such as IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor as well as chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL8 (IL-8) (14Fossiez F. Djossou O. Chomarat P. Flores-Romo L. Ait-Yahia S. Maat C. Pin J.J. Garrone P. Garcia E. Saeland S. Blanchard D. Gaillard C. Das Mahapatra B. Rouvier E. Golstein P. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. J. Exp.

It was recently demonstrated that IL-17 is also able to induce expression of antimicrobial proteins such as the murine orthologue of NGAL, 24p3/lipocalin 2, in mouse cells (16Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and hBD2 in some human cell systems (4Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that TNF-α can potentiate the expression of IL-17-induced lipocalin 2 expression (16Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether IL-17 could also induce synthesis of human NGAL. Here we demonstrate that co-stimulation of A549 cells with IL-17 and TNF-α results in strong up-regulation of NGAL, whereas neither of the two cytokines alone have an effect on NGAL expression. Furthermore, we found that induction of NGAL expression is dependent on NF-κB and its co-activator IκB-ζ but not on C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ. A549 (ATCC CCL-185) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. For transfection and/or induction with IL-17 and TNF-α (both eBioscience) or incubation with IL-1β or cycloheximide (both Sigma), 4 × 105 A549 cells were plated in a 10-cm dish and grown for 2 days before use. When stimulating with cytokines, the medium was changed to Ham's F-12 with 0.5% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin prior to the experiment. Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the concentration determined by spectrophotometry. For Northern blotting, 5 μg of RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (GE Healthcare), and hybridized as described (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed as described (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and developed with a Fuji BAS2500 PhosphorImager. The size of the mRNAs was determined by reference to 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA. The membranes were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS before rehybridization. The NGAL and β-actin cDNA probes have been described earlier (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). For quantitative assessments, the intensities of the NGAL signals were normalized to the hybridization intensity from a probe against β-actin. Reverse transcription of RNA to first strand cDNA was performed on 1 μl of RNA diluted in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. 1 μl of 50 μm random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) were added. The solution was denatured at 70 °C for 10 min followed by addition of 4 μl of 5 × First Strand Buffer (Promega), 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of RNAsin (Invitrogen), 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol (Promega), and 1 μl of SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The conditions for reverse transcription was incubation at 22 °C for 10 min, 45 °C for 45 min, and 98 °C for 5 min. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed on a MX 3000P Real Time PCR system (Stratagene) with the commercial gene expression assay Assay-on-demandTM (Applied Biosystems). The assays used were: LCN2 (NGAL), Hs00194353_m1; IL-8, Hs00174103_m1; IL-6, Hs00174131_m1; NFKBIZ (IκB-ζ), Hs00230071_m1; CEBPB (C/EBP-β), Hs00270923_s1; CEBPD (C/EBP-δ), Hs00270931_s1; and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) Hs99999905_m1. The promoter constructs pNGP1695CAT, pNGP1695(NF-κB)CAT, pNGP1695(C/EBP-1)CAT, pNGP1695(C/EBP-2)CAT, pNGP1695(NF-Y)CAT, and pNGP1695(AP-1)CAT are described elsewhere (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). pNGP1695(C/EBP 1 and 2) was made by use of the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) using pNGP1695(C/EBP-2)CAT as template and primers 5′- ACTCTCCCCGTCCCTCTGTCccGCCCAATCCTGACCAGGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACCTGGTCAGGATTGGGCggGACAGAGGGACGGGGAGAGT-3′ for site-directed mutagenesis (the altered bases in the mutant are shown as lowercase italic letters). The substitution mutants Sub C1 and Sub C2 are identical to pNGP1695(154/135) and pNGP1695(139/120) described in Ref. 1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar. The promoter construct Sub C1-C2 was made by PCR amplification with primers 5′-AGAATTCTTTCGTTCTTTGATCTTGCCAAGTGTTTCCGCAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGAATTCTCCGCTTCTCCGCTCGGACGGGGAGAGTGAGGG-3′, which anneal on pNGP1695CAT 33 bp apart on each side of C/EBP-1 and C/EBP-2, respectively. The entire plasmid was PCR amplified and the resulting PCR product digested with EcoRI (sequence shown in italics). Following re-ligation, a promoter construct was generated where the region of the LCN2 promoter with the two C/EBP sites was substituted by a nonsense sequence (underlined in the primers). The plasmid with 4 tandem repeats of the IL-8 NF-κB site (IL-8(NF-κB × 4)) has been described previously (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The plasmid with 4 tandem repeats of the IL-6 NF-κB site (IL-6(NF-κB × 4)) was made by digestion of the pCAT3-promoter plasmid (Promega) with BglII and NheI and ligation of a double-stranded DNA fragment formed by annealing primers 5′-CTAGC(AATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGA)4A-3′ and 5′-GATCT(TCATGGGAAAATCCCACATT)4G-3′. By annealing the two oligoes, an overhang resembling DNA digested with BglII and NheI was formed. All promoter mutations were verified by sequencing. The 24p3 (Lcn2) promoter constructs 24p3–282-Luc, 24p3–282-κBm-Luc, and 24p3–282-C/EBPm-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Sarah Gaffen, University of Pittsburg (17Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All siRNAs were purchased as pre-designed SilencerTM siRNAs from Ambion. For knockdown of IκB-ζ, an siRNA (siκB) (ID number 33380) was used, which we previously found very efficient against IκB-ζ mRNA (18Cowland J.B. Muta T. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Two siRNAs against C/EBP-β (siB1 (ID number 42013) and siB2 (ID number 42089)) and two siRNAs against C/EBP-δ (siD1 (ID number 45017) and siD2 (ID number 15987)) were found to efficiently knock down their cognate transcripts. A Silencer Negative Control number 1 siRNA (Ambion) was included as control for any nonspecific effects of siRNA treatment. For experiments with siRNA, transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections involving only plasmid DNA were performed by use of Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For promoter studies, 0.8 μg of the CAT plasmid promoter construct was co-transfected with 0.2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-Luc plasmid (19de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. M. Schuster, Gene Therapy Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Denmark) to compensate for differences in transfection efficiency. Expression of the reporter enzymes was quantitated by CAT ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) and Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For each sample the CAT activity was normalized to firefly luciferase activity. For analysis of the 24p3 promoter 0.8 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid was co-transfected with 0.2 μg of the plasmid pGL4.74 (Promega) expressing Renilla luciferase for normalization of the transfection. Expression of the luciferase was determined by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Nuclear proteins were prepared from A549 cells (either unstimulated or stimulated for 1½ h with IL-17 and TNF-α) as previously described (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.9), containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml of nuclease-free BSA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. If competitor oligos were included, the nuclear extract was added following a 20-min preincubation period. For supershift analysis 1 μl of antibody against C/EBP-β (sc-150X), C/EBP-δ (sc-151X), C/EBP-ϵ (sc-158X), NF-κB p50 (sc-114X), or NF-κB p65 (sc-109X) (all Santa Cruz) were added. All incubations were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and subsequently dried and autoradiographed. The oligoes used for EMSA were (only the sequence of the upper strand of the double-stranded probe/competitor is shown): NGAL-κB, 5′-CACTCCGGGAATGTCCCTCACT-3′; NGAL-κB*, 5′-CACTCCAATAATGTCCCTCACT-3′; C1, 5′-CTCTGTCTTGCCCAATCCTGAC-3′; C1*, 5′-CTCTGTCCCGCCCAATCCTGAC-3′; C2, 5′-TGACCAGGTGCAGAAATCTTGC-3′; C2*, 5′-TGACCAGGTGCAGGGATCTTGC-3′; cons. κB, 5′-GATCCGGGGACTTTCCATGGATGGGGACTTTCCATGG-3′; and CRP, 5′-TACATAGTGGCGCAAAGTGATAT-3′. NGAL was quantitated by ELISA as described previously (21Kjeldsen L. Koch C. Arnljots K. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 198: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IL-8 was quantitated with the IL-8 opti-EIA ELISA kit (Pharmingen), and IL-6 was measured with the Ready-SET-Go ELISA (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For immunodetection, the proteins were separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to a TransBlot nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk and washed four times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% BSA. The primary antibodies (C/EBP-β (sc-150), C/EBP-δ (sc-151), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sc-20357), all from Santa Cruz) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% BSA and then washed four times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% BSA. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako P0448)), washed four times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% BSA, and visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Thermo Scientific). For incubation with anti-IκB-ζ (Cell Signaling number 9244), the membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) containing 5% skimmed milk according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The membranes were washed four times for 5 min with TBS/T, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in TBS/T plus 5% BSA, washed four times for 5 min with TBS/T, incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit) in TBS/T with 5% skimmed milk, and finally washed four times for 5 min with TBS/T before detection of the proteins by chemiluminescence. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The significance of differences between two groups was determined by the Welch t test. Statistical significance was reported if p < 0.05 was achieved. We previously demonstrated that transcription of the human LCN2 promoter is strongly up-regulated by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in A549 cells, whereas no response is observed upon stimulation with TNF-α (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the gene encoding the murine orthologue of NGAL (24p3/lipocalin 2), as expression of this gene (Lcn2) can be induced by TNF-α (16Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 22Klausen P. Niemann C.U. Cowland J.B. Krabbe K. Borregaard N. Eur. J. Haematol. 2005; 75: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that transcription of the murine Lcn2 gene was synergistically up-regulated in the osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 when stimulated with a combination of TNF-α and IL-17 (16Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For this reason we speculated whether it would be possible to induce expression of the human LCN2 gene by stimulation of cells with TNF-α in the presence of IL-17. To investigate this, A549 cells were incubated with TNF-α and/or IL-17 for 24 h followed by RNA purification and Northern blot analysis. Cells stimulated with IL-1β were included as a positive control for NGAL induction. As seen in Fig. 1, strong induction of NGAL mRNA was observed in cells stimulated with IL-17 and TNF-α or IL-1β. A 15-fold increase in NGAL mRNA was measured in cells co-stimulated with IL-17 and TNF-α, whereas no effect was seen when the cells were stimulated with either of the two cytokines. A second experiment, where the amount of NGAL secreted from A549 cells to the medium was measured over a 48-h period, demonstrated than IL-17 combined with TNF-α also induced NGAL protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). IL-8 was included as control (Fig. 1D), as was found previously to be induced by TNF-α alone in these cells (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To further investigate the time course of NGAL induction following IL-17 and TNF-α-stimulation, we measured transcript levels by real-time PCR during a 24-h period. Accumulation of NGAL mRNA was observed during the entire period of stimulation (Fig. 2A) in concordance with the NGAL protein levels depicted in Fig. 1C. As seen previously (1Cowland J.B. Sørensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), a rapid and sustained increase in IL-8 mRNA levels was found after stimulation with TNF-α (Fig. 2B). A 40–60-fold increase in the amount of IL-8 mRNA was also observed for cells administered IL-17 and TNF-α, whereas stimulation with IL-17 alone had no effect on IL-8 transcript levels. Recent data demonstrate that C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ are required for IL-17- and TNF-α-induced expression of the murine Lcn2 gene (17Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and for this reason we analyzed the mRNA profiles for these two transcription factors. A 2–3-fold increase of both C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ mRNAs was observed for cells growing in the presence of TNF-α. The transcript for C/EBP-β remained elevated during the entire stimulation period, whereas the amount of C/EBP-δ mRNA peaked at 1½ h and then declined to the background level from 3 h and onwards (Fig. 2, C and D). Because C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ are reported to be involved in IL-17- and TNF-α-induced expression of the murine Lcn2 promoter (17Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of knocking down the mRNAs for these two transcription factors. Two different siRNAs against C/EBP-β (Fig. 3A, siB1 and siB2) were found to reduce the level of C/EBP-β mRNA significantly. Compared with unstimulated cells, a 2–2½-fold increase in the transcript level was observed for C/EBP-β mRNA in untreated and control siRNA-treated cells at 2 h post-induction (Fig. 3A). This is in agreement with the data in Fig. 2C. In contrast, the amount of C/EBP-β mRNA in stimulated cells that had received siB1 or siB2 was about one-third of that found in unstimulated cells and consequently less than 20% of that seen for stimulated cells that were untransfected or transfected with control siRNA. The amount of C/EBP-β protein was significantly reduced in the cells treated with siB1 and siB2 (Fig. 3B) and the treatment affected both the 35- and 20-kDa forms of C/EBP-β (23Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In the following experiments only data for siB1 are shown but similar results were obtained with siB2. At 2 h post-induction, the amount of C/EBP-β in cells receiving siB1 was about one-third of that seen in untransfected and Cntl siRNA-treated cells, whereas the amounts of C/EBP-δ and IL-8 mRNAs were similar in all three stimulated cell populations (Fig. 3C). As expression of IL-6 is induced by C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ (24Hu H.M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar) we included a measurement of the IL-6 mRNA level in our study to determine whether an effect of knocking down C/EBP-β could be measured. This was found to be the case as the level of IL-6 mRNA was severely diminished in cells treated with siB1 for 2 h (Fig. 3C). When examining the transcript profiles 24 h after co-stimulation with TNF-α + IL-17 the amount of C/EBP-β in siB1-treated cells was also found to be about one-third of that seen in the two other cytokine-treated cell populations that had not been treated with siB1. Also the amount of IL-6 mRNA was around one-third in the siB1-treated cells compared with the other two cell populations stimulated with cytokines. In contrast, the amount of C/EBP-δ, IL-8, and NGAL mRNA was unaffected by siB1 treatment as the amount of transcript was similar in all three stimulated cell populations. When measuring the amount of NGAL, IL-6, and IL-8 in the medium of siRNA-treated cells, the same pattern was observed as for the mRNAs (Fig. 3, D and E). Transfection with siB1 did not diminish the level of either NGAL or IL-8 in the medium, whereas the amount of IL-6 was one-third of that observed for untreated and Cntl siRNA-transfected cells following cytokine stimulation (Fig. 3E). A similar series of experiments was performed with siRNAs against C/EBP-δ mRNA. A reduction in mRNA levels to 20- 25% of that observed for control-transfected and untransfected cells was observed for the two siRNAs, siD1 and siD2, both of which target C/EBP-δ mRNA (Fig. 4A). A similar effect on the C/EBP-δ protein levels was observed as demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 4B). Results for siD1-treated cells are shown in the following, but comparable data were found when transfecting with siD2. When measured at 2 h post-induction, siD1-treated cells showed a significant reduction in the amount of C/EBP-δ and IL-6 mRNAs, whereas the amounts of the C/EBP-β and IL-8 mRNAs were at a"
https://openalex.org/W1969181545,"Testes size is used as a proxy of male intrasexual competition, with larger testes indicative of greater competition. It has been shown that in some taxa, social mating systems reflect variance in testes size, but results are not consistent, and instead it has been suggested that genetic patterns of mating may reflect testes size. However, there are different measures of genetic patterns of mating. Multiple paternity rates are the most widely used measure but are limited to species that produce multi-offspring litters, so, at least for group living species, other measures such as loss of paternity to males outside the social group (extra group paternity) or the proportion of offspring sired by the dominant male (alpha paternity) might be appropriate. This study examines the relationship between testes size and three genetic patterns of mating: multiple paternity, extragroup paternity and alpha paternity.Using data from mammals, phylogenetically corrected general linear models demonstrate that both multiple paternity and alpha paternity, but not extra group paternity, relate to testes size. Testes size is greater in species with high multiple paternity rates, whereas the converse is found for alpha paternity. Additionally, length of mating season, ovulation mode and litter size significantly influenced testes size in one model.These results demonstrate that patterns of mating (multiple paternity and alpha paternity rates) determined by genetic analysis can provide reliable indicators of male postcopulatory intrasexual competition (testes size), and that other variables (length of mating season, ovulation mode, litter size) may also be important."
https://openalex.org/W2000840673,"A novel swine-origin pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm, also referred to as S-OIV) was identified as the causative agent of the 21(st) century's first influenza pandemic, but molecular features conferring its ability of human-to-human transmission has not been identified. Here we compared the protein sequences of 2009 H1N1pdm strains with those causing other pandemics and the viruses isolated from humans, swines and avians, and then analyzed the mutation trend of the residues at the signature and non-signature positions, which are species- and non-species-associated, respectively, in the proteins of H1N1pdm during the pandemic of 2009. We confirmed that the host-specific genomic signatures of 2009 H1N1pdm, which are mainly swine-like, were highly identical to those of the 1918 H1N1pdm. During the short period of time when the pandemic alert level was raised from phase 4 to phase 6, one signature residue at the position of NP-100 mutated from valine to isoleucine. Four non-signature residues, at positions NA-91, NA-233, HA-206, and NS1-123, also changed during the epidemic in 2009. All these mutant residues, except that at NA-91, are located in the viral functional domains, suggesting that they may play roles in the human adaption and virulence of 2009 H1N1pdm."
https://openalex.org/W1972325849,"In addition to its endocytic function, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) also contributes to cell signaling events. In the current study, the potential of LRP1 to modulate the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway was investigated. PDGF is a key regulator of cell migration and proliferation and mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 within its cytoplasmic domain. In WI-38 fibroblasts, PDGF-mediated LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred at 37 °C but not at 4 °C, where endocytosis is minimized. Furthermore, blockade of endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, also prevented PDGF-mediated LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence studies revealed co-localization of LRP1 with the PDGF receptor after PDGF treatment within endosomal compartments, whereas surface biotinylation experiments confirmed that phosphorylated LRP1 primarily originates from intracellular compartments. Together, the data reveal the association of these two receptors in endosomal compartments where they form a signaling complex. To study the contribution of LRP1 to PDGF signaling, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP1 and identified phenotypic changes in these cell lines in response to PDGF stimulation by performing phospho-site profiling. Of 38 phosphorylated proteins analyzed, 8 were significantly different in LRP1 deficient fibroblasts and were restored when LRP1 was expressed back in these cells. Importantly, the results revealed that LRP1 expression is necessary for PDGF-mediated activation of ERK. Overall, the studies reveal that LRP1 associates with the PDGF receptor in endosomal compartments and modulates its signaling properties affecting the MAPK and Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways.

Gallini R. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1276-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). The use of gene-deleted mice has identified unique roles for each component during development. For example, these studies have revealed an important contribution of PDGF-A to lung growth and the formation of alveoli (2Boström H. Willetts K. Pekny M. Levéen P. Lindahl P. Hedstrand H. Pekna M.

In addition to its important contribution to development, the PDGF signaling pathway plays an important role in pathophysiological processes. Thus, enhanced activation of the PDGF signaling pathway is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, vascular injury-induced restenosis, angiogenesis, and fibrosis (5Levitzki A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A significant contribution of PDGF to vascular remodeling was confirmed by studies demonstrating that neointimal smooth muscle cell accumulation was reduced by administration of either PDGF-B (6Ferns G.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) or PDGFR neutralizing antibodies (7Giese N.A. Marijianowski M.M.

Conversely, expression of PDGF-B in the vasculature leads to increased SMC proliferation and intima thickening (9Nabel E.G. Yang Z. Liptay S. San H. Gordon D. Haudenschild C.C. Nabel G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1822-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A major consequence of the PDGF-signaling pathway is induction of cell proliferation. Studies have shown that the PDGF-mitogenic effect requires two distinct phases of signaling (10Balciunaite E. Jones S. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The first pulse of PDGF-mediated signaling moves the cell through the initial segment of the G0 to S interval and renders the cells responsive to a second pulse of growth factor. This first phase occurs within 30 min upon growth factor addition and requires activation of the ERK pathway and induction of the transcription factor c-Myc. The second phase of PDGF signaling, which occurs at prolonged exposure to PDGF, requires activation of protein kinase C that is necessary for progression into the S-phase. Recent studies have found that the PDGF signaling pathway is modulated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (12Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). LRP1 is a large endocytic receptor that binds numerous ligands and is involved in a variety of physiological processes (13Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 14Lillis A.P. Van Duyn L.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Strickland D.K. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 887-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of the LRP1 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells causes PDGFR overexpression and excessive activation of this signaling pathway resulting in proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and increased susceptibility to the development of atherosclerosis (12Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LRP1 affects PDGF signaling pathway is poorly understood but may involve the ability of LRP1 to regulate the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway (15Huang S.S.

This in turn alters its ability to bind to adaptor proteins, such as Shc, which are involved in signaling pathways (19Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D.

LRP1 has been shown to be required for PDGF-stimulated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (21Li Y. Lu W. Bu G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that LRP1 may be an important component of signaling complexes assembled upon PDGF receptor activation and may provide a spatial and temporal resolution as well as specificity for the PDGF signaling pathway. Studies in the current investigation were designed to test this possibility. Our results indicate that the recombinant PDGFR-β kinase domain directly catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 cytoplasmic domain and that this event occurs within endosomal compartments upon internalization of these two receptors. By employing a phosphoprotein scan, we discovered that PDGF stimulation of fibroblasts requires LRP1 to mediate ERK activation, revealing that LRP1 modulates the PDGF signaling pathway. WI-38 fibroblasts were purchased from the ATCC. LRP1+/− (PEA-10), LRP1−/− (PEA-13), and B41 clones (LRP1−/− transfected with human LRP1) have been described (22Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S.

Rabbit anti-LRP1 IgG R2629 was prepared as described (18Newton C.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Ranganathan S. Gao Y. Haudenschild C. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

The media was then replaced with DMEM, and the cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated with various concentrations of PDGF-B (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The cells were lysed in the homogenization buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were then incubated overnight with specific antibodies and washed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Antibody binding to the immunoblots was detected by incubation with an appropriate IRDye® (LI-COR Biosciences)-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. ∼80% confluent human primary fibroblasts (WI-38) were chilled to 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were incubated with or without PDGF-B for 1 h at 4 °C. Half of the PDGF-B treated cells were shifted to 37 °C for 7 min. Protein-protein interactions were stabilized by incubation with 3 mg/ml dimethyl dithiobispropionimidate (Thermoscientific) cross-linker for 2 h at 4 °C. All cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and LRP1 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-LRP1 polyclonal antibody (R2629). Immunocomplexes were pulled down with Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and eluted in 1% SDS, 24 mm dithiothreitol by boiling for 5 min. Elutants were alkylated by addition α-iodoacetamine to 0.1 m final concentration before immunoblot analysis. Purified GST-LRP1 intracellular domain (ICD) was incubated with recombinant active PDGFR-β kinase domain (PDGFR-β-kd Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 μm GST or 20 μm GST-LRP1-ICD was incubated with or without PDGFR-β-kd in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 1× SDS sample buffer and resolved on 4–12% SDS gel. Gel was fixed and exposed to x-ray film. To block dynamin-mediated endocytosis, cells were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin, dynasore (initially it was a generous gift from Dr. Kirchhausen, Immune Disease Institute, Boston, MA; later it was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were preincubated with 200 μm dynasore at 37 °C for 1 h in serum-free conditions before the addition of PDGF-B. Human primary fibroblasts (WI-38 cells) were grown on 12-well plates at 1 × 105/well density in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h before the experiment. Then they were incubated with or without 200 μm dynasore in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES for 1 h at 37 °C. All media were removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with HEPES with or without dynasore in the presence of labeled ligands. Cells were then incubated with 10 ng/ml 125I-labeled PDGF-B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 10 nm 125I-labeled RAP at 37 °C for 20 min. All media were removed; cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells that were incubated with RAP were released from the plate by incubating with trypsin/EDTA solution containing 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C. Released cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 4 min. Supernatant was removed, and radioactivity was measured for surface bound ligand. The pellet was redissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH, and radioactivity was measured representing internalized ligand. Cells incubated with PDGF-B were washed with 0.5 ml of 1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 2 min and removed, and the radioactivity measured represented cell surface-bound ligand. Cells on the plate were lysed with 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH, and lysate was measured for radioactivity representing internalized ligand. Human primary fibroblasts (WI38 cells) were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until subconfluent. Cells were then serum-starved for 18 h before the experiment. To label LRP molecules undergoing endocytosis, monoclonal anti-LRP1 antibody 5A6 (60 nm) conjugated with Alexa-488 was added to the media and incubated with cells for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were chilled on ice for 45 min. PDGF-B (40 nm) was then added to the media, and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min followed by washing and raising the temperature to 37 °C for 12 min. The cells were then fixed in ice-cold methanol, permeabilized with ice-cold acetone, and immunostained with goat anti-hPDGFRβ (R&D, AF385). For the triple-label co-localization experiments, the following antibodies were used: affinity-purified rabbit anti-LRP1 antibody (R2629), goat anti-hPDGFR β (R&D, AF385), mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1, and anti-Rab11 (both BD Transduction Laboratories). Donkey Alexa-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat secondary antibodies were used (all from Invitrogen). Stained coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem) and viewed with laser scanning system Radiance 2100 (Zeiss/Bio-Rad) equipped with the argon/krypton (488/568 nm) and red diode (638 nm) lasers. The images were acquired and stored in RAW format using LaserSharp2000 software (Zeiss, Inc.). The images were exported into TIFF format and processed by Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems) for publication. Adjustments of brightness and contrast were made for the entire image. Identical adjustments were made to both “single channel” and “merged” images. Total cell lysates were prepared according protocols established by KinexusTM Multi-immunoblotting protocol. Briefly, cells were scraped in homogenization buffer described above, sonicated 4 times for 10 s each, and then centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman tabletop TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Supernatant (detergent-solubilized lysate) protein concentration was quantified by BCA protein assay reagent (Thermo-Scientific). 500 μg of total cell lysate were subjected to protein phosphorylation analysis, which detects 38 cell signaling molecules using KinexusTM KCPS-1.3 phosphoprotein profiling screen (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp. in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The experiment was performed in duplicate. 150-mm plates of subconfluent WI38 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h before the experiment. Chilled cells were labeled with EZ-link biotin (Pierce) for 1 h, and unbound biotin was removed by washing cells with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. Then the cells were incubated for 10 min in 37 °C DMEM with or without 40 nm PDGF-B. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and LRP1 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-LRP1 polyclonal antibody (R2629) conjugated to Sepharose. LRP1 was then eluted from the immuno-Sepharose with 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 2.5, and the biotinylated pool of LRP1 was precipitated by Neutravidin-Sepharose. LRP1 that was not bound to the Neutravidin-Sepharose was concentrated using StrataClean resin (Stratagene, Inc.). The biotin-labeled and unlabeled LRP1 pools were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-phospho-Tyr (4G10-HRP) and monoclonal anti-LRP1 (11H4). LRP1+/−, LRP1−/−, and B41 mouse fibroblasts were seeded at 1.5 × 104/cm2 density on fibronectin-coated plates and were incubated overnight in DMEM media containing pyruvate, 25 mm HEPES, 1× ITS (insulin, transferring, sodium selenite; Sigma), and 0.05% fetal bovine serum. After treatment with 1 ng/ml PDGF for 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and counted. To test whether or not the PDGFR-β can directly mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP1 cytoplasmic domain, we incubated the purified GST-LRP1-ICD with the PDGFR-β kinase domain in the presence of [α-32P]ATP. The results, shown in Fig. 1A, reveal that the PDGFR-β kinase domain readily catalyzed the incorporation of 32P into the GST-LRP1-ICD (Fig. 1A, lane 3) but not into GST alone (Fig. 1A, lane 2). These results reveal that the PDGFR-β is capable of directly mediating the phosphorylation of the LRP1 cytoplasmic domain. In a prior study (19Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D. Ulery P.G. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) we noted that the addition of PDGF-B to WI-38 fibroblasts cultured at 37 °C resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR-β. In contrast, LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation peaked much later after the addition of PDGF (19Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D. Ulery P.G. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that PDGFR-β internalization may be a prerequisite for LRP1 phosphorylation. To identify the cellular compartments where PDGF-mediated phosphorylation of LRP1 can occur, we performed studies under conditions that allowed activation of the PDGFR-β but prevented receptor internalization. This was accomplished by incubating the cells at 4 °C, a temperature where endocytosis is minimized and does not occur (24Silverstein S.C. Steinman R.M. Cohn Z.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 669-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). In our experiments WI-38 fibroblasts were incubated with PDGF at either 4 or 37 °C, and the extent of LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation assessed by immunoprecipitation was followed by immunoblotting. The results (Fig. 1B) reveal that whereas PDGF readily mediated the phosphorylation of LRP1 at 37 °C, no tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 was detected at 4 °C, as equivalent amounts of LRP1 were loaded on the gels as assessed by anti-LRP1 immunoblotting (lower panel, Fig. 1B). Even when cells were incubated for extended time periods with PDGF at 4 °C, only trace amounts of LRP1-tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 1C). To measure the time course of PDGFR-β activation and LRP1-tyrosine phosphorylation, we first preincubated cells with PDGF-B at 4 °C and then washed the cells and added media prewarmed to 37 °C. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of both LRP1 and the PDGFR-β was measured while maintaining the temperature at 37 °C. The results (Fig. 1D) reveal that even at 4 °C, the PDGFRβ is fully phosphorylated, consistent with previous work revealing that autophosphorylation of the PDGFRβ occurs at this temperature (25Frackelton Jr., A.R. Tremble P.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7909-7915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 was detected when the cells were maintained at 4 °C. Upon raising the temperature to 37 °C, however, we noted that LRP1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner with peak tyrosine phosphorylation occurring around 15 min, a progression similar to that reported earlier (19Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D. Ulery P.G. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Several PDGF-mediated events that occur upon interaction of this growth factor with its cellular receptor at 37 °C also occur when the temperature is reduced to 4 °C. These include receptor dimerization (26Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Khire J. Das M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), autophosphorylation (25Frackelton Jr., A.R. Tremble P.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7909-7915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipase Cγ association and phosphorylation (27Kumjian D.A. Wahl M.I. Rhee S.G. Daniel T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Wahl M.I. Olashaw N.E. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Pledger W.J. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2934-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To identify the PDGF-mediated signaling events that occur at 4 °C, we examined the extent of PDGFR-β autophosphorylation and components of various signaling pathways at 37 and 4 °C. The results confirm that the PDGFR-β is autophosphorylated at 4 °C. Furthermore, some but not all of the signaling pathways that are triggered by this receptor are activated at this low temperature. Thus, whereas we found that Shc is phosphorylated when cells are maintained at 4 °C (data not shown), we also noted that ERK is not activated at 4 °C and requires the cells to be at 37 °C for activation to occur (Fig. 1E). Dynamin functions in membrane fusion and is essential for clathrin-dependent endocytosis (29Mettlen M. Pucadyil T. Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, a potent and highly specific non-competitive inhibitor of dynamin GTPase activity was identified that blocks dynamin-dependent endocytosis in cells (30Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 31Newton A.J. Kirchhausen T. Murthy V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of this inhibitor, termed dynasore, to prevent the internalization of LRP1. The results (Fig. 2A) show that dynasore completely blocked LRP1-mediated internalization of 125I-labeled RAP. The effect was reversible, and removing dynasore from the media allowed uptake of RAP (data not shown). The PDGFR-β undergoes ligand-stimulated endocytosis, and to determine if its internalization is also blocked by dynasore, we conducted experiments with 125I-labeled PDGF. The results (Fig. 2B) reveal that dynasore also blocked the internalization of 125I-labeled PDGF. Having confirmed that dynasore blocks the endocytosis of both LRP1 and the PDGFR-β, we determined if PDGF-mediated LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also blocked by dynasore. The results (Fig. 2C) confirm that LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation was completely blocked by dynasore. As expected, PDGF-mediated activation of the PDGFR-β was not affected by dynasore, but activation of ERK was inhibited (Fig. 2C). To confirm that LRP1 co-localizes with the PDGFR-β after endocytosis, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. In these experiments, fibroblasts were first chilled to 4 °C, and then LRP1 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PDGFR-β. These results revealed that very little PDGFR-β co-immunoprecipitated with LRP1 without prior PDGFR-β activation and when the cells were chilled to 4 °C to prevent endocytosis (Fig. 2D, lane 1). In a second experiment PDGF was added to the chilled cells, and then cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Whereas this induced phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor, very little PDGF receptor co-immunoprecipitated with LRP1 (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Only when the PDGFR-β was first activated by PDGF at 4 °C, and then the temperature raised to 37 °C, did significant amounts of PDGFR-β co-immunoprecipitate with LRP1 (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Prior experiments revealed prominent co-localization of the PDGFR-β and LRP1 in punctate structures presumed to represent endosomal compartments 15 min after PDGF addition to cells at 37 °C (18Newton C.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Ranganathan S. Gao Y. Haudenschild C. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27872-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To identify the cellular compartment where co-localization of these two receptors occurs, cells were first incubated with the LRP1 monoclonal antibody 5A6 at 37 °C to label the LRP1 involved in endocytosis. This antibody binds to the LRP1 light chain and does not dissociate during receptor recycling. The cells were then chilled to 4 °C and incubated with PDGF for 1 h at this temperature to activate PDGFR-β on the cell surface. Internalization of the PDGFR-β was initiated by raising the temperature to 37 °C for 12 min before fixing the cells and staining for PDGFR-β. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 and reveal extensive co-localization of the PDGFR-β and LRP1 in punctate structures. There was no co-localization of LRP1 with the PDGFR-β b"
https://openalex.org/W2023015944,"Molecular and morphological evidence unite the hemichordates and echinoderms as the Ambulacraria, but their earliest history remains almost entirely conjectural. This is on account of the morphological disparity of the ambulacrarians and a paucity of obvious stem-groups. We describe here a new taxon Herpetogaster collinsi gen. et sp. nov. from the Burgess Shale (Middle Cambrian) Lagerstätte. This soft-bodied vermiform animal has a pair of elongate dendritic oral tentacles, a flexible stolon with an attachment disc, and a re-curved trunk with at least 13 segments that is directed dextrally. A differentiated but un-looped gut is enclosed in a sac suspended by mesenteries. It consists of a short pharynx, a conspicuous lenticular stomach, followed by a narrow intestine sub-equal in length. This new taxon, together with the Lower Cambrian Phlogites and more intriguingly the hitherto enigmatic discoidal eldoniids (Cambrian-Devonian), form a distinctive clade (herein the cambroernids). Although one hypothesis of their relationships would look to the lophotrochozoans (specifically the entoprocts), we suggest that the evidence is more consistent with their being primitive deuterostomes, with specific comparisons being made to the pterobranch hemichordates and pre-radial echinoderms. On this basis some of the earliest ambulacrarians are interpreted as soft-bodied animals with a muscular stalk, and possessing prominent tentacles."
https://openalex.org/W2122663740,"A cancer/testis antigen, CAGE, is widely expressed in various cancer tissues and cancer cell lines but not in normal tissues except the testis. In the present study, ectopic expression of CAGE in fibroblast cells resulted in foci formation, suggesting its cell-transforming ability. Using stable HeLa transfectant clones with the tetracycline-inducible CAGE gene, we found that CAGE overexpression stimulated both anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth in vitro and promoted tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Cell cycle analysis showed that CAGE augments the levels of cyclin D1 and E, thereby activating cyclin-associated cyclin-dependent kinases and subsequently accelerating the G1 to S progression. Moreover, increased cyclin D1 and E levels in CAGE-overexpressing cells were observed even in a growth arrested state, indicating a direct effect of CAGE on G1 cyclin expression. CAGE-induced expression of cyclins D1 and E was found to be mediated by AP-1 and E2F-1 transcription factors, and among the AP-1 members, c-Jun and JunD appeared to participate in CAGE-mediated up-regulation of cyclin D1. CAGE overexpression also enhanced retinoblastoma phosphorylation and subsequent E2F-1 nuclear translocation. In contrast, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CAGE suppressed the expression of G1 cyclins, activation of AP-1 and E2F-1, and cell proliferation in both HeLa cervical cancer cells and Malme-3M melanoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2115453265,"Background Since the discovery that mutations in the enzyme SOD1 are causative in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), many strategies have been employed to elucidate the toxic properties of this ubiquitously expressed mutant protein, including the generation of GFP-SOD1 chimaeric proteins for studies in protein localization by direct visualization using fluorescence microscopy. However, little is known about the biochemical and physical properties of these chimaeric proteins, and whether they behave similarly to their untagged SOD1 counterparts. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we compare the physicochemical properties of SOD1 and the effects of GFP-tagging on its intracellular behaviour. Immunostaining demonstrated that SOD1 alone and GFP-SOD1 have an indistinguishable intracellular distribution in PC12 cells. Cultured primary motor neurons expressing GFP or GFP-SOD1 showed identical patterns of cytoplasmic expression and of movement within the axon. However, GFP tagging of SOD1 was found to alter some of the intrinsic properties of SOD1, including stability and specific activity. Evaluation of wildtype and mutant SOD1, tagged at either the N- or C-terminus with GFP, in PC12 cells demonstrated that some chimaeric proteins were degraded to the individual proteins, SOD1 and GFP. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that most, but not all, properties of SOD1 remain the same with a GFP tag."
https://openalex.org/W2046105954,"A tumor promoting role of macrophages has been described for a transgenic murine breast cancer model. In this model tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a major component of the leukocytic infiltrate and are associated with tumor progression. Shigella flexneri is a bacterial pathogen known to specificly induce apotosis in macrophages. To evaluate whether Shigella-induced removal of macrophages may be sufficient for achieving tumor regression we have developed an attenuated strain of S. flexneri (M90TDeltaaroA) and infected tumor bearing mice. Two mouse models were employed, xenotransplantation of a murine breast cancer cell line and spontanous breast cancer development in MMTV-HER2 transgenic mice. Quantitative analysis of bacterial tumor targeting demonstrated that attenuated, invasive Shigella flexneri primarily infected TAMs after systemic administration. A single i.v. injection of invasive M90TDeltaaroA resulted in caspase-1 dependent apoptosis of TAMs followed by a 74% reduction in tumors of transgenic MMTV-HER-2 mice 7 days post infection. TAM depletion was sustained and associated with complete tumor regression.These data support TAMs as useful targets for antitumor therapy and highlight attenuated bacterial pathogens as potential tools."

This prevents aneuploidy and associated genetic instability that result from anaphase commencing prior to the proper bi-orientation of replicated chromosomes.

BubR1 inhibits APC/C activity during metaphase as part of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) (Fig. 1A) (16Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The MCC is composed of BubR1, Bub3, Mad2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2), and Cdc20 (cell division cycle 20). Cdc20 is an essential APC/C co-factor that mediates the recognition of substrates that harbor short sequence motifs such as KEN boxes (consecutive lysine, glutamate, and asparagine residues) (17Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the MCC inhibits APC/C ubiquitin ligase activity by abrogating Cdc20 co-factor function (16Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Within the MCC, Cdc20 directly binds a conformer of Mad2 and the constitutive BubR1-Bub3 complex. These interactions are independently capable of APC/C-Cdc20 inhibition, although highest potency inhibition is achieved through simultaneous binding, likely because of Mad2 promotion of the BubR1-Cdc20 interaction (18Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Kulukian A. Han J.S. Cleveland D.W. Dev.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two complementary molecular mechanisms have been proposed for APC/C-Cdc20 inhibition by BubR1-Bub3 and Mad2. First is an inhibitory conformational shift of Cdc20, in which single particle electron microscopy reveals distinct orientations of Cdc20 when it is bound to the APC/C alone or as part of the MCC (21Herzog F. Primorac I. Dube P. Lenart P. Sander B. Mechtler K. Stark H. Peters J.M. Science. 2009; 323: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is possible that one of these orientations induces Cdc20 ubiquitin-mediated degradation (22Nilsson J. Yekezare M. Minshull J. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Second is competitive binding of BubR1 to substrate-binding sites of APC/C-Cdc20; BubR1 contains two conserved KEN boxes (human residues 26–28 and 304–306) that are essential for Cdc20 binding and cell viability and act to competitively block substrate binding to APC/C-Cdc20 (23Malureanu L.A.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This function of BubR1 is dependent upon PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor)-dependent acetylation at Lys250, which prevents BubR1 ubiquitin-mediated degradation (25Choi E. Choe H. Min J. Choi J.Y. Kim J. Lee H. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2077-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in the MCC, BubR1 is enriched and exchanged at kinetochores incorrectly/not attached to the mitotic spindle during metaphase (Fig. 1B) (26Howell B.J. Moree B. Farrar E.M. Stewart S. Fang G. Salmon E.D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 953-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Kinetochores are large proteinaceous complexes that form on centromeric chromatin and mediate microtubule binding (27Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The mechanistic links between BubR1 kinetochore enrichment and these activities, however, have yet to be deciphered. Regulated cycling between kinetochore-bound and MCC pools of BubR1, similar to that observed for Mad2, is thought not to occur (19Kulukian A. Han J.S. Cleveland D.W. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 105-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), whereas BubR1 interaction with the kinetochore protein Blinkin (Bub-linking) and microtubule binding, molecular motor CENP-E (centromeric protein E) may be important (30Mao Y.

Blinkin is vital for the formation of wild type kinetochore-microtubule interactions and interacts with an N-terminal α-helical region of BubR1 (32Kiyomitsu T. Obuse C. Yanagida M. Dev.

Cell. 2003; 114: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of BubR1 at the kinetochore is also likely to play a role (34Elowe S. Dulla K. Uldschmid A. Li X. Dou Z. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These links remain as conjecture as such mechanistic insight requires a detailed molecular understanding of BubR1. Molecular detail of BubR1 is not available as attempts to produce stable protein for high resolution structural studies have been hampered by BubR1 susceptibility to proteolysis, rendering such studies thus far unsuccessful (35Yoon J. Kang Y. Kim K. Park J. Kim Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 44: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 36Larsen N.A. Al-Bassam J. Wei R.R. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Insight into the structure of BubR1 can be gained by comparison with Bub1, which shows a similar overall domain organization and shares ligands Blinkin and Bub3 (Fig. 1C) (32Kiyomitsu T. Obuse C.

Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal α-helical region of budding yeast Bub1 has been solved and reveals a divergent tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (39Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Kiyomitsu T. D'Arcy S. Chirgadze D.Y. Grossmann J.G. Matak-Vinkovic D. Venkitaraman A.R. Yanagida M. Robinson C.V. Blundell T.L. Structure. 2009; 17: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis and biophysical studies, the N-terminal α-helical region of BubR1 is also expected to adopt a TPR fold (40Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Beaufils S. Renault A. Grossmann J.G.

In this study, we define the molecular architecture of the N-terminal region of human BubR1 and present the 1.8 Å crystal structure of human BubR1 residues 48–237 (BubR1(48–237)). These residues include a triple tandem arrangement of the TPR motif with predicted similarity to that found in budding yeast Bub1. We thus define the structural platform that mediates BubR1 interaction with Cdc20 in the MCC and Blinkin at the kinetochore. We further examine the molecular determinants of the interaction between BubR1 and Blinkin, revealing the presence of multiple discrete and potentially cooperative interactions along a groove of BubR1. Finally, we identify an interaction between BubR1 and Bub1 mediated by regions C-terminal to their TPR domains. These data are invaluable for future studies aimed at defining the precise roles of kinetochore-bound and MCC pools of BubR1 in the SAC in vivo. Human gene fragments encoding for BubR1 full-length (BubR1fl), residues 1–237 (BubR1(1–237)) and residues 238–1050 (BubR1(238–1050)) (GenBankTM accession number AAD11941), Bub1 full-length (Bub1fl), residues 1–189 (Bub1(1–189)) and residues 189–1085 (Bub1(189–1085)) (GenBankTM accession number AAC06259), Blinkin residues 1–728 (Blinkin(1–728)) (GenBankTM accession number AAM45143), and Bub3 full-length (Bub3fl) (GenBankTM accession number AAC06258) were cloned into pGBT9 and pGAD424 (Clontech). BubR1fl point mutants (P119A, L126A, R130A, S157A, E161A, and R165A) were created by overlapping primer extension methods and cloned to pGBT9. Yeast two-hybrid protocols were based on the Matchmaker 3 yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech), where the rate of yeast growth, the number of resultant colonies, and the intensity of X-gal reactions are directly related to the level of reporter gene activation (41MacDonald P.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 177: v-viiiPubMed Google Scholar). Using a polyethylene glycol/single-stranded DNA/LiAc procedure, pGBT9 vectors were transformed into the Y187 strain, and pGAD424 vectors were transformed into the AH109 strain. For mating, single colonies of Y187[pGTB9-bait] and AH109[pGAD424-target] were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 2× YPDA and incubated at 30 °C, 50 rpm for 24 h. Cultures were diluted 1 in 10 with 0.5× YPDA and 100 μl plated on SD/−Leu/−Trp (double dropout) and SD/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp (quadruple dropout) plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2, 3, or 5 days. Matings with BubR1fl mutants were also grown with 0–15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT; Sigma) on the quadruple dropout plates. Colonies were lifted onto filters (Whatman No. 5, 70 mm), lysed by two cycles of freeze-thaw and incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol containing 1 mg/ml X-gal (Promega) at 30 °C for 5 h. Shown filters are representative of at least three replicates performed with independent yeast transformants. For time course and 3-AT analysis, densitometry was performed by measuring mean pixel intensities of color-inverted scanned filters. The intensity of a relevant negative control, such as pGBT9-bait × pGAD424-empty, was subtracted from each value. “Relative intensity of interaction with Blinkin(1–728)” refers to (pGBT9-BubR1fl-mutant × pGAD424-Blinkin(1–728) at a particular day or 3-AT concentration) divided by ((pGBT9-BubR1fl-mutant × pGAD424-Blinkin(1–728)) at day 5 or with 0 mm 3-AT); likewise, “relative intensity of interaction with Bub3fl refers to ((pGBT9-BubR1fl-mutant × pGAD424-Bub3fl) at a particular day or 3-AT concentration) divided by ((pGBT9-BubR1fl-mutant × pGAD424-Bub3fl) at day 5 or with 0 mm 3-AT). Human gene fragments encoding for BubR1 residues 1–230 (BubR1(1–230)) and 1–280 (BubR1(1–280)) were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) with a PCR-introduced C-terminal His6 tag, whereas BubR1 residues 39–230 (BubR1(39–230)) and 48–237 (BubR1(48–237)) were cloned into pHAT4 (42Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) grown in 2× YT (Sigma) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin). The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Glutathione S-transferase fusions (BubR1(1–230) and BubR1(1–280)) and histidine tag fusions (BubR1(39–230) and BubR1(48–237)) were then purified by standard affinity chromatography and cleaved by overnight incubation with PreScissionTM (GE Healthcare) or tobacco etch virus protease, respectively. Protease, tag, and uncleaved fusion were removed by a second affinity chromatography step. BubR1(1–230) and BubR1(1–280) were further purified with Ni2+- nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, whereas BubR1(39–230) and BubR1(48–237) were further purified by ion exchange at pH 9.0 using a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). All proteins were polished with size exclusion chromatography. Proteins were biochemically and biophysically characterized as described in the supplemental material. BubR1(48–237) was concentrated to 9 mg/ml following size exclusion chromatography in 20 mm CHES, pH 9.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol. Reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 8.0, was then added at a final concentration of 1 mm and the sample used for crystallization. The best crystals were grown at 15 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with 140 μl of reservoir solution (22 g/100 ml of PEG 8000, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm praseodymium(III) acetate) and a 200-nl drop (equal volume of protein and reservoir solution) in a 96-well format (Greiner). The crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol (soaked for ∼1 min) and frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. Data were collected for two crystals at a wavelength of 1.06 Å at beam I03, Diamond Synchrotron Light Source, Oxford, UK, and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (43Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 44Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The structure of BubR1(48–237) was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion using praseodymium ions from the crystallization solution, found stably in the crystal lattice. Using data collected from crystal 1 (anomalous completeness of 100% and anomalous redundancy of 11.1), two praseodymium ions were found and refined using autoSHARP (45Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar). The final figure of merit was 0.82; the phasing power was 1.75, and the Rcullis was 0.66. Following density modification with 43.2% solvent content, these phases were used to calculate an initial map used for automated model building with ARP/wARP (46Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of model building and refinement were then carried out in COOT (47Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and REFMAC 5 (48Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using data collected from crystal 2, including a single cycle of Translation, Liberation, and Screw refinement with two groups (residues 57–114 and 115–220) identified by the TLMSD server (49Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). During refinement, 5% of reflections were kept aside for evaluation of Rfree. Residues 48–56, 92–95, and 221–237 are absent in the final model. PyMOL (DeLano Scientific) was used to create images. A major challenge in developing a molecular understanding of the SAC is establishing the structural basis of BubR1 kinetochore recruitment and APC/C-Cdc20 inhibition. We first set out to confirm the reported interaction between the N-terminal region of BubR1 and Blinkin and to investigate the interactions between BubR1 and functionally related proteins Bub1 and Bub3. Human sequences of full-length BubR1 (BubR1fl), BubR1(1–237), BubR1(238–1050), Bub1fl, Bub1(1–189), Bub1(189–1085), Blinkin(1–728), and Bub3fl were fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domains and GAL4 activator domains. Interactions were tested through the highly stringent Matchmaker 3 yeast two-hybrid system in which positive interactions were determined by independent activation of three reporter genes (HIS, ADE, and lacZ). In this system, the rate of yeast growth, the number of resultant colonies, and the intensity of X-gal reactions are directly related to the underlying level of reporter gene activation (41MacDonald P.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 177: v-viiiPubMed Google Scholar). BubR1(1–237) was found to interact with Blinkin(1–728) in a manner equivalent to that of full-length protein (Fig. 1D), confirming that Blinkin(1–728) forms contacts with the N-terminal region of BubR1. In contrast, interaction with Bub3fl was detected only for full-length BubR1 (Fig. 1D), consistent with the known Bub3-binding site downstream of the N-terminal region (36Larsen N.A. Al-Bassam J. Wei R.R. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Wang X. Babu J.R. Harden J.M. Jablonski S.A. Gazi M.H. Lingle W.L. de Groen P.C. Yen T.J. van Deursen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26559-26567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Related protein Bub1 showed a similar pattern of binding to Blinkin(1–728) through its N-terminal region and Bub3fl through a downstream region (Fig. 1D). We were regrettably unable to test interactions using pGBT9-Blinkin(1–728) and pGBT9-Bub1fl vectors due to insurmountable technical difficulties of autoactivation and toxicity, respectively. We thus conclude that the BubR1 N-terminal region interacts with Blinkin, whereas a more C-terminal region interacts with Bub3. The yeast two-hybrid experiments also indicate an interaction between BubR1 and Bub1 (Fig. 1, D and E). The interaction does not rely on the N-terminal region of Bub1 or BubR1, is retained upon deletion of the N-terminal regions, and specifically allows formation of a BubR1-Bub1 heterodimer but not a BubR1-BubR1 homodimer. Failure to detect a heterodimeric complex of BubR1(1–237) and Bub1(1–189) is consistent with in vitro analytical size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking analysis with recombinant proteins (data not shown). We thus conclude that BubR1 and Bub1 undergo heterodimerization through the interaction of distinct sequences in their C-terminal regions (Fig. 1, D and E). Our findings conflict with previously published yeast two-hybrid data suggesting both homo- and heterodimerization of BubR1 and Bub1 (32Kiyomitsu T. Obuse C. Yanagida M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We account for this through our observation that the BubR1fl GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion exhibits a low level of autoactivation that hampers investigations using only the lacZ reporter gene (supplemental Fig. S1) but is completely eliminated by the three independent reporter genes (HIS, ADE, and lacZ) employed in this study. The formation of a BubR1-Bub1 complex is consistent with reports that BubR1 kinetochore recruitment is dependent on Bub1 when the capacity of Blinkin to bind BubR1 is abrogated in vivo (32Kiyomitsu T. Obuse C. Yanagida M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We next investigated the molecular architecture of the BubR1 N-terminal region. To explore the presence of domain structure, recombinant human BubR1(1–280) was subjected to limited proteolysis using trypsin, which specifically cleaves peptide chains C-terminal to Lys and Arg residues. Despite Lys and Arg residues being distributed throughout BubR1(1–280), this identified protease-resistant fragments of ∼18 and 20 kDa (Fig. 2A). Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry peptide fragmentation analyses subsequently showed that these fragments contain residues Ile37–Arg199 or Arg202 and Ile37–Arg224, respectively, suggesting the presence of a folded domain within these limits. The trypsin cleavage site immediately downstream of Arg36 is Lys59, indicating that the N-terminal boundary of this folded domain lies between Ile37 and Lys59. This is supported by our observation that degradation products of BubR1(1–230) formed during purification are N-terminally truncated at residues Arg33, Ser39, Glu42, Gly43, Ala44, and Ala46 (shown by Edman degradation; data not shown). Interestingly, the N-terminal fragment cleaved from BubR1 is conserved in BubR1 but not Bub1 orthologues and contains one of the conserved KEN box motifs essential for interaction with Cdc20 (Fig. 3A) (23Malureanu L.A. Jeganathan K.B. Hamada M. Wasilewski L. Davenport J. van Deursen J.M. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 118-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similarly, the presence of protease-resistant fragments that undergo C-terminal cleavage at Arg199/202 or Arg224 suggests a mobile C-terminal region. One frequently sampled conformation of this region must constrain residues Arg199–Arg224 as cleavage at the intervening trypsin site Lys210 was not observed. Our analysis thus predicts a molecular architecture for the N-terminal region of BubR1 in which a folded domain is preceded by an N-terminal extension of 36–58 amino ac"

https://openalex.org/W1965510471,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the induction of adaptive and memory immune responses. Upon encounter with pathogens, they undergo a complex maturation process and migrate toward lymphoid organs where they stimulate immune effector cells. This process is associated with dramatic transcriptome changes, pointing to a paramount role for transcription factors in DC activation and function. The regulation and the role of these transcription factors are however ill-defined and require characterization. Among those, AP-1 is a family of dimeric transcription complexes with an acknowledged role in the control of immunity. However, it has not been studied in detail in DCs yet.Here, we have investigated the regulation and function of one of its essential components, JunB, in primary bone marrow-derived DCs induced to maturate upon stimulation by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data show fast and transient NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional induction of the junb gene correlating with the induction of the TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-12 proinflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of JunB protein induction by RNA interference hampered the transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p40 genes. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed LPS-inducible binding of JunB at AP-1-responsive sites found in promoter regions of these genes. Concomitant LPS-inducible NF-kappaB/p65 binding to these promoters was also observed.We identified a novel role for JunB--that is, induction of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-activated primary DCs with NF-kappaB acting not only as an inducer of JunB, but also as its transcriptional partner."

This experimentally observed immature aceGFP-G222E structure, characterized by the non-coplanar arrangement of the imidazolone and phenolic rings, has been attributed to one of the intermediate states in the GFP chromophore biosynthesis.

Chromoproteins are another large group of non-fluorescent counterparts of FPs that share with them the principal fold but not spectral properties (6Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V.

However, a number of artificially created, genetically engineered variants of chromoproteins do exhibit fluorescence (6Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I.

Biochem. 2002; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Members of both fluorescent and non-fluorescent families possess visible coloration corresponding to an absorption range of 450–610 nm. Extensive diversity of their photophysical characteristics arises mostly from variations in the chemical structure of the internal chromophore group and in the stereochemistry of its adjacent environment. The first identified member of a novel colorless non-fluorescent group of GFP-like proteins was acGFPL from jellyfish Aequorea coerulescens (9Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Pounkova N.I. Staroverov D.B. Bulina M.E. Yanushevich Y.G. Labas Y.A. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Its discovery suggested that many other species might express similar colorless FPs. It was found that a glycine replacement of Glu-222, a conserved residue adjacent to the chromophore, plays a key role in creating a fluorescent form of acGFPL. A variant of acGFPL, named aceGFP (commercial name AcGFP1 from Clontech), obtained by mutation of five residues that included mutating residue Glu-222 to a glycine, exhibited bright green fluorescence. The reverse single mutation G222E in aceGFP resulted in the colorless variant aceGFP-G222E that demonstrated no visible coloration and fluorescence, similarly to the wild type acGFPL. Detailed characterization of the purified aceGFP-G222E showed that only a minor fraction (about 3%) of this protein contains mature chromophore in the protonated state (absorption maximum at 390 nm), whereas the major fraction exhibits no absorption/fluorescence in the visible region, indicating the presence of an immature chromophore. Importantly, this immature protein can be converted into a green fluorescent state (similar to aceGFP, with excitation and emission maxima at 480 and 505 nm, respectively) by UV light illumination (λ = 250–300 nm). We have focused on the stereochemical features responsible for these unique properties. We present here the results of a high resolution x-ray study of the mutant variants of the colorless non-fluorescent progenitor acGFPL. The proteins that were investigated include the green fluorescent aceGFP (resolution 1.5 Å), the colorless aceGFP-G222E (resolution 1.14 Å), and UV-photoconverted aceGFP-G222E-(UV) (resolution 1.75 Å). The structural aspects of this study have been supported by site-directed mutagenesis and by spectroscopic characterization of three new mutant variants, namely aceGFP-Y220L, aceGFP-Y220F, and aceGFP-G222E-Y220L. The pQE30 plasmids with the corresponding vectors of aceGFP, aceGFP-Y220L/F, aceGFP-G222E, and aceGFP-G222E-Y220L were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3) cells. The proteins were expressed in 3 liters of LB medium by overnight incubation at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl and disrupted by sonication. Purification of each protein was performed on metal-affinity (TALON resin, Clontech) and size-exclusion (Superdex-200 (16/60), Amersham Biosciences) columns. All major purification steps were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl buffer. Prior to crystallization, aceGFP and aceGFP-G222E were transferred to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA buffer and concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml in 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff concentration units (Vivascience). Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Each crystallization drop consisted of 1 μl of protein solution mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and was incubated against 500 μl of reservoir solution. The hexagonal bipyramidal crystals of aceGFP, with visible green coloration, were obtained from 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, 2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 5.6, and the prismatic crystals of aceGFP-G222E were obtained from 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystal growth time varied from 1 week to 2 months. A crystal of the colorless aceGFP-G222E, surrounded by the mother liquor in its crystallization drop, was photoconverted to the green fluorescent state by 2 h of UV irradiation (254 nm) at 20 °C. X-ray diffraction data for aceGFP, aceGFP-G222E, and the UV-photoconverted aceGFP-G222E-(UV) were collected from single crystals flash-cooled in a 100 K nitrogen stream. Prior to cooling, the crystals were transferred to a cryo-protecting solution containing 20% glycerol and 80% reservoir solution. Data were collected with a MAR300 CCD detector at the SER-CAT beamline 22ID (Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and were processed with HKL2000 (10Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of the structure-based variants aceGFP-Y220F/L and aceGFP-222E-Y220L by site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the overlap extension method with primers containing the appropriate target substitutions (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Absorption and excitation-emission spectra of the purified proteins were recorded with a Varian Cary 100 UV-vis spectrophotometer and Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. A monomer (molecular mass ∼27 kDa) of aceGFP and aceGFP-G222E adopts a fold typical for all GFP-like proteins that consists of an 11-stranded β-barrel, with loop caps from both sides and a chromophore embedded in the middle of an internal α-helix going along the β-barrel axis. In the crystalline state, both proteins form dimers composed of two such monomers arranged in an antiparallel fashion, with an angle of ∼40° between the β-barrel axes. The aceGFP variant exhibits bright emission in the green spectral range (λex = 480 nm, λem = 505 nm; Fig. 1A). In contrast to wild type green fluorescent proteins, the important position 222, proximal to the chromophore, is occupied in aceGFP by an unusual Gly residue instead of the highly conserved catalytic Glu. Nevertheless the chromophore structure, matured from the Ser-65–Tyr-66–Gly-67 triad (Fig. 2), is identical to that present in wild type avGFP from Aequorea victoria (PDB ID: 1W7S) and cgGFP from Clytia gregaria (2HPW). The chromophore adopts a two-ring coplanar structure typical for GFP, consisting of a five-member imidazolone heterocycle having a p-hydroxybenzylidene substituent with the phenolic ring of Tyr-66 in cis-orientation to the Cα–N(66) bond. Tyr-66 exhibits trigonal planar geometry of bonds attached to the Cα atom and a double character of the Cα=Cβ bond, indicating the sp2 hybridization state of both atoms. Ser-65 is characterized by the sp3 hybridization of Cα, the single character of the Cα–N bond, and the trans-configuration of the preceding peptide bond.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of the wild type colorless progenitor acGFPL (A. coerulescens) with its green fluorescent variant aceGFP (five sites of mutation are shown in dark blue), WT avGFP (A. victoria), and WT cgGFP (C. gregaria).

The residues in the immediate chromophore environment are shown in red. The residues forming direct bonds and the residues mediated by water H-bonds (d ≤ 3.3Å) with chromophore are highlighted in yellow and light blue, respectively, and those making van der Waals contacts (d ≤ 3.9Å) are not highlighted.

Indeed, the crystal structure of aceGFP-G222E showed that the chromophore moiety is not fully matured. Here the posttranslational modification has terminated at the backbone cyclized state characterized by the non-coplanar, non-conjugated two-ring structure, with Tyr-66 in the native (non-oxidized) form. The single character of the Tyr-66 Cα–Cβ and Cβ–Cγ bonds, the tetrahedral geometry of bonds attached to the Cα atom, and the characteristic value of the torsion angle χ1 = −55° around the Cα–Cβ all unequivocally define the sp3 hybridization state of both the Cα and the Cβ atoms (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4a).FIGURE 4Chromophore geometry in the mutant variants. a, Ser-65–Tyr-66–Gly-67 in aceGFP (numbers/symbols shown in blue; oxidized Tyr-66 with sp2 hybridized Cα/Cβ) and aceGFP-G222E (numbers/symbols shown in red; native Tyr-66 with sp3 hybridized Cα/Cβ) (current study). b, Thr-65–His-66–Gly-67 in the reduced BFPsol (PDB ID: 2FWQ (32Barondeau D.P.

Glu-222 and another highly conserved residue, Arg-96, play an active catalytic role in the GFP-like proteins, facilitating oxidative chemistry in the posttranslational modification process (19Barondeau D.P.

Most of the proximal residues are involved in an extensive H-bond network interacting with the chromophore. The proximal waters (presumed reaction products of the maturation process) also participate in the network, mediating interactions between the residues. The network is apparently functionally important as a potential proton/electron wire in the maturation process. Interestingly, the carboxyl group of Glu-222 in the immature aceGFP-G222E exhibits ∼2 Å displacement relative to the corresponding position in the wild type green avGFP and cgGFP. This shift is stabilized by an H-bond with the Tyr-220 side chain and can be reproduced with ∼20, ∼30, and ∼35° torsion rotations around the respective Cα–Cβ, Cβ–Cγ, and Cγ–Cδ bonds of the side chain of Glu-222. In WT avGFP and cgGFP, the carboxyl Oϵ1 and Oϵ2 atoms of Glu-222 form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser-205 and the chromophore Ser-65, respectively. The corresponding water-mediated H-bond pathway OH(Tyr-66)–OHO(Wat)–OH(Ser-205)–Oϵ1(Glu-222)Oϵ2–OH(Ser-65) was proposed to be important for promoting rapid proton transfer from a neutral chromophore to Glu-222 (23Shu X. Leiderman P. Gepshtein R. Smith N.R. Kallio K. Huppert D. Remington S.J. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the colorless aceGFP-G222E, this pathway is replaced by a longer chain OH(Tyr-66)–OHO(Wat)–OH(Ser-205)–OH(Tyr-220)–Oϵ1(Glu-222)Oϵ1–OH(Ser-65), which also incorporates Tyr-220. Here the corresponding Oϵ1 atom of Glu-222 makes two H-bonds with the hydroxyl of Tyr-220 and the chromophore Ser-65, and Oϵ2 interacts with the proximal water, mediating interactions in the H-bond network (Fig. 6). Irradiation of the colorless aceGFP-G222E variant with UV light (λ = 250–300 nm) causes its irreversible photoconversion to a green fluorescent state that is similar to the one found in aceGFP (9Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Pounkova N.I. Staroverov D.B. Bulina M.E. Yanushevich Y.G. Labas Y.A. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast to a non-irradiated precursor, the chromophore structure in the UV-converted variant is fully matured and has spectral properties practically identical to that in aceGFP (Fig. 1, A and B), exhibiting coplanar arrangement of the imidazolone and phenolic rings with a conjugated system of π-electrons. Except for the chromophore itself, photoconverted and non-photoconverted aceGFP-G222E, as well as aceGFP, have practically identical three-dimensional structural arrangement of the residues nearest to the chromophore. No decarboxylation of Glu-222, characteristic for UV-induced photoconversion of WT avGFP (24van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and photoactivatable GFP (25Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 26Henderson J.N. Gepshtein R. Heenan J.R. Kallio K. Huppert D. Remington S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 4176-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was observed in aceGFP-G222E. A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of aceGFP/aceGFP-G222E with WT avGFP/cgGFP revealed an important amino acid difference at position 220. This position, located in the immediate environment of the chromophore, is occupied by Tyr and Leu/Ile, respectively (Fig. 2). In aceGFP-G222E, the Tyr-220 phenolic ring shifts the Glu-222 carboxylate by 2 Å from the standard position observed in avGFP/cgGFP. The replacement Y220L in the colorless aceGFP-G222E resulted in a green fluorescent product aceGFP-G222E-Y220L with excitation-emission spectra similar to those of the wild type avGFP (λex = 396 and 494 nm, λem = 508 nm; Fig. 1C). In the green fluorescent aceGFP, lacking Glu-222, substitutions Y220L and especially Y220F resulted in very slowly maturing mutants that required 1–2 weeks of incubation to develop fluorescence. At the same time, matured aceGFP-Y220L and aceGFP-Y220F proteins have excitation and emission spectra indistinguishable from those of parental aceGFP (Fig. 1A). Moreover, molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields for these mutants were found to be very close to that of aceGFP (50,000 m−1cm−1 and 0.55, respectively (9Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Pounkova N.I. Staroverov D.B. Bulina M.E. Yanushevich Y.G. Labas Y.A. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, Tyr-220 appears to be important to ensure fast chromophore maturation of aceGFP, but its presence has a negligible effect on the spectral properties of the matured protein. The immature chromophore of aceGFP-G222E exhibits non-coplanar arrangement of the imidazolone and phenolic rings, indicating the lack of their conjugation (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4a). This state is characterized by the non-oxidized single Tyr-66 Cα–Cβ bond, with both atoms in sp3 hybridization. A distinct feature of the colorless aceGFP-G222E, as well as of aceGFP, is the presence of Tyr-220, as opposed to Leu and Ile in WT avGFP and cgGFP, respectively. In aceGFP-G222E, the side chain of Tyr-220 pushes the negatively charged carboxyl group of Glu-222 by ∼2 Å from its conventional position. As a result, the H-bonded wire between Glu-222 and the chromophore Tyr-66 is extended by insertion of the interactions with Tyr-220. Such a shift apparently causes local distortion of the electrostatic field, which terminates the chromophore maturation process at an intermediate stage in which the cyclization of the protein backbone has occurred, but Tyr-66 still remains in the native, non-oxidized form. To check the proposed charge effect, we replaced the “pushing” Tyr-220 residue with a smaller Leu, aiming to restore the location of the Glu-222 side chain to that observed in avGFP and cgGFP. Indeed, this replacement resulted in a fully matured product aceGFP-G222E-Y220L, with spectral properties similar to those of the wild type avGFP (Fig. 1C). UV irradiation of the immature aceGFP-G222E drives the post-translational modification process further and results in a fully matured chromophore having the GFP conventional planar bicyclic structure and the conjugated system of π-electrons. The conserved Glu-222, Arg-96, and possibly, Tyr-220, are expected to participate in catalysis of this process. The UV-converted variant exhibits bright green fluorescence similar to that observed in green aceGFP. Surprisingly, despite the critical Glu-222/Gly-222 difference, both proteins have almost identical spectral characteristics (λex = 480 nm, λem = 505 nm; Fig. 1, A and B). The absence of Glu-222 or its displacement from the position standard in GFPs correlates with the excitation peak at ∼480 nm, which is presumably due to the deprotonated state of the chromophore (27Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Indeed, replacement of Glu-222 with a Gly in WT avGFP shifts the excitation maximum in spectra from 398 to 481 nm, leaving the emission peak at ∼507 nm (28Ehrig T. O'Kane D.J. Prendergast F.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the proposed restoration of the conventional position of Glu-222 side chain in aceGFP-G222E-Y220L shifts the excitation peak from 480 to 390 nm, characteristic for WT avGFP (28Ehrig T. O'Kane D.J. Prendergast F.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The latter property has been proposed to relate with the protonated chromophore state, stabilized by electrostatic repulsion between Glu-222 carboxylate and the chromophore (27Heim R. Prasher D.C.

A distinctive feature of aceGFP is the presence of an unusual Gly residue substituting for the catalytic Glu-222, invariant in all wild type GFP-like proteins. Glu-222 was found to be one of the key residues in biosynthesis of the GFP chromophore. It has been suggested that this residue plays a role of the general base, facilitating proton abstraction from the chromophore moiety (19Barondeau D.P. Putnam C.D. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A.

The absence of Glu-222 turned out not to be critical for complete maturation of the aceGFP chromophore to a conventional planar π-conjugated bicyclic system (Fig. 4a), which might indicate the possibility of an alternative path for the chemical reaction. In this particular variant, the hydroxyl of Tyr-220 resides within ∼1 Å distance from the position occupied by one of the oxygens of the carboxylate of Glu-222 in WT avGFP and apparently acts in a similar way as a proton acceptor. To check a possible role of this residue in aceGFP, we substituted Tyr-220 by Leu, characteristic for avGFP, and by Phe. The resultant variants, aceGFP-Y220L and aceGFP-Y220F, have the spectra and the intrinsic brightness similar to aceGFP, but in contrast to the latter protein, show a very slow maturation rate. This experiment supports our suggestion of an alternative catalytic pathway of chromophore maturation via Tyr-220, rather than via conventional Glu-222. The details of the mechanism of chromophore formation in GFPs have been a subject of considerable controversy. Several crystal structures trapping various intermediate states have been reported, leading to a number of proposed reaction schemes of chromophore biosynthesis (21Pouwels L.J. Zhang L. Chan N.H. Dorrestein P.C. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10111-10122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Rosenow M.A. Huffman H.A. Phail M.E. Wachter R.M.

Soc. 2006; 128: 3166-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One of the plausible pathways of chromophore maturation (Fig. 7) has been proposed by Barondeau et al. (32Barondeau D.P. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 3166-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Currently, three intermediates, I, III, IV, and the mature state VI of the chromophore from the proposed pathway, have been experimentally detected by x-ray crystallography. The precyclized state I was trapped in the anaerobically prepared GFP variants with modified chromophore-forming sequences Gly-65–Gly-66–Gly-67 and Ala-65–Ser-66–Ala-67 (19Barondeau D.P. Putnam C.D.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1960-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dehydrated intermediate III has now been observed by us in the non-modified chromophore Ser-65–Tyr-66–Gly-67 of the colorless aceGFP-G222E. The distinguishing feature of this state is the intact geometry of Tyr-66, characterized by sp3 hybridization of both the Cα and the Cβ atoms and by the tetrahedral arrangements of their covalent bonds (Fig. 4a). The structure corresponding to the following partially oxidized enolate intermediate IV with sp2 and sp3 hybridization of the respective Cα and Cβ atoms (Fig. 4b) has been detected for the blue fluorescent BFPsol matured variant after reducing the previously mutated chromophore Thr-65–His-66–Gly-67 with dithionite (32Barondeau D.P. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 3166-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pouwels et al. (21Pouwels L.J. Zhang L. Chan N.H. Dorrestein P.C. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10111-10122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) proposed a different pathway of chromophore formation in which the dehydration reaction of the hydroxylated imidazolone is the last chemical step leading to a mature chromophore. The state preceding the matured form has been attributed to the non-dehydrated chromophore structure (Fig. 4c) trapped in the crystal of the colorless EGFP variant. This variant has the chromophore-forming sequence Thr-65–Leu-66–Gly-67 with an unusual non-aromatic Y66L substitution (31Rosenow M.A. Huffman H.A. Phail M.E. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4464-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The observed form reveals the hydroxylated imidazolone and partially oxidized Leu-66 Cα–Cβ bond with sp2 and sp3 hybridization of the respective atoms. The authors' assignment of the Cα(Leu-66) atom hybridization to sp2 is consistent with the observed trigonal planar geometry of three attached bonds but somewhat disagrees with their single character. This non-dehydrated state with oxidized Cα(66)_sp2 atom cannot succeed or precede our dehydrated form III with non-oxidized Cα(66)_sp3 (Fig. 7). This might indicate the complexity of chromophore biosynthesis, suggesting more than one possible reaction pathway defined by the concrete chromophore-forming sequence and the immediate stereochemical environment. The unusual aliphatic nature of the chromophore Leu-66 in the EGFP variant could also make a dramatic difference in the maturation process when compared with that in GFP-like proteins that contain an aromatic residue at position 66.

In the nematode, C. elegans, intestinal magnesium uptake is dependent on the activities of the TRPM channel proteins, GON-2 and GTL-1. In this paper we provide evidence that another member of the TRPM protein family, GTL-2, acts within the C. elegans excretory cell to mediate the excretion of excess magnesium. Thus, the activity of GTL-2 balances the activities of the paralogous TRPM channel proteins, GON-2 and GTL-1."

We investigated serum IgG levels in narcolepsy. Methodology/Principal Findings We measured the serum total IgG levels in 159 Japanese narcolepsy-cataplexy patients positive for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele, 28 idiopathic hypersomnia patients with long sleep time, and 123 healthy controls (the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele present in 45 subjects). The serum levels of each IgG subclass were subsequently measured. The distribution of serum IgG was significantly different among healthy controls negative for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele (11.66±3.55 mg/ml), healthy controls positive for the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele (11.45±3.43), narcolepsy patients (9.67±3.38), and idiopathic hypersomnia patients (13.81±3.80). None of the following clinical variables, age, disease duration, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, smoking habit and BMI at the time of blood sampling, were associated with IgG levels in narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Furthermore we found the decrease in IgG1 and IgG2 levels, stable expression of IgG3, and the increase in the proportion of IgG4 in narcolepsy patients with abnormally low IgG levels. The increase in the proportion of IgG4 levels was also found in narcolepsy patients with normal serum total IgG levels. Idiopathic hypersomnia patients showed a different pattern of IgG subclass distribution with high IgG3 and IgG4 level, low IgG2 level, and IgG1/IgG2 imbalance. Conclusions/Significance Our study is the first to determine IgG abnormalities in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia by measuring the serum IgG levels in a large number of hypersomnia patients. The observed IgG abnormalities indicate humoral immune alterations in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Different IgG profiles suggest immunological differences between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia."

To further delineate the mechanistic details of this critical enzyme, we have determined the structures of two inhibited forms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCL (ScGCL), which shares significant sequence identity with the human enzyme. In vivo, GCL activity is feedback regulated by glutathione. Examination of the structure of ScGCL-glutathione complex (2.5 Å; R = 19.9%, Rfree = 25.1%) indicates that the inhibitor occupies both the glutamate- and the presumed cysteine-binding site and disrupts the previously observed Mg2+ coordination in the ATP-binding site. l-Buthionine-S-sulfoximine (BSO) is a mechanism-based inhibitor of GCL and has been used extensively to deplete glutathione in cell culture and in vivo model systems. Inspection of the ScGCL-BSO structure (2.2 Å; R = 18.1%, Rfree = 23.9%) confirms that BSO is phosphorylated on the sulfoximine nitrogen to generate the inhibitory species and reveals contacts that likely contribute to transition state stabilization.

There are three distinct families of GCL enzymes: γ-proteobacteria (Group 1), nonplant eukaryotes (Group 2), and α-proteobacteria and plants (Group 3) (5Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0025)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite low sequence conservation between these groups (typically <10% sequence identity), all of the GCL appear to use this general catalytic mechanism. The resulting γ-glutamylcysteine is coupled to l-glycine by glutathione synthetase (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

GCL activity is tightly modulated by free l-cysteine availability (6Tateishi N. Higashi T. Shinya S. Naruse A. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. 1974; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), transcriptional regulation (7Wild A.C. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem.

In addition, GCL is feedback regulated by the end product, glutathione (9Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione inhibits GCL competitively with respect to l-glutamate, suggesting that the two binding sites are coincident (9Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In heterodimeric GCL, such as the Drosophila, rat, and human enzymes, binding of the modifier subunit relieves feedback inhibition both by increasing the Ki for glutathione and decreasing the Km for glutamate (10Huang C.S.

Further studies with glutathione analogues such as ophthalmic acid, S-methylglutathione, and GSSG have demonstrated that the free thiol group of glutathione is necessary for maximal inhibition (1Griffith O.W.

The central role of GCL in glutathione homeostasis makes it an attractive target for drug design. Increased glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit mRNA levels and GCL activity have been frequently observed in cells derived from human tumors resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (14Godwin A.K.

Increased production of glutathione likely protects against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (17Anderson M.E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 18Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7369-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Drug resistance in tumors can be overcome by the administration of l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) (20Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibits GCL and subsequently depletes GSH, thus sensitizing the cancer cells to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. Administration of BSO has also been shown to prolong the survival of mice infected with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (21Arrick B.A. Griffith O.W. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Similarly, BSO-mediated depletion of glutathione inhibits the development Plasmodium falciparum in red blood cells (22Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). BSO presumably binds as an l-glutamate analogue with its S-butyl group extending into the l-cysteine-binding site (23Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subsequent ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the sulfoximine nitrogen by GCL leads to the formation of a tightly bound transition state analogue (20Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCL (ScGCL) in complex with l-glutamate, Mg2+, and ADP (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As the first structure of a Group 2 glutamate cysteine ligase, examination of the model provided important molecular details of substrate recognition and led to the identification of key catalytic residues. In the current study, we have determined the crystal structures of two inhibited forms of the enzyme. The structure of ScGCL in complex with glutathione reveals the molecular details of feedback inhibition, whereas the ScGCL-BSO complex structure details the mechanism of BSO inhibition. Examination of the available ScGCL structures provides considerable insight in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and suggests approaches by which GCL inhibitors with greater selectivity may be attainable. ScGCL was expressed in Escherichia coli RosettaTM2(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified to homogeneity as described previously (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, soluble cell lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation and ScGCL isolated by affinity chromatography using a HisTrap Chelating HP Column (GE Healthcare). The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column. Purified ScGCL was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, concentrated (Amicon stirred cell 8050, 10-kDa cut-off), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Point mutations were introduced at residue Cys266 (C266S and C266A) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing at the University of Nebraska Genomics Facility (Lincoln, NE). Enzymatic activity was measured using an indirect assay that couples ADP production to NADH oxidation, which was monitored at 340 nm (11Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 0.2 mm NADH, and 4 units each of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in 1 ml of buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ScGCL. To determine the apparent Km values, two of the three substrates were added to the reaction at a saturating concentration (20 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP), whereas the third was varied. At high concentrations of cysteine or ATP, substrate inhibition was observed. To examine the mode of inhibition of glutathione, the rates for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction as a function of glutamate concentration were determined in the presence of fixed concentrations of glutathione (0, 2.5, and 5.0 mm). A general mixed model of inhibition was initially selected in Prism (Graph Pad Software) to describe the dependence of rate versus substrate concentration. This global analysis indicated that glutathione was a competitive inhibitor with respect to glutamate. Following this preliminary analysis, the data were reanalyzed designating competitive inhibition (supplemental Fig. S1). For inactivation studies, ScGCL (1.75 μm) was incubated with BSO (Sigma) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP at 4 °C (20Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33463-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At the indicated time, an aliquot was removed, and enzymatic activity was measured at saturating substrate concentrations using the coupled assay system. Representative data from three or more determinations are plotted as a function of time with the experimental errors indicated. A single-order decay was used to describe the data using the program Prism (Graph Pad Software). Concentrated ScGCL (7 mg/ml) was crystallized in the presence of either 5 mm reduced glutathione and 20 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm BSO, 5 mm ATP, and 20 mm MgCl2. Crystals were grown at 18 °C out of a solution of 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm MES, pH 6.8, with the dimensions 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm, as described previously (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 400 and the appropriate ligands and then vitrified in liquid nitrogen (26Rodgers D.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1135-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Diffraction data for the ScGCL-glutathione complex were collected using radiation produced by a Rigaku MicroMax-007 x-ray generator fitted with confocal blue optics and an R-axis IV++ image plate system (λ = 1.54 Å; 100 K). For the ScGCL-BSO complex, diffraction data (λ = 0.9 Å; 100 K) were collected on Beamline 14-BM-C of BioCARS at Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source. All of the data were processed with the HKL2000 software package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

As the protein models neared completion, water molecules obeying proper hydrogen-bonding constraints with electron density greater than 1.0 σ on a 2Fo − Fc map and 4.0 σ on an Fo − Fc map were also included in the final structure. Model geometry was monitored using MOLPROBITY (31Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26024) Google Scholar). Previously reported structural and biochemical data indicate that ScGCL likely functions as a monomer both in vitro and in vivo (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

Inhibition by glutathione, a feedback inhibitor of ScGCL, was also examined. Glutathione is a competitive inhibitor with respect to the glutamate substrate (supplemental Fig. S1), with an apparent Ki(GSH) of 2.12 ± 0.13 mm, similar to other Group 2 GCL holoenzymes (11Huang C.S.

A time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity was observed in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP at each of the BSO concentrations tested (5 μm to 50 μm). A near linear dependence on the inactivation rate as a function of BSO concentration was observed (data not shown). At 50 μm BSO, ScGCL activity was reduced nearly 10-fold in ∼5 min. Unfortunately, reliable rate measurements above this concentration of BSO could not be made because of the limitations of the assay. Nonetheless, BSO is clearly a potent inhibitor of ScGCL. Previous studies of related GCL indicated that l-buthionine-S-sulfoximine is the relevant stereoisomer and that its enzymatic phosphorylation generates a high affinity transition state analogue (23Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Mårtensson J. Jain A. Stole E. Frayer W. Auld P.A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 9360-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As discussed below, the ScGCL-BSO structure supports these findings. The structures of ScGCL in complex with either glutathione or BSO were determined by molecular replacement using the apo form of ScGCL as a probe (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the ScGCL-glutathione complex, reduced glutathione was readily modeled into the strong positive density observed within the enzyme active site (supplemental Fig. S2). The glutamate portion of glutathione is located at the base of the active site funnel (Fig. 2A). The cysteine moiety occupies a relatively hydrophobic binding pocket, whereas the terminal glycine is near the outer edge of the active site and is solvent-exposed. In the ScGCL-BSO complex, the electron density supports the modeling of phosphorylated BSO, ADP, and three Mg2+ ions (supplemental Fig. S3). The adenine ring of ADP is located at the lower lip of the active site cavity and is solvent-exposed (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylated BSO occupies a site comparable but distinct from the glutathione-binding site, as discussed below. The overall ScGCL-glutathione and ScGCL-BSO structures are very similar to that of ScGCL in complex with glutamate and Mg2+ with an root mean square deviation for Cα = ∼0.2 Å (24Biterova E.I.

Refinement statistics for the final ScGCL-glutathione and ScGCL-BSO models are provided in Table 2.

Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-carboxylate of the glutamyl moiety of glutathione is positioned by hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr362 and Arg313 as well as with an ordered water molecule (Fig. 3) that in turn forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Arg472 (not shown). Cys266 is also positioned above the plane of the carboxylate and may help orient the bound inhibitor. The glutamyl α-amino group is within hydrogen bond distance of the backbone carbonyl of Cys264, the γ-carboxylate of Glu52, and an ordered water molecule. The cysteinyl α-amino and α-carbonyl groups are within hydrogen bond distance of the γ-carboxylate of Glu96 and the indole nitrogen of Trp445, respectively. An ordered water molecule can also form a hydrogen bond with the cysteinyl α-carbonyl group. The side chain of Arg196 is positioned to interact favorably with the terminal carboxylate of GSH, but the glycine portion of glutathione is poorly defined relative to the rest of the inhibitor. As compared with the previously described ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ structure, there are several notable differences in the placement of the γ-glutamyl moiety of glutathione relative to the bound glutamate substrate. In the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ structure, the γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate occupies one of the coordination sites of the bound M1 Mg2+ (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in the ScGCL-glutathione structure, the γ-carboxylate has been assimilated into the γ-glutamyl peptide bond and can no longer promote Mg2+ binding. Glu52 and Glu96, which also coordinate the Mg2+, maintain comparable positions in both structures, but Glu103 has shifted away from the M1 binding site (not shown). Loss of the M1 binding site causes the γ-glutamyl portion of glutathione to be shifted ∼0.3 Å out from the base of the active site, limiting interactions between its α-carboxylate and the side chain of Arg313. In addition, the M2 and M3 binding sites are not significantly occupied in the absence of ATP or ADP. An intriguing feature of the γ-glutamyl-binding pocket is the conserved cysteine residue, Cys266, which is in close proximity to the α-carboxylate of glutamate. Previously, mutation of the equivalent cysteine residue in T. brucei GCL to an alanine had little effect on the specific activity or the substrate binding affinity of the enzyme (35Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26317-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In ScGCL, substitution of this residue with either a serine (C266S) or an alanine residue (C266A) had a modest but reproducible effect on glutamate and glutathione binding (Table 3). For both mutants, the apparent Km(Glu) and the apparent Ki(GSH) increased ∼2-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. Studies to examine the impact of these mutations on overall glutathione production in S. cerevisiae are ongoing.TABLE 3Apparent kinetic constants for C266S and C266A ScGCLKm l-GluVmaxV/KKi glutathionemmμmol min−1 mg−1mmScGCL1.21 ± 0.0510.7 ± 0.178.82.12 ± 0.13C266S2.15 ± 0.077.58 ± 0.073.53.91 ± 0.25C266A1.93 ± 0.079.22 ± 0.094.84.70 ± 0.35 Open table in a new tab In addition to glutathione, all three families of GCL can be inhibited by S-alkyl-l-homocysteine sulfoximines (36Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed above, BSO is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of ScGCL. The enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of BSO to form BSO phosphate and ADP, which mimic the transition state. Phosphorylated BSO binds tightly and dissociates very slowly (20Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), making this compound pharmacologically important for development of treatments against cancer and certain parasites (21Arrick B.A. Griffith O.W. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Biochem.

Cancer. 2003; 39: 120-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated BSO occupies the l-glutamate and the presumed l-cysteine-binding sites of ScGCL (Fig. 4A). The α-carboxylate and α-amino groups of BSO are virtually superimposable on the comparable functional groups of the glutamate substrate (not shown). BSO is phosphorylated on the sulfoximine nitrogen, and the S-butyl group of BSO mimics l-cysteine, occupying a relatively hydrophobic pocket within the enzyme active site. Arg472 is within hydrogen bond distance of the sulfoximine oxygen and an oxygen of the newly added phosphate group and likely stabilizes the transition state. In support of a direct role in catalysis, mutation of the equivalent arginine, Arg491 in T. brucei GCL, decreased enzymatic activity by 70-fold (39Abbott J.J. Ford J.L. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by ATP and subsequent tight inhibitor-enzyme interaction is dependent on the metal ion binding (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73 (xii): 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). The precise locations of the three metal-binding sites are discussed below. The crystal structures of E. coli (40Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Brassica juncea (41Hothorn M. Wachter A. Gromes R. Stuwe T. Rausch T. Scheffzek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27557-27565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) GCL in complex with alkyl sulfoximine inhibitors have also been reported. Comparison with the ScGCL-BSO complex reveals a dramatic conservation of active site functionality across bacteria, plants, and nonplant eukaryotes. In these three structures, the γ-glutamyl-binding sites are superimposable, with the α-carboxylate adjacent to a conserved arginine residue (Arg313 in ScGCL) and the α-amino group within hydrogen bond distance of a bound water, the backbone carbonyl of residue 264, and the carboxylate of Glu52 (Fig. 4A). The proposed catalytic arginine residue, Arg472 in ScGCL, is also conserved and suggests that all three enzymes function using a similar mechanism. Previously, we described the structure of ScGCL in complex with glutamate, ADP, and Mg2+ to 2.7 Å resolution (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The current ScGCL-BSO complex structure has been refined to significantly higher resolution (2.2 Å) and provides additional details regarding ADP binding (Fig. 4B). As described previously, the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls of the ribose are involved in an extended hydrogen bond network. The oxygen of the furanose ring forms a hydrogen bond with an ordered water molecule that is positioned by the side chain of Arg468. Substitution of the equivalent residue in T. brucei GCL, Arg487, with an alanine increases the Km(ATP) > 15-fold (39Abbott J.J. Ford J.L. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The C6 amino group and N7 nitrogen of the adenine ring are within hydrogen bond distance of the side chain of Gln272 and an ordered water molecule, respectively. Through bridging water molecules, Thr270, Arg449, and Lys451 interact with the pyrophosphate group of ADP, and these residues are likely important binding determinants. In T. brucei GCL, mutation of Thr323 (Thr370 in ScGCL) to an alanine dramatically increased the apparent Km for ATP (39Abbott J.J. Ford J.L. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the imidazole ring of His94 moves ∼1.4 Å toward the ADP molecule and forms hydrogen bonds with an α-phosphate oxygen and the γ-carboxylate of Glu103 (not shown). Three bound Mg2+ molecules provide additional stabilizing interactions as described below. In the ScGCL-BSO structure, three octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ ions are observed (Fig. 4C). The first metal-binding site, M1, is formed by the side chain carboxylates of Glu52, Glu96, and Glu103; the sulfoximine nitrogen; an oxygen of the covalently attached phosphate group; and an ordered water molecule. The M2 site is fashioned from the side chains of Gln268, Glu50, and Glu470, as well as from oxygen atoms from the β phosphate of ADP and the phosphoryl group of the transition state analogue. The M3 site is in contact with oxygen atoms from each of the three phosphate groups, the carboxylates of Glu50 and Glu103, and a bound water molecule. This constellation of Mg2+-binding sites facilitates the binding of ATP and positions the γ-phosphate of ATP for in-line nucleophilic attack by the γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate. As mentioned above, Arg472 is likely a key residue in this initial step of catalysis. The coordination of these critical Mg2+ ions appears to be highly conserved. A similar arrangement of active site Mg2+ ions is observed in the equivalent E. coli GCL structure (40Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), despite less than 10% sequence identity between the Group 1 and 2 enzymes. Mutation of glutamate residues 55 and 100 in T. brucei GCL (equivalent to Glu52 and Glu103 in ScGCL) to alanine led to a striking loss of enzyme activity, suggesting that Glu52 and Glu103 are indispensable for catalysis (42Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N. Pitcher L.A. Phillips M.A. Grishin N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42099-42107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Substitutions at either residue likely result in the loss of Mg2+ binding at the M1 site. Interestingly, mutation of Glu93 in T. brucei GCL to alanine (equivalent to Glu96 in ScGCL) resulted in an enzyme capable of ATP hydrolysis. However, the E93A mutant could not catalyze the peptide bond formation between l-glutamate and l-aminobutyrate (a surrogate for l-cysteine), suggesting that this glutamate residue may instead facilitate the nucleophilic attack of l-cysteine on the γ-glutamylphosphate intermediate (42Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N. Pitcher L.A. Phillips M.A. Grishin N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42099-42107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Attempts to crystallize a pseudo-Michaelis complex have been unsuccessful. In each case, the electron density for the cysteine substrate has been quite poor, precluding the direct identification of the cysteine-binding pocket. To overcome this limitation, the ScGCL-glutathione and ScGCL-BSO structures were superimposed, and the environment surrounding the cysteine or cysteine mimic was examined (Fig. 5). The thiol group of glutathione and the S-butyl group of BSO overlay reasonably well and are located in a hydrophobic pocket lined by Tyr97, Phe197, Leu200, Met258, Met262, and Trp445. The cysteinyl amino and carbonyl groups of glutathione are within hydrogen bond distance of the γ-carboxylate of Glu96 and the indole nitrogen of Trp445. These two residues likely orient the incoming cysteine substrate, and Glu96 may facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the α-amino group of cysteine on the γ-glutamylphosphate, leading to the displacement of the phosphate group and the formation of the γ-glutamyl peptide bond (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73 (xii): 209-267PubMed Google Scholar, 2Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3563-3568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the guanidinium group of Arg196 may coordinate the α-carboxylate of cysteine, similar to the arrangement seen for binding of the glycine portion of glutathione (Fig. 3). In support of this assertion, mutagenesis studies of T. brucei GCL indicated that Arg179 (Arg196 in ScGCL) is required for efficient binding of the cysteine analogue, l-aminobutyrate (39Abbott J.J. Ford J.L. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Comparison of the ScGCL-BSO structure with that of E. coli GCL in complex with the related mechanism-based inhibitor, (2S)-2-amino-4-[(2S)-2-carboxybutyl-(R)-sulfonimidoyl]butanoic acid (40Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggests potential differences in cysteine binding. In E. coli GCL, the cysteine pocket is formed concurrently with a conformation change in a switch loop (residues 240–249). As a result, the carboxyl group of the inhibitor cysteine moiety is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with Tyr300, as well as Tyr131. In ScGCL there are no significant conformational changes in the backbone of the enzyme upon inhibitor binding, and Tyr300 and Tyr131 of the E. coli enzyme appear to be functionally replaced by Trp445 and Arg196. Interestingly, the cysteine-binding pocket of B. juncea GCL (41Hothorn M. Wachter A. Gromes R. Stuwe T. Rausch T. Scheffzek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27557-27565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) more closely resembles that of ScGCL. However, both enzyme structures were determined in complex with BSO, which lacks the functional equivalent of the α-carboxylate of the cysteine substrate. Perhaps additional conformational changes would occur if this moiety were present. The available biochemical and structural data provide many of the details of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (Fig. 6). Glutamate binds at the base of the enzyme active site with its side chain carboxylate occupying one of the coordination sites of the M1 Mg2+. The nucleophilicity of the γ-carboxylate is likely increased by the adjacent Mg2+ as well as the side chain of Arg472. The addition of Mg2+/ATP leads to the formation of two additional magnesium-binding sites, M2 and M3, which orient the phosphate groups of ATP, placing the γ-phosphate in position for in-line attack by the activated glutamate substrate. This leads to the formation of a γ-glutamyl phosphate intermediate, which is tightly anchored in the enzyme active site, and the eventual displacement of ADP. The incoming cysteine nucleophile is potentially activated by the side chain carboxylate of Glu96, and the developing negative charge on the γ-carboxylate oxygen of the glutamate substrate is stabilized by the side chain of Arg472. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate leads to the expulsion of the phosphate group and the formation of the γ-glutamyl peptide bond. Additional biochemical and mutational studies to examine this proposed mechanism are ongoing. However, the essential features of catalysis appear to be conserved in related enzymes such as glutamine synthetase (43Liaw S.H. Eisenberg D.

Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3450-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the detailed catalytic mechanism of GCL in conjunction with the structural studies of the inhibited ScGCL may lead to improved glutathione biosynthesis inhibitors. The alkyl sulfoximine-based inhibitors are excellent transition state mimics that dramatically reduce enzymatic activity. Examination of the ScGCL-BSO complex suggests that additional functionalities may be engineered to increase selectivity. ScGCL and human GCL share >40% sequence identity, with nearly complete conservation of active site architecture (24Biterova E.I. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that the insights garnered from the study of ScGCL will facilitate the development of improved therapeutics that modulate glutathione production in mammalian systems.

https://openalex.org/W2090085222,"Each year, more than 10 million children younger than five years of age die. The large majority of these deaths occur in the developing world. The verbal autopsy (VA) is a tool designed to ascertain cause of death in such settings. While VA has been validated against hospital diagnosed cause of death, there has been no research conducted to better understand the factors that may influence individual physicians in determining cause of death from VA.This study uses data from over 27,000 neonatal and childhood deaths from The Million Death Study in which 6.3 million people in India were monitored for vital status between 1998 and 2003. The main outcome variable was physician agreement or disagreement of category of death and the variables were assessed for association using the kappa statistic, univariate and multivariate logistic regression using a conceptual hierarchical model, and a sensitivity and specificity analysis using the final VA category of mortality as the gold standard. The main variables found to be significantly associated with increased physician agreement included older ages and male gender of the deceased. When taking into account confounding factors in the multivariate analysis, we did not find consistent significant differences in physician agreement based on the death being in a rural or urban area, at home or in a health care facility, registered or not, or the respondent's gender, religion, relationship to the deceased, or whether or not the respondent lived with the deceased.Factors influencing physician agreement/disagreement to the greatest degree are the gender and age of the deceased; specifically, physicians tend to be less likely to agree on a common category of death in female children and in younger ages, particularly neonates. Additional training of physician reviewers and continued adaptation of the VA itself, with a focus on gender and age of the deceased, may be useful in increasing rates of physician agreement in these groups."
https://openalex.org/W1972835248,"The zinc finger protein Sp2 (specificity protein 2) is a member of the glutamine-rich Sp family of transcription factors. Despite its close similarity to Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4, Sp2 does not bind to DNA or activate transcription when expressed in mammalian cell lines. The expression pattern and the biological relevance of Sp2 in the mouse are unknown.Whole-mount in situ hybridization of mouse embryos between E7.5 and E9.5 revealed abundant expression in most embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. In order to unravel the biological relevance of Sp2, we have targeted the Sp2 gene by a tri-loxP strategy. Constitutive Sp2null and conditional Sp2cko knockout alleles were obtained by crossings with appropriate Cre recombinase expressing mice. Constitutive disruption of the mouse Sp2 gene (Sp2null) resulted in severe growth retardation and lethality before E9.5. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Sp2null embryos at E9.5 failed to grow. Cre-mediated ablation of Sp2 in Sp2cko/cko MEFs obtained from E13.5 strongly impaired cell proliferation.Our results demonstrate that Sp2 is essential for early mouse development and autonomous proliferation of MEFs in culture. Comparison of the Sp2 knockout phenotype with the phenotypes of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 knockout strains shows that, despite their structural similarity and evolutionary relationship, all four glutamine-rich members of the Sp family of transcription factors have distinct non-redundant functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1975401996,"Tristetraprolin (TTP) is the prototype member of a family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins and is considered to be an anti-inflammatory protein in mammals. TTP plays a critical role in the decay of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) mRNA, among others, by binding AU-rich RNA elements in the 3'-untranslated regions of this transcript and promoting its deadenylation and degradation.We used yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify potential protein binding partners for human TTP (hTTP). Various regions of hTTP recovered 31 proteins that fell into 12 categories based on sequence similarities. Among these, the interactions between hTTP and CIN85, cytoplasmic poly (A) binding protein (PABP), nucleolin and heat shock protein 70 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. CIN85 and hTTP co-localized in the cytoplasm of cells as determined by confocal microscopy. CIN85 contains three SH3 domains that specifically bind a unique proline-arginine motif (PXXXPR) found in several CIN85 effectors. We found that the SH3 domains of CIN85 bound to a PXXXPR motif located near the C-terminus of hTTP. Co-expression of CIN85 with hTTP resulted in the increased phosphorylation of hTTP at serine residues in positions 66 and 93, possibly due in part to the demonstrated association of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MEKK4) to both proteins. The presence of CIN85 did not appear to alter hTTP's binding to RNA probes or its stimulated breakdown of TNF mRNA.These studies describe interactions between hTTP and nucleolin, cytoplasmic PABP, heat shock protein 70 and CIN85; these interactions were initially discovered by two-hybrid analysis, and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. We found that CIN85 binding to a C-terminal motif within hTTP led to the increased phosphorylation of hTTP, possibly through enhanced association with MEKK4. The functional consequences to each of the members of this putative complex remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2020308291,"We have recently shown that in monkey passive extraocular muscles the force induced by a stretch does not depend on the entire length history, but to a great extent is only a function of the last elongation applied. This led us to conclude that Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model, and more general nonlinear models based on a single convolution integral, cannot faithfully mimic passive eye muscles. Here we present additional data about the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles in deeply anesthetized monkeys. We show that, in addition to the aforementioned failures, previous models also grossly overestimate the force exerted by passive eye muscles during smooth elongations similar to those experienced during normal eye movements. Importantly, we also show that the force exerted by a muscle following an elongation is largely independent of the elongation itself, and it is mostly determined by the final muscle length. These additional findings conclusively rule out the use of classical viscoelastic models to mimic the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles. We describe here a new model that extends previous ones using principles derived from research on thixotropic materials. This model is able to account reasonably well for our data, and could thus be incorporated into models of the eye plant."
https://openalex.org/W2102433789,"Background Mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) like oleic acid have been shown to cause apoptosis of cultured endothelial cells by activating protein phosphatase type 2C α and β (PP2C). The question arises whether damage of endothelial or other cells could be observed in intact animals fed with a trioleate-enriched diet. Methodology/Principal Findings Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were fed with a trioleate-enriched diet for 5 months. Advanced atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and the coronary arteries could not be seen but the arteries appeared in a pre-atherosclerotic stage of vascular remodelling. However, the weight and size of the hearts were lower than in controls and the number of apoptotic myocytes increased in the hearts of trioleate-fed animals. To confirm the idea that oleic acid may have caused this apoptosis by activation of PP2C, cultured cardiomyocytes from guinea pigs and mice were treated with various lipids. It was demonstrable that oleic acid dose-dependently caused apoptosis of cardiomyocytes from both species, yet, similar to previous experiments with cultured neurons and endothelial cells, stearic acid, elaidic acid and oleic acid methylester did not. The apoptotic effect caused by oleic acid was diminished when PP2C α and β were downregulated by siRNA showing that PP2C was causally involved in apoptosis caused by oleic acid. Conclusions/Significance The glycerol trioleate diet given to guinea pigs for 5 months did not cause marked atherosclerosis but clearly damaged the hearts by activating PP2C α and β. The diet used with 24% (wt/wt) glycerol trioleate is not comparable to human diets. The detrimental role of MUFAs for guinea pig heart tissue in vivo is shown for the first time. Whether it is true for humans remains to be shown."
