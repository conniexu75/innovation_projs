https://openalex.org/W2272252865,"Nitrogen (N)-doped carbon materials exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is essential for several renewable energy systems. However, the ORR active site (or sites) is unclear, which retards further developments of high-performance catalysts. Here, we characterized the ORR active site by using newly designed graphite (highly oriented pyrolitic graphite) model catalysts with well-defined π conjugation and well-controlled doping of N species. The ORR active site is created by pyridinic N. Carbon dioxide adsorption experiments indicated that pyridinic N also creates Lewis basic sites. The specific activities per pyridinic N in the HOPG model catalysts are comparable with those of N-doped graphene powder catalysts. Thus, the ORR active sites in N-doped carbon materials are carbon atoms with Lewis basicity next to pyridinic N."

Burkett et al. observed that within a pair of monogamous prairie voles, an unstressed partner increased its grooming of a stressed partner. Furthermore, the unstressed partner matched the stressed partner in its stress hormone response. Thus, consolation may be more common than assumed in animals, and prairie voles may prove a useful model for understanding the physical and neural mechanisms underlying consolation behavior.

The copper centers are topologically independent of the weaving within the COF structure and serve as templates for bringing the threads into a woven pattern rather than the more commonly observed parallel arrangement. The copper(I) ions can be reversibly removed and added without loss of the COF structure, for which a tenfold increase in elasticity accompanies its demetalation. The threads in COF-505 have many degrees of freedom for enormous deviations to take place between them, throughout the material, without undoing the weaving of the overall structure."

Tang et al. used Ni/Co and Cr/Zn ratios as a proxy for the magnesium oxide that long ago weathered away in Earth's oldest rocks. This allowed a reconstruction of rock composition, which appears to be very different from that of the crust today. The shift to contemporary crust composition occurred after the Archean era, suggesting the onset of plate tectonics. Science , this issue p. 372"

Unpaired triplet states engage in a variety of useful reactions but are hard to produce. Quantum mechanics dictates that photo-excitation from singlet to triplet states is inefficient. Instead, chemists rely on sensitizers, which populate the triplet states of their neighbors through energy transfer after absorbing light themselves. Mongin et al. now show that certain nanoparticles can act as triplet sensitizers. Science , this issue p. 369"

Such sustainable increases may be especially important for the 2 billion people reliant on small farms, many of which are undernourished, yet we know little about the efficacy of this approach. Using a coordinated protocol across regions and crops, we quantify to what degree enhancing pollinator density and richness can improve yields on 344 fields from 33 pollinator-dependent crop systems in small and large farms from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. For fields less than 2 hectares, we found that yield gaps could be closed by a median of 24% through higher flower-visitor density. For larger fields, such benefits only occurred at high flower-visitor richness. Worldwide, our study demonstrates that ecological intensification can create synchronous biodiversity and yield outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2279320212,"Oligodendrocytes myelinate axons in the central nervous system and develop from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that must first migrate extensively during brain and spinal cord development. We show that OPCs require the vasculature as a physical substrate for migration. We observed that OPCs of the embryonic mouse brain and spinal cord, as well as the human cortex, emerge from progenitor domains and associate with the abluminal endothelial surface of nearby blood vessels. Migrating OPCs crawl along and jump between vessels. OPC migration in vivo was disrupted in mice with defective vascular architecture but was normal in mice lacking pericytes. Thus, physical interactions with the vascular endothelium are required for OPC migration. We identify Wnt-Cxcr4 (chemokine receptor 4) signaling in regulation of OPC-endothelial interactions and propose that this signaling coordinates OPC migration with differentiation."

Forkel et al. combined observations and models to show that climate warming has caused the photosynthetic uptake of carbon to increase faster than its respiratory release from the terrestrial biosphere. This has increased the difference from summer to winter, as well as the latitudinal gradient. Because of the physiological limitations to carbon uptake by terrestrial vegetation, this negative feedback to warming in the boreal north and Arctic cannot continue indefinitely.

https://openalex.org/W2268619028,"Differentiated macrophages can self-renew in tissues and expand long term in culture, but the gene regulatory mechanisms that accomplish self-renewal in the differentiated state have remained unknown. Here we show that in mice, the transcription factors MafB and c-Maf repress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network that controls self-renewal. Single-cell analysis revealed that, in vivo, proliferating resident macrophages can access this network by transient down-regulation of Maf transcription factors. The network also controls embryonic stem cell self-renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers. This indicates that distinct lineage-specific enhancer platforms regulate a shared network of genes that control self-renewal potential in both stem and mature cells."

https://openalex.org/W2252248415,"Neural responses are noisy, and circuit structure can correlate this noise across neurons. Theoretical studies show that noise correlations can have diverse effects on population coding, but these studies rarely explore stimulus dependence of noise correlations. Here, we show that noise correlations in responses of ON-OFF direction-selective retinal ganglion cells are strongly stimulus dependent, and we uncover the circuit mechanisms producing this stimulus dependence. A population model based on these mechanistic studies shows that stimulus-dependent noise correlations improve the encoding of motion direction 2-fold compared to independent noise. This work demonstrates a mechanism by which a neural circuit effectively shapes its signal and noise in concert, minimizing corruption of signal by noise. Finally, we generalize our findings beyond direction coding in the retina and show that stimulus-dependent correlations will generally enhance information coding in populations of diversely tuned neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2251407979,"The neural representation of information suffers from ""noise""-the trial-to-trial variability in the response of neurons. The impact of correlated noise upon population coding has been debated, but a direct connection between theory and experiment remains tenuous. Here, we substantiate this connection and propose a refined theoretical picture. Using simultaneous recordings from a population of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, we demonstrate that coding benefits from noise correlations. The effect is appreciable already in small populations, yet it is a collective phenomenon. Furthermore, the stimulus-dependent structure of correlation is key. We develop simple functional models that capture the stimulus-dependent statistics. We then use them to quantify the performance of population coding, which depends upon interplays of feature sensitivities and noise correlations in the population. Because favorable structures of correlation emerge robustly in circuits with noisy, nonlinear elements, they will arise and benefit coding beyond the confines of retina."
https://openalex.org/W2282926206,"FGF21 is a stress-induced hormone with potent anti-obesity, insulin-sensitizing, and hepatoprotective properties. Although proteolytic cleavage of recombinant human FGF21 in preclinical species has been observed previously, the regulation of endogenously produced FGF21 is not well understood. Here we identify fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as the enzyme that cleaves and inactivates human FGF21. A selective chemical inhibitor, immunodepletion, or genetic deletion of Fap stabilized recombinant human FGF21 in serum. In addition, administration of a selective FAP inhibitor acutely increased circulating intact FGF21 levels in cynomolgus monkeys. On the basis of our findings, we propose selective FAP inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to increase endogenous FGF21 activity for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and related metabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2336806544,"Objectives 
Saliva is a biological fluid suitable for biomarker analysis, and differences in the salivary microbiota in oral health and disease have been reported. For such comparative analyses, time of sampling is critical since the bacterial composition may vary throughout the day, i.e., diurnal variation. The purpose of this study is to compare the salivary microbiome over time to determine the optimal time for sampling.


Design 
Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 5 orally healthy individuals in 4 h intervals for 24 h, and collection was repeated 7 days later (number of samples per person, n = 12, total number of samples, n = 60). Salivary microbiota was analyzed using the Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS), and statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction for multiple comparisons, cluster analysis, principal component analysis and correspondence analysis.


Results 
From a total of 60 saliva samples, 477 probe targets were collectively identified with a mean number of probes per sample of 207 (range: 153–307). Little or no variation in microbial profiles within subjects was observed over time.


Conclusions 
Although there was considerable variation between subjects, microbial profiles within subjects were stable throughout a 24 hour period and after 1 week. Since there is little or no evidence of diurnal variation of the salivary microbiome, time of sampling of saliva is not critical for perturbation or other microbial studies."

Compared with chondrocytes isolated from young adult humans, chondrocytes from older adults exhibited higher levels of PRX1–3 hyperoxidation basally and under conditions of oxidative stress. Peroxiredoxin hyperoxidation was associated with inhibition of pro-survival Akt signaling and stimulation of pro-death p38 signaling. These changes were prevented in cultured human chondrocytes by adenoviral expression of catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) and in cartilage explants from MCAT transgenic mice. Peroxiredoxin hyperoxidation was observed in situ in human cartilage sections from older adults and in osteoarthritic cartilage. MCAT transgenic mice exhibited less age-related osteoarthritis. These findings demonstrate that age-related oxidative stress can disrupt normal physiological signaling and contribute to osteoarthritis and suggest peroxiredoxin hyperoxidation as a potential mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2257062313,"Transcutaneous stimulation of the human lumbosacral spinal cord is used to evoke spinal reflexes and to neuromodulate altered sensorimotor function following spinal cord injury. Both applications require the reliable stimulation of afferent posterior root fibers. Yet under certain circumstances, efferent anterior root fibers can be co-activated. We hypothesized that body position influences the preferential stimulation of sensory or motor fibers. Stimulus-triggered responses to transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation were recorded using surface-electromyography from quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and triceps surae muscles in 10 individuals with intact nervous systems in the supine, standing and prone positions. Single and paired (30-ms inter-stimulus intervals) biphasic stimulation pulses were applied through surface electrodes placed on the skin between the T11 and T12 inter-spinous processes referenced to electrodes on the abdomen. The paired stimulation was applied to evaluate the origin of the evoked electromyographic response; trans-synaptic responses would be suppressed whereas direct efferent responses would almost retain their amplitude. We found that responses to the second stimulus were decreased to 14%±5% of the amplitude of the response to the initial pulse in the supine position across muscles, to 30%±5% in the standing, and to only 80%±5% in the prone position. Response thresholds were lowest during standing and highest in the prone position and response amplitudes were largest in the supine and smallest in the prone position. The responses obtained in the supine and standing positions likely resulted from selective stimulation of sensory fibers while concomitant motor-fiber stimulation occurred in the prone position. We assume that changes of root-fiber paths within the generated electric field when in the prone position increase the stimulation thresholds of posterior above those of anterior root fibers. Thus, we recommend conducting spinal reflex or neuromodulation studies with subjects lying supine or in an upright position, as in standing or stepping."
https://openalex.org/W2254384978,"While it has long been known that the pupil reacts to cognitive load, pupil size has received little attention in cognitive research because of its long latency and the difficulty of separating effects of cognitive load from the light reflex or effects due to eye movements. A novel measure, the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA), relates cognitive effort to the frequency of small rapid dilations of the pupil. We report here on a total of seven experiments which test whether the ICA reliably indexes linguistically induced cognitive load: three experiments in reading (a manipulation of grammatical gender match / mismatch, an experiment of semantic fit, and an experiment comparing locally ambiguous subject versus object relative clauses, all in German), three dual-task experiments with simultaneous driving and spoken language comprehension (using the same manipulations as in the single-task reading experiments), and a visual world experiment comparing the processing of causal versus concessive discourse markers. These experiments are the first to investigate the effect and time course of the ICA in language processing. All of our experiments support the idea that the ICA indexes linguistic processing difficulty. The effects of our linguistic manipulations on the ICA are consistent for reading and auditory presentation. Furthermore, our experiments show that the ICA allows for usage within a multi-task paradigm. Its robustness with respect to eye movements means that it is a valid measure of processing difficulty for usage within the visual world paradigm, which will allow researchers to assess both visual attention and processing difficulty at the same time, using an eye-tracker. We argue that the ICA is indicative of activity in the locus caeruleus area of the brain stem, which has recently also been linked to P600 effects observed in psycholinguistic EEG experiments."

Shams received only anesthesia. Behavioral tests were administered at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days post-injury (dpi). CCI animals showed significant motor and sensory deficits in the early (1–7 dpi) and long-term (90 dpi) stages of testing. Interestingly, sensory and subtle motor deficits in rmCHI animals were found at 90 dpi. Most importantly, depression-like behaviors and social passiveness were observed in rmCHI animals at 90 dpi. These data suggest that mild concussive injuries lead to motor and sensory deficits and affective disorders that are not observed after moderate TBI."

Exposure to a high glucose concentration has recently been shown to increase phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser485/491 of its α1/α2 subunit; however, the mechanism by which it does so is not known. Diacylglycerol (DAG), which is also increased in muscle exposed to high glucose, activates a number of signaling molecules including protein kinase (PK)C and PKD1. We sought to determine whether PKC or PKD1 is involved in inhibition of AMPK by causing Ser485/491 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the PKC/D1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which acts as a DAG mimetic. This caused dose- and time-dependent increases in AMPK Ser485/491 phosphorylation, which was associated with a ∼60% decrease in AMPKα2 activity. Expression of a phosphodefective AMPKα2 mutant (S491A) prevented the PMA-induced reduction in AMPK activity. Serine phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK activity were partially prevented by the broad PKC inhibitor Gö6983 and fully prevented by the specific PKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101.

Open fractures are at risk of S. epidermidis transcutaneous contamination leading to higher non-union development compared to closed fractures. Although the role of infection in delaying fracture healing is well recognized, no in vivo models investigated the impact of subclinical low-grade infections on bone repair and non-union. We hypothesized that the non-union rate is directly related to the load of this commonly retrieved pathogen and that a low-grade contamination delays the fracture healing without clinically detectable infection. Rat femurs were osteotomized and stabilized with plates. Fractures were infected with a characterized clinical-derived methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (10(3), 10(5), 10(8) colony forming units) and compared to uninfected controls. After 56 days, bone healing and osteomyelitis were clinically assessed and further evaluated by micro-CT, microbiological and histological analyses. The biofilm formation was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. The control group showed no signs of infection and a complete bone healing. The 10(3) group displayed variable response to infection with a 67% of altered bone healing and positive bacterial cultures, despite no clinical signs of infection present. The 10(5) and 10(8) groups showed severe signs of osteomyelitis and a non-union rate of 83-100%, respectively. The cortical bone reaction related to the periosteal elevation in the control group and the metal scattering detected by micro-CT represented limitations of this study. Our model showed that an intra-operative low-grade S. epidermidis contamination might prevent the bone healing, even in the absence of infectious signs. Our findings also pointed out a dose-dependent effect between the S. epidermidis inoculum and non-union rate. This pilot study identifies a relevant preclinical model to assess the role of subclinical infections in orthopaedic and trauma surgery and to test specifically designed diagnostic, prevention and therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2231147640,"Perceptual training is generally assumed to improve perception by modifying the encoding or decoding of sensory information. However, this assumption is incompatible with recent demonstrations that transfer of learning can be enhanced by across-trial variation of training stimuli or task. Here we present three lines of evidence from healthy adults in support of the idea that the enhanced transfer of auditory discrimination learning is mediated by working memory (WM). First, the ability to discriminate small differences in tone frequency or duration was correlated with WM measured with a tone n-back task. Second, training frequency discrimination around a variable frequency transferred to and from WM learning, but training around a fixed frequency did not. The transfer of learning in both directions was correlated with a reduction of the influence of stimulus variation in the discrimination task, linking WM and its improvement to across-trial stimulus interaction in auditory discrimination. Third, while WM training transferred broadly to other WM and auditory discrimination tasks, variable-frequency training on duration discrimination did not improve WM, indicating that stimulus variation challenges and trains WM only if the task demands stimulus updating in the varied dimension. The results provide empirical evidence as well as a theoretic framework for interactions between cognitive and sensory plasticity during perceptual experience."

Later it was shown that this family of enzymes has protein glutamine methyltransferase activity, and they methylate the glutamine residue in the GGQ motif of ribosomal translation termination factors. The murine HEMK2 enzyme methylates Gln185 of the eukaryotic translation termination factor eRF1. We have employed peptide array libraries to investigate the peptide sequence recognition specificity of murine HEMK2. Our data show that HEMK2 requires a GQX3R motif for methylation activity. In addition, amino acid preferences were observed between the −3 and +7 positions of the peptide substrate (considering the target glutamine as 0), including a preference for Ser, Arg, and Gly at the +1 and a preference for Arg at the +7 position. Based on our specificity profile, we identified several human proteins that contain putative HEMK2 methylation sites and show that HEMK2 methylates 58 novel peptide substrates. After cloning, expression, and purification of the corresponding protein domains, we confirmed methylation for 11 of them at the protein level. Transfected CHD5 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5) and NUT (nuclear protein in testis) were also demonstrated to be methylated by HEMK2 in human HEK293 cells. Our data expand the range of proteins potentially subjected to glutamine methylation significantly, but further investigation will be required to understand the function of HEMK2-mediated methylation in proteins other than eRF1."

The miracidium, along with the cercaria, both of which are water-borne and free-living, are the only two stages in the life-cycle of Schistosoma mansoni which are involved in host invasion. Miracidia penetrate intermediate host snails and develop into sporocysts, which lead to cercariae that can infect humans. Infection of the snail host by the miracidium represents an ideal point at which to interrupt the parasite’s life-cycle. This research focuses on an analysis of the miracidium proteome, including those proteins that are secreted. We have identified a repertoire of proteins in the S. mansoni miracidium at 2 hours post-hatch, including proteases, venom allergen-like proteins, receptors and HSP70, which might play roles in snail-parasite interplay. Proteins involved in energy production and conservation were prevalent, as were proteins predicted to be associated with defence.

PKA affects cell migration potentially through spatiotemporal interactions with regulators of Rho GTPases. Here we show that the endogenous regulatory (R) subunit of type I PKA interacts with P-Rex1, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that integrates chemotactic signals. Type I PKA holoenzyme interacts with P-Rex1 PDZ domains via the CNB B domain of RIα, which when expressed by itself facilitates endothelial cell migration. P-Rex1 activation localizes PKA to the cell periphery, whereas stimulation of PKA phosphorylates P-Rex1 and prevents its activation in cells responding to SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1). The P-Rex1 DEP1 domain is phosphorylated at Ser-436, which inhibits the DH-PH catalytic cassette by direct interaction. In addition, the P-Rex1 C terminus is indirectly targeted by PKA, promoting inhibitory interactions independently of the DEP1-PDZ2 region. A P-Rex1 S436A mutant construct shows increased RacGEF activity and prevents the inhibitory effect of forskolin on sphingosine 1-phosphate-dependent endothelial cell migration. Altogether, these results support the idea that P-Rex1 contributes to the spatiotemporal localization of type I PKA, which tightly regulates this guanine exchange factor by a multistep mechanism, initiated by interaction with the PDZ domains of P-Rex1 followed by direct phosphorylation at the first DEP domain and putatively indirect regulation of the C terminus, thus promoting inhibitory intramolecular interactions. This reciprocal regulation between PKA and P-Rex1 might represent a key node of integration by which chemotactic signaling is fine-tuned by PKA.

https://openalex.org/W2270224028,"Objectives Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), in common with myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3, is stored in human neutrophil granules and is expressed on apoptotic neutrophil surface. We therefore investigated the presence of anti-PTX3 autoantibodies (aAbs) in the sera of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients. Methods Presence of anti-PTX3 autoantibodies was analysed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera from 150 patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and in sera of 227 healthy subjects (HS), 40 systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, and 25 giant cell arteritis patients (GCA). Using indirect immunofluorescence on fixed human neutrophils, we also analyzed the staining pattern associated with the presence of anti-PTX3 aAbs. Results Anti-PTX3 aAbs were detected in 56 of 150 (37.3%) of the AAV patients (versus 12 of 227 (5.3%) of HS, p<0.001) and, interestingly, in 7 of 14 MPO and PR3 ANCA negative AAV patients. Moreover, by indirect immunofluorescence on fixed neutrophils, anti-PTX3 aAbs gave rise to a specific cytoplasmic fluorescence pattern distinct from the classical cytoplasmic (c-ANCA), perinuclear (p-ANCA), and atypical (a-ANCA) pattern. Anti-PTX3 aAbs levels were higher in patients with active AAV as compared to patients with inactive disease. Conclusion Our work suggests that PTX3 is as a novel ANCA antigen. Anti-PTX3 aAbs appear thus as a promising novel biomarker in the diagnosis of AAV, including in patients without detectable MPO and PR3 ANCA."
https://openalex.org/W2277061491,"Caveolin 1 (Cav-1) is an oligomeric protein that forms flask-shaped, lipid-rich pits, termed caveolae, on the plasma membrane. Cav-1 is targeted for lysosomal degradation in ubiquitination- and valosin-containing protein (VCP)-dependent manners. VCP, an ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities that remodels or segregates ubiquitinated protein complexes, has been proposed to disassemble Cav-1 oligomers on the endosomal membrane, facilitating the trafficking of Cav-1 to the lysosome. Genetic mutations in VCP compromise the lysosomal trafficking of Cav-1, leading to a disease called inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Here we identified the Ankrd13 family of ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-containing proteins as novel VCP-interacting molecules on the endosome. Ankrd13 proteins formed a ternary complex with VCP and Cav-1 and exhibited high binding affinity for ubiquitinated Cav-1 oligomers in an UIM-dependent manner. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that Cav-1 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination, which serves as a lysosomal trafficking signal, and that the UIMs of Ankrd13 proteins bind preferentially to this ubiquitin chain type. The overexpression of Ankrd13 caused enlarged hollow late endosomes, which was reminiscent of the phenotype of the VCP mutations in IBMPFD. Overexpression of Ankrd13 proteins also stabilized ubiquitinated Cav-1 oligomers on the limiting membrane of enlarged endosomes. The interaction with Ankrd13 was abrogated in IMBPFD-associated VCP mutants. Collectively, our results suggest that Ankrd13 proteins cooperate with VCP to regulate the lysosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated Cav-1.

Caveolae are flask-shaped pits in the lipid-rich domains of the plasma membrane. They are structured by an electron-dense, membrane-spanning oligomeric protein called caveolin (Cav) 2The abbreviations used are: Cav, caveolin; Ub, ubiquitin; MVB, multivesicular body; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; VCP, valosin-containing protein; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; UBXD, ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein; UBX, ubiquitin regulatory X; CI-M6PR, cation-independent mannose 6-phospate receptor; IBMPFD, inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia. and have been implicated in various cellular activities, including endocytosis and signal transduction (1Parton R.G. Simons K. The multiple faces of caveolae.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The mammalian Cav family consists of three members: Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3. Caveolae mainly comprise either Cav-1 or Cav-3 homo-oligomers, which, at lower proportions, form hetero-oligomers with Cav-2 (2Hayer A. Stoeber M. Bissig C. Helenius A. Biogenesis of caveolae: stepwise assembly of large caveolin and cavin complexes.Traffic. 2010; 11: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cav-1 and Cav-2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas Cav-3 is primarily expressed in striated muscle. Cav proteins associate with the plasma membrane through their central regions, leaving the N- and C-terminal regions oriented toward the cytoplasm (3Parton R.G. del Pozo M.A. Caveolae as plasma membrane sensors, protectors and organizers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized Cav monomers, after their insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are oligomerized into SDS-resistant 8S oligomers together with cholesterol. The 8S oligomers are finally transported to the plasma membrane, where they form 70S oligomers and are stabilized by regulatory proteins, such as cavin, to constitute complete caveolae (2Hayer A.

PTRF-Cavin, a conserved cytoplasmic protein required for caveola formation and function.Cell. 2008; 132: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Cav-1 undergoes endocytosis from the plasma membrane and is transported to the lysosome for degradation in a ubiquitination-dependent manner (5Hayer A. Stoeber M. Ritz D. Engel S. Meyer H.H. Helenius A. Caveolin-1 is ubiquitinated and targeted to intralumenal vesicles in endolysosomes for degradation.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification of proteins with a 76-amino acid protein called ubiquitin (Ub). Ub is conjugated either directly to the Lys residues of various intracellular proteins or through another Ub moiety to form Ub chains (6Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). All the seven Lys residues of Ub are capable of forming Ub chains. Among the different types of polyubiquitination, Lys-48-linked and Lys-63-linked types are the most abundant in the cell (7Meierhofer D. Wang X. Huang L. Kaiser P.

Methods. 2011; 8: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination is known for its role in proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins (6Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination serves as a tag that targets plasma membrane proteins to the lysosome for degradation via the early endosome and late endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) (9Haglund K. Dikic I. The role of ubiquitylation in receptor endocytosis and endosomal sorting.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Tanno H. Komada M. The ubiquitin code and its decoding machinery in the endocytic pathway.J. Biochem. 2013; 153: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Ub moieties of plasma membrane proteins are recognized sequentially on the early endosome by three Ub-binding protein complexes called the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 0, I, and II, and this is followed by the ESCRT-III-mediated incorporation of the ubiquitinated cargo into the inner vesicles of the MVB (11Saksena S. Sun J. Chu T. Emr S.D. ESCRTing proteins in the endocytic pathway.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although the lysosomal trafficking of Cav-1 depends on its ubiquitination and the ESCRT machinery (5Hayer A. Stoeber M. Ritz D. Engel S. Meyer H.H. Helenius A. Caveolin-1 is ubiquitinated and targeted to intralumenal vesicles in endolysosomes for degradation.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is also shown to be required (12Ritz D. Vuk M. Kirchner P. Bug M. Schütz S. Hayer A.

VCP is a homohexameric ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities that utilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis to remodel or segregate ubiquitinated protein complexes (13Jentsch S. Rumpf S.

Emerging functions of the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase in the ubiquitin system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It plays important roles in a myriad of cellular activities, including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, in which VCP pulls misfolded, newly synthesized proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation (15Wolf D.H. Stolz A. The Cdc48 machine in endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mutations in the VCP gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired clearance of protein aggregates, including inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease (16Johnson J.O.

The WT, but not disease mutants, of VCP binds to Cav-1, and the expression of the VCP mutants causes the accumulation of Cav-1 to aberrantly enlarged late endosomes, suggesting that dysfunction of VCP-mediated Cav-1 trafficking is causative of neurodegenerative diseases (12Ritz D.

The ankyrin repeat domain (Ankrd) 13 family of proteins, including Ankrd13A, 13B, and 13D, consists of proteins with three ankyrin repeat domains in the N-terminal region and three or four Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminal region. We have reported previously that Ankrd13 proteins bind via UIMs to ligand-activated, ubiquitinated EGF receptors on the plasma membrane, regulating its rapid endocytosis from the cell surface (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, Ankrd13 proteins are mainly localized on endosomes (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that they have an unidentified endosomal function. In this study, we demonstrated this novel role for Ankrd13 proteins on the endosome. FLAG-tagged Ankrd13 expression vectors were constructed using the mammalian expression vector pME (19Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. A deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY interacts with the Src homology 3 domain of Hrs-binding protein via a novel binding motif PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP.J. Biol.

Human VCP and Cav-1 cDNAs were purchased from GE Healthcare/Dharmacon, tagged C-terminally with the FLAG (VCP and Cav-1) or HA (Cav-1) epitope, and inserted into pME. The FLAG-tagged rat ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein (UBXD) 1 expression vector was provided by M. Nagahama (Meiji Pharmaceutical University) (20Nagahama M. Ohnishi M. Kawate Y.

Commun. 2009; 382: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The FLAG-STAM1 expression vector was constructed as described previously (21Mizuno E. Kawahata K. Kato M. Kitamura N. Komada M. STAM proteins bind ubiquitinated proteins on the early endosome via the VHS domain and ubiquitin-interacting motif.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3675-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce point mutations into the VCP and Cav-1 cDNAs. HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. DNAs were transfected into cells with jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France) for 24 h, FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) for 48 h, or linear polyethylenimine (molecular mass, 25 kDa; 3 μg/ml, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 48 h. For EGF treatment, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h and subsequently incubated with human EGF (100 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (unless indicated), 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After solubilization at 4 °C for 30 min, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. To examine Cav-1 oligomer levels, cells were solubilized in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) (12Ritz D.

To prepare lysates with the hot lysis method, cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA for 12 min at 100 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were diluted 4-fold with 1.33% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). To determine Ankrd13A-associated Ub chains by MS, cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetic acid, 40 μm bortezomib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), 50 μm PR619 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Roche Diagnostics), and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). To access the Ub modifications of Cav-1, cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm iodoacetic acid, 40 μm bortezomib, 50 μm PR619, PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixtures, and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were collected, stored in Protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and sonicated on ice at 30-s intervals with a 1-s short burst and 1-s rest at a moderate power (UR21P, Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min twice, the supernatants were collected into new Protein LoBind tubes and subjected to immunoprecipitation. For the cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, supernatants were diluted 10-fold in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation was performed using standard procedures. Anti-FLAG (1 μg, clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-HA (1.25 μg, clone 12CA5, Roche Diagnostics), anti-VCP (1 μg, catalog no. ab11433, Abcam), and anti-EGF receptor (1 μg, clone 6F1, MBL, Nagoya, Japan) antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. The indicated amounts of antibodies were used for ∼0.5 mg of total proteins in 250 μl of the cell lysate. To immunoprecipitate the Flag-VCP·HA-Cav-1·Ankrd13A ternary complex, cell lysates were precleared in protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in the absence of an antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, and FLAG-VCP was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads (M2 affinity gel, Sigma-Aldrich). Bound FLAG-VCP was eluted from the beads with the FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and subjected to a standard second immunoprecipitation. Primary antibodies for immunoblotting were as follows: anti-EGF receptor (1 μg/ml, clone 6F1, MBL), anti-Ub (1 μg/ml, clone FK2, MBL), anti-Ub (0.76 μg/ml, catalog no.

Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, -rat, and -rabbit IgG antibodies (GE Healthcare). An anti-FLAG (clone M2) peroxidase conjugate (1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was also used. Blots were detected using ECL and ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The intensity of bands in immunoblotted membranes was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 5% FBS in PBS. Cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG (2 μg/ml, catalog no. 7425, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-FLAG (2 μg/ml, clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA (1 μg/ml, clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics), anti-VCP (1:500, catalog no. ab11433, Abcam), anti-EEA1 (1 μg/ml, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-CI-M6PR (5 μg/ml, provided by E. Kominami, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan), and anti-Ub (10 μg/ml, clone FK2, MBL) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated anti-mouse, -rat, and -rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were captured with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM780, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To identify novel Ankrd13-interacting proteins, immunoprecipitated Ankrd13 proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained using a silver stain MS kit (Wako Pure Chemical). Protein bands of interest were excised, diced into small pieces, destained, chemically reduced, and alkylated according to standard procedures. Gels were trypsinized overnight at 37 °C with Trypsin Gold-MS grade (10 ng/μl, Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Digests were quenched and extracted by treatment with 25% acetonitrile/0.5% TFA and sonication. The extracted peptides were collected and concentrated by speed-vac. MALDI-TOF MS analysis was carried out using Ultraflex P TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Raw data were processed and analyzed using flexControl and flexAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics), respectively. Biotools software (Bruker Daltonics) was used to analyze MS spectra and match the peptide sequences with the MASCOT database (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). LC-MS/MS using the absolute quantification strategy was performed as described previously (22Tsuchiya H. Tanaka K. Saeki Y. The parallel reaction monitoring method contributes to a highly sensitive polyubiquitin chain quantification.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 436: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine Ankrd13A-associated Ub chains as well as the Ub modification of Cav-1, immunoprecipitated Ankrd13A and Cav-1 were subjected to SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE BisTris gels (Life Technologies). Gels were stained with bio-safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) and washed extensively with ultrapure water. The protein-loaded regions of the gels were excised, diced into 1-mm3 cubes, destained, and trypsinized overnight at 37 °C with modified sequencing-grade trypsin (20 ng/μl, Promega). Digests were quenched, extracted, and recovered into fresh Protein LoBind tubes. The extracted peptides were concentrated to 15 μl using speed-vac. Seven microliters of the concentrated peptide solution were mixed with 13 μl of 40 fmol of the Ub absolute quantification peptides (22Tsuchiya H. Tanaka K. Saeki Y. The parallel reaction monitoring method contributes to a highly sensitive polyubiquitin chain quantification.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 436: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), 0.1% TFA, and 0.05% H2O2, and an aliquot of the solution containing 10 fmol of the Ub peptide was analyzed on a nanoflow ultra high performance LC instrument (Easy nLC 1000, Q-Exactive MS, and nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). Raw data were processed by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS spectra were analyzed using PinPoint software version 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To determine the possible endosomal function of Ankrd13 proteins, we attempted to identify their novel binding partners using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. FLAG-tagged Ankrd13A, 13B, 13C, and 13D proteins (Fig. 1A) were expressed individually in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of NEM. Silver staining of the precipitated proteins after SDS-PAGE revealed that an ∼100-kDa protein co-precipitates with UIM-bearing Ankrd13A, 13B, and 13D but not with 13C lacking the UIMs (Fig. 1B, asterisks). The protein band was excised from the gel, trypsinized, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, leading to identification of the protein as VCP/p97/Cdc48 (Mascot score, 157; data not shown). The interaction was confirmed by anti-VCP immunoblotting, which detected VCP in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from FLAG-Ankrd13A-, 13B-, and 13D-transfected cell lysates only in the presence of NEM (Fig. 1C). Because NEM inhibits cysteine protease-type deubiquitinases, these results suggest that the Ankrd13-VCP interaction requires protein ubiquitination. The binding of endogenous Ankrd13 proteins to VCP was then examined. Untransfected HeLa cells were lysed in the presence of NEM and immunoprecipitated with the control IgG or anti-VCP antibody. Blotting of the precipitates with specific antibodies for Ankrd13A, 13C, and 13D showed that endogenous Ankrd13A and 13D, but not 13C, were co-precipitated successfully with endogenous VCP (Fig. 1D). The expression of endogenous Ankrd13B was not detected in HeLa cells with our or commercially available anti-Ankrd13B antibodies (data not shown). To identify the region in Ankrd13 proteins required for VCP binding, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Ankrd13A mutants lacking ankyrin repeats (ΔAR), lacking the UIM region (ΔUIM), or harboring Δ1Δ2Δ3Δ4 point mutations with substitutions in the invariant Ala/Val and Ser residues in the four UIMs (Fig. 1A) (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody, and co-precipitated VCP was detected by immunoblotting. ΔAR bound to VCP, whereas ΔUIM and Δ1Δ2Δ3Δ4 did not (Fig. 1E). We further examined the VCP binding of Ankrd13A mutants with point mutations in individual UIMs. Consistent with our previous findings that the two C-terminally located UIMs (UIM3 and UIM4) are important for Ub binding (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the VCP-binding ability was reduced in the mutant with mutations in UIM3 and UIM4 (Fig. 1F, Δ3Δ4). VCP binding of the mutant with mutations in UIM1 and UIM2 (Δ1Δ2) and that in mutants with mutations individually in UIM3 (Δ3) or UIM4 (Δ4) was not affected significantly (Fig. 1F), suggesting that Ub-binding ability is required for Ankrd13 proteins to interact with VCP. We subsequently examined whether the Ankrd13-VCP interaction is direct. FLAG-Ankrd13A was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cells were lysed at 100 °C in the presence of 1% SDS to dissociate non-covalently associated proteins from Ankrd13A. Ankrd13A was renatured, immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using the anti-FLAG antibody, and eluted from the antibody with the FLAG peptide. VCP was also immunoprecipitated with the anti-VCP antibody from the lysate of untransfected COS-7 cells prepared in the presence of 1% SDS at 100 °C. VCP-immobilized beads were incubated with eluted FLAG-Ankrd13A, and, after washing the beads, the precipitates were blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. FLAG-Ankrd13A was not pulled down with VCP (Fig. 1G). To exclude the possibility that proteins were not functionally renatured after boiling in SDS, we performed control experiments with known direct binding partners for Ankrd13A (i.e. ubiquitinated EGF receptor) (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and VCP (i.e. co-factor UBXD1) (20Nagahama M. Ohnishi M. Kawate Y. Matsui T. Miyake H. Yuasa K. Tani K. Tagaya M. Tsuji A. UBXD1 is a VCP-interacting protein that is involved in ER-associated degradation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As expected (18Tanno H. Yamaguchi T. Goto E. Ishido S. Komada M. The Ankrd 13 family of UIM-bearing proteins regulates EGF receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the eluted FLAG-Ankrd13A was pulled down with EGF receptor immunopurified from the lysate of EGF-treated cells prepared in boiling 1% SDS (data not shown). A direct interaction between VCP and UBXD1 was also confirmed in an experiment in which FLAG-UBXD1 was immunopurified from cell lysates prepared in 1% SDS at 100 °C and pulled down with VCP-immobilized beads (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that the interaction between Ankrd13A and"

https://openalex.org/W2272697427,"Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a 3′-to-5′ phosphorolytic exoribonuclease, is thought to be the primary enzyme responsible for turnover of Bacillus subtilis mRNA. The role of PNPase in B. subtilis mRNA decay has been analyzed previously by comparison of mRNA profiles in a wild-type strain versus a strain that is deleted for pnpA, the gene encoding PNPase. Recent studies have provided evidence for a degradosome-like complex in B. subtilis that is built around the major decay-initiating endonuclease, RNase Y, and there is ample evidence for a strong interaction between PNPase and RNase Y. The role of the PNPase-RNase Y interaction in the exonucleolytic function of PNPase needs to be clarified. We sought to construct a B. subtilis strain containing a catalytically active PNPase that could not interact with RNase Y. Mapping studies of the PNPase-RNase Y interaction were guided by a homology model of B. subtilis PNPase based on the known structure of the Escherichia coli PNPase in complex with an RNase E peptide. Mutations in B. subtilis residues predicted to be involved in RNase Y binding showed a loss of PNPase-RNase Y interaction. Two mRNAs whose decay is dependent on RNase Y and PNPase were examined in strains containing full-length PNPase that was either catalytically active but unable to interact with RNase Y, or catalytically inactive but able to interact with RNase Y. At least for these two mRNAs, disruption of the PNPase-RNase Y interaction did not appear to affect mRNA turnover.

At least for these two mRNAs, disruption of the PNPase-RNase Y interaction did not appear to affect mRNA turnover. Bacterial mRNA turnover is an essential process that replenishes the ribonucleotide pool and plays a role in regulation of gene expression. We have been studying 3′-exonuclease activity in Bacillus subtilis, the Gram-positive model organism. Although at least four 3′-exonucleases are known to exist in B. subtilis (1.Oussenko I.A. Abe T.

The B. subtilis pnpA gene was originally identified in a transposon insertion screen of competence-deficient mutants, and was also shown to be required for cold adaptation (4.Luttinger A. Hahn J. Dubnau D. Polynucleotide phosphorylase is necessary for competence development in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A deletion strain lacking most of the pnpA coding sequence (the ΔpnpA strain) was constructed, and additional phenotypes were observed: growth as non-motile chains, tetracycline sensitivity (5.Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. Properties of a Bacillus subtilis polynucleotide phosphorylase deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and accumulation of mRNA decay intermediates (1.Oussenko I.A. Abe T. Ujiie H. Muto A. Bechhofer D.H.

More recently, reliance of global mRNA turnover on PNPase was examined in an RNA sequencing analysis of the B. subtilis transcriptome in wild-type and ΔpnpA strains, and this demonstrated the broad impact of PNPase on mRNA turnover (7.Liu B.

Many of the above mentioned studies were performed before the discovery of RNase Y, a B. subtilis endoribonuclease that appears to function in initiation of decay similarly to the more well known RNase E of Escherichia coli (8.Commichau F.M.

Endonucleolytic cleavage in the body of a message by RNase E in E. coli or RNase Y in B. subtilis generates mRNA fragments that are susceptible to further steps in mRNA turnover. In addition, just as RNase E of E. coli coordinates a complex of several proteins known as the “degradosome,” so, too, there is evidence that RNase Y of B. subtilis is the organizing protein for a complex that includes, at least, PNPase, CshA (an RNA helicase), and the glycolytic enzymes, enolase and phosphofructokinase (8.Commichau F.M.

A PNPase-RNase Y interaction was first indicated by bacterial-2-hybrid (B2H) assay and in vivo protein crosslinking experiments (8.Commichau F.M. Rothe F.M. Herzberg C. Wagner E. Hellwig D. Lehnik-Habrink M. Hammer E. Völker U. Stülke J. Novel activities of glycolytic enzymes in Bacillus subtilis: interactions with essential proteins involved in mRNA processing.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1350-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This interaction has more recently been confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis, which showed a strong PNPase-RNase Y interaction with a Kd of 5 nm (12.Newman J.A. Hewitt L. Rodrigues C. Solovyova A.S. Harwood C.R. Lewis R.J. Dissection of the network of interactions that links RNA processing with glycolysis in the Bacillus subtilis degradosome.J. Mol.

Structural mapping of regions of PNPase that interact with an RNase E peptide has been done for the E. coli enzyme (13.Nurmohamed S. Vaidialingam B. Callaghan A.J. Luisi B.F.

The existence of a PNPase-RNase Y complex raises the question of whether this interaction is relevant to the ability of PNPase to rapidly degrade upstream decay intermediates that are created by RNase Y cleavage. In addition, prior results of experiments in the strain that contained no PNPase may be confounded by effects on RNase Y; the complete absence of PNPase protein in the ΔpnpA strain may not only affect 3′-exonucleolytic turnover directly, but may also affect RNase Y-mediated initiation of decay indirectly. As such, we sought to map the regions of PNPase that interact with RNase Y, to construct a B. subtilis mutant strain containing a catalytically active PNPase that is unable to interact with RNase Y. E. coli DH5α (14.Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Differential plasmid rescue from transgenic mouse DNAs into Escherichia coli methylation-restriction mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The wild-type B. subtilis strain was BG1, a trpC2 thr-5 derivative of B. subtilis strain 168. In BG546, a large portion of the pnpA coding sequence (CDS) was replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette, as described previously (5.Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. Properties of a Bacillus subtilis polynucleotide phosphorylase deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the wild-type pnpA CDS was replaced with a CDS containing the RNase Y interaction domain E331A change, to give BG1039. Similarly, the wild-type pnpA CDS was replaced with a CDS containing the active site D493A change, to give BG1030. A B. subtilis PNPase model was constructed based on the crystal structure of the E. coli PNPase trimer in complex with an RNase E peptide (Protein Data Bank identifier 3GCM (13.Nurmohamed S.

The models were assessed and ranked with Z-DOPE, a normalized atomic distance-dependent statistical potential based on known protein structures (18.Shen M.Y. Sali A. Statistical potential for assessment and prediction of protein structures.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2507-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). For each PNPase chain, we modeled the residues that are included in the E. coli PNPase structure (13.Nurmohamed S. Vaidialingam B. Callaghan A.J. Luisi B.F.

Biol. 2009; 389: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The models were visualized using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC). The electrostatic potential of the homology model and template structure surfaces were calculated using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) plug-in in PyMOL. To prioritize residues for mutagenesis, various “hotspot” predictors on the E. coli PNPase/RNase E template structure were run, and the predicted residues were evaluated according to their conservation between E. coli and B. subtilis PNPase sequences, as well as their location in the B. subtilis PNPase model. In particular, hotspots were predicted using the KFC2 server (19.Darnell S.J. Page D. Mitchell J.C.

Plasmids for the B2H assay carrying the pnpA and rny coding sequences (pGP984 and pGP978, respectively) were constructed previously (8.Commichau F.M. Rothe F.M. Herzberg C. Wagner E. Hellwig D.

Point mutations in the pnpA CDS were constructed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Agilent Technologies). Primer sequences are available on request. All gene mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the complete pnpA CDS. For replacement of the wild-type pnpA allele with mutant versions, we used the pMiniMAD vector (23.Patrick J.E. Kearns D.B. MinJ (YvjD) is a topological determinant of cell division in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A 2.1-kb fragment containing the pnpA gene was amplified by PCR with an upstream primer that contained an EcoRI site and a downstream primer that contained a BamHI site. The amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pMiniMAD plasmid. Replacement of the wild-type pnpA allele with a mutated allele carried on the pMiniMAD plasmid derivative was performed as described (23.Patrick J.E. Kearns D.B. MinJ (YvjD) is a topological determinant of cell division in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing wild-type (pGP984) or mutant PNPase CDSs were co-transformed with the RNase Y-containing plasmid (pGP798) into E. coli strain BTH101. Strains carrying the PNPase and RNase Y plasmids were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth (LB, 10 g of Tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl/liter) and diluted for plating on MacConkey agar plates (Difco, BD Biosciences) containing maltose (1%), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm). The plates were incubated for 30 h at 30 °C and then at room temperature overnight to enhance the colony color. As a negative control, cells were co-transformed with pGP984 and pKT25::zip (24.Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. A bacterial two-hybrid system that exploits a cAMP signaling cascade in Escherichia coli.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the CDS for the yeast GCN4 transcription factor. Pellets from 40 ml of E. coli overnight cultures (∼0.3 g of dry weight) were frozen/thawed and treated with 1.2 ml of B-PER reagent (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. 3 μl of soluble protein extract were loaded on a 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed under reducing conditions. The gel was electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 30 V. Membranes were probed with either mouse anti-cyaA (adenylate cyclase) antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-13582, lot number C2715) or anti-GAPDH antibody at a 1:5000 dilution (Antibodies-online, catalog number L001, lot number 01016), followed by goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected by ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce) and quantitated on a Typhoon TRIO variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare). For RNA isolation, a 1:40 dilution of an overnight culture was inoculated into LB broth. Cells were harvested at mid-logarithmic stage (A600 0.4–0.5), and total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method (25.Bechhofer D.H. Oussenko I.A. Deikus G. Yao S. Mathy N. Condon C. Analysis of mRNA decay in Bacillus subtilis.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 447: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit fluorimeter (Invitrogen), and RNA integrity was checked on a 1% denaturing agarose MOPS gel. To determine mRNA half-life, total RNA was isolated at times after the addition of 150 μg/ml rifampin. RNA was either fractionated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted, or fractionated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose MOPS gel and blotted by wicking. T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P] ATP were used to prepare 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The rpsO probe was complementary to the sequence from 13 nt upstream to 10 nt downstream of the rpsO start codon. The cggR probe was complementary to nt 37–66 of the cggR CDS. To control for RNA loading, membranes were stripped and probed either for 5S rRNA, as described (26.Sharp J.S. Bechhofer D.H. Effect of translational signals on mRNA decay in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5372-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or for 16S rRNA, using an oligonucleotide complementary to nt 1405–1424 (27.Sulthana S. Deutscher M.P. Multiple exoribonucleases catalyze maturation of the 3′ terminus of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA).J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 12574-12579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results were the average of two or more biological replicates. Quantitation of the radioactivity in bands on Northern blots was performed with a Typhoon TRIO variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare). To determine the half-life of full-length RNA, exponential regression analysis (R2 > 0.9) was performed on the percentage of RNA remaining versus time. Bacterial PNPase exists primarily as a trimer (28.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. A duplicated fold is the structural basis for polynucleotide phosphorylase catalytic activity, processivity, and regulation.Structure. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). B. subtilis and E. coli PNPase share 52% identity and 69% similarity (Fig. 1A). A homology model of the B. subtilis PNPase trimer was generated based on the trimeric structure of the E. coli PNPase (Fig. 1, B and C) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Z-DOPE score of the top model was −0.3, indicating that this model would likely be sufficiently accurate to guide further structural and functional studies. The E. coli crystal structure also contained a 21-amino acid peptide of the exonuclease RNase E (Fig. 1, B and C, yellow) that is in contact with E. coli PNPase (13.Nurmohamed S. Vaidialingam B. Callaghan A.J. Luisi B.F. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase core bound to RNase E, RNA and manganese: implications for catalytic mechanism and RNA degradosome assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The interacting peptide binds at a site that is formed by residues from adjacent monomers. Although there is no sequence similarity between E. coli RNase E and B. subtilis RNase Y, these two proteins are thought to play functionally equivalent roles in the initiation of mRNA decay (29.Laalami S. Zig L. Putzer H. Initiation of mRNA decay in bacteria.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 1799-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that RNase Y binds to B. subtilis PNPase in a similar region as RNase E binds to E. coli PNPase. In support of this hypothesis, the overall shape and electrostatic potential of both the E. coli structure and the B. subtilis model were analyzed (Fig. 2, A and B). The surface of E. coli PNPase in the region that interacts with the RNase E peptide showed a pronounced electrostatic potential (called the “electrostatic channel” below), as well as a deep binding pocket for the helical domain of the RNase E peptide (Fig. 2A). The overall shape, electrostatic potential, and binding pocket were conserved in the corresponding location of the B. subtilis PNPase (Fig. 2B), suggesting that RNase Y binds in a similar manner to PNPase.FIGURE 2.Electrostatic channel for binding of interacting peptide. A, surface representation of the E. coli PNPase/RNase E trimer structure showing the electrostatic channel, with positive charge in blue and negative charge in red.

B, surface representation of the B. subtilis PNPase model, showing a similar predicted electrostatic channel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several B. subtilis PNPase residues, Glu-20, Arg-35, Asp-323, Glu-331, and Arg-546, were hypothesized to be involved in the RNase Y interaction. These are charged residues located on the protein surface that are predicted to be far from the catalytic site and that correspond with residues of E. coli PNPase that appear to interact with the RNase E peptide (13.Nurmohamed S. Vaidialingam B. Callaghan A.J. Luisi B.F. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase core bound to RNase E, RNA and manganese: implications for catalytic mechanism and RNA degradosome assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The B2H assay system (24.Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. A bacterial two-hybrid system that exploits a cAMP signaling cascade in Escherichia coli.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen for the interaction of RNase Y with PNPase mutant proteins. For this, we used plasmids pGP798, which contains the RNase Y CDS fused to the N-terminal fragment of the adenylate cyclase catalytic domain, and pGP984, which contains the PNPase CDS fused to the C-terminal fragment of the adenylate cyclase catalytic domain (8.Commichau F.M. Rothe F.M. Herzberg C. Wagner E. Hellwig D. Lehnik-Habrink M. Hammer E. Völker U. Stülke J. Novel activities of glycolytic enzymes in Bacillus subtilis: interactions with essential proteins involved in mRNA processing.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1350-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Derivatives of pGP984 were constructed that had the above mentioned PNPase residues mutated to alanine. The B2H assay of PNPase-RNase Y interaction was performed on MacConkey agar plates (see “Experimental Procedures”). To ensure that the introduction of mutations did not cause drastic changes in protein stability, Western blotting analysis was performed using antibody to the C-terminal fragment of the adenylate cyclase catalytic domain. The data in Fig. 3A show the presence of full-length PNPase/adenylate cyclase fusion protein for all mutants examined. Although there was as much as an 8-fold difference in protein amounts relative to wild type, the absolute level of protein did not affect the results of the B2H assay. Thus, several mutants showed a high level of fusion protein on the Western blot but were negative for interaction in the B2H assay, and several mutants showed a low level of fusion protein on the Western blot but were positive for interaction in the B2H assay. Apparently, the readout is sensitive to protein function, but is not strongly dependent on the amount of protein. We mutated one of the two proposed glutamate residues, Glu-331, to alanine. The B2H assay indicated a clear loss of interaction of the E331A mutant with RNase Y (Table 1, first round); although wild-type PNPase gave an intense pink color on the B2H assay, the E331A mutant showed no pink color (Fig. 3B). In a close-up of B. subtilis PNPase regions that correspond to E. coli PNPase regions that interact with the RNase E peptide (Fig. 3C), the Glu-331 side chain is seen to be facing, and a short distance (∼3 Å) from, the helical domain of the peptide. As shown in Fig. 3C, the position of the Glu-20 side chain suggests that this residue is also an important contributor to the binding site.TABLE 1B2H screening resultsMutated residueResidue characteristicsColony colora−, no pink color (no interaction); +, light pink color (weak interaction); ++, dark pink color (strong interaction).Controls and wild type Negative control− Wild type++ D493A++First round R35ASurface residue, positive electrostatic potential++ D323AConserved surface residue, negative electrostatic potential+ E331ASurface residue, negative electrostatic potential− R546AConserved surface residue, positive electrostatic potential+Second round Q3APredicted to affect RNase Y interaction; located in N-terminal loop region− Q23ALocated in predicted RNase Y binding pocket− P327ATest bottom boundary of electrostatic channel+ L334AFaces RNase Y binding pocket− P336AClose proximity to RNase E peptide loop; P may be structurally significant+ E533APredicted not to affect RNase Y interaction; located close to boundary of electrostatic channel+Third round D11APredicted not to affect RNase Y interaction+ D11SPredicted to affect RNase Y interaction less than D11A++ M33APossible hydrophobic effect+a −, no pink color (no interaction); +, light pink color (weak interaction); ++, dark pink color (strong interaction). Open table in a new tab The other three mutants, R35A, D323A, and R546A, showed a weaker effect in the B2H assay (Table 1), and the close-up in Fig. 3D provides the rationale for this observation. The Arg-35 side chain faces the non-helical domain of the binding peptide, and its mutation may therefore have less effect. Arg-546 is located farther away from the binding peptide, perhaps in an unstructured region. The third residue, Asp-323, sits near the C-terminal end of the peptide sequence, which likely explains the weaker effect of mutating this residue. To prioritize additional residues for mutagenesis studies, we used three different hotspot predictor servers on the E. coli PNPase/RNase E template structure (see “Experimental Procedures”). Residues predicted to be hotspots were evaluated further based on their location in the B. subtilis PNPase model, and their evolutionary conservation as calculated by ConSurf. Six additional PNPase residues were selected to be mutated to alanine (Table 1, second round) and were tested by B2H analysis for the RNase Y interaction. Mutation of three residues, Gln-3, Gln-23, and Leu-334, resulted in a loss of RNase Y interaction. As can be seen in Fig. 3C, these three residues sit in close proximity (∼3 Å) to the helical domain of the binding peptide. Although we have no data yet, it is likely that Leu-24 (Fig. 3C) is also important for formation of the binding site. From these results, and according to the models in Fig. 3, C and D, the binding site for the interacting peptide is formed by N-proximal residues of one PNPase monomer and two central regions of an adjacent monomer (Fig. 1A, underlined regions). Pro-327 and Pro-336 were chosen to test the boundaries of the electrostatic channel that interacts"

To study the transcriptional response of stem cells to HH signaling, we searched for proteins binding to GLI proteins, the transcriptional effectors of the HH pathway in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

In differentiating ES cells, the presence of NANOG reduces the transcriptional response of cells to HH. Finally, we found that Gli1 and Nanog are co-expressed in ES cells at high levels.

HH ligands, including Sonic hedgehog, bind to the Patched1 (PTCH1) receptor, which activates the transmembrane protein Smoothened, resulting in pathway activation (for a review, see Ref. 1.Briscoe J. Thérond P.P. The mechanisms of Hedgehog signalling and its roles in development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The transcriptional response to HH ligands is mediated by the GLI family of transcription factors (GLI1–3), which can act as both transcriptional activators and repressors in a context-dependent fashion (for a review, see Ref. 2.Falkenstein K.N. Vokes S.A. Transcriptional regulation of graded Hedgehog signaling.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 33: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of HH ligand causes the maturation of full-length GLI proteins into their transcriptional activator forms (GLI-A), whereas in the absence of ligand GLI proteins undergo C-terminal truncation and then act as transcriptional repressors (GLI-R). Although GLI2 and GLI3 exist in both activator and repressor forms, GLI2 is the major activator, whereas GLI3 is the major repressor (3.Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H.

The HH pathway was initially characterized for its role in regulating embryonic development, but it also has critical roles in regulating the homeostasis of several adult tissues (for a review, see Ref. 12.Petrova R. Joyner A.L. Roles for Hedgehog signaling in adult organ homeostasis and repair.Development. 2014; 141: 3445-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In particular, HH regulates two major neural stem cell populations in the brain, the ventral subventricular zone and subgerminal zone, as well as quiescent hair follicle stem cells (13.Hsu Y.C. Li L. Fuchs E. Transit-amplifying cells orchestrate stem cell activity and tissue regeneration.Cell. 2014; 157: 935-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the absence or inhibition of the HH pathway, these tissues undergo a marked reduction in the number of proliferating cells, indicating that the pathway is required for normal proliferation (14.Álvarez-Buylla A. Ihrie R.A. Sonic hedgehog signaling in the postnatal brain.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 33: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Conversely, hyperactivation of the HH pathway results in an expanded population of neural stem cells. In this context, the progeny of neural stem cells is shifted so that they preferentially give rise to two daughter stem cells instead of producing transient amplifying cells capable of generating differentiated progeny (15.Ferent J. Cochard L. Faure H. Taddei M. Hahn H. Ruat M. Traiffort E. Genetic activation of hedgehog signaling unbalances the rate of neural stem cell renewal by increasing symmetric divisions.Stem Cell Rep. 2014; 3: 312-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together these results indicate that the levels of HH perceived by neural stem cells regulate the balance between generating stem cells and differentiated progenitors. In addition to regulating normal neural development, various studies have suggested that populations of stem cells play key roles in cancer. In particular, GLI proteins have been shown to activate the transcription of the pluripotency factor Nanog in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cancer models (16.Po A. Ferretti E. Miele E. De Smaele E. Paganelli A. Canettieri G. Coni S. Di Marcotullio L. Biffoni M. Massimi L. Di Rocco C. Screpanti I. Gulino A.

NANOG regulates glioma stem cells and is essential in vivo acting in a cross-functional network with GLI1 and p53.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2659-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NANOG in turn is critical for maintaining tumorigenic cell populations, suggesting positive feedback between these factors (16.Po A. Ferretti E. Miele E. De Smaele E. Paganelli A. Canettieri G. Coni S. Di Marcotullio L. Biffoni M. Massimi L. Di Rocco C. Screpanti I. Gulino A.

NANOG regulates glioma stem cells and is essential in vivo acting in a cross-functional network with GLI1 and p53.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2659-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although HH signaling, via GLI transcription factors, is critical for regulating neural stem cells, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remain poorly understood. In part, this is because it is difficult to isolate large numbers of these stem cells. In an effort to understand this process, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen to identify GLI-binding proteins in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that might act as stem cell-specific cofactors. Here, we report that GLI1 and GLI3 bind to the pluripotency factor NANOG. The presence of NANOG inhibits GLI transcriptional responses, therefore inhibiting HH signaling. We show that Gli1 is expressed at high levels in ES cells along with Nanog. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that NANOG also binds to and inhibits the transcriptional effectors of both the BMP and NF-κB pathways in ES cells (18.Torres J. Watt F.M. Nanog maintains pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells by inhibiting NFκB and cooperating with Stat3.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19.Suzuki A.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that, by binding to multiple transcriptional effectors, NANOG may help to buffer ES cells from external signals. Unless specified otherwise, statistical significance was measured using a paired t test with a two-tailed p value. NIH3T3 and HEK293Tcells were cultured with 10% calf serum in DMEM. P19 cells were cultured with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 7.5% calf serum in α minimum essential medium Eagle (Sigma, M8042). ES cell lines containing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) and FLAG-tagged GLI1 or GLI3T driven by the Rosa26 promoter (9.Vokes S.A. Ji H. McCuine S. Tenzen T. Giles S. Zhong S. Longabaugh W.J.

Expression of FLAG-tagged GLI1 and GLI3T was induced by adding 1 μm 4-OH-tamoxifen (Sigma, H7904) for at least 48 h. The feeder-free J1 ES cells (ATCC, SCRC 1010) and J1 biotinylated NANOG ES cells (FB-NANOG) (20.Kim J. Chu J. Shen X. Wang J. Orkin S.H. An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar) were cultured on gelatinized plates. ES cells were cultured in medium containing 15% FBS with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) at a final concentration of 1,000 units/ml. In vitro differentiation of ES cells was induced by removing LIF from the ES cell medium. 1,200 ng of Nanog shRNA lentiviral plasmid (shNG; Sigma Mission RNAi TRCN0000075333) or control (shCtrl; pLKO.1-puro vector containing 1.9 kb of inert DNA) was co-transfected with 400 ng of vesicular stomatitis virus G and 800 ng of Δ8.9 into HEK293T cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 1 day, the medium was changed to ES cell medium without LIF to obtain LIF-free supernatant for ES cell infection. After an additional 24 h, the supernatant containing the viruses was harvested. Immediately before infection, the undiluted supernatant was mixed with Polybrene (Sigma) to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml and then mixed with 5 × 105 resuspended J1 ES cells. The ES cells were then incubated overnight before providing fresh medium on the 2nd day. The ES cells were split on day 3 into ES cell medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin, and HH signaling was stimulated by treatment with 5 μm purmorphamine or 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle control) for 2 days. A single 15-cm plate (containing ∼3 × 108 ES cells expressing FLAG-tagged GLI1/3R or control cells) was harvested with cell scrapers in cold Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were spun down at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of Lysis Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science))/0.3 ml of cell pellet. The cells were incubated with the Lysis Buffer at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. 1 ml of supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube, and 0.3 volume of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) was added to dilute the salt concentration of cell lysate to a final concentration of ∼0.3 m. 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, A2220) was mixed with 1.3 ml of cell lysate, rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed three times with Washing Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture) and then with Elution Base Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture, no FLAG peptides) once. This was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 30 s, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of Complete Elution Buffer (200 μg/ml 3XFLAG peptides (Sigma, F4799) in Elution Base Buffer), and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with frequent vortexing. The supernatant was collected by spinning at 2,500 × g for 30 s, loaded on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and minimally resolved by electrophoresis for 10 min at 120 V. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue for 1 h and destained for 30 min. The stained part of the gel containing proteins was excised and digested with trypsin. Peptides were sequenced by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteins were identified as described previously (21.Takata K. Reh S. Tomida J. Person M.D. Wood R.D.

Briefly, the digested peptides were desalted using Millipore U-C18 ZipTip pipette tips following the manufacturer's protocol. A 2-cm-long × 100-μm-inner diameter C18 5-μm trap column (Proxeon EASY column) was followed by a 75-μm-inner diameter × 15-cm-long analytical column packed with C18 3-μm material (Dionex Acclaim PepMap 100). Peptides were separated by a 60-min 5–45% B gradient using Buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). On the Orbitrap Elite, the Fourier transformed MS resolution was set to 120,000, and the top 20 MS/MS spectra were acquired by collision-induced dissociation using the ion trap. For the Velos Pro, the ion trap was used for MS, and the top 20 MS/MS spectra were collected using the data-dependent acquisition method. Raw data were processed using SEQUEST embedded in Proteome Discoverer v1.3, searching the mouse reference proteome from UniProt (March 2012 containing 54,201 entries). A decoy database was used for calculating peptide and protein probabilities. X! Tandem database searches were performed embedded in Scaffold 4 Q+ (Proteome Software) using the same search parameters as SEQUEST. Scaffold was used for validation of peptide and protein identifications with filtering to achieve 99% protein confidence with two peptides at 95% confidence. The mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (23.Vizcaíno J.A. Deutsch E.W. Wang R. Csordas A. Reisinger F. Ríos D. Dianes J.A. Sun Z. Farrah T. Bandeira N.

Protein samples were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBS-Tween 20 buffer for 30 min and incubated with the primary antibodies anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, FLAG M2 antibody, F1804; 1:4,000), anti-HA (Thermo Scientific, 26183; 1:4,000), anti-NANOG (Calbiochem, SC1000; 1:2,000), anti-actin (Sigma, A2066; 1:2,000), and anti-POU5F1 (OCT4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC5279; 1:1,000) in 3% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-Tween 20 for 5 min, membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:5,000) and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:5,000) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBS-Tween 20 three times, membranes were developed by using ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, RPN2232) and visualized by exposure to CL-XPosure films (Thermo Scientific, 34091). To determine -fold change, Western blots were quantified using ImageJ, and NANOG intensities were normalized to actin intensities. P19 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, 11668019) with 300 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid ptcΔ136-pGL3 (24.Nybakken K.

In samples with less than 100 ng of NANOG or OCT4, pCIG vector was added to a total of 100 ng. pBluescript DNA was then added as filler DNA so that each sample had a total of 800 ng of transfected DNA. The serum levels in the medium were reduced to 0.5% at the time of transfection. The cells were harvested 2 days after transfection and assayed for activity using the One-Glo Luciferase Assay lit (Promega, E6120). All luciferase activities were normalized with β-galactosidase activity levels (quantified using the BetaFluor β-gal assay kit (G-Biosciences, 786-654)). RNA was extracted from ES cells by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), and cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA. Quantitative PCR was performed on a ViiA7 platform using 2× SensiFast SYBR mixture (Bioline, BIO-94020).

We searched Barcode-annotated samples (26.McCall M.N. Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A.

In Barcode, samples were processed to facilitate cross-data set comparisons by minimizing unwanted variation such as laboratory or batch effects. Because of this, expression levels of a gene can be meaningfully compared across heterogeneous samples in the Barcode compendium as shown previously (28.Wu G. Yustein J.T. McCall M.N. Zilliox M. Irizarry R.A. Zeller K. Dang C.V. Ji H. ChIP-PED enhances the analysis of ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After identifying samples for each expression pattern, statistically enriched biological contexts were identified using the Gene Set Context Analysis package in R/Bioconductor (29.Ji Z. Vokes S.A. Dang C.V. Ji H. Turning publicly available gene expression data into discoveries using gene set context analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which implements the ChIP-PED method (28.Wu G. Yustein J.T. McCall M.N. Zilliox M. Irizarry R.A. Zeller K. Dang C.V. Ji H. ChIP-PED enhances the analysis of ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To identify biological contexts associated with a specific gene expression pattern of Gli1 and Nanog, we counted the total number of samples (N), number of total samples with the specified expression pattern (K), total number of samples Nc for each biological context (c), and number of samples of biological context (c) with the specific expression pattern Kc. A Fisher's exact test was then performed for each context (c) to see whether it is enriched in the specified expression pattern. The p values were corrected using the Bonferroni procedure by multiplying the total number of tested contexts (c) to adjust for multiple testing. For gene expression analysis in differentiating ES cells, we obtained expression data from a previous study (30.Hailesellasse Sene K. Porter C.J. Palidwor G. Perez-Iratxeta C. Muro E.M. Campbell P.A. Rudnicki M.A. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Gene function in early mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (GSE3749), which generated triplicate time course measurements during differentiation of J1 mouse ES cells. The CEL files were imported into dChIP software (31.Schadt E.E. Li C. Ellis B. Wong W.H. Feature extraction and normalization algorithms for high-density oligonucleotide gene expression array data.J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2001; 37: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) for data normalization and extraction of expression values. To identify GLI-associated proteins in ES cells, we used a line that contained a tamoxifen-inducible Cre as well as a Cre-activatable 3XFLAG-tagged GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) allele driven by the ubiquitous Rosa26 promoter (10.Vokes S.A.

We performed mass spectrometry-based protein identification on FLAG-immunoprecipitated lysates from tamoxifen-induced ES cells (GLI3RFLAG) and control, parental ES cells that do not express GLI3RFLAG. We sorted the resulting list based on the Z score enrichment. The most enriched protein in this list was the bait protein, GLI3. This list also contained two proteins, suppressor of fused (SUFU) and 14-3-3 (Table 1), that were previously shown to bind GLI proteins (32.Humke E.W. Dorn K.V. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Rohatgi R.

We set a cutoff Z-score value of 1.5, which allowed for the inclusion of both of these proteins (Table 1). The remaining 19 proteins have not previously been associated with GLI proteins.

Extensive in vitro structural analysis has led to a working model of Hsp90's ATP-driven conformational cycle. An implicit assumption is that dilute experimental conditions do not significantly perturb Hsp90 structure and function. However, Hsp90 undergoes a dramatic open/closed conformational change, which raises the possibility that this assumption may not be valid for this chaperone. Indeed, here we show that the ATPase activity of Hsp90 is highly sensitive to molecular crowding, whereas the ATPase activities of Hsp60 and Hsp70 chaperones are insensitive to crowding conditions. Polymer crowders activate Hsp90 in a non-saturable manner, with increasing efficacy at increasing concentration. Crowders exhibit a non-linear relationship between their radius of gyration and the extent to which they activate Hsp90. This experimental relationship can be qualitatively recapitulated with simple structure-based volume calculations comparing open/closed configurations of Hsp90. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that crowding activation of Hsp90 is entropically driven, which is consistent with a model in which excluded volume provides a driving force that favors the closed active state of Hsp90. Multiple Hsp90 homologs are activated by crowders, with the endoplasmic reticulum-specific Hsp90, Grp94, exhibiting the highest sensitivity. Finally, we find that crowding activation works by a different mechanism than co-chaperone activation and that these mechanisms are independent. We hypothesize that Hsp90 has a higher intrinsic activity in the cell than in vitro.

Obstetrical complications recorded in the first trimester included spontaneous miscarriage (5 pregnancies). Four patients delivered preterm, including one delivery due to preeclampsia at 26 weeks which resulted with neonate death due to extreme prematurity. Five women delivered via cesarean: four due to obstetrical indications and one due to mastocytosis, during which no anesthesia related complications were recorded. Of patients delivering vaginally, two received extradural anesthesia, three required oxytocin infusion due to uterine hypotonia. No labor complications were recorded. In one woman with pregnancy-induced hypertension, early puerperium was complicated by the presence of persistent arterial hypertension. One neonate was born with the signs of cutaneous mastocytosis. Another neonate was diagnosed with Patau syndrome. Four women were treated for mastocytosis prior to conception and continued therapy after becoming pregnant. One patient was put on medications in the first trimester due to worsening of her symptoms. Pregnancy exerted only a slight effect on the intensity and frequency of mastocytosis-related symptoms observed. Worsening of the disease-related symptoms was documented in only four patients (23%). None of the patients showed the signs of anaphylaxis, either before becoming pregnant, or during pregnancy and puerperium.There is no contraindication to pregnancy when mastocystosis-related pathologies are under appropriate medical control."
https://openalex.org/W2317897385,"The interaction of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plays a critical role in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) maturation. We previously identified a highly solvent-exposed apoA-I loop domain (Leu159–Leu170) in nascent HDL, the so-called “solar flare” (SF) region, and proposed that it serves as an LCAT docking site (Wu, Z., Wagner, M. A., Zheng, L., Parks, J. S., Shy, J. M., 3rd, Smith, J. D., Gogonea, V., and Hazen, S. L. (2007) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 14, 861–868). The stability and role of the SF domain of apoA-I in supporting HDL binding and activation of LCAT are debated. Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that multiple residues within the SF region (Pro165, Tyr166, Ser167, and Asp168) of apoA-I are critical for both LCAT binding to HDL and LCAT catalytic efficiency. The critical role for possible hydrogen bond interaction at apoA-I Tyr166 was further supported using reconstituted HDL generated from apoA-I mutants (Tyr166 → Glu or Asn), which showed preservation in both LCAT binding affinity and catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the in vivo functional significance of NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I, a specific post-translational modification on apoA-I that is abundant within human atherosclerotic plaque, was further investigated by using the recombinant protein generated from E. coli containing a mutated orthogonal tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair enabling site-specific insertion of the unnatural amino acid into apoA-I. NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I, after subcutaneous injection into hLCATTg/Tg, apoA-I−/− mice, showed impaired LCAT activation in vivo, with significant reduction in HDL cholesteryl ester formation. The present results thus identify multiple structural features within the solvent-exposed SF region of apoA-I of nascent HDL essential for optimal LCAT binding and catalytic efficiency.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), transports lipids and also serves as a protein scaffold for numerous HDL-associated protein interactions. The HDL particle is responsible for facilitating reverse cholesterol transport, a multistep process that removes cholesterol from peripheral tissues and ultimately from the body in feces. To promote its cholesterol carrier functions, apoA-I exists in multiple forms throughout the reverse cholesterol transport process. Initially, lipid-free or lipid-poor apoA-I becomes lipidated, generating the nascent HDL particle via the ATP-binding cassette transporter type 1 (ABCA1) 4The abbreviations used are: ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter type 1; LCAT, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase; SF, solar flare; rHDL, reconstituted HDL containing recombinant human apoA-I; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; hLCAT, human LCAT; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; kcat, catalytic efficiency; Kd, equilibrium dissociation constant, Km, Michaelis constant; Vmax, maximum velocity; LC/MS/MS, HPLC with on-line tandem mass spectrometry; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; CD, circular dicroism.

Although capable of facilitating reverse cholesterol transport, subsequent maturation of the HDL particle into a cholesteryl ester-laden spherical particle substantially increases the capacity of the HDL particle to carry cholesterol cargo.

Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analyses, we previously identified a peptide region (Leu159–Ala180) within apoA-I of nascent HDL with a markedly enhanced hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate, indicating a predominantly open and solvent-accessible conformation (24Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. The refined structure of nascent HDL reveals a key functional domain for particle maturation and dysfunction.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A functional role for this region as an LCAT interaction site was suggested based upon additional hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry results, which showed reductions in deuterium incorporation rate within the overlapping apoA-I peptide region Leu159-Leu170 of nascent HDL in the presence versus absence of LCAT (24Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. The refined structure of nascent HDL reveals a key functional domain for particle maturation and dysfunction.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We called this a “solar flare” (SF) region of apoA-I because it presumably represented a highly solvent-exposed protruding loop on the anti-parallel apoA-I chain in a nascent HDL particle (24Wu Z.

We reported that both point mutation of Tyr166 of apoA-I (i.e. Y166F), a residue that we showed is a target for oxidative post-translational modification within human atherosclerotic plaque (25Zheng L.

However, in contrast to our report that apoA-I Y166F affects LCAT activity by as much as 70% reduction (24Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. The refined structure of nascent HDL reveals a key functional domain for particle maturation and dysfunction.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), others reported a more minor (∼20%) reduction of LCAT activity of Y166F and questioned the significance of this residue and the SF region as a docking site for LCAT interaction (13Kunnen S. Van Eck M. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase: old friend or foe in atherosclerosis?.J. Lipid Res. 2012; 53: 1783-1799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, we developed recombinant apoA-I with site-specific 3-nitrotyrosine incorporation only at position 166 of apoA-I using an evolved orthogonal nitro-Tyr-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair. This enabled in vitro studies with recombinant human apoA-I incorporating this unnatural amino acid exclusively at position 166 to evaluate functional effects of NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I within reconstituted HDL and illustrated a reduced capacity to activate LCAT in vitro (26DiDonato J.A. Aulak K. Huang Y. Wagner M. Gerstenecker G. Topbas C. Gogonea V. DiDonato A.J. Tang W.H. Mehl R.A. Fox P.L. Plow E.F. Smith J.D. Fisher E.A. Hazen S.L.

There thus exists debate of the significance of the SF region of apoA-I for HDL/LCAT interaction, both as a docking site and in the activation of LCAT for particle maturation. We hypothesize that within the SF region of apoA-I, some of the amino acids are important for maintaining the structure of the loop and thus play a role in LCAT docking, whereas the same or others may impact presentation of the HDL particle lipid to LCAT, impacting catalytic activity. Herein we explore in detail critical structural and functional relationships within this proposed LCAT interaction loop of apoA-I to define the role(s) for individual amino acids in supporting both optimal LCAT binding to the nascent HDL particle and optimal LCAT catalytic efficiency. We also explore for the first time the in vivo functional impact of post-translational modification of apoA-I Tyr166 through nitration, which is enriched in human atherosclerotic lesions, using a humanized mouse model of apoA-I/LCAT interaction and infusion of endotoxin-free recombinant NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I. All chemicals were from Sigma, and all solvents were HPLC grade unless otherwise indicated. [3H]cholesterol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The purity of recombinant apoA-I forms was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purity and size of reconstituted HDL containing recombinant human apoA-I (rHDL) was estimated using both 4–20% non-denaturing equilibrium gel electrophoresis using precast gels (Bio-Rad) and dual-beam light scattering. The size of nascent HDL was determined by comparison with protein standards of known Stokes diameter (GE Healthcare). Cholesterol efflux (total and ABCA1-dependent) activity was measured using RAW264.7 cells in 48-well dishes according to established laboratory procedures (27Li X.M. Tang W.H. Mosior M.K. Huang Y.

HDL cholesterol mass (both free and cholesteryl ester forms) were quantified using mass spectrometry as described previously (28Huang Y. DiDonato J.A. Levison B.S. Schmitt D. Li L. Wu Y. Buffa J.

All mouse studies were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Cleveland Clinic. Transgenic human LCAT mice (hLCATTg/Tg) backcrossed onto a C57Bl/6J background (>10 generations) were provided by Dr. J. S. Parks and were described previously (10Furbee Jr., J.W. Parks J.S. Transgenic overexpression of human lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in mice does not increase aortic cholesterol deposition.Atherosclerosis. 2002; 165: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ApoA-I knock-out mice (apoA-I−/−) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and have been backcrossed for >10 generations onto a C57Bl/6J background. Human LCAT Tg mice that are apoA-I-deficient (hLCATTg/Tg, apoA-I−/−) were generated by breeding hLCATTg/Tg mice on a C57Bl/6J background (>10 generations) with apoA-I−/− mice on a C57Bl/6J background (>10 generations). Recombinant human apoA-I mutants carrying a single substitution (P165A, Y166X (where X represents Ala, Glu, Phe, or Asn), S167A, D168A, Y192F, or Y192L) were created by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template was the plasmid pET20b, containing the mature human apoA-I sequence, that had been codon-optimized for Escherichia coli expression as described previously (28Huang Y. DiDonato J.A. Levison B.S. Schmitt D. Li L. Wu Y. Buffa J. Kim T. Gerstenecker G.S. Gu X. Kadiyala C.S. Wang Z. Culley M.K. Hazen J.E. Didonato A.J. Fu X. Berisha S.Z. Peng D. Nguyen T.T. Liang S. Chuang C.C.

The QuikChange primers were designed by the online QuickChange Primer Design Program and further synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). The sequence of each mutated cDNA was verified by automated DNA sequence analysis before it was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for the expression of the recombinant proteins. Wild-type and mutant apoA-I forms were purified to homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described (29Peng D.Q. Wu Z. Brubaker G. Zheng L. Settle M. Gross E.

For studies where apoA-I was injected into mice for in vivo LCAT activity measurements, recombinant human apoA-I and NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I were generated as described previously (26DiDonato J.A. Aulak K.

Med. 2014; 20: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels in all recombinant apoA-I were confirmed to be nominal (<0.5 EU/mg/ml protein) by a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) under conditions where positive controls showed detection of trace levels of LPS (1.0 EU/mg/ml protein) added to apoA-I. rHDL containing the indicated recombinant apoA-I was prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method (30Matz C.E. Jonas A. Micellar complexes of human apolipoprotein A-I with phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol prepared from cholate-lipid dispersions.J. Biol.

All rHDL preparations were further purified using a Sephacryl-S300 column (GE Healthcare). Pooled fractions of rHDL were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 10k centrifugal filter devices (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The amounts of phospholipids and cholesterol in purified rHDL preparations were determined by a microphosphorus assay and a cholesterol enzymatic assay kit (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX), respectively, as described previously (31Wu Z. Gogonea V. Lee X. Wagner M.A. Li X.M. Huang Y. Undurti A. May R.P. Haertlein M. Moulin M. Gutsche I. Zaccai G. Didonato J.A. Hazen S.L. Double superhelix model of high density lipoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36605-36619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The content of apoA-I within rHDL preparations was quantified by UV absorbance at A280 nm. Extinction coefficients used for WT and mutant apoA-I forms were individually calculated using the ProtParam tool, a program provided freely by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The ϵ280 used was 32,430 mol−1 cm−1 for WT apoA-I and the mutants P165A, S167A, and D168A and 30,940 mol−1 cm−1 for the apoA-I mutants Y166F, Y166A, Y166E, Y192F, and Y192L. Before use of UV spectroscopy for apoA-I quantification in all mutant apoA-I forms, the accuracy of this approach was verified (for WT and a few different mutant apoA-Is) by stable isotope dilution HPLC with on-line tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) by quantifying the amounts of leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine in apoA-I in acid hydrolysates using heavy isotope-labeled leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine as internal standards. Recombinant human LCAT (hLCAT) was purified from the culture medium of CHO cells transfected with hLCAT plasmid as described (32Chisholm J.W. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. Characterization of C-terminal histidine-tagged human recombinant lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase.J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1512-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rHDL used as substrate for LCAT assay was prepared as described above but with the incorporation of a trace amount of [3H]cholesterol (45 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare). The reaction mixtures contained 0–35 μm HDL cholesterol and 20 ng of purified His-tagged hLCAT in a buffer composed of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Reactions were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C under argon. LCAT activity was determined by calculating the conversion efficiency of [3H]cholesterol into [3H]cholesteryl ester after lipid extraction of reaction mixture followed by thin layer chromatography and scintillation counting (24Wu Z.

The extent of cholesterol esterification was kept below 5% of free cholesterol levels to maintain first order kinetics. The fractional cholesterol esterification rate was expressed as nmol of cholesteryl ester formed/h/ng of LCAT. Apparent Vmax and Km values were determined from Hanes-Woolf plots of cholesterol substrate concentration divided by the cholesteryl ester formation rate versus HDL cholesterol substrate concentration using GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

It is of great research interest because of its nonconserved quaternary structures, unique species-specific aminoacylation properties, and noncanonical functions in neurological diseases, but none of these is fully understood. We report two crystal structures of human GlyRS variants, in the free form and in complex with tRNAGly respectively, and reveal new aspects of the glycylation mechanism. We discover that insertion 3 differs considerably in conformation in catalysis and that it acts like a “switch” and fully opens to allow tRNA to bind in a cross-subunit fashion. The flexibility of the protein is supported by molecular dynamics simulation, as well as enzymatic activity assays. The biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that human GlyRS may utilize its flexibility for both the traditional function (regulate tRNA binding) and alternative functions (roles in diseases).

In the first step of the reaction, the enzymes catalyze the condensation between ATP and the specific amino acid to generate an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate. In the second, they transfer the activated amino acid to the acceptor stem of cognate tRNA to form the product aminoacyl-tRNA. The 20 aaRSs can be grouped into two distinct classes based of the conservation of primary sequences and quaternary structures (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D.

This phenomenon may be attributed to the distinct discriminator base at position 73. In eukaryotes, it is an adenosine that precedes the 3′-CCA end, whereas in prokaryotes, a uridine is present (9Freist W. Logan D.T. Gauss D.H. Glycyl-tRNA synthetase.Biol. Chem.

The human GlyRS (hGlyRS) is a class IIa synthetase and forms a homodimer using motif 1. Motifs 2 and 3, on the other hand, are responsible for recognizing the substrates glycine and ATP. Additionally, hGlyRS features an N-terminal WHEP-TRS domain, as well as several insertion domains named insertions 1–3 (9Freist W. Logan D.T. Gauss D.H. Glycyl-tRNA synthetase.Biol. Chem.

CMT is one of the most commonly inherited neurological disorders of the peripheral nervous system (22Skre H. Genetic and clinical aspects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease.Clin. Genet. 1974; 6: 98-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 23Jani-Acsadi A. Krajewski K. Shy M.E. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies: diagnosis and management.Semin. Neurol. 2008; 28: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), manifested by progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy or hand and foot deformities. CMT is usually caused by inherited or de novo mutations in genes related to the structures and functions of myelin sheath or axon (24Vallat J.M. Mathis S. Funalot B. The various Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2013; 26: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on the nerve conduction velocity, CMT can be roughly divided into the CMT1 subtype with demyelinating and reduced nerve conduction velocities, the CMT2 subtype with axonal and moderately reduced or normal nerve conduction velocities, and the intermediate subtypes, respectively (25Thomas P.K. Calne D.B. Motor nerve conduction velocity in peroneal muscular atrophy: evidence for genetic heterogeneity.J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

Subtypes are further classified according to the inheritance patterns and gene mutations, and more than 50 genes are implicated in various subtypes (24Vallat J.M. Mathis S. Funalot B. The various Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2013; 26: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Saporta M.A. Shy M.E. Inherited peripheral neuropathies.Neurol.

We have previously solved two cocrystal structures of hGlyRS bound with tRNAGly in the presence of glycine and an ATP analog and identified critical elements involved in enzyme-tRNA interactions. In addition, we proposed a working model for the aminoacylation reaction of hGlyRS that greatly contributes to the understanding of its catalytic mechanism (37Qin X. Hao Z. Tian Q. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xie W. Cocrystal structures of glycyl-tRNA synthetase in complex with tRNA suggest multiple conformational states in glycylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20359-20369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, in both structures we reported, insertions 1 and 3 are mostly unstructured. Insertion 1 (Ala145–Asn225) is located between motifs 1 and 2, and it was proposed to bind to the minor groove of 3′-end of tRNA (38Logan D.T. Mazauric M.H. Kern D. Moras D. Crystal structure of glycyl-tRNA synthetase from Thermus thermophilus.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4156-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); insertions 2 (Asp307–Asn348) and 3 (Val440–Val504) are only found in eukaryotic GlyRSs, and their functions are not fully understood (17Xie W. Nangle L.A. Zhang W. Schimmel P. Yang X.L. Long-range structural effects of a Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-causing mutation in human glycyl-tRNA synthetase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9976-9981Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of the disorder, the roles of the insertions 1 and 3 are uncertain in catalysis, although we speculated that they are responsible for the binding to different regions of tRNA (37Qin X. Hao Z. Tian Q. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xie W. Cocrystal structures of glycyl-tRNA synthetase in complex with tRNA suggest multiple conformational states in glycylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20359-20369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here, we report two new crystal structures with improved resolution, with or without the tRNA substrate. We resolved the entire insertion 3 in both structures, as well as partial insertion 1 in the tRNA-bound complex. Insertion 3 acts like a conformational “switch” to control the binding of tRNA, and it is absolutely critical to aminoacylation. The structural information presented here allows for a better understanding of hGlyRS catalysis and provides new insight into the enzyme mechanism of eukaryotic GlyRSs. hGlyRS (accession no. BAA06338) contains 739 residues, and its first 54 residues encode a mitochondria localization signal peptide. The cytosolic portion of hGlyRS (designated as WTFL, including residues 56–739) was amplified from the HeLa cell line cDNA library and ligated into pET-21b (+) vector (EMD Biosciences) using the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI. The WHEP-TRS domain-truncated form of WT GlyRS (WTSF, where “SF” represents “short form”) was amplified and subcloned with the same restriction sites, containing 637 residues (residues 114–739 plus the cloning sites). The apo form of full-length E71G (E71GFL) was generated by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using WTFL as the template, whereas the WHEP-TRS-truncated form of the E71G/C157R double mutant (E71G/C157RSF) and the mutants for activity assays were produced by QuikChange PCRs using WTSF as the template. Mutants with multiple mutations in WTSF were created by consecutive QuikChange PCRs.

All the purified mutants displayed a symmetrical peak on the size exclusion column, suggesting that they were well folded. E71GFL was crystallized in 13–15% PEG 6000, 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), and 0.1 m NaCl. For crystallization of the tRNA-bound complex, E71G/C157RSF was mixed with tRNAGly in 1:1.2 molar ratio in a buffer with 4 mm glycine, 4 mm adenosine 5-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate (AMPPNP), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The complex was incubated on ice for 30 min and filtered before crystallization. Cocrystals were found in 27% PEG 6000, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). After optimization, the best crystals were produced by mixing the sample of the complex, reservoir solution, and the additive E9 from the Silver Bullets screen (39McPherson A. Cudney B. Searching for silver bullets: an alternative strategy for crystallizing macromolecules.J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 387-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) containing 0.2% (w/v) 4-diaminobutane, 0.2% (w/v) cystamine dihydrochloride, 0.2% (w/v) diloxanide furoate, 0.2% (w/v) sarcosine, 0.2% (w/v) spermine, 0.02 m HEPES sodium (pH 6.8) in a 2:1:1 ratio (v/v). All crystals were grown at 25 °C, and the fully grown crystals were soaked for 1–3 min in a cryoprotective solution containing all the components of the reservoir solution plus 20% (v/v) glycerol. The soaked crystals were mounted on a nylon loop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native data of both forms of crystals were collected at −173 °C using Beamline 17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Shanghai, China). The data were processed with the programs HKL 2000 (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The space group of the E71G/C157RSF-tRNAGly-AMPPNP cocrystals belongs to P21212 with a diffracting resolution of 2.90 Å, whereas that of E71GFL belongs to P43212 with 2.75 Å resolution. The structures of E71GFL and the E71G/C157RSF-tRNAGly-AMPPNP complex were solved by molecular replacement, using Phenix (41Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

Multiple cycles of refinement alternates with model rebuilding. The final R factors (Rwork/Rfree) were 0.214 and 0.265 for the E71G/C157RSF-tRNAGly-AMPPNP complex and 0.21 and 0.255 for E71GFL (Table 2). The Ramachandran plots of the final models have 91.7, 6.55, and 1.75% residues in the most favorable, generously allowed, and disallowed regions for the E71G/C157RSF-tRNAGly-AMPPNP complex and 94.89, 4.44, and 0.67% residues in the most favorable, generously allowed, and disallowed regions for the apoenzyme, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The assay mixture contains 150 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 3 mm ATP, 20 μm l-glycine, 2 μm l-[3H]glycine, and 5 μm annealed tRNAGly(CCC). 25 nm WTSF or mutants were added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was carried out at ambient temperature, and aliquots were removed at designated time points, spotted onto TCA-soaked filter pads, washed twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and washed twice with 95% ethanol. The filter pads were dried and measured by scintillation counting. For the oxidation-reduction experiments, no reducing agent was added during the protein purification process. The protein oxidation was carried out by incubation of the enzyme or cysteine to alanine mutants with 1 mm oxidized glutathione for 1 h, whereas the reduction was carried out by treatment of the proteins with 10 mm DTT for 12 h after dialyzing away the extra oxidized glutathione. Then activity assays were performed with the above procedure, except the enzyme concentration was increased to 50 nm. The protocol for in vitro transcription of the tRNA substrates follows the same procedure as described previously (37Qin X. Hao Z. Tian Q. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xie W. Cocrystal structures of glycyl-tRNA synthetase in complex with tRNA suggest multiple conformational states in glycylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20359-20369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For 5′-end radiolabeling of tRNA, 0.5 μg of tRNAGly(CCC) was incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture consisting of 1× T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, 1.7 μm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl; Thermo Scientific). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled product was cleaned with a Zymo-Spin IC Column (Zymo Research) and eluted with 60 μl of TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. To calculate approximate Kd values between hGlyRS and tRNA, 1 μl of 5′-labeled tRNAGly(CCC) (>5 × 103 cpm) was incubated with various concentrations of purified WT GlyRS or mutants (0.5–16 μm). The protein-tRNA complexes were formed in 15 μl of a binding buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm glycine, 2 mm AMPPNP, and 2 mm DTT for 30 min at 25 °C before being loaded into 6% native polyacrylamide gels (pH 8.5). The gel was run at 4 °C at 14.0 V/cm after a prerun for 1 h, with a running buffer of 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.5). The samples of complexes were mixed in equal volumes with a sample buffer of 6% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue. After electrophoresis, the gel was removed from the apparatus, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate overnight. The plate was scanned with a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare), and the resulting band intensities were quantified using the software ImageJ. The approximate Kd values were derived from the equation tRNAbound/tRNAtotal = [protein]/(Kd + [protein]). A typical reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 4 μm [32P]pyrophosphate (91 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 mm glycine. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme or mutants at 100 nm, and aliquots were taken at different time points and spotted on a cellulose polyethyleneimine TLC plate (Merck Millipore). The spots were 2 cm from the bottom of the plate and 1 cm apart, and the plates were developed in 750 mm KH2PO4 and 4 m urea for 40 min at 25 °C in a glass jar. Then the TLC plates were exposed to a phosphorimaging plate for 50 min.

https://openalex.org/W2287582581,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important driver for resistance- and virulence factor accumulation in pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.Here, we have investigated the downstream region of the bacterial chromosomal attachment site (attB) for the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element of a commensal mecC-positive Staphylococcus stepanovicii strain (IMT28705; ODD4) with respect to genetic composition and indications of HGT. S. stepanovicii IMT28705 was isolated from a fecal sample of a trapped wild bank vole (Myodes glareolus) during a screening study (National Network on ""Rodent-Borne Pathogens"") in Germany. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of IMT28705 together with the mecC-negative type strain CM7717 was conducted in order to comparatively investigate the genomic region downstream of attB (GenBank accession no. KR732654 and KR732653).The bank vole isolate (IMT28705) harbors a mecC gene which shares 99.2% nucleotide (and 98.5% amino acid) sequence identity with mecC of MRSA_LGA251. In addition, the mecC-encoding region harbors the typical blaZ-mecC-mecR1-mecI structure, corresponding with the class E mec complex. While the sequences downstream of attB in both S. stepanovicii isolates (IMT28705 and CM7717) are partitioned by 15 bp direct repeats, further comparison revealed a remarkable low concordance of gene content, indicating a chromosomal ""hot spot"" for foreign DNA integration and exchange.Our data highlight the necessity for further research on transmission routes of resistance encoding factors from the environmental and wildlife resistome."
https://openalex.org/W2410133331,"The effectiveness of an intervention in clinical practice is often reduced compared to the efficacy demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). In this comparative effectiveness study, the RCT-proven efficacy of a diabetes education programme for type 1 diabetic patients (PRIMAS) was compared to the effectiveness observed in an implementation trial (IT) under routine care conditions.75 patients with type 1 diabetes received PRIMAS through an RCT, whereas 179 patients were observed in an implementation trial. Baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (improvement of HbA1c, hypoglycaemia problems, and diabetes-related distress) were compared.At baseline, the type 1 diabetic patients in the RCT had a significant longer diabetes duration (18.7 ± 12.3 vs. 13.8 ± 12.7 yrs., p = .005), lower self-efficacy scores (21.9 ± 4.7 vs. 23.7 ± 6.1, p = .02) and a greater number of diabetes complications (0.8 ± 1.3 vs. 0.4 ± 0.9, p = .02). After 6 months, PRIMAS achieved comparable effects under RCT and implementation trial conditions, as demonstrated by improvement in HbA1c (-0.36% ± 1.1 vs. -0.37 ± 1.2; Δ -0.01, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.31) and hypoglycaemia unawareness (-0.5 ± 1.4 vs. -0.3 ± 1.4; Δ 0.18, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.57). The likelihood of clinical improvement did not depend on the trial setting (RCT vs. IT: OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.33). The participants with worse glycaemic control (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.92), hypoglycaemia problems (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.97) or elevated diabetes distress (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) had a better chance of clinical improvement.The effectiveness of PRIMAS under routine care conditions was comparable to the efficacy demonstrated in the RCT. Clinical improvement was independent of the setting in which PRIMAS was evaluated. The PRIMAS education programme for type 1 diabetes can be delivered under conditions of routine care without a loss of effectiveness, compared to its original evaluation in an RCT."
https://openalex.org/W2256826326,"Graphlets are small subgraphs, usually containing up to five vertices, that can be found in a larger graph. Identification of the graphlets that a vertex in an explored graph touches can provide useful information about the local structure of the graph around that vertex. Actually finding all graphlets in a large graph can be time-consuming, however. As the graphlets grow in size, more different graphlets emerge and the time needed to find each graphlet also scales up. If it is not needed to find each instance of each graphlet, but knowing the number of graphlets touching each node of the graph suffices, the problem is less hard. Previous research shows a way to simplify counting the graphlets: instead of looking for the graphlets needed, smaller graphlets are searched, as well as the number of common neighbors of vertices. Solving a system of equations then gives the number of times a vertex is part of each graphlet of the desired size. However, until now, equations only exist to count graphlets with 4 or 5 nodes. In this paper, two new techniques are presented. The first allows to generate the equations needed in an automatic way. This eliminates the tedious work needed to do so manually each time an extra node is added to the graphlets. The technique is independent on the number of nodes in the graphlets and can thus be used to count larger graphlets than previously possible. The second technique gives all graphlets a unique ordering which is easily extended to name graphlets of any size. Both techniques were used to generate equations to count graphlets with 4, 5 and 6 vertices, which extends all previous results.

https://openalex.org/W2474114646,"Adult passerines renew their flight feathers at least once every year. This complete moult occurs either in the breeding areas, just after breeding (summer moult), or, in some long-distance migratory species, at the non-breeding areas, after arrival to the southern wintering area at the end of autumn migration (winter moult). The aim of this study was to relate moult strategies with the DMD, the difference in median migration date, through Israel, between juveniles and adults. Our data on autumn migration timing in juveniles and adults was based on ringing data of 49,125 individuals belonging to 23 passerine species that breed in Europe and Western Asia and migrate through Israel. We found that DMD was associated with moult timing. In all species that perform a winter moult, adults preceded juveniles during autumn. Among migrants who perform a summer moult, we found evidence of both migration timing patterns: juveniles preceding adults or adults preceding juveniles. In addition, in summer moulters, we found a significant, positive correlation between mean breeding latitude and DMD. Although previous studies described that moult duration and extent can be affected by migration, we suggest that moult strategies affect both migration timing and migration strategy. These two moult strategies (summer or winter moult) also represent two unique migration strategies. Our findings highlight the evolutionary interplay between moult and migration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2281249506,"Nuclear speckles are subnuclear storage sites containing pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Proteins assembled in nuclear speckles are known to modulate transcription and pre-mRNA processing. We have previously identified nuclear speckle-related protein 70 (NSrp70) as a novel serine/arginine (SR)-related protein that co-localizes with classical SR proteins such as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1 or ASF/SF2) and SRSF2 (SC35). NSrp70 mediates alternative splice site selection, targeting several pre-mRNAs, including CD44 exon v5. Here we demonstrated that NSrp70 interacts physically with two SR proteins, SRSF1 and SRSF2, and reverses their splicing activity in terms of CD44 exon v5 as exon exclusion. The NSrp70 RS-like region was subdivided into three areas. Deletion of the first arginine/serine-rich-like region (RS1) completely abrogated binding to the SR proteins and to target mRNA and also failed to induce splicing of CD44 exon v5, suggesting that RS1 is critical for NSrp70 functioning. Interestingly, RS1 deletion also resulted in the loss of NSrp70 and SR protein speckle positioning, implying a potential scaffolding role for NSrp70 in nuclear speckles. NSrp70 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain that is critical not only for self-oligomerization but also for splicing activity. Consistently, deletion of the coiled-coil domain resulted in indefinite formation of nuclear speckles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NSrp70 acts as a new molecular counterpart for alternative splicing of target RNA, counteracting SRSF1 and SRSF2 splicing activity."
https://openalex.org/W2413779170,"We examine the hypothesis that driven by a competition heuristic, people don't even reflect or consider whether a cooperation strategy may be better. As a paradigmatic example of this behavior we propose the zero-sum game fallacy, according to which people believe that resources are fixed even when they are not. We demonstrate that people only cooperate if the competitive heuristic is explicitly overridden in an experiment in which participants play two rounds of a game in which competition is suboptimal. The observed spontaneous behavior for most players was to compete. Then participants were explicitly reminded that the competing strategy may not be optimal. This minor intervention boosted cooperation, implying that competition does not result from lack of trust or willingness to cooperate but instead from the inability to inhibit the competition bias. This activity was performed in a controlled laboratory setting and also as a crowd experiment. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of these behaviors may help us improve cooperation and thus may have vast practical consequences to our society."
https://openalex.org/W2277909394,"Replicative DNA polymerases (DNAPs) require divalent metal cations for phosphodiester bond formation in the polymerase site and for hydrolytic editing in the exonuclease site. Me2+ ions are intimate architectural components of each active site, where they are coordinated by a conserved set of amino acids and functional groups of the reaction substrates. Therefore Me2+ ions can influence the noncovalent transitions that occur during each nucleotide addition cycle. Using a nanopore, transitions in individual Φ29 DNAP complexes are resolved with single-nucleotide spatial precision and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. We studied Mg2+ and Mn2+, which support catalysis, and Ca2+, which supports deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) binding but not catalysis. We examined their effects on translocation, dNTP binding, and primer strand transfer between the polymerase and exonuclease sites. All three metals cause a concentration-dependent shift in the translocation equilibrium, predominantly by decreasing the forward translocation rate. Me2+ also promotes an increase in the backward translocation rate that is dependent upon the primer terminal 3′-OH group. Me2+ modulates the translocation rates but not their response to force, suggesting that Me2+ does not affect the distance to the transition state of translocation. Absent Me2+, the primer strand transfer pathway between the polymerase and exonuclease sites displays additional kinetic states not observed at >1 mm Me2+. Complementary dNTP binding is affected by Me2+ identity, with Ca2+ affording the highest affinity, followed by Mn2+, and then Mg2+.

https://openalex.org/W2273600697,"Introduction Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) for infants decreased overall invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), while non-vaccine serotype IPD increased. To fully understand this serotype replacement, knowledge about serotype dynamics in the pre-vaccine era is needed. In addition to IPD surveillance and carriage studies, the serotype replacement can be investigated by serosurveillance studies. The current study compared the results of two Dutch serosurveillance studies conducted in 1995–1996 (PIENTER1) and 2006–2007 (PIENTER2). Methods Participants in these studies donated a blood sample and completed a questionnaire. Pneumococcal antibodies of serotypes included in PCV13 were measured with a fluorescent-bead based multiplex immunoassay. Geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) and determinants of pneumococcal antibody levels were investigated. Results GMCs were higher in PIENTER2 for serotypes 1, 6A, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19F and 23F and lower for 3 and 5. Age, day care attendance, household size, vaccination coverage, and urbanisation rate were associated with pneumococcal antibodies in children. Education level, ethnicity, age, low vaccination coverage sample, urbanisation rate, and asthma/COPD were associated with pneumococcal antibodies in elderly. The determinants significantly associated with pneumococcal IgG were slightly different for the elderly in PIENTER1 compared to the elderly in PIENTER2. Conclusion Although most of the serotype antibody levels remained stable, some of the serotype-specific antibody levels varied during the pre-vaccine era, indicating that exposure of certain serotypes changes without interference of PCVs."
