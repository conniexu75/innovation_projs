However, it is a challenge to assess metabolism at a spatial resolution that acknowledges both heterogeneity and cellular dynamics in its tissue microenvironment. Using a multi-omics platform to study cell-type-specific dynamics in metabolism in complex tissues, we describe the metabolic trajectories during nephrogenesis in the developing human kidney. Exploiting in situ analysis of isotopic labeling, a shift from glycolysis toward fatty acid β-oxidation was observed during the differentiation from the renal vesicle toward the S-shaped body and the proximal tubules. In addition, we show that hiPSC-derived kidney organoids are characterized by a metabolic immature phenotype that fails to use mitochondrial long-chain fatty acids for energy metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of butyrate enhances tubular epithelial differentiation and maturation in cultured kidney organoids. Our findings highlight the relevance of understanding metabolic trajectories to efficiently guide stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4308294792,"How the eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex scans along the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of a capped mRNA to locate the correct start codon remains elusive. Here, we directly track yeast 43S-mRNA binding, scanning, and 60S subunit joining by real-time single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. 43S engagement with mRNA occurs through a slow, ATP-dependent process driven by multiple initiation factors including the helicase eIF4A. Once engaged, 43S scanning occurs rapidly and directionally at ∼100 nucleotides per second, independent of multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by RNA helicases post ribosomal loading. Scanning ribosomes can proceed through RNA secondary structures, but 5' UTR hairpin sequences near start codons drive scanning ribosomes at start codons backward in the 5' direction, requiring rescanning to arrive once more at a start codon. Direct observation of scanning ribosomes provides a mechanistic framework for translational regulation by 5' UTR structures and upstream near-cognate start codons."
https://openalex.org/W4308294180,"The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large-scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and non-linear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain."

We used single-cell RNA-sequencing to map the transcriptomic landscape of human fetal BM and spleen hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their microenvironment from 10 to 14 post-conception weeks (PCWs). We further demonstrated that functional HSCs capable of reconstituting long-term multi-lineage hematopoiesis in adult NOG mice do not emerge in the BM until 12 PCWs. In contrast, functional HSCs were not detected in the spleen by 14 PCWs. By comparing the niche-HSPC interactions between BM and spleen, we identified ligand-receptor pairs likely to be involved in fetal HSC migration and maintenance. Our work paves the way for research into the mechanisms underlying HSC colonization in human fetal BM and provides invaluable resources for future studies on HSC development."
https://openalex.org/W4308212068,"Abstract The value of genome-wide over targeted driver analyses for predicting clinical outcomes of cancer patients is debated. Here, we report the whole-genome sequencing of 485 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients enrolled in clinical trials as part of the United Kingdom’s 100,000 Genomes Project. We identify an extended catalog of recurrent coding and noncoding genetic mutations that represents a source for future studies and provide the most complete high-resolution map of structural variants, copy number changes and global genome features including telomere length, mutational signatures and genomic complexity. We demonstrate the relationship of these features with clinical outcome and show that integration of 186 distinct recurrent genomic alterations defines five genomic subgroups that associate with response to therapy, refining conventional outcome prediction. While requiring independent validation, our findings highlight the potential of whole-genome sequencing to inform future risk stratification in chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W4308193167,"Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) have increasingly gained interest as a potential therapy for nerve regeneration in medicine and dentistry, however their neurogenic potential remains a matter of debate. This study aimed to characterize hDPSC neuronal differentiation in comparison with the human SH-SY5Y neuronal stem cell differentiation model. Both hDPSCs and SH-SY5Y could be differentiated to generate typical neuronal-like cells following sequential treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as evidenced by significant expression of neuronal proteins βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) and neurofilament medium (NF-M). Both cell types also expressed multiple neural gene markers including growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), enolase 2/neuron-specific enolase (ENO2/NSE), synapsin I (SYN1), nestin (NES), and peripherin (PRPH), and exhibited measurable voltage-activated Na+ and K+ currents. In hDPSCs, upregulation of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), choline O-acetyltransferase (CHAT), sodium channel alpha subunit 9 (SCN9A), POU class 4 homeobox 1 (POU4F1/BRN3A) along with a downregulation of motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1) indicated that differentiation was more guided toward a cholinergic sensory neuronal lineage. Furthermore, the Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126 significantly impaired hDPSC neuronal differentiation and was associated with reduction of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that extracellular signal-regulated kinase/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) is necessary for sensory cholinergic neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs. hDPSC-derived cholinergic sensory neuronal-like cells represent a novel model and potential source for neuronal regeneration therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4308210326,"Abstract Genomic imprinting is regulated by parental-specific DNA methylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs). Despite an identical DNA sequence, ICRs can exist in two distinct epigenetic states that are memorized throughout unlimited cell divisions and reset during germline formation. Here, we systematically study the genetic and epigenetic determinants of this epigenetic bistability. By iterative integration of ICRs and related DNA sequences to an ectopic location in the mouse genome, we first identify the DNA sequence features required for maintenance of epigenetic states in embryonic stem cells. The autonomous regulatory properties of ICRs further enabled us to create DNA-methylation-sensitive reporters and to screen for key components involved in regulating their epigenetic memory. Besides DNMT1, UHRF1 and ZFP57, we identify factors that prevent switching from methylated to unmethylated states and show that two of these candidates, ATF7IP and ZMYM2, are important for the stability of DNA and H3K9 methylation at ICRs in embryonic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W4308294565,"Myosin heavy chain 7b (MYH7b) is an evolutionarily ancient member of the sarcomeric myosin family, which typically supports striated muscle function. However, in mammals, alternative splicing prevents MYH7b protein production in cardiac and most skeletal muscles and limits expression to a subset of specialized muscles and certain nonmuscle environments. In contrast, MYH7b protein is abundant in python cardiac and skeletal muscles. Although the MYH7b expression pattern diverges in mammals versus reptiles, MYH7b shares high sequence identity across species. So, it remains unclear how mammalian MYH7b function may differ from that of other sarcomeric myosins and whether human and python MYH7b motor functions diverge as their expression patterns suggest. Thus, we generated recombinant human and python MYH7b protein and measured their motor properties to investigate any species-specific differences in activity. Our results reveal that despite having similar working strokes, the MYH7b isoforms have slower actin-activated ATPase cycles and actin sliding velocities than human cardiac β-MyHC. Furthermore, python MYH7b is tuned to have slower motor activity than human MYH7b because of slower kinetics of the chemomechanical cycle. We found that the MYH7b isoforms adopt a higher proportion of myosin heads in the ultraslow, super-relaxed state compared with human cardiac β-MyHC. These findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations that predict MYH7b preferentially occupies myosin active site conformations similar to those observed in the structurally inactive state. Together, these results suggest that MYH7b is specialized for slow and energy-conserving motor activity and that differential tuning of MYH7b orthologs contributes to species-specific biological roles.

Members of the sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) family function as actin-based motors in striated muscle, where they convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical force necessary for contraction. Studies have focused almost exclusively on the eight conventional sarcomeric myosin-II genes principally expressed in the major skeletal muscles and the heart (MYH1, MYH2, MYH3, MYH4, MYH6, MYH7, MYH8, and MYH13). These sarcomeric myosin proteins consist of a globular motor domain with ATP and actin-binding sites, a neck domain bound by myosin light chains, and an ɑ-helical tail domain that drives assembly into the thick filament of the sarcomere. Despite high sequence conservation across this myosin protein family, the properties of the chemomechanical cycle differ greatly among isoforms allowing for specific tuning of muscle physiology (1Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2013; 288: 27469-27479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given the deep scrutiny of the sarcomeric myosin family because of its essential role in life-critical organs, it was surprising to discover additional members of this family, including MYH7b, after bioinformatic annotation of the human genome (4Desjardins P.R. Burkman J.M. Shrager J.B. Allmond L.A. Stedman H.H. Evolutionary implications of three novel members of the human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This oversight was the result of the atypical expression pattern of MYH7b in mammals. MYH7b transcripts are present in mammalian cardiac and major skeletal muscles, but a regulated alternative splicing event introduces a premature stop codon that prevents MYH7b protein production in these tissues (5Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic MicroRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.MCB. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, forced cardiac expression of MYH7b protein in a transgenic mouse model resulted in a severe dilated cardiomyopathy, underscoring the importance of evolutionary silencing of MYH7b protein production in the mammalian heart (6Peter A.K. Rossi A.C. Buvoli M. Ozeroff C.D. Crocini C. Perry A.R. et al.Expression of normally repressed myosin heavy chain 7b in the mammalian heart induces dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2019; 8e013318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, MYH7b protein is found in the sarcomeres of certain mammalian specialized muscles, such as extraocular muscles (EOMs), muscle spindles, and the upper esophagus (7Rossi A.C. Mammucari C. Argentini C. Reggiani C. Schiaffino S.

Surprisingly, MYH7b protein has also been detected at low abundance in nonmuscle tissues, and mutations in MYH7b are linked to hereditary hearing loss (5Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A.

Given this unique expression pattern, it remains unclear how MYH7b functions in certain mammalian specialized muscles and nonmuscle tissue, yet is not well tolerated in major muscles like the heart. Phylogenetic analysis of the sarcomeric myosin family classifies MYH7b as an ancient myosin that predates the emergence of the major cardiac and skeletal myosin isoforms (4Desjardins P.R. Burkman J.M. Shrager J.B. Allmond L.A. Stedman H.H. Evolutionary implications of three novel members of the human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunostaining has identified MYH7b protein in chicken heart and skeletal muscle (7Rossi A.C. Mammucari C. Argentini C. Reggiani C.

Expression of slow skeletal myosin heavy chain 2 gene in Purkinje fiber cells in chick heart.Biol. Cell. 2002; 94: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and in this study, we report MYH7b protein identification in python heart and skeletal muscles. Given the difference in expression pattern of MYH7b between reptiles/birds and mammals, it appears that the MYH7b gene has evolved to meet different physiological needs of these distinct vertebrate species. Based on this divergent expression pattern across species and the ancient evolutionary roots of MYH7b, we hypothesized that (1) human MYH7b motor properties diverge from other well-characterized human sarcomeric myosin family members and (2) human and python MYH7b motor functions are differentially tuned to accommodate species-specific roles. We examined these hypotheses using a comprehensive suite of biochemical and biophysical analyses to test MYH7b motor activity. Ultimately, our study of MYH7b defines the activity of a previously uncharacterized sarcomeric myosin motor and provides an evolutionary perspective of motor function within this highly conserved protein family. Most mammalian muscle tissues, including the heart and major skeletal muscles, do not produce MYH7b protein because of an alternative splicing event that shifts a premature stop codon into frame (5Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic MicroRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.MCB. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Lee L.A. Broadwell L.J. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Nonproductive splicing prevents expression of MYH7b protein in the mammalian heart.J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2021; 10e020965Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the MYH7b expression pattern observed in mammals is conserved in reptiles, an evolutionarily distinct class of vertebrates, by examining the cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin composition of two distinct species of python, Burmese python (Python bivittatus) and Ball python (Python regius). We detected MYH7b RNA and unique MYH7b peptides in the skeletal muscle of both python species and in the cardiac muscle of Ball pythons but not Burmese pythons (Figs. 1 and S1). Notably, pythons express a broad array of myosins in their muscles where MYH15 (the other recently identified ancient myosin gene) appears to be the predominant cardiac myosin isoform, and MYH1 is the most abundant skeletal myosin isoform (Fig. 1, A, B, Tables S1 and S2). We also assessed the myosin light chain composition in these tissues to understand which myosin light chains are present (Fig. S1, A–C). All python myosin light chain sequences share 69 to 99% sequence identity with their mouse myosin light chain orthologs. Using an RT–PCR assay that discriminates between the two MYH7b splice forms, we determined that the alternative splicing event first discovered in mammals (5Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic MicroRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.MCB. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) also prevents MYH7b protein production in Burmese python hearts (Fig. S1E). Ball python cardiac MYH7b RNA also undergoes exon skipping, but a proportion of unskipped RNA that can encode protein is readily detectable (Fig. S1E). Based on these results, it appears that, unlike the mammalian ortholog, MYH7b operates in a conventional role in python cardiac and skeletal muscle. Despite the divergent expression pattern observed in mammals versus reptiles, the MYH7b sequence is highly conserved across species (Fig. 1C). Therefore, it is unclear whether inherent molecular function diverges between human and python MYH7b or whether cell type–specific factors within the different tissues that express MYH7b externally tune MYH7b properties to promote species-specific roles. To directly compare human and python MYH7b motor properties, we produced recombinant myosin motor domains consisting of the myosin subfragment 1 (S1) region (Fig. S2) and performed a comprehensive analysis of their catalytic motor properties. Our studies use human β-MyHC (encoded by the MYH7 gene), the myosin isoform expressed in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, as a comparison because β-MyHC is the closest in sequence identity to human MYH7b and has been extensively characterized in vitro (2Deacon J.C. Bloemink M.J. Rezavandi H. Geeves M.A. Leinwand L.A. Identification of functional differences between recombinant human α and β cardiac myosin motors.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2261-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Sommese R.F. Sung J. Nag S. Sutton S. Deacon J.C. Choe E. et al.Molecular consequences of the R453C hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation on human -cardiac myosin motor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We used an NADH-coupled system to assess the steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity of our myosin constructs. We measured the ATPase rates of human β-MyHC, human MYH7b, and python MYH7b at increasing actin concentrations and fit the Michaelis–Menten kinetics equation to the data to calculate the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate (per myosin molecule, kcat) and apparent actin affinity (KM) for each myosin construct (Fig. 2A and Table S4). Human MYH7b has a maximal ATPase rate of 0.80 ± 0.08 s−1, strikingly lower by 49% compared with the canonical slow human β-MyHC isoform (1.57 ± 0.18 s−1, p < 0.0001). The maximal ATPase rate for python MYH7b (0.60 ± 0.08 s−1) was substantially lower than both β-MyHC (a 62% decrease, p < 0.0001) and human MYH7b (a 25% decrease, p = 0.0350). The maximum actin-activated ATPase rate is inversely proportional to the total cycle time (tcycle) through the chemomechanical cycle for one myosin (kcat = 1/tcycle) (14Spudich J.A. Hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy: four decades of basic research on muscle lead to potential therapeutic approaches to these devastating genetic diseases.Biophys. J. 2014; 106: 1236-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, when comparing tcycle between isoforms from the values measured, β-MyHC has the shortest cycle time (∼0.6 s) and human and python MYH7b have a longer tcycle comparatively (∼1.3 s and ∼1.7 s, respectively). Moreover, the KM of human MYH7b (35.9 ± 9.8 μM) is 62% lower than human β-MyHC (93.4 ± 56.5 μM, p = 0.0096), indicating that MYH7b binds more tightly to actin. The KM of python MYH7b (79.3 ± 16.1 μM) is not significantly different than that of human β-MyHC indicating that altered actin affinity cannot account for the decreased kcat for python MYH7b. Finally, we assessed overall enzymatic efficiency of actin-activated ATPase for each construct determined by kcat/KM. We observed similar measures for human β-MyHC (0.025 ± 0.015 s−1 μM−1) and human MYH7b (0.023 ± 0.006 s−1 μM−1), whereas comparatively python MYH7b is a less efficient motor (0.008 ± 0.003 s−1 μM−1). In order to understand the mechanical properties of MYH7b, we used an unloaded in vitro motility assay to determine the actin sliding velocities of human and python MYH7b compared with human β-MyHC (Fig. 2B, Table S5, and Movies S1–S3). For these experiments, we used PDZ-based chemistry to immobilize our C-terminally tagged S1 constructs to a coverslip and monitored the velocity at which each myosin moved fluorescently labeled actin. Experiments measuring the actin sliding velocity as a function of myosin concentration were conducted to ensure surface saturation (Fig. S3). Human MYH7b and python MYH7b actin sliding velocities (0.597 ± 0.057 μm/s and 0.536 ± 0.076 μm/s, respectively) were lower compared with human β-MyHC (1.017 ± 0.050 μm/s, p < 0.0001 for both). There was no discernable difference between human and python MYH7b actin sliding velocities. We next performed stopped-flow experiments to better understand the kinetics of key steps of the chemomechanical cycle that may underly the differences in actin-activated ATPase activity observed between human MYH7b and python MYH7b. The dissociation of human and python MYH7b from pyrene-labeled actin was best described by a single exponential, which provides an observed rate constant (kobs). The rates of ATP-induced dissociation of myosin from actin are plotted against ATP concentration in Figure 3A (stopped-flow data are summarized in Table S6). A linear dependence at low ATP concentrations provides the second-order rate constant for ATP binding (K1k+2, Fig. S4. The ATP-binding rate for human MYH7b was faster (6.7 ± 1.4 μM−1 s−1) than the rate previously measured for human β-MyHC S1 (∼4.4 μM−1 s−1) (15Nag S. Sommese R.F. Ujfalusi Z. Combs A. Langer S. Sutton S. et al.Contractility parameters of human β-cardiac myosin with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation R403Q show loss of motor function.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1e1500511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas python MYH7b had a slower rate than both (1.2 ± 0.0 μM−1 s−1). Over the full range of ATP concentrations, the data are described by a hyperbolic fit (Equation 1), which results in the maximum dissociation rate (k+2) and the ATP-binding affinity in the initial step (1/K1). Both human MYH7b (79.8 ± 17.7 μM) and python MYH7b (157.3 ± 11.5 μM) had a much tighter affinity for ATP (smaller 1/K1) compared with values for human β-MyHC (∼365.7 μM) (15Nag S. Sommese R.F. Ujfalusi Z. Combs A. Langer S. Sutton S. et al.Contractility parameters of human β-cardiac myosin with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation R403Q show loss of motor function.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1e1500511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, human MYH7b ATP affinity was twofold tighter than that of python MYH7b (p = 0.0352). Similarly, human MYH7b (520.7 ± 7.0 s−1) and python MYH7b (181.2 ± 6.9 s−1) have a slower maximum actin dissociation rate compared with human β-MyHC (∼991 s−1). It is worth noting that the dissociation rate for python MYH7b is over 2.5-fold slower than human MYH7b (p = 0.0004). We next determined the ADP affinity for each myosin S1 construct using a competition assay where increasing concentrations of ADP were rapidly mixed alongside a fixed ATP concentration with S1, resulting in a competition between the ATP and ADP for the nucleotide-binding site of myosin (Fig. 3B). As the concentration of ADP increases, the kobs decreases as more ADP is available to bind myosin. Plotting the kobs against the ADP concentration can be described by a hyperbolic fit (Equation 2), which provides a measure of the ADP affinity (KADP). Human MYH7b had a weaker ADP affinity (120.7 ± 29.5 μM) compared with both python MYH7b (17.0 ± 3.2 μM, p = 0.0386) and human β-MyHC (∼6.1 μM) (15Nag S. Sommese R.F. Ujfalusi Z. Combs A. Langer S. Sutton S. et al.Contractility parameters of human β-cardiac myosin with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation R403Q show loss of motor function.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1e1500511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that human and python MYH7b have appreciably slower kinetics than human β-MyHC. We next sought to determine the changes in motor function that contribute to the slower actin sliding velocities of the MYH7b constructs compared with β-MyHC. The speed in the motility assay at saturating myosin concentrations is set by the displacement of the myosin working stroke (d) and the amount of time that myosin spends attached to actin at saturating ATP (ton). We used a single-molecule optical trapping assay (Fig. 4A) based on the three-bead geometry (16Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Single myosin molecule mechanics: piconewton forces and nanometre steps.Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar) to define the size of the working stroke for human and python MYH7b (17Blackwell T.

Within the flow cell, an actin filament is suspended between two optically trapped beads and brought close to a surface bead to probe for interactions with myosin S1. Actomyosin-binding interactions are associated with decreased variance of trapped bead positions and a shift in the mean bead positions, the magnitude of which reports on the step size of myosin S1 undergoing its working stroke (Fig. 4B). The distribution of attachment durations can be used to calculate the rate of dissociation of myosin from actin. These experiments are conducted at low ATP concentrations to facilitate the observation of binding interactions. We measured the detachment kinetics of human and python MYH7b S1 at subsaturating ATP concentrations (1 μM ATP). Under these conditions, the rate of actomyosin dissociation is limited by the rate of ATP binding, not ADP release as seen in the motility assays. We found that the detachment rate for python MYH7b (3.7 [+0.3/−0.2] s−1) was slower than the detachment rate for human MYH7b (9.9 [+0.7/−0.6] s−1; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, B and C). This demonstrates that the rate of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation is slower for python relative to human MYH7b, consistent with the second-order rates of ATP-induced dissociation at low ATP measured in the stopped-flow (K1k+2). Interestingly, the detachment rate for python MYH7b, which is expressed in python hearts, is similar to that previously observed for human β-MyHC myosin (∼3 s−1) (19Woody M.S. Greenberg M.J. Barua B.

We also measured the size of the myosin working stroke. We observed similar total step sizes for human MYH7b (5.3 ± 0.4 nm) and python MYH7b (4.8 ± 0.2 nm; p = 0.27) (Fig. 4D). These step sizes are consistent with those previously observed for human and porcine β-cardiac myosin (∼5–7 nm) (2Deacon J.C. Bloemink M.J. Rezavandi H. Geeves M.A. Leinwand L.A.

Ensemble averaging involves postsynchronization of binding events and averaging forward in time from actomyosin attachment (time-forward average) or backward in time from actomyosin detachment (time-reversed average). If the working stroke consists of multiple substeps, there will be a difference in displacement between the time-forward and time-reversed averages equal to the size of the second displacement. Our data clearly demonstrate a two-substep working stroke for both human and python MYH7b (Fig. 4E), demonstrating that the mechanics of the MYH7b working stroke are similar to β-MyHC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the reduced velocity in the motility assay is because of changes in the myosin kinetics and not mechanics. Muscle function and energy usage by myosin can be modulated by shifting the equilibrium of myosin into different functional states. Myosin ATPase activity is fastest when actomyosin crossbridge cycling occurs, but ATP turnover decreases when myosin is unavailable to bind actin. Non–actin-bound myosin can adopt two distinct functional states: the disordered-relaxed state (DRX; 100-fold slower than actin-activated rates) or the super-relaxed state (SRX; ultralow ATPase, 1000-fold slower than actin-activated rates) (28Anderson R.L.

https://openalex.org/W4308192738,"COVID-19 highlighted the importance of meaningful engagement between communities and health authorities. This is particularly challenging in conflict-affected countries such as Syria, where social protection and food security needs can hinder adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccine uptake. This study explored community perspectives of COVID-19 and health authority responses across the three main areas of control in Syria, i.e. Syrian government-controlled areas (GCA), autonomous administration-controlled areas (AACA), and opposition-controlled areas (OCA).We conducted a qualitative study, interviewing 22 purposively-sampled Syrians accessing health services in AACA, GCA, or OCA in 2021 to provide approximately equal representation by governance area and gender. We analysed data thematically using deductive and inductive coding.Interviewees in all areas described how their fears of COVID-19 and willingness to adhere to NPIs decreased as their local COVID-19 epidemics progressed and NPIs disrupted access to household essentials such as work and food. Community-level responses were minimal and ad hoc, so most people focused on personal or household protective efforts and many mentioned relying on their faith for comfort. Misinformation and vaccine hesitancy were common in all areas, linked to lack of transparency from and mistrust of local health authorities and information sources.The COVID-19 pandemic has increased health actors' need to engage with communities to control disease spread, yet most NPIs implemented in Syria were inappropriate and adherence decreased as the pandemic progressed. This was exemplified by lockdowns and requirements to self-isolate, despite precarious reliance on daily wages, no subsidies for lost income, individual self-reliance, and mistrust/weak communication between communities and health authorities. We found minimal community engagement efforts, consisting entirely of informing with no efforts to consult, involve, collaborate, or empower. This contributed to failures of health actors to contextualise interventions in ways that respected community understandings and needs."
https://openalex.org/W4308197334,"The primary cilium is a central signaling component during embryonic development. Here we focus on CROCCP2, a hominid-specific gene duplicate from ciliary rootlet coiled coil (CROCC), also known as rootletin, that encodes the major component of the ciliary rootlet. We find that CROCCP2 is highly expressed in the human fetal brain and not in other primate species. CROCCP2 gain of function in the mouse embryonic cortex and human cortical cells and organoids results in decreased ciliogenesis and increased cortical progenitor amplification, particularly basal progenitors. CROCCP2 decreases ciliary dynamics by inhibition of the IFT20 ciliary trafficking protein, which then impacts neurogenesis through increased mTOR signaling. Loss of function of CROCCP2 in human cortical cells and organoids leads to increased ciliogenesis, decreased mTOR signaling, and impaired basal progenitor amplification. These data identify CROCCP2 as a human-specific modifier of cortical neurogenesis that acts through modulation of ciliary dynamics and mTOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4308296710,"Gene expression is tightly regulated, with many genes exhibiting cell-specific silencing when their protein product would disrupt normal cellular function1. This silencing is largely controlled by non-coding elements, and their disruption might cause human disease2. We performed gene-agnostic screening of the non-coding regions to discover new molecular causes of congenital hyperinsulinism. This identified 14 non-coding de novo variants affecting a 42-bp conserved region encompassed by a regulatory element in intron 2 of the hexokinase 1 gene (HK1). HK1 is widely expressed across all tissues except in the liver and pancreatic beta cells and is thus termed a 'disallowed gene' in these specific tissues. We demonstrated that the variants result in a loss of repression of HK1 in pancreatic beta cells, thereby causing insulin secretion and congenital hyperinsulinism. Using epigenomic data accessed from public repositories, we demonstrated that these variants reside within a regulatory region that we determine to be critical for cell-specific silencing. Importantly, this has revealed a disease mechanism for non-coding variants that cause inappropriate expression of a disallowed gene."

In this study, we introduce a physiologically accurate in-vitro hydraulic setup that models the hemodynamics of the coupled atrioventricular-aortic system. This unique experimental simulator has three major components: 1) an arterial system consisting of a human-scale artificial aorta along with the main branches, 2) an artificial left ventricle (LV) sac connected to a programmable piston-in-cylinder pump for simulating cardiac contraction and relaxation, and 3) an artificial left atrium (LA). The setup is designed in such a way that the basal LV is directly connected to the aortic root via an aortic valve, and to the LA via an artificial mitral valve. As a result, two-way hemodynamic couplings can be achieved for studying the effects that the LV, aorta, and LA have on each other. The collected pressure and flow measurements from this setup demonstrate a remarkable correspondence to clinical hemodynamics. We also investigate the physiological relevancies of isolated effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics of various major global parameters found in the circulatory system, including LV contractility, LV preload, heart rate, aortic compliance, and peripheral resistance. Subsequent control over such parameters ultimately captures physiological hemodynamic effects of LV systolic dysfunction, preload (cardiac) diseases, and afterload (arterial) diseases. The detailed design and fabrication of the proposed setup is also provided."

https://openalex.org/W4308150335,"I-motifs are four-strand noncanonical secondary structures formed by cytosine (C)-rich sequences in living cells. The structural dynamics of i-motifs play essential roles in many cellular processes, such as telomerase inhibition, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation. In cells, the structural dynamics of the i-motif can be modulated by the interaction of poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs), and the interaction is closely related to human health, through modulating the transcription of oncogenes and telomere stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of how PCBPs interact with i-motif structures are fundamentally important. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. I-motif structures in the promoter of the c-MYC oncogene can be unfolded by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a PCBP, to activate its transcription. Here, we selected this system as an example to comprehensively study the unfolding mechanisms. We found that the promoter sequence containing 5 C-runs preferred folding into type-1245 to type-1234 i-motif structures based on their folding stability, which was further confirmed by single-molecule FRET. In addition, we first revealed that the c-MYC i-motif structure was discretely resolved by hnRNP K through two intermediate states, which were assigned to the opposite hairpin and neighboring hairpin, as further confirmed by site mutations. Furthermore, we found all three KH (hnRNP K homology) domains of hnRNP K could unfold the c-MYC i-motif structure, and KH2 and KH3 were more active than KH1. In conclusion, this study may deepen our understanding of the interactions between i-motifs and PCBPs and may be helpful for drug development."

There is limited data from Africa on their usefulness in patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs). We performed an evaluation of baseline haematological parameters as prognostic biomarkers in ICU COVID-19 patients. Methods Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively on patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to the adult ICU in a tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, between March 2020 and February 2021. Robust Poisson regression methods and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to explore the association of haematological parameters with COVID-19 severity and mortality. Results A total of 490 patients (median age 54.1 years) were included, of whom 237 (48%) were female. The median duration of ICU stay was 6 days and 309/490 (63%) patients died. Raised neutrophil count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were associated with worse outcome. Independent risk factors associated with mortality were age (ARR 1.01, 95%CI 1.0–1.02; p = 0.002); female sex (ARR 1.23, 95%CI 1.05–1.42; p = 0.008) and D-dimer levels (ARR 1.01, 95%CI 1.002–1.03; p = 0.016). Conclusions Our study showed that raised neutrophil count, NLR and D-dimer at the time of ICU admission were associated with higher mortality. Contrary to what has previously been reported, our study revealed females admitted to the ICU had a higher risk of mortality."

To address this need, we performed long-read transcriptomic sequencing. 5′ capped mRNA was enriched from samples of total and nuclear-fractionated RNA from intra-erythrocytic stages and converted to cDNA library. The cDNA libraries were sequenced on PacBio and Nanopore long-read platforms. 12,495 novel isoforms were annotated from the data. Alternative 5′ and 3′ ends represent the majority of isoform events among the novel isoforms, with retained introns being the next most common event. The majority of alternative 5′ ends correspond to genomic regions with features similar to those of the reference transcript 5′ ends. However, a minority of alternative 5′ ends showed markedly different features, including locations within protein-coding regions. Alternative 3′ ends showed similar features to the reference transcript 3′ ends, notably adenine-rich termination signals. Distinguishing features of retained introns could not be observed, except for a tendency towards shorter length and greater GC content compared with spliced introns. Expression of antisense and retained intron isoforms was detected at different intra-erythrocytic stages, suggesting developmental regulation of these isoform events. To gain insights into the possible functions of the novel isoforms, their protein-coding potential was assessed. Variants of P . falciparum proteins and novel proteins encoded by alternative open reading frames suggest that P . falciparum has a greater proteomic repertoire than the current annotation. We provide a catalog of annotated transcripts and encoded alternative proteins to support further studies on gene and protein regulation of this pathogen."

Based on the panel data of the textile and apparel industry from 2010 to 2019, this paper measures green total factor productivity (GTFP) by using the unexpected output super efficiency SBM model and the ML index. On this basis, this paper empirically tests the impact of digital economy on the GTFP of textile and apparel industry, and the dual intermediary effects of rationalization of industrial structure and advanced industrial structure are discussed. The results show that: (1) The GTFP of the textile and apparel industry shows a fluctuating upward trend, but it is in a state of low growth. (2) Digital economy has a significant effect on promoting the GTFP. Among them, it has a positive effect on the improvement of GTFP in textile industry, but has no obvious effect on the clothing industry, and has a restraining effect on the chemical fiber manufacturing industry. (3) In the process of the impact of digital economy on GTFP, the rationalization of industrial structure has a partial intermediary effect, and the level of effect reaches 35.81%, while the advancement of industrial structure does not necessarily have a ""structural dividend"", and its influence on GTFP is non-linear. This paper enriches the research on the influencing factors of GTFP, and is also an effective supplement to the research on digital economy. The conclusions provide a reliable empirical basis for digital economy to help the textile and apparel industry pollution control, and also provide policy references for giving full play to the green value of digital economy."
https://openalex.org/W4308194266,"GPR40, a G protein-coupled receptor for free fatty acids (FFAs), is considered as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) since GPR40 activation in pancreatic beta cells enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of T2DM or metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the role of GPR40 in NAFLD associated with T2DM or MetS has not been well established. Given that it is known that cholesterol and FFAs are critically involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and LDL receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice are a good animal model for human hyperlipidemia including high cholesterol and FFAs, we generated GPR40 and LDLR double knockout (KO) mice in this study to determine the effect of GPR40 KO on hyperlipidemia-promoted NASH. We showed that GPR40 KO increased plasma levels of cholesterol and FFAs in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed LDLR-deficient mice. We also showed that GPR40 KO exacerbated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Further study demonstrated that GPR40 KO led to upregulation of hepatic CD36 and genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, fibrosis and inflammation. Finally, our in vitro mechanistic studies showed that while CD36 was involved in upregulation of proinflammatory molecules in macrophages by palmitic acid (PA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), GPR40 activation in macrophages exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the first time that loss of GPR40 in LDLR-deficient mice exacerbated HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis potentially through a CD36-dependent mechanism, suggesting that GPR40 may play a beneficial role in hyperlipidemia-associated NASH in LDLR-deficient mice."

ACK1 tyrosine kinase: targeted inhibition to block cancer cell proliferation.Cancer Lett. 2013; 338: 185-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The normal physiological functions of Tnk1, and its potential involvement in disease, are not well understood. Genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer’s disease have suggested a linkage with Tnk1 (9Bertram L. Tanzi R.E. Genome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: R137-R145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism involves the ability of Tnk1 to induce TNFα-dependent apoptosis by preventing activation of NF-κB (2Azoitei N. Brey A. Busch T. Fulda S. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1) facilitates TNFalpha-induced apoptosis by blocking NF-kappaB activation.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as TNFα is known to be important in driving the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (10Chang R. Yee K.L. Sumbria R.K. Tumor necrosis factor alpha Inhibition for Alzheimer's Disease.J. Cent. Nerv. Syst. Dis. 2017; 9https://doi.org/10.1177/1179573517709278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cancer, Tnk1 may act as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene, depending on cell context. Overexpression of Kos1 (the murine homolog of Tnk1) in Ras (G12V)-driven lung cancer cells inhibited cell growth (11Hoare K. Hoare S. Smith O.M. Kalmaz G. Small D. Stratford May W. Kos1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that suppresses Ras signaling.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3562-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Knockout of Kos1 resulted in the spontaneous formation of lymphomas and carcinomas (12Hoare S. Hoare K. Reinhard M.K. Lee Y.J. Oh S.P. May W.S. Tnk1/Kos1 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for this tumor suppressive function involves downregulation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway by Tnk1 phosphorylation of Grb2 (13May W.S. Hoare K. Hoare S. Reinhard M.K. Lee Y.J. Oh S.P. Tnk1/Kos1: a novel tumor suppressor.Trans. Am. Clin. Climatol. Assoc. 2010; 121 (discussion 292-3): 281-292PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, RNAi kinome screens have demonstrated that Tnk1 plays a role in the viability of the immortalized pancreatic cell lines BxPC3 and MiaPaCa-2 (14Henderson M.C. Gonzales I.M. Arora S. Choudhary A. Trent J.M. Von Hoff D.D. et al.High-throughput RNAi screening identifies a role for TNK1 in growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells.Mol. Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in ex vivo cultures of samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7Chan T.Y. Egbert C.M. Maxson J.E. Siddiqui A. Larsen L.J. Kohler K. et al.TNK1 is a ubiquitin-binding and 14-3-3-regulated kinase that can be targeted to block tumor growth.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A correlation was also observed between high Tnk1 expression and decreased survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. A unique form of Tnk1 was discovered in the Hodgkin’s Lymphoma cell line L540: the 5′ portion of the Tnk1 gene (encoding the kinase domain) was fused to sequences from the C17ORF61 (chromosome 17 open reading frame 61) gene. This variant of Tnk1 (Tnk1Fusion) promoted cellular growth and phosphorylation of proliferative substrates (15Gu T.L. Cherry J. Tucker M. Wu J. Reeves C. Polakiewicz R.D. Identification of activated Tnk1 kinase in Hodgkin's lymphoma.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To facilitate studies of Tnk1 activity and regulation, we report here the expression and purification of the enzyme from Sf9 insect cells. We developed an in vitro assay based on phosphorylation of a peptide derived from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). Using this assay, we compared the activities of WT Tnk1, N- and C-terminal deletion constructs, and Tnk1Fusion. These results suggest functional roles for the noncatalytic N- and C-termini of Tnk1 and point to a potential mechanism for the pro-proliferative phenotype elicited by the Tnk1Fusion mutant in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma cells. There is no reported biochemical characterization of purified Tnk1 in the literature. Initial attempts at expression in Escherichia coli were unsuccessful, either in the presence or absence of GroEL/GroES chaperones and YopH phosphatase (16Seeliger M.A. Young M. Henderson M.N. Pellicena P. King D.S. Falick A.M. et al.High yield bacterial expression of active c-Abl and c-Src tyrosine kinases.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), due to the accumulation of Tnk1 in the insoluble pellet after centrifugation of cell lysates. To produce Tnk1, we generated a recombinant baculovirus encoding a C-terminally truncated construct (Tnk1ΔCT: 1–510aa) with the SAM, kinase, and SH3 domains intact. We engineered this 87 kDa construct to contain an N-terminal 6x-His tag for affinity chromatography followed by a GST tag to improve the solubility of the protein (Fig. 2A). We expressed and purified Tnk1ΔCT in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using Ni-NTA chromatography and confirmed the identity of the protein by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). We used this GST-tagged protein for subsequent activity measurements, because we found that cleavage of the GST tag resulted in protein that was not monodisperse when analyzed by-size exclusion chromatography. We first established an in vitro assay for purified Tnk1 using [32P-ATP] and the phosphocellulose paper-binding assay (17Casnellie J.E. Assay of protein kinases using peptides with basic residues for phosphocellulose binding.Met. Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and studied the peptide substrate specificity of the enzyme. We screened synthetic peptides containing the substrate recognition sequences of several representative tyrosine kinases (Abl, IR/IGF1R, Src, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) (18Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. Biochemical properties of the Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase ACK1. Substrate specificity, authphosphorylation, and interaction with Hck.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. et al.Catalytic specificity of protein-tyrosine kinases is critical for selective signalling.Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We included a substrate for PKA, as Ack1 possesses detectable Ser/Thr kinase activity (20Yokoyama N. Lougheed J. Miller W.T. Phosphorylation of WASP by the Cdc42-associated kinase ACK1: dual hydroxyamino acid specificity in a tyrosine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42219-42226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also included a synthetic peptide modeled on the Src/Ack1 phosphorylation site (Y256) of WASP; we previously showed that this peptide is phosphorylated by Ack1 with more favorable kinetics than any other reported substrate (21Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. Purification and enzyme activity of ACK1.Met. Enzymol. 2006; 406: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Finally, we tested a peptide (Pro-G6) that combines a phosphorylation site with an SH3-binding sequence. This peptide shows enhanced phosphorylation by NRTKs (e.g., Src) whose SH3 domains act as substrate targeting motifs (22Scott M.P. Miller W.T. A peptide model system for processive phosphorylation by Src family kinases.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14531-14537Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tnk1 activity was highest against the WASP peptide (Fig. 2C). The Abl peptide also exhibited a significant level of phosphorylation, suggesting potential overlap of the substrate specificity between Tnk1 and Abl. This may be due to common specificity-determining residues in the catalytic domains of the two enzymes (Fig. S1). Phosphorylation of the other peptides was low or undetectable (Fig. 2C). Next, we carried out steady-state kinetic experiments with the WASP peptide (Fig. S2). These experiments gave a Km (ATP) value of 70 μM and a Km (peptide) value of 214 μM (Fig. S2), indicating that the WASP peptide is a good substrate for measuring in vitro Tnk1 activity. We employed the in vitro assay with WASP peptide to test the effectiveness of a series of FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors against Tnk1. We tested the EGFR family kinase inhibitors lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib, as well as the Src/Abl family inhibitor dasatinib. We included compound (R)-9b, an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of Ack1 that is highly effective in vitro and in vivo (23Lawrence H.R. Mahajan K. Luo Y. Zhang D. Tindall N. Huseyin M. et al.Development of novel ACK1/TNK2 inhibitors using a fragment-based approach.J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58: 2746-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At a single concentration of 10 μM, erlotinib and gefitinib gave 30 to 40% inhibition; the other FDA-approved inhibitors were somewhat less effective (Fig. 2D). (R)-9b completely inhibited Tnk1 (Fig. 2D). Dose-response experiments showed that under our assay conditions, the IC50 of (R)-9b was 470 nM (Fig. 2E). These results from our inhibitor experiments suggest that the experimental Ack1 inhibitor (R)-9b would also be useful as a tool for probing Tnk1 function. The N-terminal SAM domain of Ack1 has been shown to facilitate the self-association and activation of the enzyme (24Prieto-Echagüe V. Gucwa A. Brown D.A. Miller W.T. Regulation of Ack1 localization and activity by the amino-terminal SAM domain.BMC Biochem. 2010; 11: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SAM domain of Tnk1 plays a similar role, we generated plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged and SBP-tagged Tnk1 (WT and SAM-deleted) for expression in mammalian cells. The proteins were all expressed in HEK293T cells (Figs. 3A, top and S3). We analyzed Tnk1 self-association by anti-FLAG co-immunoprecipitation. When expressed alone, neither SBP-tagged Tnk1WT nor SBP-tagged Tnk1ΔSAM was immunoprecipitated with FLAG (Fig. S3). SBP-tagged Tnk1WT coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Tnk1 (Fig. 3A, bottom). Deletion of the SAM domain led to a significant reduction in the amount of SBP-tagged Tnk1ΔSAM that coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Tnk1ΔSAM (Fig. 3A, bottom). To determine whether the SAM domain is important for Tnk1 activity, we analyzed the levels of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in lysates of transfected HEK 293T cells and found a significant decrease in Tnk1 activity (Fig. 3B). We found a similar reduction in the levels of phosphorylation of Tyr277, which corresponds to the predicted major site of autophosphorylation within the activation loop of Tnk1 (Fig. 3C). To compare activities directly, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged Tnk1 (WT and Tnk1ΔSAM) and measured in vitro activities using [32P]-ATP and the WASP peptide. These experiments showed that removal of the SAM domain caused a large reduction in Tnk1 activity (Fig. 3D). Next, we generated a recombinant baculovirus encoding the C-terminally truncated construct (Tnk1ΔCT; Fig. 2A) but lacking the SAM domain and the linker between SAM and kinase domains (Tnk1ΔSAMΔCT). We expressed and purified this protein in Sf9 insect cells. Activity measurements at saturating concentrations of ATP and peptide showed a ∼2-fold decrease in the rate for the Tnk1 construct lacking the SAM domain (Fig. 3E). Together, these results suggest that the SAM domain is important for the cellular self-association and activation of Tnk1, in a similar manner as was previously observed for Ack1. A Tnk1 variant with a truncated C-terminus fused to a 39-residue segment from C17ORF61 (Tnk1Fusion) showed increased activity (relative to WT Tnk1) in a Hodgkin’s Lymphoma cell line (15Gu T.L. Cherry J. Tucker M. Wu J. Reeves C. Polakiewicz R.D. Identification of activated Tnk1 kinase in Hodgkin's lymphoma.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As suggested by Gu et al., truncation of the C-terminus of Tnk1 in Tnk1Fusion might remove an autoinhibitory element, activating the kinase. Additionally or alternatively, the fusion sequence itself might impart higher activity to Tnk1. Based on recent studies by Chan et al. (7Chan T.Y. Egbert C.M. Maxson J.E. Siddiqui A. Larsen L.J. Kohler K. et al.TNK1 is a ubiquitin-binding and 14-3-3-regulated kinase that can be targeted to block tumor growth.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we also considered the possibility that alterations in the Tnk1 C-terminus could affect substrate phosphorylation indirectly, through changes in subcellular localization. To test these possibilities, we produced mammalian cell expression constructs for WT Tnk1 and a series of C-terminal variants (Fig. 4A). Tnk1Fusion is identical to the activated protein found in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma cells. Tnk1465 corresponds to Tnk1Fusion protein minus the 39-residue fusion sequence, allowing us to test the effect of the C17ORF61 segment on activity. The Tnk1ΔCT construct consists of residues 1 to 510 and corresponds to the protein we purified from insect cells for biochemical studies. When transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, these FLAG-tagged Tnk1 proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4B). We analyzed global phospho-tyrosine levels in HEK293T cell lysates by Western blotting with anti-pTyr antibody. Although Tnk1WT and Tnk1ΔCT showed comparable levels of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of proteins in cells transfected with Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that truncation of Tnk1 to amino acid 465, but not to 510, results in a hyperactivated kinase. The activities of Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion were similar in this assay, arguing against a positive role for the 39-residue fusion segment. All of these C-terminal deletions had higher activity than Tnk1ΔSAM (Fig. S4). Next, we examined phosphorylation of the Tnk1 downstream signaling partners STAT3 and AKT (15Gu T.L. Cherry J. Tucker M. Wu J. Reeves C. Polakiewicz R.D. Identification of activated Tnk1 kinase in Hodgkin's lymphoma.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using cell lysates of transfected HEK293T cells, we carried out Western blotting with the activation state-specific antibodies STAT3 (pY705) and AKT (S473) (25Gao Y. Moten A. Lin H.K. Akt: a new activation mechanism.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26El-Tanani M. Al Khatib A.O. Aladwan S.M. Abuelhana A. McCarron P.A. Tambuwala M.M. Importance of STAT3 signalling in cancer, metastasis and therapeutic interventions.Cell Signal. 2022; 92: 110275Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Expression of Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion modestly increased the phosphorylation of pSTAT3 but not pAKT (Fig. 4C). It is not currently known whether STAT3 and AKT serve as direct substrates for Tnk1 or alternatively if other Tnk1 substrates lead to phosphorylation of STAT3 and AKT. In any case, these results raised the possibility that deletion of the Tnk1 C-terminus increases the phosphorylation of some, but not all, cellular proteins. To compare the activities of the Tnk1 constructs, we first probed for the autophosphorylation site at pY277 in the predicted activation loop of the Tnk1 catalytic domain. Phosphorylation at this site and at Y287 is required for activity (13May W.S. Hoare K. Hoare S. Reinhard M.K. Lee Y.J. Oh S.P. Tnk1/Kos1: a novel tumor suppressor.Trans. Am. Clin. Climatol. Assoc. 2010; 121 (discussion 292-3): 281-292PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation reactions and measured Y277 phosphorylation with a phosphospecific antibody. Unexpectedly, the two shorter constructs (Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion) showed lower levels of Y277 phosphorylation than WT Tnk1 (Fig. 4D), in contrast to their apparent higher activity in Figure 4B. A caveat is that phosphorylation at Y277 is an indirect measure of Tnk1 activity; Y277 might be autophosphorylated or serve as a phosphorylation site for another HEK293T kinase. Furthermore, we do not know the phosphorylation status of Y287 in these constructs. To assess Tnk1 activity directly, we immunoprecipitated the constructs and carried out in vitro activity assays using [32P-ATP] and the synthetic WASP peptide. There was no change in activity between Tnk1WT, Tnk1ΔCT, and Tnk1465, while Tnk1Fusion exhibited reduced activity (Fig. 4E). We confirmed the lower activity of the fusion protein using a different peptide substrate (Fig. S5). While the reason for the low in vitro kinase activity of Tnk1Fusion is currently unclear (see Discussion), the results for Tnk1465 suggest that the increased levels of cellular pTyr (Fig. 4B) do not arise from the deletion of an autoinhibitory region. Instead, we hypothesized that the increased cellular pTyr levels for Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion were due to changes in binding and/or phosphorylation of particular cellular substrates. A potential mechanism for a change in substrate specificity could be an alteration in the subcellular localization of the truncated Tnk1 proteins. To investigate this possibility, we generated GFP-tagged constructs encoding Tnk1WT, Tnk1ΔCT, Tnk1465, and Tnk1Fusion and carried out fluorescence microscopy studies. In our initial experiments with HEK293T cells, we found that the transfected cells were not sufficiently adherent to permit quantitation. Consequently, we carried out these experiments in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). We confirmed that expression of the GFP-tagged constructs in HeLa cells gave similar results to those obtained in HEK293T cells by anti-pTyr Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. S6). To quantify the microscopy results, we analyzed the ratio of nuclear GFP signal to the total GFP signal in both the cytosol and nucleus. We found an approximate two-fold increase in nuclear GFP for Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion as compared to Tnk1WT and Tnk1ΔCT (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Tnk1Fusion formed puncta that were uniformly dispersed throughout the whole cell. To corroborate the microscopy results, we performed cellular fractionation of transfected HeLa cells and probed for anti-GFP in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 5C). Levels of Tnk1WT and Tnk1ΔCT were higher in the cytoplasmic fraction than the nuclear fraction. Tnk1465 had a roughly equal distribution, while Tnk1Fusion showed an increased proportion of nuclear signal relative to cytosolic signal. Our interpretation of these results is that truncation of the C-terminus of Tnk1 causes a mislocalization of the enzyme, leading to increased phosphorylation of cellular proteins without a direct effect on the enzyme’s intrinsic kinase activity. In this paper, we have established a method of expressing and purifying active Tnk1, and we identified an efficient peptide substrate based on the WASP protein. This assay system should facilitate further studies into the activity of Tnk1 and aid in the search for proteins and small molecules that regulate activity. We used this assay system to measure the activities of truncated forms of Tnk1 expressed in mammalian cells. Although expression of Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion gave an increase in cellular pTyr (relative to WT Tnk1), there was no increase in intrinsic kinase activity, arguing against the presence of an autoinhibitory motif. Instead, our results suggest that the C-terminus of Tnk1 contains a sequence for cytosolic localization and that the altered activity of Tnk1465 and Tnk1Fusion is due to their entry into the nucleus. Our findings with Tnk1Fusion indicate that the 39-residue fusion sequence does not make a direct contribution to activity. It is also conceivable that the fusion sequence promotes Tnk1 aggregation, since in vitro activity was very low (Fig. 4E) and this protein showed a tendency to form puncta in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Our results are consistent with a recent study showing that phosphorylation of S502 in the C-terminus of Tnk1 leads to 14-3-3 binding and cytosolic localization (7Chan T.Y. Egbert C.M. Maxson J.E. Siddiqui A. Larsen L.J. Kohler K. et al.TNK1 is a ubiquitin-binding and 14-3-3-regulated kinase that can be targeted to block tumor growth.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the nuclear entry of Tnk1Fusion is due to the presence of a nuclear localization signal in the protein sequence or the association with a nuclear entry chaperone. The functional importance of the other domains of Tnk1 are not completely understood. The presence of an N-terminal SAM domain is a unique feature of the Ack family of NRTKs. SAM domains are small helical modules that mediate homo- and hetero-oligomerization (27Kim C.A. Bowie J.U. SAM domains: uniform structure, diversity of function.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 625-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The SAM domain of Ack1 is required for its self-association and promotes kinase activation by autophosphorylation (24Prieto-Echagüe V. Gucwa A. Brown D.A. Miller W.T. Regulation of Ack1 localization and activity by the amino-terminal SAM domain.BMC Biochem. 2010; 11: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tnk1 contains a predicted SAM domain (Fig. 1). Our results suggest that like Ack1, the N-terminal SAM domain of Tnk1 is important for self-association and for activity in cells and in vitro (Fig. 3). We hypothesize that Tnk1 requires intermolecular autophosphorylation at Y277 for full activity and that the reduced activity of Tnk1ΔSAM (Fig. 3) stems from a reduction in the efficiency of this process. In contrast to Ack1, Tnk1 lacks a CRIB domain and is presumably not subject to the Cdc42-dependent activation observed for Ack1 (20Yokoyama N. Lougheed J. Miller W.T. Phosphorylation of WASP by the Cdc42-associated kinase ACK1: dual hydroxyamino acid specificity in a tyrosine kinase.J. Biol.

Binding of the UBA domain in the C-terminus of Tnk1 to ubiquitin stabilizes an active form of the enzyme (7Chan T.Y. Egbert C.M. Maxson J.E. Siddiqui A. Larsen L.J. Kohler K. et al.TNK1 is a ubiquitin-binding and 14-3-3-regulated kinase that can be targeted to block tumor growth.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ubiquitination of Ack1 through its UBA is required for its degradation. The UBA domain of Ack1 also facilitates the degradation of EGFR following EGF treatment (29Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress C. Yang W. Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 is a component of EGF receptor signaling complex and regulates EGF receptor degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A cancer-associated mutation in the Ack1 UBA domain increases the stability of EGFR and leads to prolonged Ras/Raf/MAPK activation (30Chua B.T. Lim S.J. Tham S.C. Poh W.J. Ullrich A. Somatic mutation in the ACK1 ubiquitin association domain enhances oncogenic signaling through EGFR regulation in renal cancer derived cells.Mol. Oncol. 2010; 4: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The UBA domain of Tnk1 may play a similar role in regulating signaling by associated receptor tyrosine kinases. Previous studies have suggested both pro-oncogenic and pro-apoptotic/tumor suppressive functions for Tnk1 (2Azoitei N. Brey A. Busch T. Fulda S. Ad"

In general, PTBD techniques are divided into two methods: fluoroscopy-guided PTBD and ultrasound (US)-guided PTBD. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of US-guided PTBD, focusing on radiation exposure according to intrahepatic duct (IHD) dilatation degree, differences between right- and left-sided approaches and differences between benign and malignant biliary stenosis/obstruction. We evaluated technical success, clinical success, procedural data (the number of liver capsule punctures, procedural time, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose), and procedure-related complications. During the study period, a total of 123 patients with biliary stenosis/obstruction or bile leakage were initially eligible. We excluded 76 patients treated with only ERCP or initially treated with ERCP followed underwent PTBD insertion. Finally, a total of 50 procedures were performed in 47 patients. Of the 47 patients, 8 patients had anatomical alteration due to previous surgery, 6 patients refused ERCP, and 3 patients failed ERCP. For the remaining 30 patients, PTBD was performed on weekend or at night, 11 of whom had poor general condition, 10 patients underwent ERCP 3 to 4 days later after PTBD insertion, 6 patients improved after PTBD insertion without ERCP, 1 patient died, and 1 patient was referred to other hospital. Remaining 1 patient underwent surgery due to Mirizzi syndrome. All procedures were performed by two interventional radiologists. Technical success rate was 100%, clinical success was 94%, and the complication rate was 10%. Fluoroscopy time and the reported radiation dose were significantly lower in patients with dilated bile ducts than in those with non-dilated bile ducts, when biliary puncture under US guidance was performed initially. However, even in patients with non-dilated bile ducts undergoing initial trials of biliary puncture under US guidance, the fluoroscopy time and the reported radiation dose were low, based on current studies. No statistical significant differences were observed in terms of technical and dosimetry results according to right-sided and left-sided procedures and benign and malignant biliary stenosis/obstruction. Thus, US-guided PTBD was found to be a safe and effective technique that significantly reduced fluoroscopy time and radiation doses."
https://openalex.org/W4308194219,"Otoliths (ear-stones) in the inner ears of vertebrates containing visible year zones are used extensively to determine fish age. Analysis of otoliths is a time-consuming and difficult task that requires the education of human experts. Human age estimates are inconsistent, as several readings by the same human expert might result in different ages assigned to the same otolith, in addition to an inherent bias between readers. To improve efficiency and resolve inconsistent results in the age reading from otolith images by human experts, an automated procedure based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models suitable for image processing, is investigated. We applied CNNs that perform image regression to estimate the age of Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides ) with good results for individual ages as well as the overall age distribution, with an average CV of about 10% relative to the read ages by experts. In addition, the density distribution of predicted ages resembles the density distribution of the ground truth. By using k*l -fold cross-validation, we test all available samples, and we show that the results are rather sensitive to the choice of test set. Finally, we apply explanation techniques to analyze the decision process of deep learning models. In particular, we produce heatmaps indicating which input features that are the most important in the computation of predicted age."
https://openalex.org/W4308192862,"To reveal the characteristics of climate change and the controlling factors for vegetation dynamics in the Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China, 34 years (1982–2015) of regional climate variables and vegetation dynamics were investigated. The results show that: Annual mean air temperature (TMP) significantly increased with a linear slope of 0.473°C/10yr. Annual precipitation (PRE) had a non-significant positive trend nearly 5 times lower than the trend of potential evapotranspiration (PET). The average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed for the region was found to show a significant positive trend (6.131×10 −4 /yr). However, all climate variables displayed non-significant correlations with NDVI at annual scale. The reduction of desert and the increase of grassland over the past decades were accountable for the increased NDVI. Principal components analysis revealed that the regional climate change can be characterized as changes in temperature, humidity and the availability of radiant energy. Based on principal components regression coefficients, NDVI was mostly sensitive to humidity component, followed by growing season warmth (WMI). Spatially, 93.1% of the pixels displayed positive trend and 61.8% of the pixels displayed significant change over the past decades. Both principal regression analysis and partial correlation analysis revealed that NDVI in eastern part of Ordos was sensitive to TMP, whereas, NDVI in southern and western areas of Ordos displayed the high sensitivity to combined effects of PRE and cloud coverage (CLD). Partial correlation analyses also revealed that TMX was a surrogate for aridity, TMN was a representative of humidity, and temperature variations below the threshold of 5°C (CDI) were less important than WMI. We conclude that regional climate change can be characterized by warming and increased aridity.

This study aimed to examine the associations of different structural and functional social supports on depression, anxiety, and stress among young adults in Vietnam.An online cross-sectional study was performed on 236 respondents aged 16 to 30 years in Vietnam from June to July 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21); the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and the LUBBEN Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) was used to measure psychological health, functional and structural social support characteristics. Multi-level mixed-effect logistic regression was used to identify associations between social support and anxiety, depression, and stress.The rate of at least mild depression, anxiety, and stress were 30.1%, 34.8%, and 35.6%, respectively. Structural supports measured by LSNS-6 were not associated with the likelihood of having depression, anxiety, and stress (p&gt;0.05). Respondents having friends with whom they could share joys and sorrows were less likely to have anxiety (aOR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.41-0.90) and stress (aOR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.45-0.96). Having family support in decision-making was also negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Meanwhile, those having family and friends who tried to help them were more likely to suffer stress (aOR = 1.94, 95%CI = 1.16-3.24) and depression (aOR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.11-3.92), respectively.This study highlighted a high rate of psychological problems among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Emotional support from friends and advice support from family were important components that should be considered in further interventions to mitigate the psychological problems in young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4308193020,"Background Animal source foods (ASFs) are rich in high-quality proteins, including essential amino acids and highly bioavailable micronutrients vital for child growth and cognitive development. But, the daily consumption of ASFs among 6–23 months old children is very low in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of nutrition education intervention to improve the consumption of ASFs among 6–23 months old children from rural communities with strict religious fasting traditions of avoiding intake of ASFs in Northern Ethiopia. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two food insecure districts namely Samre Seharti (intervention) and Tanqua Abergele (comparison). The mother-child pairs in the intervention group (n = 140) received nutrition education based on the barriers and available resources for optimal consumption of ASFs among children and followed up for nine months. The mother-child pairs in the comparison group (n = 153) received routine nutrition education. The data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. The baseline and endline data assessment included interviews on socio-demographic and socio-economic status, dietary intake, and child feeding practices. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured using the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis model. Results At endline, the consumption of ASFs among children was 19.5 percentage points higher in the intervention group compared with the comparison group (p = 0.008). In addition, there was a significant increase in egg consumption among children in the intervention group (DID of 16.9, p = 0.012) from the comparison group. No child was consuming meat at baseline in both the intervention and comparison arms and it was very low at endline (5.2% vs. 7.9%). Overall, the proportion of children that consumed eggs in the intervention group was higher than in the comparison group in households that owned sheep and goats (4.8% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.050) and chicken (6.3% vs. 43.8%, p = 0.002) after education interventions. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between cow ownership and milk consumption among children (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions Age-appropriate educational interventions for mothers and owning small livestock in the household can improve the consumption of ASFs and eventually the minimum diet diversity of children in communities with strict religious traditions of avoiding ASFs during the fasting seasons."
https://openalex.org/W4308193365,"Substantial empirical evidence suggests that individuals who belong to sexual and gender minorities experience more anxiety and depression than heterosexual and cisgender people. Many previous studies have not, however, used population-based samples. There is also a shortage of evidence about certain sexual and gender minorities (e.g., nonbinary individuals). We examined differences in levels of anxiety and depression within sexual and gender minorities, as well as compared to the heterosexual and cisgender majority in a population-based Finnish sample ( N = 8,589). We also explored if individuals who belong to both a gender and a sexual minority (double minority) reported higher rates of anxiety and depression than individuals who hold either a gender or a sexual minority status (single minority). Individuals who belonged to either a sexual or a gender minority overall experienced significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression than cisgender and heterosexual individuals. Among the different sexual and gender minorities, bisexual, emerging identity, and nonbinary individuals reported the highest rates of anxiety and depression. We found no differences in anxiety and depression between single minority and double minority individuals. Our results suggest that even though Finland is a country with an inclusive social climate, sexual and gender minorities are, nevertheless, disproportionately affected by mental health issues. The present study gives further support to the claim that individuals holding a sexual or gender minority status experience higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to cisgender and heterosexual individuals and pinpoints the need to acknowledge these issues both in the context of health care and in the society at large."
https://openalex.org/W4308193757,"As a teaching subject, animal welfare is challenging for educators and learners, as was recently shown in a recent survey on the evolution of animal welfare teaching in Europe. Among several suggestions to overcome the current resistance to implementing animal welfare education, we highlight two. The first is that animal welfare education should be based on learner-centred approaches; the second is that it should encompass both animal welfare science and ethics and law. To the best of our knowledge, there are no learner-centred pedagogical approaches that can simultaneously explore scientific and ethical concepts. Furthermore, when exploring ethical concepts within the educational context, there is the additional challenge of being able to depart from discussion and debate to a systematic organization of knowledge. Our work simultaneously addresses these two challenges, presenting the design and implementation of a novel web-based learner-centred pedagogical platform for farm animal welfare teaching. The platform, named ANIPHI, uses the Delphi method's iterative nature as a learning process to generate both reflection and (online) debate among learners. ANIPHI can be used by educators in an online environment, in a classroom environment, or in a combination of the two environments. ANIPHI was developed within the ERASMUS+ ANICARE project and is an open web-based platform for all educators interested in teaching farm animal welfare. Given ANIPHI's flexible and user-friendly nature, the platform simultaneously exposes learners to ethical and scientific concepts in different educational realities, according to the educator's objectives. Furthermore, videos depicting different husbandry practices across different types of animal production and countries are embedded in the platform. These videos are commented on by the farmer himself and by animal scientists, which enriches the learner's experience. Educators across the ANICARE consortium have already successfully tested the ANIPHI platform for different farm animal welfare topics. We conclude this article by presenting one example of using ANIPHI in a real-life educational context, where we discuss some aspects of the design and use of our pedagogical platform."
https://openalex.org/W4308263320,"Semen cryopreservation is used for the propagation of variety among species and domestic breeding. Mitochondria are implicated in sperm freezability, and their proteins are prone to succinylation, but the relationship between sperm freezability and mitochondrial protein succinylation is unclear. In this study, six bulls were classified as having good or poor freezability ejaculates (GFE or PFE, each 3 bulls). The fresh sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and pan succinylation level of the two groups were first detected. Then the lysine succinylome and fatty acid content of the two groups were analyzed using label-free LC–MS/MS and GC–MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes, respectively. The results indicated that the GFE sperm had significantly higher MMPs than the PFE group (p < 0.05). A total of 1393 succinylation sites corresponding to 426 proteins were assessed and 5 succinylated peptides of the GFE group were markedly upregulated, while 3 were significantly downregulated (FC > 2.0 – < 0.5 and p-value < 0.05) when compared to the PFE group. Forty-six succinylated proteins were identified to have consistent presence/absence expression. The upregulated succinylated proteins in the GFE sperm were enriched in lipid metabolic processes. A total of 31 fatty acids were further subjected to quantitative analysis of which 23 including arachidic (C20:0), linolenic (C18:3n3), and docosahexaenoic acids (C22:6n3) were decreased in GFE sperm when compared with PFE (p < 0.05). These results suggest that lysine succinylation can potentially influence the sperm freezability of Mediterranean buffaloes through mitochondrial lipid metabolism. This novel study provides our understanding of sperm succinylation and the molecular basis for the mechanism of sperm freezability."
https://openalex.org/W4308294026,"Fibrillization of the protein amyloid β is assumed to trigger Alzheimer's pathology. Approaches that target amyloid plaques, however, have garnered limited clinical success, and their failures may relate to the scarce understanding of the impact of potential drugs on the intertwined stages of fibrillization. Here, we demonstrate that bexarotene, a T-cell lymphoma medication with known antiamyloid activity both in vitro and in vivo, suppresses amyloid fibrillization by promoting an alternative fibril structure. We employ time-resolved in situ atomic force microscopy to quantify the kinetics of growth of individual fibrils and supplement it with structure characterization by cryo-EM. We show that fibrils with structure engineered by the drug nucleate and grow substantially slower than ""normal"" fibrils; remarkably, growth remains stunted even in drug-free solutions. We find that the suppression of fibril growth by bexarotene is not because of the drug binding to the fibril tips or to the peptides in the solution. Kinetic analyses attribute the slow growth of drug-enforced fibril polymorph to the distinctive dynamics of peptide chain association to their tips. As an additional benefit, the bexarotene fibrils kill primary rat hippocampal neurons less efficiently than normal fibrils. In conclusion, the suggested drug-driven polymorph transformation presents a mode of action to irreversibly suppress toxic aggregates not only in Alzheimer's but also potentially in myriad diverse pathologies that originate with protein condensation."
https://openalex.org/W4308294092,"The glucagon receptor (GCGR) is a potential target for diabetes therapy. Several emerging GCGR antagonism-based therapies are under preclinical and clinical development. However, GCGR antagonism, as well as genetically engineered GCGR deficiency in animal models, are accompanied by α-cell hyperplasia and hyperglucagonemia, which may limit the application of GCGR antagonism. To better understand the physiological changes in α cells following GCGR disruption, we performed single cell sequencing of α cells isolated from control and gcgr-/- (glucagon receptor deficient) zebrafish. Interestingly, beyond the α-cell hyperplasia, we also found that the expression of gcga, gcgb, pnoca, and several glucagon-regulatory transcription factors were dramatically increased in one cluster of gcgr-/- α cells. We further confirmed that glucagon mRNA was upregulated in gcgr-/- animals by in situ hybridization and that glucagon promoter activity was increased in gcgr-/-;Tg(gcga:GFP) reporter zebrafish. We also demonstrated that gcgr-/- α cells had increased glucagon protein levels and increased granules after GCGR disruption. Intriguingly, the increased mRNA and protein levels could be suppressed by treatment with high-level glucose or knockdown of the pnoca gene. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that GCGR deficiency not only induced α-cell hyperplasia but also increased glucagon expression in α cells, findings which provide more information about physiological changes in α-cells when the GCGR is disrupted."
https://openalex.org/W4308294602,"Mutations in C10orf11 (oculocutaneous albinism type 7 [OCA7]) cause OCA, a disorder that presents with hypopigmentation in skin, eyes, and hair. The OCA7 pathophysiology is unknown, and there is virtually no information on the OCA7 protein and its cellular function. Here, we discover that OCA7 localizes to the limiting membrane of melanosomes, the specialized pigment cell organelles where melanin is synthesized. We demonstrate that OCA7 is recruited through interaction with a canonical effector-binding surface of melanosome proteins Rab32 and Rab38. Using newly generated OCA7-KO MNT1 cells, we show OCA7 regulates overall melanin levels in a melanocyte autonomous manner by controlling melanosome maturation. Importantly, we found that OCA7 regulates premelanosome protein (PMEL) processing, impacting fibrillation and the striations that define transition from melanosome stage I to stage II. Furthermore, the melanosome lumen of OCA7-KO cells displays lower pH than control cells. Together, our results reveal that OCA7 regulates pigmentation through two well-established determinants of melanosome biogenesis and function, PMEL processing, and organelle pH."

Blood of (HFE)(−/−) mice and of humans with hemochromatosis contains toxic nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) which accumulates in organs. However, the chemical composition of NTBI is uncertain.

Liquid chromatography detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of flow-through solutions exhibited low-molecular-mass iron peaks that did not increase intensity with increasing dietary iron. Retentates yielded peaks due to transferrin (TFN) and ferritin, but much iron in these samples adsorbed onto the column. Retentates treated with the chelator deferoxamine (DFO) yielded a peak that comigrated with the Fe–DFO complex and originated from iron that adhered to the column in the absence of DFO. Additionally, plasma from younger and older 57Fe-enriched HFE mice were separately pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration.

Nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) is a toxic form of iron in the blood of individuals with iron-overload diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis (1Anderson G.J. Bardou-Jacquet E. Revisiting hemochromatosis: genetic vs. phenotypic manifestations.Ann. Transl. Med. 2021; 9: 731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and β-thalassemia (2Chauhan W. Shoaib S. Fatma R. Zaka-ur-Rab Z. Afzal M. Beta-thalassemia and the advent of new interventions beyond transfusion and iron chelation.Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2022; 88: 3610-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It accumulates excessively in the liver and other organs, resulting in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer, endocrinopathies, and cardiomyopathies (3Knutson M.D. Non-transferrin-bound iron transporters.Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2019; 133: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatments include low iron diets, frequent phlebotomies, and ingestion of iron-binding chelators. Effectiveness is limited, especially for β-thalassemia. Transferrin (TFN) is an iron-binding protein in the blood which serves as an iron buffer (4Bartnikas T.B. Known and potential roles of transferrin in iron biology.Biometals. 2012; 25: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, about one-third of TFN is in the holo- (two FeIII ions bound) form whereas most of the remainder is apo- (iron-free). Nutrient iron enters the blood via ferroportin (FPN), a membrane-bound FeII transporter that is highly expressed on the basolateral side of enterocytes in the duodenum (5Ganz T. Hepcidin and iron regulation, 10 years later.Blood. 2011; 117: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Holo-TFN is distributed throughout the body and enters cells via TFN receptor–mediated endocytosis. FPN is also highly expressed in macrophages, including Kupffer cells in the liver and red-pulp macrophages in the spleen. In both cases, FPN functions to release stored iron into the blood. Iron import into the body is regulated at the systems’ level by hepcidin, a small peptide hormone produced in the liver in response to excessive bodily iron (5Ganz T. Hepcidin and iron regulation, 10 years later.Blood. 2011; 117: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Hepcidin binds FPN, causing its internalization and subsequent hydrolytic degradation. Individuals with hemochromatosis, most commonly harboring a mutation in the HFE (Homeostatic Fe regulator) gene, generate insufficient hepcidin, resulting in excessive levels of FPN and thus excessive import of nutrient iron into the blood. This saturates TFN such that the concentration of apo-TFN available to receive newly imported iron is insufficient. The excessive iron released into the blood becomes NTBI. Despite being recognized to exist for a half-century, the chemical identity of NTBI remains unestablished (1Anderson G.J. Bardou-Jacquet E.

The (Bio)Chemistry of non-transferrin-bound iron.Molecules. 2022; 27: 1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). One reason for this is that its two most predominant characteristics—accumulating in organs and susceptibility to chelation—are indirect and difficult to quantify. Iron accumulates in organs primarily as ferritin (FTN), but NTBI is a different species that is likely altered via reduction and ligand exchange as it enters the cell and is converted into FTN. NTBI is typically defined operationally as the iron in plasma that reacts with a particular chelator under prescribed concentrations and durations. However, the size of the NTBI pool in plasma is affected by these details. A second problem is that the concentration of NTBI in diseased plasma is not exceptionally high (1–10 μM), and although NTBI concentration in healthy individuals is lower, it is still detectable and significant. A third problem arises from the gradual and ambiguous “spillover” conditions required to generate NTBI; between 40% and 70% TFN saturation is reportedly sufficient for NTBI levels to increase (10Batey R.G. Fracp P. Fong L.C. Shamir S. Sherlock S. A non-transferrin-bound serum iron in idiopathic hemochromatosis.Dig. Dis. Sci. 1980; 25: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Aruoma O.I.

A fourth problem is that the aqueous redox and coordination chemistry of iron is complicated, and NTBI may be heterogeneous (12Silva A.M. Kong X. Parkin M.C. Cammack R. Hider R.C. Iron(III) citrate speciation in aqueous solution.Dalton Trans. 2009; 40: 8616-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Breuer W. Hershko C. Cabantchik Z.I. The importance of non-transferrin bound iron in disorders of iron metabolism.Transfus. Sci. 2000; 23: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Two basic types of experiments have contributed to our understanding of NTBI, but perhaps they have also hindered it. One type of experiment has been to monitor the fate of added radioactive 59Fe to sera or plasma. Radioactive iron binds preferentially and tightly to available apo-TFN, and the excess is concluded to be (or become) NTBI. This assumes that the only iron-binding ligand in sera/plasma is the NTBI ligand (symbolized :LNTBI) and that this ligand is present in excess. Actually, there are many potential ligands in plasma (18May P.M. Linder P.W. Computer simulation of metal-ion equilibria in biofluids: models for the low-molecular-weight complex distribution of Calcium(II), Magnesium(II), Manganese(II), Iron(III), Copper(II), Zinc(II) and Lead(II) ions in human blood plasma.J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 1977; : 588-595Crossref Google Scholar) and the added 59Fe may bind any or all of them. In the other type of experiment, a chelator is added to sera/plasma, and the resulting Fe–chelator complex is assumed to arise from the binding of NTBI; the assumed general reaction is {Fe:LNTBI + chelator ⇄ Fe-chelator +:LNTBI}. The problem is that NTBI is destroyed during this reaction, making it unlikely that such experiments can ultimately be used to identify NTBI. Moreover, the added chelator might also sequester iron that is bound to other non-NTBI species, overestimating the size of the NTBI pool. To avoid these problems, we and others (19Neu H.M. Alexishin S.A. Brandis J.E.P. Williams A.M.C. Li W.J. Sun D.J. et al.Snapshots of iron speciation: tracking the fate of iron nanoparticle drugs via a liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric approach.Mol.

(20Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron in healthy blood plasma is not predominately ferric citrate.Metallomics. 2018; 10: 802-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) detected low concentrations of low-molecular-mass (LMM) iron species in plasma from healthy humans, horses, mice, and pigs, but the chromatographic properties of these species largely differed from those of FeIII(citrate). Unexpectedly, the 10 kDa plasma ultrafiltrate (or flow-through solution, FTS) from human hemochromatosis patients did not exhibit any additional iron-detected LC peaks relative to healthy controls. However, the patients had been treated for the disease, suggesting that their NTBI levels might have been too low to detect. Dzubia et al. (21Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron complexes in blood plasma of iron-deficient pigs do not originate directly from nutrient iron.Metallomics. 2019; 11: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that the low concentration of LMM iron species observed in the earlier study was due to the quantitative removal of NTBI by the liver, and so they surgically implanted catheters in the portal vein of pigs that had been starved for iron. Intestinal blood passes through this vein to the liver, and so they anticipated that blood removed from it would contain high concentrations of NTBI. Blood was also removed from the caudal/cranial vena cava as a control. A bolus of 57Fe was injected into the stomach via a feeding tube, and blood samples were removed from both catheters at increasing times. Since only 2% of natural-abundance iron is due to 57Fe, the fate of the injected enriched 57Fe could be followed. Surprisingly, the LMM iron complexes did not become enriched in 57Fe; rather the injected 57Fe bound apo-TFN. Dzubia et al. (21Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron complexes in blood plasma of iron-deficient pigs do not originate directly from nutrient iron.Metallomics. 2019; 11: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the detected LMM iron complexes arise from internal stores rather than directly from nutrient iron. Building off those results, we hypothesized that NTBI might only be detectable using iron-overloaded genetically modified animals. Here, we investigated this by examining HFE(−/−) (heretofore called HFE) mice fed iron-deficient diets supplemented with 0, 50, 500, and 5000 mg of natural abundance FeIII citrate. We selected the HFE gene because a mutation in it is the most common origin of the disease (22Barton J.C. Edwards C.Q. Acton R.T. HFE gene: structure, function, mutations, and associated iron abnormalities.Gene. 2015; 574: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using our LC-ICP-MS system, we expected to observe increasing levels of LMM iron complexes in the blood plasma filtrates of these sick animals, especially as the concentration of iron in the diet increased. Once again, our results were unexpected, but they prompted a new and intriguing hypothesis as to the chemical nature of NTBI. Figure 1 outlines the chronology of our study. Our initial objective was to detect and characterize NTBI in the blood of HFE mice (and controls) raised on 0, 50, 500, and 5000 mg of iron per kg of iron-deficient chow. Some HFE mice were raised on 50 mg 57Fe/kg chow. Mice were sacrificed at various ages, blood was collected, and the plasma portion was filtered through a 10 kDa cut-off membrane, resulting in retentate and FTS fractions. A flow chart showing an overview of the study is given in Fig. S1. We initially focused on detecting NTBI in FTSs since we expected it to be a LMM species. FTSs of the plasma from both HFE and control mice were subjected to LC-ICP-MS chromatography using a size-exclusion low-mass column that could resolve species with masses ranging from 100 to 10,000 Da. In a typical experiment performed over the course of a day, eight HFE or control mice were sacrificed, two from each diet group. Adult mice yielded only 0.5 to 1 ml of blood, and so blood of two mice from each group (3 for younger mice) were combined. After centrifugation, plasma fractions, representing ∼ 50% of total volume, were collected and filtered, yielding ∼ 70 μl of retentate and ∼ 400 μl of FTS. The iron concentration in HFE FTS (from six 12–16 weeks mice) was modest, 1.9 ± 0.2 μM Fe. Plasma contains hundreds of mM of salt which fouled the ICP-MS instrument and reduced the detector response. Significant amounts of iron adsorbed onto the column, and subsequent cleaning had limited effectiveness. Small differences in daily tuning of the ICP-MS and changes in columns caused shifts in peak intensities and/or elution volumes. As a result, traces obtained on different days were not easily compared, so analyses were limited to assessing overall patterns within a group of traces obtained on the same day. Chromatograms of FTS from HFE and control mice exhibited 1 to 4 low-intensity iron peaks (Fig. 2). Results of three separate experiments are shown, including from 3-weeks HFE mice (Panel A), 12 weeks HFE mice (Panel B), and 16 weeks control mice (Panel C). Iron-detected traces from four additional experiments are shown in Fig. S2, including FTS from 3 weeks HFE (Panel B), 24 weeks HFE (Panel C), 32 weeks HFE (Panel A), and 24 weeks control (Panel D) mice. Specific peaks within a group were nearly identical in terms of elution volumes and intensities. Peaks in SI experiments were more intense; however, some of that intensity was due to contaminating iron that had desorbed from the column with each sample injection. In the experiment of Fig. S2D, we verified this by running a “ghost” column (i.e., peek tubing in place of the column) and measuring the area under the resulting iron peaks. Although this indicated substantial contaminating iron in LC traces, the nearly identical intensity of the ghost column peaks confirmed that the concentration of iron in the FTS did NOT increase proportionately with dietary iron. All such experiments indicated the same. In the experiment of Fig. S2C, an FeIII citrate standard run on the same day did not comigrate with the Fe peaks from plasma, supporting our previous conclusion (20Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron in healthy blood plasma is not predominately ferric citrate.Metallomics. 2018; 10: 802-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron complexes in blood plasma of iron-deficient pigs do not originate directly from nutrient iron.Metallomics. 2019; 11: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that FeIII citrate was not the dominant LMM Fe species in plasma FTS. The LMM iron species in the FTS of HFE (or control) mice were present at low concentrations and were similar regardless of whether the sample originated from HFE or control mice and regardless of the iron level in the diet. Overall, these results forced us to conclude that plasma FTS from HFE mice do not accumulate a LMM form of iron even on a high-iron diet. With some reluctance, we shifted the search for NTBI to retentate fractions. Such fractions from 24 weeks control and HFE mice were run on a high-mass column which resolved species with masses between 10 kDa and 100 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). Matching ghost column traces (×0.1) are in red. Two major peaks were observed, which were assigned to FTN and TFN by running protein standards of horse spleen FTN (Sigma) and human TFN (Athens Research). The pattern in Fig. 3A suggested that the TFN peak intensity in HFE retentates increased from 0 to 50 mg Fe and then remained relatively constant. The peak assigned to FTN increased gradually with dietary iron. For control retentates, the FTN peak also increased with dietary iron (Fig. 3B). No such trend was evident for TFN. Other batches of retentate analyzed by LC-ICP-MS showed increasing TFN and FTN saturation with increasing Fe in the diet. Ghost column areas in Fig. S3A indicated little contamination; however, 35% to 70% of sample iron typically adsorbed on the column. Retentates from control and HFE mice were devoid of LMM species (Fig. S4). The intensity of the void volume peaks increased with increasing nutrient iron, especially for the HFE samples. NTBI is commonly quantified by its reaction with deferoxamine (DFO), and so we treated retentate samples with this chelator to assess the presence of NTBI in those fractions. Some HFE mice were raised on a “regular” diet containing ∼250 mg iron/kg chow. Retentate samples from 24 to 36 weeks “regular” mice (called R24 and R36) were diluted 80-fold and divided in halves. Half of each sample was treated with DFO, and half was left untreated. All four samples were run on the high-mass and ghost columns (Fig. 4). A trace of an Fe-DFO standard was also collected. The dominant Fe-detectable peak for both R24 and R36 mice originated from TFN, and its intensity was similar for all four traces. Traces from the two samples that had been treated with DFO exhibited a second major peak which comigrated with the Fe-DFO standard. The intensity of these peaks did not increase at the expense of the TFN peak, rather the peaks simply appeared. We concluded that HFE retentates contain a “sticky” form of iron that adsorbed onto the column but was also chelatable by DFO. We will ultimately conclude that this material is NTBI. The corresponding ghost column peaks indicated that the R36 retentate contained more than twice as much iron as the R24 retentate, suggesting that the DFO-chelatable iron increased with age, as expected for NTBI. Citrate is the most popular candidate for the NTBI ligand, and so we performed experiments to explore this possibility. We attempted to remove LMM species from plasma, including FeIII citrate, by filtering plasma from 36-weeks HFE “regular” mice using a 10 kDa cutoff membrane and washing the retentate twice with water. The retentate was then divided in two, half was treated with citrate, and half was untreated. Both halves were passed through the high-mass column. In both traces, the dominant peak was TFN (Fig. 5 Panel A). Quantification of the ghost-column trace indicated that 40% of the iron in the washed untreated retentate sample was not bound to TFN and was not detected in the trace. This undetected form of iron must have adsorbed to the column (ultimately, we will assign it to NTBI). The citrate-treated sample exhibited new peaks in the LMM region (at ∼ 22 ml) with approximately the intensity expected if citrate coordinated the high-mass “sticky” (NTBI) iron that was undetected in the other trace. We write this as {FeIII:LNTBI + citrate → FeIIIcitrate +:LNTBI}. Two similar experiments using plasma FTSs were analyzed using the low-mass column. In one experiment, FTSs from plasma of six mice were combined and then divided in two. Half was treated with an FeIII citrate solution (which contained an excess of citrate), and half was untreated. An FeIII citrate standard was also run. The trace of the untreated half exhibited ∼ 3 resolvable peaks at 16 to 21 ml elution volume plus a broad peak at longer elution volumes (Fig. 5B, middle trace). The trace of the treated sample (upper trace) was qualitatively similar but more intense. It included a peak that nearly comigrated with the FeIII citrate standard (perhaps the slight shift was due to the salt present only in the FTS sample), but the intensity of the “FeIII citrate” peak was modest relative to the increased intensities of the other peaks in the trace. (Note: the elution volume of FeIII citrate that migrated through the low-mass column differed from that through the high-mass column.) We concluded that most (∼90%) of the iron from the added FeIII citrate underwent ligand exchange with other species in the FTS. This suggested that FeIII citrate is not the most stable iron complex formed when citrate is added to plasma; much of it converts to other forms resulting in a distribution of species. If NTBI was present in retentate fractions rather than in FTSs, we realized that it might be possible to detect using Mössbauer spectroscopy (MB). With a limited amount of 57Fe-enriched plasma available from a recent study (23Vali S.W. Lindahl P.A. Mössbauer spectroscopic characterization of organs from HFE(-/-) mice: relevance to hereditary hemochromatosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; Google Scholar), we decided to combine plasma from the four youngest HFE mice that were available (4, 6, 10, and 14 weeks), concentrate the sample using a 10 kDa cutoff membrane, and load it into a MB cup for analysis. We did the same for plasma from four older HFE mice (18, 24, 32, and 52 weeks). Since no 57Fe-enriched plasma from control mice were available to serve as a control, we anticipated that NTBI might be present in greater amounts in the old mice sample. The iron concentrations in the young and old retentates (after removing residual red blood cell contributions) were 96 ± 6 μM and 136 ± 5 μM, respectively. Since the retentates were concentrated ∼ 5-fold for this experiment, we estimate that the plasma iron concentration would be ∼ 20 μM in young and ∼ 27 μM in old plasma, similar to our previous values (20Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron in healthy blood plasma is not predominately ferric citrate.Metallomics. 2018; 10: 802-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dziuba N. Hardy J. Lindahl P.A. Low-molecular-mass iron complexes in blood plasma of iron-deficient pigs do not originate directly from nutrient iron.Metallomics. 2019; 11: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dominating features in the raw 6 K 0.05 T MB spectra (Fig. S5) were quadrupole doublets originating from contaminating deoxy and oxy FeII hemoglobin; these were simulated and removed. The resulting difference spectra were dominated by a magnetic feature which was simulated using the spin Hamiltonian parameters of di-ferric TFN (24Kretchmar S.A. Teixeira M. Huynh B.H. Raymond K.N. Mössbauer studies of electrophoretically purified monoferric and diferric human transferrin.Biol. Met. 1988; 1: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The only remaining spectral feature (Fig. 6, A and B respectively) was narrow absorption in the central region. Spectral noise was significant even after > 200 h of data collection. Spectral noise was too severe to firmly assign the absorption in the central region, but it could be approximately simulated by a quadrupole doublet with δ = 0.5 ± 0.1 mm/s and ΔEQ = 0.5 ± 0.1 mm/s. The parameters approximated those of FeIII aggregates such as the oxyhydroxide phosphate–associated nanoparticles found in diseased mitochondria (δ = 0.52 mm/s and ΔEQ = 0.63 mm/s; (25Miao R. Martinho M. Morales J.G. Kim H. Ellis E.A. Lill R. et al.EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy of intact mitochondria isolated from Yah1p depleted Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9888-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The intensity of this material was ∼ 2 × higher in the spectrum obtained from old versus young HFE mice. In animals with iron-overload diseases, NTBI concentration increases with age (26Lee S.M. Loguinov A. Fleming R.E. Vulpe C.D. Effects of strain and age on hepatic gene expression profiles in murine models of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis.Genes Nutr. 2015; 10: 443Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that NTBI was an FeIII aggregate in plasma. We considered that such aggregates formed due to the oxidizing, salty, pH-neutral conditions of plasma. To consider this further, we added acidic 57FeIII ions dropwise to blood plasma (to 250 μM) from 24 weeks HFE mice that had been fed a regular natural abundance-iron diet. The resulting spectrum (Fig. 6C) exhibited a broad quadrupole doublet again typical of 57FeIII aggregates (simulated in red). The minor magnetic species evident from the baseline was probably from added 57Fe that bound apo-TFN. We next prepared a “pseudo plasma FTS” solution and added acidic 57FeIII in similar fashion. The corresponding MB spectrum (Fig. 7D) was once again a quadrupole doublet with similar parameters (δ = 0.55 ± 0.02 mm/s and ΔEQ = 0.60 ±"

https://openalex.org/W4308550080,"Mutations in one of the three RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) are present in nearly 20% of all human cancers. These mutations shift RAS to the GTP-loaded active state due to impairment in the intrinsic GTPase activity and disruption of GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis, resulting in constitutive activation of effectors such as RAF. Because activation of RAF involves dimerization, RAS dimerization has been proposed as an important step in RAS-mediated activation of effectors. The α4-α5 allosteric lobe of RAS has been proposed as a RAS dimerization interface. Indeed, the NS1 monobody, which binds the α4-α5 region within the RAS G domain, inhibits RAS-dependent signaling and transformation as well as RAS nanoclustering at the plasma membrane. Although these results are consistent with a model in which the G domain dimerizes through the α4-α5 region, the isolated G domain of RAS lacks intrinsic dimerization capacity. Furthermore, prior studies analyzing α4-α5 point mutations have reported mixed effects on RAS function. Here, we evaluated the activity of a panel of single amino acid substitutions in the α4-α5 region implicated in RAS dimerization. We found that these proposed ""dimerization-disrupting"" mutations do not significantly impair self-association, signaling, or transformation of oncogenic RAS. These results are consistent with a model in which activated RAS protomers cluster in close proximity to promote the dimerization of their associated effector proteins (e.g., RAF) without physically associating into dimers mediated by specific molecular interactions. Our findings suggest the need for a nonconventional approach to developing therapeutics targeting the α4-α5 region."
https://openalex.org/W4308150530,"Yeast vacuoles are acidified by the v-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) that is comprised of the membrane embedded VO complex and the soluble cytoplasmic V1 complex. The assembly of the V1-VO holoenzyme on the vacuole is stabilized in part through interactions between the VO a-subunit ortholog Vph1 and the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). PI(3,5)P2 also affects vacuolar Ca2+ release through the channel Yvc1 and uptake through the Ca2+ pump Pmc1. Here, we asked if H+ and Ca2+ transport activities were connected through PI(3,5)P2. We found that overproduction of PI(3,5)P2 by the hyperactive fab1T2250A mutant augmented vacuole acidification, whereas the kinase-inactive fab1EEE mutant attenuated the formation of a H+ gradient. Separately, we tested the effects of excess Ca2+ on vacuole acidification. Adding micromolar Ca2+ blocked vacuole acidification, whereas chelating Ca2+ accelerated acidification. The effect of adding Ca2+ on acidification was eliminated when the Ca2+/H+ antiporter Vcx1 was absent, indicating that the vacuolar H+ gradient can collapse during Ca2+ stress through Vcx1 activity. This, however, was independent of PI(3,5)P2, suggesting that PI(3,5)P2 plays a role in submicromolar Ca2+ flux but not under Ca2+ shock. To see if the link between Ca2+ and H+ transport was bidirectional, we examined Ca2+ transport when vacuole acidification was inhibited. We found that Ca2+ transport was inhibited by halting V-ATPase activity with Bafilomycin or neutralizing vacuolar pH with chloroquine. Together, these data show that Ca2+ transport and V-ATPase efficacy are connected but not necessarily through PI(3,5)P2."
https://openalex.org/W4308155840,"Grim-19 (gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality 19), the essential component of complex I of mitochondrial respiratory chain, functions as a noncanonical tumor suppressor by controlling apoptosis and energy metabolism. However, additional biological actions of Grim-19 have been recently suggested in male reproduction. We investigated here the expression and functional role of Grim-19 in murine testis. Testicular Grim-19 expression was detected from mouse puberty and increased progressively thereafter, and GRIM-19 protein was observed to be expressed exclusively in interstitial Leydig cells (LCs), with a prominent mitochondrial localization. In vivo lentiviral vector-mediated knockdown of Grim-19 resulted in a significant decrease in testosterone production and triggered aberrant oxidative stress in testis, thus impairing male fertility by inducing germ cell apoptosis and oligozoospermia. The control of testicular steroidogenesis by GRIM-19 was validated using the in vivo knockdown model with isolated primary LCs and in vitro experiments with MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. Mechanistically, we suggest that the negative regulation exerted by GRIM-19 deficiency-induced oxidative stress on steroidogenesis may be the result of two phenomena: a direct effect through inhibition of phosphorylation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and subsequent impediment to StAR localization in mitochondria and an indirect pathway that is to facilitate the inhibiting role exerted by the extracellular matrix on the steroidogenic capacity of LCs via promotion of integrin activation. Altogether, our observations suggest that Grim-19 plays a potent role in testicular steroidogenesis and that its alterations may contribute to testosterone deficiency-related disorders linked to metabolic stress and male infertility."

Also, there is an increased likelihood of road accidents requiring immediate medical attention. Emergency vehicle (EV) service is adversely affected due to the unavailability of the clear lane that supports EVs to get to their endpoint without being delayed along the national highways. Moreover, the EV's sirens have a limited range, which may fail to reach and notify other vehicular traffic about its mobility promptly. In addition to this range constraint, EVs in motion often lose their communication links while moving from network to network. This paper delineates an approach using the next generation mobile internet protocol, for automated pathway clearance, for EVs. The prototype model of the proposed approach was experimentally designed and implemented. The proposed design concept is validated by performance characterization via numerical analysis."

The strong anthropogenic interventions by mining processes reduce dramatically the physical and nutritional composition of the soil. We studied two restoration areas in Paracatu, Brazil, to examine their edaphic conditions six years after mining activities ceased and relate them to the status of the restoration process. In 2009, a Cerrado restoration were established in an area previously explored for gravel extraction. Plants were sampled and identified in 11 transects along the planting lines. The diameter base (DB) and total height (HT) were measured. The physical/chemical quality of the soil substrate was determined using a collection of samples in open trenches at four types of points: Cerrado (TC); dead plant pits (TM); seedling pits having living individuals of the most abundant species (TT); and those of the second-most abundant species (TE). Cecropia pachystachya Trécul and Tapirira guianensis Aubl. were most abundant and demonstrated the potential to thrive in areas degraded by mining having low mortality rates and growth at relatively DB and HT. The physical quality indicators in the gravel pits were not limiting, indicating that substrate preparation was efficient in this regard. The organic matter content in TM, TT, and TE was low in comparison to that of TC, and the chemical conditions in the TE pit substrates were similar to those in TM pits, suggesting C . pachystachya is a species with good plasticity, whereas T . guianensis is present in pits with higher levels of phosphorus."

https://openalex.org/W4308193957,"Introduction Immigrants from high tuberculosis-burdened countries have been shown to have an increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). To reduce the risk of increased tuberculosis cases in Canada, the country has a comprehensive immigration medical examination process that identifies individuals with active tuberculosis using chest X-ray; however, it fails to identify LTBI. The lack of LTBI identification is concerning because immigrants with LTBI are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis within their first few years of migration due to stressful experiences common to many immigrants. Objectives The goal of this pilot study is to improve the current LTBI screening protocols among immigrants from high tuberculosis incidence countries and to better prevent and manage tuberculosis cases, by introducing an LTBI screening pilot program. The objectives are threefold: 1) to screen LTBI in immigrants from high tuberculosis incidence countries, including immigrants identified as being at risk of LTBI by the NB health care system, using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA); 2) to offer LTBI treatment and supports to those identified as having LTBI; and 3) to assess immigrant and health care providers (HCPs) satisfaction of the LTBI screening pilot program. Methods This cross-sectional study seeks to recruit 288 participants. Participants will be recruited via posters, social media platforms, invitations at immigrant wellness check-ups, presentations to local ethnocultural groups, and by snowball sampling. Consenting participants will be asked to submit a blood sample for LTBI screening; if positive, participants will be assessed and offered treatment for LTBI based on clinical assessment. Participants and HCPs’ feedback will be gathered via short questionnaires. For the quantitative portion of the study, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant characteristics and feedback. Simultaneous logistic regression will be performed to identify variables associated with the IGRA test outcome and evidence of increased CD8 T-cell immune response among those found to be LTBI-positive. Qualitative results will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Discussion The findings from this study will allow us to understand the role of the IGRA LTBI screening assay and its feasibility and acceptability by immigrants and HCPs in New Brunswick. The findings will additionally provide information on the enhancers and barriers of LTBI screening and management useful in determining how best to expand the LTBI screening program if deemed appropriate."

To address this issue, we have developed a rapid and robust flow cytometric assay for analysis of signaling protein function. A fluorescent reporter and fluorescent tagging of the target protein enables simultaneous assessment of protein expression and signaling within individual cells. We have applied our technique to the analysis of variants of the lipopolysaccharide receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its adapter protein MyD88, using a NF-кB-responsive promoter driving mScarlet-I expression. The assay enables exclusion of nontransfected cells and overexpressing cells that signal spontaneously. Additionally, our assay allows the identification of protein variants that fail to express. We found that the assays were highly sensitive, with cells expressing an appropriate level of GFP-MyD88 showing approximately 200-fold induction of mScarlet-I by lipopolysaccharide, and we can detect subtle protein concentration-dependent effects of mutations. Importantly, the assay is adaptable to various signaling pathways."
