https://openalex.org/W2036895735,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) participates in many processes including early developmental events, angiogenesis, wound healing, and maintenance of neuronal cell viability. A 130-kilodalton protein was isolated on the basis of its ability to specifically bind to bFGF. A complementary DNA clone was isolated with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to determined amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments of the purified protein. The putative bFGF receptor encoded by this complementary DNA is a transmembrane protein that contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, an unusual acidic region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. These domains are arranged in a pattern that is different from that of any growth factor receptor described."
https://openalex.org/W1593673702,"Unfractionated preparations of the proteins of human urine provided protection against the in vitro cytocidal effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In certain cells, the proteins decreased expression of the receptors for TNF in a temperature-dependent way. In all cells examined, the proteins were found to interfere also with the binding of both TNF and interleukin-1 when applied directly into the binding assays. That effect could be observed in the cold, suggesting that it was independent of cellular metabolism. A protein which protects cells against the cytotoxicity of TNF was purified from human urine by chromatography on CM-Sepharose followed by high performance liquid chromatography on Mono Q and Mono S columns and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. This protein is a very minor constituent of normal urine, with an apparent molecular weight of about 27,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Homogeneity of the purified protein was confirmed by microsequence analysis which revealed a single N-terminal sequence: Asp-Ser-Val-Cys-Pro-. The protein protected cells from TNF toxicity at concentrations of a few nanograms per ml and interfered with the binding of both TNF-α and TNF-β to cells, when applied simultaneously with the cytokines. However, unlike crude preparations of the urinary proteins, the purified protein did not induce in cells a decrease in ability to bind TNF nor did it interfere with the binding of interleukin-1 to its receptor. Direct, specific binding to the protein of TNF-α and, to a lesser extent, also TNF-β, but not of interleukin-1 nor interferon-γ could be demonstrated. It is suggested that this protein blocks the function of TNF by competing for TNF with the TNF receptor and not by interacting with the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W2076795549,"In the Neurospora genome duplicate sequences are detected and altered in the sexual phase. Both copies of duplicate genes are inactivated at high frequency, whether or not they are linked. Restriction sites change, and affected sequences typically become heavily methylated. To characterize the alterations of the DNA, duplicated sequences were isolated before and after one or more sexual cycles. DNA sequencing and heteroduplex analyses demonstrated that the process (termed RIP) produces exclusively G-C to A-T mutations. Changes occur principally at sites where adenine is 3′ of the changed cytosine. A sequence duplicated at a distant site in the genome lost approximately 10 percent of its G-C pairs in one passage through a cross. A closely linked duplication of the same sequence that was passed twice through a cross lost about half of its G-C pairs. The results suggest a mechanism for the RIP process."
https://openalex.org/W2013576776,"beta-Adrenergic agonists activate the G protein, Gs, which stimulates cardiac calcium currents by both cytoplasmic, indirect and membrane-delimited, direct pathways. To test whether beta-adrenergic agonists might use both pathways in the heart, isoproterenol was rapidly applied to cardiac myocytes, resulting in a biphasic increase in cardiac calcium channel currents that had time constants of 150 milliseconds and 36 seconds. beta-Adrenergic antagonists of a G protein inhibitor blocked both the fast and slow responses, whereas the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin produced only the slow response. The presence of a fast pathway in the heart can explain what the slow pathway cannot account for: the ability of cardiac sympathetic nerves to change heart rate within a single beat."
https://openalex.org/W1566391720,"Abstract The purpose of the present investigation was to purify a urine-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNF alpha INH) and to characterize its mechanism of action. For the purification procedure, urine was concentrated and TNF alpha INH purified by ion-exchange chromatographies, gel filtration, TNF alpha affinity column, and reverse-phase chromatography. The TNF alpha INH migrates with an apparent Mr of approximately 33,000 when estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Elution of TNF alpha INH activity from the gel yields also a approximately 33,000-Da inhibitory fraction. Besides inhibiting TNF alpha-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells in the presence of actinomycin D, the TNF alpha INH impeded in a dose-dependent manner prostaglandin E2 production and expression of cell-associated interleukin-1 by human dermal fibroblasts. Therefore, TNF alpha INH is active on both actinomycin D-treated and untreated cells. In contrast to TNF alpha, TNF beta-induced cytotoxicity was only slightly affected by the inhibitor. This specificity was confirmed by the fact that it affected neither interleukin-1 alpha nor interleukin-1 beta biologic activities. The mechanism of action of TNF alpha INH involves blocking of 125I-TNF alpha binding to the promonocytic cell line U937. Moreover, preincubation of 125I-TNF alpha with TNF alpha INH increased binding inhibition, suggesting an interaction between TNF alpha and the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1534028861,"Phospholamban is the major membrane protein of the heart phosphorylated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. In cell-free systems, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes exclusive phosphorylation of serine 16 of phospholamban, whereas Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gives exclusive phosphorylation of threonine 17 (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, J. L., Wegener, A. D., and Jones, L. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333–13341). In this work we have localized the sites of phospholamban phosphorylation in intact ventricles treated with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Isolation of phosphorylated phospholamban from 32P-perfused guinea pig ventricles, followed by partial acid hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis, revealed phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues. At steady state after isoproterenol exposure, phospholamban contained approximately equimolar amounts of these two phosphoamino acids. Two major tryptic phosphopeptides containing >90% of the incorporated radioactivity were obtained from phospholamban labeled in intact ventricles. The amino acid sequences of these two tryptic peptides corresponded exactly to residues 14–25 and 15–25 of canine cardiac phospholamban, thus localizing the sites of in situ phosphorylation to serine 16 and threonine 17. Phosphorylation of phospholamban at two sites in heart perfused with isoproterenol was supported by detection of 11 distinct mobility forms of the pentameric protein by use of the Western blotting method, consistent with each phospholamban monomer containing two phosphorylation sites, and with each pentamer containing from 0 to 10 incorporated phosphates. Our results localize the sites of in situ phospholamban phosphorylation to serine 16 and threonine 17 and, furthermore, are consistent with the phosphorylations of these 2 residues being catalyzed by cAMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1963847700,"Insulin receptor complementary DNA has been cloned from an insulin-resistant individual whose receptors have impaired tyrosine protein kinase activity. One of this individual's alleles has a mutation in which valine is substituted for Gly996, the third glycine in the conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif in the putative binding site fo adenosine triphosphate. Expression of the mutant receptor by transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells confirmed that the mutation impairs tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586111947,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor is a single membrane-spanning polypeptide of 180,000 daltons with a ligand-stimulatable tyrosine kinase site. We have investigated changes in the structure and association state of the receptor that are induced by ligand binding, but which precede autophosphorylation. Chemical cross-linking of PDGF-bound 32P-labeled receptor and 125I-PDGF-labeled receptor resulted in the generation of a radiolabeled cross-linked complex of 370–390 kDa. This band, as well as the 180–190-kDa PDGF receptor band, were recognized by a PDGF receptor-specific antipeptide antibody. The appearance of the 370–390-kDa band was PDGF-dependent and was seen irrespective of whether the receptor was membrane-bound, solubilized, or highly (∼90%) purified. Sedimentation analysis of the 125I-PDGF cross-linked receptor showed that both 180–190- and 370–390-kDa labeled species sedimented as a single peak at about 11.5 S, a position expected of a receptor dimer, demonstrating that the liganded receptor exists essentially as a dimer. In contrast, unliganded receptors sedimented as a single species at 7 S, a position consistent with a monomeric structure. The monomer-dimer interconversion was absolutely ligand-dependent and occurred independent of autophosphorylation. These results demonstrate and intimate correlation between PDGF binding and inter-receptor bond formation, and raise the possibility that the phenomenon may be causally linked to the process of kinase activation."

https://openalex.org/W1522513618,"Abstract Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin I into the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. We have used cDNA and genomic sequences to assemble a composite cDNA, ACE.315, encoding the entire amino acid sequence of mouse converting enzyme. ACE.315 contains 4838 base pairs and encodes a protein of 1278 amino acids (147.4 kDa) after removal of a 34-amino acid signal peptide. Within the protein, there are two large areas of homologous sequence, each containing a potential Zn-binding region and catalytic site. These homologous regions are approximately half the size of the whole ACE protein and suggest that the modern ACE gene is the duplicated product of a precursor gene. Mouse ACE is 83% homologous to human ACE in both nucleic acid and amino acid sequence, and like human ACE, contains a hydrophobic region in the carboxyl terminus that probably anchors the enzyme to the cell membrane (Soubrier, F., Alhenc-Gelas, F., Hubert, C., Allegrini, J., John, M., Tregear, G., and Corvol, P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 9386-9390). Northern analysis of mouse kidney, lung, and testis RNA demonstrates that the testicular isozyme of ACE is encoded by a single, smaller RNA (2500 bases) than the two message sizes found in kidney or lung (4900 and 4150 bases), and that this testicular RNA hybridizes to the 3' portion of ACE.315."
https://openalex.org/W1597308548,"Hepatocytes isolated from adult fasted rats and cultured in the presence of thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, and in a serum-free medium conserve the essentials of their differentiated function and hormonal sensitivity for at least 1 week. In these cells, the gene for L-type pyruvate kinase is expressed only when glucose and insulin are present together, each of them being inactive by itself. Inhibition of the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene which occurs when glucose and/or insulin are removed from the culture medium is not associated with accumulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA, which argues against the involvement of intracellular cyclic AMP in this phenomenon. Rather, a transcriptional activator, derived from carbohydrate metabolism and accumulating in the presence of insulin, seems to be needed to support the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene. Glucagon, in vitro as in vivo, inhibits production of the L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs. In addition to their roles on the production of these mRNAs, glucose and insulin on the one hand and glucagon on the other have profound effects on the stability of the L-type pyruvate kinase messengers: the half-life of the mRNA whose production has been blocked by actinomycin D is 1 h in the presence of glucagon and 24 h in the presence of glucose and insulin. Glucagon and glucose/insulin partially antagonize each other's effect on mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1498627601,"Previous studies have shown 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3)-responsive alkaline phosphatase in cultured growth zone cartilage chondrocytes is localized in extracellular matrix vesicles (MV). Since osteoblast-like cells also have 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive alkaline phosphatase, this study determined whether the 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive enzyme activity is localized to MV produced by these cells as well. Osteoblast-like cells from rat (ROS 17/2.8), mouse (MC 3T3), human (MG 63), and rat growth zone cartilage were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10(-7)-10(-12) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Alkaline phosphatase total activity and specific activity were measured in the cell layer, MV, and plasma membrane (PM) fractions. MV and PM purity were verified by electron microscopy and MV alkaline phosphatase specific activity compared to PM (MV versus PM: ROS 17/2.8 6 x; MG 63, 5.5 x; MC 3T3, 33 x; GC, 2 x). There was a dose-dependent stimulation of MV alkaline phosphatase (5- to 15-fold increase at 10(-7)-10(-9) M) in all cell types in response to the 1,25-(OH)2D3. The PM enzyme was stimulated in a parallel fashion in the osteoblast cultures. No effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was observed in growth cartilage PM. Although MV accounted for less than 20% of the total activity they contributed 50% of the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the cell layer in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and MV specific activity was enriched 10 times over that of the cell layer. These are common features of MV produced by cells which calcify their matrix and suggest that hormonal regulation of MV enzymes may be important in primary calcification."
https://openalex.org/W1524337940,"Chemical agents which activate specific kinases were employed to disrupt the stress fiber and focal adhesion organization of cells spread on a substratum. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, promoted a rapid loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions from African green monkey kidney (BSC-1) cells. This was paralleled by an increase in the level of talin phosphorylation suggesting that this may play a role in the removal of talin from focal adhesions. Similar morphological changes were produced in the rat embryo fibroblast line (REF 52) by dibutyryl-cAMP, which stimulates protein kinase A. In contrast, however, the phosphorylation of talin was reduced in REF 52 cells when treated with dibutyryl cAMP. In untreated cells we found that the levels of vinculin phosphorylation were very low relative to the levels of talin phosphorylation and did not change following drug treatment in either cell line. Although limited proteolytic cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins represents a potential mechanism for focal adhesion disruption, we observed no proteolysis of talin or vinculin in response to either drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1549022612,"It has been suggested that resident ovarian macrophages may play a role in the regulation of ovarian function through local paracrine secretion of regulatory molecule(s). It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to evaluate the potential ovarian relevance of one such macrophage product, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). To this end, use was made of a primary culture system of rat ovarian granulosa cells, the functional status of which was monitored by the acquisition of estrogen, progestin, and proteoglycan biosynthetic capacity. Whereas treatment with the gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a potent functional regulator, resulted in a substantial increase in the extent of aromatization (conversion of androgenic steroid precursors to estrogens), concomitant exposure to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) produced significant (p"
https://openalex.org/W1590338480,"alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors recognize a number of molecules with diverse chemical structures, including the yohimban diastereoisomers yohimbine and rauwolscine, catecholamines, guanidinium analogs, and imidazolines, such as clonidine. The affinity of the receptor protein for some of these ligands can vary by 10-100-fold among various tissues and species, suggesting a heterogeneous class of binding sites. Certain cellular effects elicited by the compounds possessing an imidazoline or guanidinium moiety may actually be mediated by a membrane receptor distinct from the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. To determine whether this imidazoline/guanidinium receptive site (IGRS) and the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor represent distinct proteins, we solubilized and partially characterized the two binding sites in rabbit kidney. This tissue expresses both alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and high affinity imidazoline/guanidinium binding sites, the latter which are rauwolscine-insensitive but can be identified with the benzodioxan [3H]idazoxan. The IGRS and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in rabbit kidney exhibit distinct ligand recognition properties, which are maintained after solubilization and partial purification. In addition, the two receptors can be physically separated by heparin-agarose or lectin affinity chromatography indicating that the two binding sites are distinct entities. [3H]Idazoxan binding is trypsin-sensitive, indicating that the IGRS is a protein rather than a lipid component of the plasma membrane. [3H]Idazoxan binding is not inhibited by endogenous agonists for known neurotransmitter receptors. However, the IGRS does recognize clonidine-displacing substance, a small non-catechol compound isolated from calf brain, suggesting the existence of a previously uncharacterized hormonal/neurotransmitter receptor system."
https://openalex.org/W1569237019,"The type III transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor is a cell surface chondroitin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan that binds various forms of TGF-β with high affinity and specificity. Here, we have used a genetic approach to determine the requirement for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains for normal TGF-β receptor expression and the role that the receptor proteoglycan core and GAG chains play in TGF-β binding. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells defective in GAG synthesis express on their surface 110–130-kDa type III receptor proteoglycan cores that can bind normal levels of TGF-β compared to wild type CHO cells. The affinity of the receptor core for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in CHO cell mutants is similar to that of the TGF-β receptor proteoglycan forms present in wild type CHO cells or in CHO cell mutants that have been allowed to bypass their metabolic defect and express the wild type proteoglycan phenotype. The binding properties of TGF-β receptor types I and II in CHO cells and the growth-inhibitory response of CHO cell mutants to TGF-β are not impaired by the absence of GAG chains in the type III receptor. These results show that the GAG chains are dispensable for type III receptor expression on the cell surface, binding of TGF-β to the receptor core, and growth inhibitory response of the cells to TGF-β. The evidence also suggests that the type III receptor may act as a multifunctional proteoglycan able to bind TGF-β via the receptor core while performing another as yet unidentified function(s) via the GAG chains."
https://openalex.org/W1526170391,"The transposon Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance protein TetA is an integral membrane protein responsible for the export of tetracycline from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of the inner membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. From a plot of the average hydrophobicity along the sequence of this protein, a two-dimensional membrane topology with 12 transmembrane domains may be predicted. Using plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli maxicells we specifically radiolabeled the TetA protein. The amino terminus of this membrane protein was shown not to be processed, and its location on the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane was demonstrated by a newly developed use of a chemical method. Spheroplasts and inside-out vesicles of the TetA protein synthesizing maxicells were subjected to limited digestion by proteases of different specificities. The TetA protein was not accessible to proteases from the periplasmic side. On the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane, the carboxyl terminus and four sites accessible to endoproteases could be identified. The cleavage sites are proposed to be localized between amino acid residues 60–70, 110–130, 180–200, and at amino acid 327. These results allow the definition of a model for the two-dimensional topology of the TetA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1533165142,"Three Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1)-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants do not grow in 100% O2 in rich medium and require Met and Lys when grown in air (Bilinski, T., Krawiec, Z., Liczmanski, A., and Litwinska, J. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 533-539). We show herein that medium manganese (II) accumulated by the mutants rescues these O2-sensitive phenotypes; 2 mM medium Mn2+ represented the threshold required for cell growth. The accumulation of Mn2+ was not oxygen-inducible since mutants grown aerobically and anaerobically accumulated the same amount of Mn2+. Mn2+ accumulation is not unique to these mutants since wild type accumulated almost twice as much Mn2+ as did mutant. ESR spectra of the cell extracts and whole cells loaded with Mn2+ were typical of free Mn(II) ion. These spectra could not account quantitatively for the total cellular Mn2+, however. A screen for soluble antioxidant activities in the Mn2+-supplemented cells detected O2- (superoxide) scavenging activity, with no change in catalase or peroxidase activities. This O2- scavenging activity was CN- and heat-resistant. No achromatic bands were revealed in nondenaturing gels of Mn2+- containing cell extracts stained for O2- scavenging activity. The Mn2+-dependent O2- scavenging activity in the cell extracts was quenched by EDTA and dialyzable. More than 60% of both the intracellular Mn2+ and the O2- scavenging activity was removed by 2-h dialysis. Dialyzed cells were not viable in air unless resupplemented with either Met or Mn2+. Although Mn2+ supported the aerobic growth of these mutants, excess Mn2+, which correlated with an elevated O2- scavenging activity, was toxic to both mutant and wild type. The results indicate that free or loosely bound Mn2+ ion protects the mutants against oxygen stress by providing an intracellular, presumably cytosolic, O2- scavenging activity which replaces the absent SOD-1."
https://openalex.org/W1598899386,"Abstract We previously observed that dexamethasone had a biphasic effect on the levels of mRNA encoding the major surfactant protein (SP-A) in human fetal lung in vitro; at concentrations of 10(-10) and 10(-9) M, dexamethasone caused an increase in the levels of SP-A mRNA, whereas at concentrations of greater than 10(-8) M, the steroid had a pronounced inhibitory effect on SP-A mRNA levels. It was also found that dexamethasone antagonized the stimulatory effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) on SP-A mRNA levels in human fetal lung in vitro. It was our objective, in the present study, to characterize further the effects of dexamethasone and Bt2cAMP on SP-A mRNA levels in human fetal lung tissue and to determine whether such effects are associated with comparable changes in the transcriptional activity of the SP-A gene. We found that the action of dexamethasone (10(-7) M) to reduce the levels of SP-A mRNA in control and Bt2cAMP-treated fetal lung explants was evident within 2 h of its addition to the culture medium; SP-A mRNA was reduced to barely detectable levels in control and in Bt2cAMP-treated tissues after 24 h of dexamethasone treatment. The action of dexamethasone to reduce SP-A mRNA levels was not prevented by co-incubation with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. In contrast to its dose-related biphasic effects on the levels of SP-A mRNA, we found that dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent stimulation of SP-A gene transcription. Bt2cAMP also increased the transcriptional activity of the SP-A gene in the human fetal lung in vitro. In fetal lung explants incubated in the presence of dexamethasone plus Bt2cAMP, a synergistic induction of SP-A gene transcription was observed at concentrations of dexamethasone of 10(-9)-10(-7) M. Our findings are indicative that the stimulatory effects of dexamethasone (10(-10)-10(-9) M) on SP-A mRNA levels are reflective of a stimulatory effect of the steroid on SP-A gene transcription, whereas the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone (10(-7) M) on SP-A mRNA levels are the result of a dominant effect of the steroid in elevated concentrations to reduce SP-A mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1528585302,"Abstract We have investigated the effects of hyperosmolarity induced by sucrose on the fluid phase endocytosis of the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow CH (LY) and the endocytosis of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) by the galactosyl receptor system in isolated rat hepatocytes. Continuous uptake of LY by cells at 37 degrees C is biphasic, occurs for 3-4 h, and then plateaus. Permeabilized cells or crude membranes do not bind LY at 4 or 37 degrees C. Intact cells also do not accumulate LY at 4 degrees C. The rate and extent of LY accumulation are concentration- and energy-dependent, and internalized LY is released from permeabilized cells. Efflux of internalized LY from washed cells is also biphasic and occurs with halftimes of approximately 38 and 82 min. LY is taken up into vesicles throughout the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region with a distribution pattern typical of the endocytic pathway. LY, therefore, behaves as a fluid phase marker in hepatocytes. LY has no effect on the uptake of 125I-ASOR at 37 degrees C. The rate of LY uptake by cells in suspension is not affected for at least 30 min by up to 0.2 M sucrose. The rate of endocytosis of 125I-ASOR, however, is progressively inhibited by increasing the osmolality of the medium with sucrose (greater than 98% with 0.2 M sucrose; Oka and Weigel (1988) J. Cell. Biochem. 36, 169-183). Hyperosmolarity completely inhibits endocytosis of 125I-ASOR by the galactosyl receptor, whereas fluid phase endocytosis of LY is unaffected. Cultured hepatocytes contained about 100 coated pits/mm of apical membrane length as assessed by transmission electron microscopy. In the presence of 0.4 M sucrose, only 17 coated pits/mm of membrane were observed, an 83% decrease. Only a few percent of the total cellular fluid phase uptake in hepatocytes is due to the coated pit endocytic pathway. We conclude that the fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytic processes must operate via two separate pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1590179486,"A substantial fraction (20-30%) of the bovine rod outer segment phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity is not associated with outer segment membranes prepared with buffers of moderate ionic strength; this PDE activity appears to represent a distinct, soluble isozyme. Although this PDE isozyme can be demonstrated to be present in sealed rod outer segments, it is discarded from most standard rod outer segment preparations. A method was developed that allowed the rapid purification of the soluble rod PDE by 2600-fold, to apparent homogeneity, using a monoclonal antibody column (ROS-1a). The soluble rod PDE isozyme has a novel Mr = 15,000 subunit (delta) in addition to subunits of Mr = 88,000 (alpha sol), 84,000 (beta sol), and 11,000 (gamma sol). The delta subunit comigrates with and may be identical to the cone PDE 15-kDa subunit. The small subunits of the soluble rod PDE and the membrane-associated rod PDE were isolated by reverse-phase chromatography. The gamma sol subunit was a potent inhibitor of trypsin-activated rod PDE, inhibiting 50% of 1 pM PDE activity at a concentration of 11 pM. This concentration was similar to that observed for the gamma subunit of the membrane-associated rod PDE. The purified delta subunit did not appear to affect PDE activity; this subunit was, however, unusually difficult to keep in solution. All of the kinetic and physical properties of the soluble rod PDE tested thus far are similar to those of the membrane-associated form, except for the presence of the delta subunit, suggesting that this unique subunit could mediate the solubility of the soluble rod PDE and the cone PDE in the intact photoreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W2102732182,"Seven bacteriophage T4-encoded proteins reconstitute a DNA replication apparatus that catalyzes coupled leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at a replication fork in vitro. The proteins involved are the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (the products of T4 genes 43, 44/62, and 45), a helix-destabilizing (SSB) protein (gene 32 protein), and the T4 primosome which is composed of a DNA helicase (gene 41 protein) and a primase (gene 61 protein). We show here that the presence of 41 protein on the lagging strand of the fork enables the polymerase holoenzyme to catalyze leading strand DNA synthesis at a maximum rate and with high processivity. This leading strand synthesis is unaffected by the addition of either the gene 32 or the gene 61 protein; the 41 protein cannot be replaced by the dda protein, a second T4-encoded DNA helicase. When the 61 protein is added to the 41 protein to complete the primosome, Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand accompanies leading strand DNA synthesis in this system even in the absence of the 32 protein. However, the addition of 32 protein decreases the size of the Okazaki fragments made, as expected for an increase in the lagging strand polymerization rate at a fork that has coupled leading and lagging strand DNA polymerase molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1515287375,"An amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel is found in the apical plasma membrane of high resistance, Na+ transporting epithelia. We have developed a method for the identification of this channel based on the use of a new high affinity photoreactive amiloride analog, 2'-methoxy-5'-nitrobenzamil (NMBA), and anti-amiloride antibodies to identify photolabeled polypeptides. NMBA specifically labels the putative Na+ channel in bovine kidney microsomes. A 130-kDa polypeptide is detected on immunoblots with anti-amiloride antibodies. NMBA is a potent inhibitor of Na+ transport in the established amphibian kidney epithelial cell line A6, and specifically labels a 130-kDa polypeptide. We utilized both NMBA photolabeling and [3H]benzamil binding in order to examine the cellular pool of putative channels following hormonal regulation of Na+ transport. This pool is not significantly altered by the mineralocorticoid agonist aldosterone or antagonist spironolactone, despite a 3.8-fold difference in transepithelial Na+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W1519303101,"Abstract We report the presence of truncated forms of the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFRt) in the conditioned medium of the human melanoma cell line A875 and in human urine and amniotic fluid. Radioiodinated nerve growth factor (125I-NGF) specifically bound to NGFRt was chemically cross-linked. After immunoprecipitation, labeled receptor species were visualized by autoradiography following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NGFRts were purified from human adult male urine or a mixture of human amniotic fluid and infant urine by using a combination of either ion exchange chromatography (adult) or ammonium sulfate precipitation (infant) and immunoaffinity chromatography. Typical yields were about 1 microgram/liter of adult urine and 75 micrograms/liter of amniotic fluid/infant urine. The purified proteins, with molecular masses of 45, 40, and 35 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), were confirmed to be NGFRts by amino-terminal sequencing and were designated NGFRt-1, NGFRt-2, and NGFRt-3, respectively. The isoelectric points of these three species ranged from 3.3 to 3.95 and displayed intraspecies heterogeneity; subsequently, amino acid residues covalently modified with sialic acid-containing carbohydrates were documented. The binding affinities of these species for nerve growth factor were comparable to that of the low affinity cell surface receptor.

The structural gene for the enzyme was subcloned from pSK750 (Kanaya, S., and Crouch, R. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1276-1281) to make a plasmid vector pPL801, in which the gene was under the control of bacteriophage lambda PL promoter. Thermal induction of the gene accumulated the enzyme in E. coli N4830-1 to approximately 8% of the total cytosolic protein. The level of production of the enzyme in N4830-1 harboring pPL801 was 14 mg/liter culture, which was 3000 times as high as that in the host cell. The enzyme was purified with a yield of more than 80% and crystallized by utilizing the property that the solubility of the enzyme decreased at pH values close to its isoelectric point (pI = 9). Crystals were grown by successive seeding (hanging drop method) for x-ray crystallographic analysis. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of alpha = 44.1 A, b = 87.0 A, c = 35.5 A and contain one molecule in an asymmetric unit. They diffracted x-rays beyond 2.5 A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1567207102,"Abstract The F0 portion of the rat liver mitochondrial ATP synthase (F0F1-ATPase) has been purified by a rapid, high yield procedure. F0 is selectively extracted from inner membrane vesicles with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) after prior treatment of the vesicles with guanidine HCl to remove F1. The resultant F0 is functional in proton translocation assays and separates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four major and three minor Coomassie-stainable bands, all with apparent molecular masses below 30 kDa. This CHAPS-purified F0 preparation was characterized in detail for its capacity to interact with the unique probe diethylstilbestrol (DES) which, depending on conditions, has been shown to interact with rat liver F0F1 to either inhibit or promote ATP hydrolysis (McEnery, M. W., and Pedersen, P.L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1745-1752). DES-inhibitory sensitivity could be conferred on F1-ATPase activity with the same concentration dependence on F0 as conferral of oligomycin sensitivity. DES was shown also to inhibit the magnitude of valinomycin induced proton influx, while initiating proton efflux in asolectin vesicles reconstituted with F0 and loaded with K+. The potency of DES in producing the latter effects was shown to be highly dependent on hydroxyl groups in para positions of the two benzene rings within the DES molecule. Finally, in the absence of F0, DES was shown to act as a catalyst of proton influx in K+-loaded asolectin vesicles upon addition of valinomycin. A model based on the structure of DES is presented to account for both the inhibitory and uncoupling properties of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1501863981,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein whose synthesis and secretion by mesenchymal cells is regulated at the level of gene transcription by platelet-derived growth factor. To examine the transcriptional regulation of the TSP gene at the molecular level, a genomic clone containing the human TSP promoter and flanking sequence was isolated and characterized. A 3.8-kilobase pair (kb) DNA fragment containing the first three exons, the first two introns, and 2.2 kb of 5′-flanking region was sequenced, and the site of transcription initiation was determined by both primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping. Consensus sequences for several potential regulatory elements were found in the 5′-flanking sequence, including a TATA box consensus sequence, TTTAAAA, located 24 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. A chimeric gene was constructed containing the first intron, the first exon, and 2.0 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the TSP gene fused to the promoterless gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. When transfected into COS-1 or NIH3T3 cells this gene construct was transcribed, indicating the presence of a functional promoter in the TSP sequence. Transient transfection studies using deletion mutants of this TSP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct were performed to locate cis-acting regulatory sequences. The deletion of flanking sequence 5′ to position −234 had little or no effect on transcriptional activity, whereas deletions of 5′-flanking sequence extending further in the 3′ direction resulted in the gradual loss of transcriptional activity. The removal of the first intron resulted in a 4-fold decrease in transcript levels, indicating the presence of a cis-acting positive element(s) in the first intron of the human TSP gene. This element(s) was further localized to the region between position +576 and position +727."

This locus is also part of the WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation). In one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. Comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. Sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the AN2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1560346609,"The structural requirements for oligomerization and the generation of a functional mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding site of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) were analyzed. Chemical cross-linking studies on affinity-purified CD-MPR and on solubilized membranes containing the receptor indicate that the CD-MPR exists as a homodimer. To determine whether dimer formation is necessary for the generation of a Man-6-P binding site, a cDNA coding for a truncated receptor consisting of only the signal sequence and the extracytoplasmic domain was constructed and expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The expressed protein was completely soluble, monomeric in structure, and capable of binding phosphomannosyl residues. Like the dimeric native receptor, the truncated receptor can release its ligand at low pH. Ligand blot analysis using bovine testes beta-galactosidase showed that the monomeric form of the CD-MPR from bovine liver and testes is capable of binding Man-6-P. These results indicate that the extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor contains all the information necessary for ligand binding as well as for acid-dependent ligand dissociation and that oligomerization is not required for the formation of a functional Man-6-P binding site. Several different mutant CD-MPRs were generated and expressed in X. laevis oocytes to determine what region of the receptor is involved in oligomerization. Chemical cross-linking analyses of these mutant proteins indicate that the transmembrane domain is important for establishing the quaternary structure of the CD-MPR."
https://openalex.org/W1537148716,"Abstract Carbamoylcholine (carbachol), histamine, and gastrin are three principal stimulants of gastric acid secretion. To explore the mechanisms by which these agents exert their actions in parietal cells, we examined their effects on the gene expression of the enzymes responsible for H+ generation. Each secretagogue induced rapid and coordinate increases in steady-state levels of mRNAs encoding carbonic anhydrase II and H+,K+-ATPase in isolated canine gastric parietal cells. Furthermore, pronounced increases, with different kinetics, in expression of beta-actin mRNA were observed. With increasing time after cell isolation, carbonic anhydrase II and H+,K+-ATPase, but not beta-actin, mRNA levels were attenuated, suggesting that parietal cell-specific genes may be dependent upon maintenance of parietal cell contacts within intact mucosal tissue. Pretreatment of the cells with competitive inhibitors of each secretagogue blocked the increases. Our results indicate that acid secretagogue-specific receptor activation in parietal cells triggers coordinate gene expression of the two enzymes involved in H+ ion generation and that beta-actin may be an important regulator of acid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1588399730,"Abstract There is considerable evidence which suggests that the gamma-subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE gamma) is a multifunctional protein which may interact directly with both the catalytic subunits of PDE (PDE alpha beta) and the alpha-subunit of transducin (T alpha) (Whalen, M., and Bitensky, M. (1989) Biochem. J. 259, 13-19; Griswold-Prenner, I., Young, J. H., Yamane, H. K., and Fung, B. K.-K. (1988) Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 29, (Suppl.) 218). To determine the region of interaction between the multifunctional PDE gamma and T alpha, and to determine the significance of this interaction, peptides corresponding to various regions of PDE gamma were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the GTPase activity of T alpha. One of these peptides, PDE gamma-3 (bovine amino acid residues 31-45), inhibited the GTPase activity of T alpha with an I50 of 450 microM. The peptide (PDE gamma-3) was found to inhibit the GTPase activity of T alpha by inducing the binding of transducin to the rod outer segment membrane and by altering the GTP/GDP exchange. Analogs of PDE gamma-3 were synthesized to determine the required structure of the PDE gamma-3 region needed for the interaction of PDE gamma with T alpha. The results of these studies indicated that the removal of the positively charged amino acids or any of the potential hydrogen-bonding amino acids increased the I50 for the inhibition of the GTPase activity of T alpha Substitution of the hydrophobic amino acids had no effect. These results indicate the hydrophilic interactions may be essential for the binding of PDE gamma to T alpha and for the inhibition of the GTPase activity of T alpha by PDE gamma. The observed effects of PDE gamma-3 on T alpha and on PDE suggest that PDE gamma is a multifunctional protein which may play more than one role in the deactivation of the retinal transduction cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1623886086,"Crystals of trimethylamine dehydrogenase have been examined by difference Fourier methods at 6.0-A resolution after partial reduction by substrate and by dithionite in the presence of inhibitor. Similar studies of the inhibited oxidized enzyme and of the enzyme reduced fully by dithionite alone were also carried out. In all cases ligand binding at the active site occurred. In addition, there were small structural changes, possibly side chain movements, in the inhibited oxidized enzyme and somewhat larger changes in the partially reduced crystals. The largest changes occurred with the fully reduced enzyme. However, in no cases were subunit or domain movements observed nor were changes observed in the position of the FMN or [4Fe-4S] cofactors. Parallel studies of crystalline trimethylamine dehydrogenase were carried out by EPR spectroscopy. The results show that the electronic states of the crystalline enzyme under the conditions of the difference Fourier studies are comparable to those which occur in solution under similar conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2101228347,"In quiescent Ha-ras-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, addition of serum growth factors, bombesin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) leads to a dimethylamiloride-sensitive intracellular alkalinization which can be inhibited by staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C. Expression of the transforming Ha-ras gene causes a growth factor-independent increase in cytoplasmic pH. This Ha-ras-induced alkalinization is sensitive to dimethylamiloride but is not affected by staurosporine concentrations which prevent the pH response after addition of growth factors or TPA. Protein kinase C depletion by long term exposure to TPA eliminates the pH response to bombesin and phorbol ester but does not effect the Ha-ras-induced intracellular alkalinization. It is concluded that expression of Ha-ras causes an activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter by an as yet unknown protein kinase C-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1583817241,"We wished to determine if a partial methylation profile for a specific CpG site was stably maintained in both mammalian tissues and cultured cell lines. To accomplish this, we identified a CpG site with a partial methylation profile located upstream of the mouse adenine phosphoribosyltransferase promoter region. This site was found to be methylated at a level of approximately 25% in mouse brain, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle tissues, at a level close to 50% in liver, and at level close to 0% in testis. These tissue-specific methylation profiles were not altered during aging. A methylation profile of approximately 25% at this CpG site was also observed in five mouse teratocarcinoma stem cell lines and one additional cultured cell line. This profile, however, was altered upon cellular differentiation, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase hemizygosity, and a loss of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in some of the cultured cell lines. We conclude that partial methylation of a specific CpG site can be stably maintained both in vivo and in vitro and that a mechanism exists for its maintenance. The functional significance of a partial methylation profile remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1564785334,"Abstract Human antithrombin III (AT-III) was partially reduced under mild conditions in the absence or presence of low molecular weight heparin. Quantitation of reduced disulfide bonds was facilitated by the application of a water-soluble color reagent, 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-iodoacetamido-2'-sulfonic acid (S-DABIA). The study shows that the three disulfide linkages of AT-III can be sequentially reduced, with Cys8-Cys128 being the most sensitive, followed by Cys21-Cys95, while Cys247-Cys430 is the most resistant to the mild reduction conditions. The rate of reduction of Cys8-Cys128 and Cys21-Cys95 was significantly decreased in the presence of heparin. The reduction of Cys8-Cys128 was also found to correlate quantitatively with the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity, heparin binding affinity, and heparin-induced fluorescence enhancement. These results suggest that Cys8-Cys128 is required for the integrity of the heparin binding domain of AT-III and support previous findings that lysyl residues surrounding Cys128 (Lys107, Lys114, Lys125, and Lys136) constitute an important part of the heparin binding site in AT-III."
https://openalex.org/W1514168331,"Abstract DNA topoisomerases II are nuclear enzymes that have been identified recently as targets for some of the most active anticancer drugs. Antitumor topoisomerase II inhibitors such as teniposide (VM-26) produce enzyme-induced DNA cleavage and inhibition of enzyme activity. By adding to such reactions distamycin, a compound whose effects on DNA have been extensively characterized, we investigated the effects of drug binding upon topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26. We have found a correspondence between distamycin binding (determined by footprinting analysis) and topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of SV40 DNA (determined by sequencing gel analysis). Distamycin binding potentiated the cleavage of specific sites in the near proximity of distamycin-binding sites (within at least 25 base pairs), which indicates that DNA secondary structure is involved in topoisomerase II-DNA interactions. That distamycin potentiated cleavage only at sites that were recognized in the absence of distamycin and suppressed cleavage directly at distamycin-binding sites indicates that topoisomerase II recognizes DNA on the basis of primary sequence. In addition, distamycin stimulated topoisomerase II-mediated DNA relaxation and antagonized the inhibitory effect of VM-26. These results show that the DNA sequence-specific binding of distamycin produces local and propagated effects in the DNA which markedly affect topoisomerase II activity."
https://openalex.org/W1538416713,"Diverse approaches that include site-directed mutagenesis have indicated a catalytic role of Lys-329 of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum. To determine whether Lys-329 is required for the initial enolization of ribulose bisphosphate or for some subsequent step in the overall reaction pathway, the competence of position 329 mutant proteins (devoid of carboxylase activity) in catalyzing exchange of solvent protons with the C-3 proton of substrate has now been examined. Irrespective of the amino acid substitution for Lys-329, the mutant protein retains 2–6% of the wild-type activity in the proton exchange reaction. The complete stability of ribulose bisphosphate during the enolization catalyzed by mutant protein suggests that the major effect of Lys-329 is to facilitate the addition of gaseous substrates (CO2 or O2) to the enediol intermediate. The exchange reaction requires Mg2+, is CO2-dependent, and is inhibited by the transition-state analogue 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. A mutant protein in which Lys-191, the site for carbamylation by CO2 in an obligatory activation step, is replaced by a cysteinyl residue totally lacks proton exchange activity. Barely detectable exchange activity (∼0.2% of wild-type) is displayed by the Lys-166 → Cys mutant protein, consistent with the previously implicated role of Lys-166 in the deprotonation of ribulose bisphosphate. Retention of exchange activity by the Glu-48 → Gln mutant protein, which is slightly active in overall carboxylation, demonstrates that active site Glu-48, like Lys-329, exerts its major effect at some step subsequent to the initial enolization."
https://openalex.org/W1567752272,"Previous studies have shown that the antiviral response induced by interferon in murine cells could be degraded after a heat shock. Here we have confirmed that a similar effect occurs also in interferon-treated human HeLa cells subjected to a heat shock. In addition, we have investigated the fate of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase in heat-shocked cells. This protein kinase is a Mr 68,000 protein (p68 kinase) which, when autophosphorylated, catalyzes phosphorylation of the protein synthesis eukaryotic initiation factor-2, thus mediating inhibition of protein synthesis. After heat shock of interferon-treated HeLa cells, the double-stranded RNA-dependent autophosphorylation of p68 kinase in cytoplasmic extracts is greatly reduced whereas the phosphorylation of other cellular proteins is not affected. In vivo, autophosphorylation of p68 kinase is also reduced in heat-shocked cells whereas there is no apparent effect on the phosphorylation state of other proteins. In such cells, the interferon-mediated antiviral response becomes modified according to the virus challenge, i.e. these cells remain resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus but become partially sensitive to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. The reduction in the activity of p68 kinase is due to its reduced nonionic detergent solubility occurring during the heat shock period. The resultant reduced detergent extractibility of p68 kinase is dependent on the intensity of the thermal stress. In contrast to the effect after a heat shock, arsenite treatment of interferon-treated HeLa cells induces heat shock proteins, but neither modifies the antiviral response nor affects the extractibility of p68 kinase. These results indicate that the degradation of the anti-EMCV response and reduced p68 kinase activity occur in response to heat treatment independently of the induction of heat shock proteins. The role of p68 kinase in the mechanism of the antiviral response against EMCV and vesicular stomatitis virus is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569347737,"Abstract The modification of avian phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents leads to inhibition. The inhibition is related to the loss of 1 highly reactive cysteine residue of the 13 cysteines present in the enzyme. Inhibition by reagents which yield a mixed disulfide was rapidly reversed by thiols. Reagents specific for vicinal sulfhydryl configurations were not potent inhibitors. The cysteine-modified enzyme continues to bind Mn2+ with the same stoichiometry and dissociation constant as the native enzyme. All of the substrates also bind to thiol-modified inactive enzyme. The modification of the reactive cysteine with the spin-labeled iodoacetate derivative leads to inactive enzyme with spin label stoichiometrically incorporated. The EPR spectrum showed an immobilized spin label on the enzyme. EPR studies of the perturbation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bound spin label by bound Mn2+ showed a dipolar interaction between the two spins, estimated to be 10 A apart. The perturbation of the 1/T1 and 1/T2 values of the 31P resonances of ITP by spin-labeled enzyme indicates that this portion of the nucleotide binds 8-10 A from the spin label. These results indicate that the reactive cysteine is close to but not at the active site of the enzyme. The thiol group must be free and in its reduced form for the enzyme to be active. Perhaps modification of this group prevents conformational change(s) upon ligand binding necessary for the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1598088085,"Abstract p72 high affinity receptors (Fc gamma RI) for the Fc portion of IgG molecules on human peripheral blood monocytes mediate a variety of beneficial functions, but also have deleterious effects in certain clinical situations. In the present study, the photosensitizing porphyrins hematoporphyrin derivative and dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE), which are known to preferentially affect the cell membrane, were found to significantly inhibit binding of mouse IgG2a antibodies to the ligand binding site of Fc gamma RI on human peripheral blood monocytes and the U937 human monocytic cell line. Fc gamma RI receptors could be identified with a monoclonal antibody which recognizes an epitope distinct from the ligand binding site, indicating that photosensitization induced a structural alteration rather than loss of the receptor molecule from the cell surface. The effect of DHE and light appeared to be highly specific, since binding of monoclonal antibodies to other surface structures was not decreased. DHE plus light-induced modulation of Fc gamma RI was found to be mediated by superoxide anions, since addition of a mimic of superoxide dismutase restored both binding of mouse IgG2a to Fc gamma RI as well as human monocyte accessory cell function. These studies identify porphyrin photosensitization as a unique mechanism by which to selectively down-regulate Fc gamma RI-mediated functions."

The desensitization was independent of agonist occupancy of the receptor, and the effects were blocked both by the active fragment (amino acids 5-22) of the specific inhibitor of cA.PK and by p[NH]ppA. cA.PKc treatment of kin- membranes resulted in a heterologous desensitization that resembled the effects of WT adenylyl cyclase, with the exception that forskolin-stimulated activity was also reproducibly decreased by 24%. cA.PKc had no effect on WT membranes isolated from cells that had previously undergone maximal heterologous desensitization during treatment with 10 microM forskolin. In contrast, cA.PKc-induced heterologous desensitization of kin- membranes was additive with the epinephrine-induced homologous desensitization of intact cells. Cell-free desensitizations were reversed by incubation of membranes with cA.PKc and ADP, conditions that drive the kinase reaction backward. The similarities of our cell-free cA.PKc-mediated heterologous desensitization of adenylyl cyclase with the intact cell desensitization support our hypothesis that heterologous desensitization of the WT lymphoma cells is mediated by cA.PK via a mechanism independent of homologous desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1585199012,"Abstract ATP sulfurylase from Penicillium chrysogenum is a homohexamer that contains three free sulfhydryl groups/subunit, only one of which (designated SH-1) can be modified by disulfide, maleimide, and halide reagents under nondenaturing conditions. Modification of SH-1 has only a small effect on kcat but causes the [S]0.5 values for MgATP and SO4(2-) (or MoO4(2-) to increase by an order of magnitude. Additionally, the velocity curves become sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient (nH) of about 2 (Renosto, F., Martin, R. L., and Segel, I. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16279-16288). Direct equilibrium binding measurements confirmed that [32P]MgATP binds to the SH-modified enzyme in a positively cooperative fashion (nH = 2.0) if a sulfate subsite ligand (e.g. FSO3-) is also present. [35S]Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) binding to the SH-modified enzyme displayed positive cooperativity (nH = 1.9) in the absence of a PPi subsite ligand. The results indicate that positive cooperativity requires occupancy of the adenylyl and sulfate (but not the pyrophosphate) subsites. [35S]APS binding to the native enzyme displayed negative cooperativity (or binding to at least two classes of sites). Isotope trapping profiles for the single turnover of [35S]APS: (a) confirmed the equilibrium binding curves, (b) indicated that all six sites/hexamer are catalytically active, and (c) showed that APS does not dissociate at a significant rate from E.APS.PPi. The MgPPi concentration dependence of [35S]APS trapping was indicative of MgPPi binding to two classes of sites on both the native and SH-modified enzyme. Inactivation of the native or SH-modified enzyme by phenylglyoxal in the presence of saturating APS was biphasic. The semilog plots suggested that only half of the sites were highly protected. The cumulative data suggest a model in which pairs of sites or subunits can exist in three different states designated HH (both sites have a high APS affinity, as in the native free enzyme), LL (both sites have a low APS affinity as in the SH-modified enzyme), and LH (as in the APS-occupied native or SH-modified enzyme). Thus, the HH----LH transition displays negative cooperativity for APS binding while the LL----LH transition displays positive cooperativity. The relative reactivities of like-paired SH-reactive reagents were in the order: N-phenylmaleimide greater than N-ethylmaleimide; dithionitropyridine greater than dithionitrobenzoate; thiolyte-MQ greater than thiolyte-MB. The log kmod versus pH curve indicates that the pKa of SH-1 is greater than 9.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1493113589,"The issue as to whether there is direct phosphodiesteratic cleavage of phosphatidylinositol (PI), in addition to that of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), on agonist stimulation of cells has been controversial. In an attempt to resolve this issue, we have studied the kinetics of the formation and breakdown of the cyclic inositol phosphates. This approach is fairly straightforward, since the turnover of the cyclic inositol phosphates is very slow as compared to that of the noncyclic inositol phosphates and proceeds from inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate (I(c1:2)P) directly by dephosphorylation without any branching pathways, in contrast to the multiple branchpoints of the noncyclic inositol phosphate pathway. Mouse pancreatic minilobules were prelabeled with [3H]inositol for 30 min, followed by washing to remove free inositol. They were then stimulated with carbachol for 30 min. The inositol cyclic polyphosphates reached steady state at 10-15 min, and I(c1:2)P reached steady state at 25 min. We blocked the action of carbachol by addition of an excess of atropine at 30 min, and the rate of disappearance of the three cyclic inositol phosphates was measured. From these data, the contribution of the inositol cyclic polyphosphate pathway to I(c1:2)P was calculated, which was 40-50% of total I(c1:2)P formation. Thus, 40-50% of the I(c1:2)P formed must have been derived from direct phosphodiesteratic cleavage of PI. This approach should prove useful in measuring the relative contributions of PI hydrolysis and PI phosphorylation (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis) in the overall PI cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1482018775,"Abstract GTP-binding proteins have been implicated as transducers of a variety of biological signaling processes. These proteins share considerable structural as well as functional homology. Due to these similarities, it was thought that a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the light activation of the rod outer segment GTP-binding protein, tranducin (Gt), might exert some functional effect upon the G proteins that regulate the adenylate cyclase system. Antibody 4A, raised against the alpha subunit of Gt, cross-reacted (by hybridization on nitrocellulose) with purified alpha subunits of other G proteins (Gi and Gs, regulatory guanyl nucleotide-binding proteins that mediate inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase, respectively) as long as they were not denatured. This antibody, which interferes with rod outer segment cGMP phosphodiesterase activation by blocking interaction between rhodopsin and Gt, also interfered with actions of both the stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins of adenylate cyclase from rat cerebral cortex membranes. Effects of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4A were dose-dependent and not reversed by washing. mAb 4A also blocked the Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase in the cyc- variant of S49 lymphoma and in doing so raised the level of adenylate cyclase activity in both the cyc- variant and the S49 wild type. There was no effect of mAb 4A on adenylate cyclase activity of the resolved catalytic subunit. These results suggest that the well known sequence homologies among the G proteins involved in cellular signal transduction may extend to the sites that interact with other members of signal-transducing cascades (receptors and effector molecules). Therefore, antibody 4A may serve as a useful tool to probe the similarities and differences among the various systems."
https://openalex.org/W1883013626,"Abstract The Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H+-ATPase is inactivated by the periodate-oxidized nucleotides, oATP, oADP, and oAMP, with oAMP the most effective. Inhibition of the ATPase is essentially irreversible, because Sephadex G-50 column chromatography of the oAMP-treated ATPase does not result in a reversal of the inhibition. Inhibition of the ATPase by oAMP is protected against by the H+-ATPase substrate ATP, the product ADP, and the competitive inhibitors TNP (2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidine)-ATP and TNP-ADP, suggesting that oAMP inhibition occurs at the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. The rate of inactivation of the ATPase by oAMP is only slightly affected by EDTA, indicating that the oAMP interaction with the nucleotide binding site of the H+-ATPase occurs in the absence of a divalent cation. The protection against oAMP inhibition by ADP is likewise unaffected by EDTA. The inhibition of the ATPase by oAMP is absolutely dependent on the presence of acidic phospholipids or acidic lysophospholipids known to be required for H+-ATPase activity, suggesting that these lipids either aid in the formation of the nucleotide binding site or render it accessible. Incubation of the ATPase with Mg2+ plus vanadate, which locks the enzyme in a conformation resembling the transition state of the enzyme dephosphorylation reaction, completely protects against inhibition by oAMP, suggesting that in this transition state conformation the nucleotide site either does not exist, or is inaccessible to oAMP. Labeling studies with [14C] oAMP indicate that the incorporation of 1 mol of oAMP is sufficient to cause complete inactivation of the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1526401521,"Abstract Cellular transcriptional activator sequences from a Syrian hamster cell line (baby hamster kidney (BHK] were rescued by a double selection procedure. An enhancer-deficient SV40 promoter was linked to the neomycin resistance (NEO) gene and transfected into BHK cells. Genomic DNA fragments of G418-resistant cell clones containing multiple copies of integrated plasmid DNAs were used for a second transfection of BHK cells, resulting in the genomic integration of a single copy plasmid which expresses the NEO gene efficiently. For rapid cloning of the integrated promoter and adjacent cellular DNA sequences, these cell clones were fused to COS-1 cells, thereby providing SV40 large T antigen and the monkey cell permissive factor necessary for SV40 replication. Resulting from this fusion, the integrated plasmid and adjacent sequences were amplified to about 1000 extrachromosomal copies giving rise to an abundant pool of promoter elements which thus can be cloned into a plasmid very easily for further investigations. Promoter analyses of three clones in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transient expression assay demonstrated that the recombination with cellular DNA enables the initially defective SV40 promoter to express at wild type levels."

Phosphorylase activation by alpha-adrenergic agonists is sustained over 20-30 min of agonist exposure, whereas histamine exposure only transiently activates phosphorylase during the initial 5 min of stimulation. The initial activation of phosphorylase by either receptor is not attenuated by treated cells with Ca2+-deficient and [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid-supplemented buffer, whereas the response to sustained adrenergic stimulation depends largely, but not totally, upon extracellular Ca2+. The involvement of protein kinase C in agonist responses was tested by treating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibits receptor-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (IC50 = 3.6 nM) yet activates phosphorylase independently of agonist. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate has no effect on cellular 45Ca2+ fluxes in the absence of agonist. Thus, the two receptors coordinately regulate intracellular signaling through Ca2+- and protein kinase C-mediated pathways. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptors elicit sustained phosphorylase activation whereas H1-histaminergic receptors desensitize."
