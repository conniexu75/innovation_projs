https://openalex.org/W2101357408,"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2162612236,"Magnetic devices are a leading contender for the implementation of memory and logic technologies that are non-volatile, that can scale to high density and high speed, and that do not wear out. However, widespread application of magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current and power. There has been considerable recent progress in this effort; in particular, it has been discovered that spin-orbit interactions in heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers can produce strong current-driven torques on the magnetic layer, via the spin Hall effect in the heavy metal or the Rashba-Edelstein effect in the ferromagnet. In the search for materials to provide even more efficient spin-orbit-induced torques, some proposals have suggested topological insulators, which possess a surface state in which the effects of spin-orbit coupling are maximal in the sense that an electron's spin orientation is fixed relative to its propagation direction. Here we report experiments showing that charge current flowing in-plane in a thin film of the topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) at room temperature can indeed exert a strong spin-transfer torque on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni81Fe19) thin film, with a direction consistent with that expected from the topological surface state. We find that the strength of the torque per unit charge current density in Bi2Se3 is greater than for any source of spin-transfer torque measured so far, even for non-ideal topological insulator films in which the surface states coexist with bulk conduction. Our data suggest that topological insulators could enable very efficient electrical manipulation of magnetic materials at room temperature, for memory and logic applications."

https://openalex.org/W2094961834,"The principles of the 3Rs, Replacement, Reduction and Refinement, are being increasingly incorporated into legislations, guidelines and practice of animal experiments in order to safeguard animal welfare. In the present study we have studied the systematic application of 3R principles to toxicological research in the pharmaceutical industry, with particular focus on achieving reductions in animal numbers used in regulatory and investigatory in vivo studies. The work also details major factors influencing these reductions including the conception of ideas, cross-departmental working and acceptance into the work process. Data from 36 reduction projects were collected retrospectively from work between 2006 and 2010. Substantial reduction in animal use was achieved by different strategies, including improved study design, method development and project coordination. Major animal savings were shown in both regulatory and investigative safety studies. If a similar (i.e. 53%) reduction had been achieved simultaneously within the twelve largest pharmaceutical companies, the equivalent reduction world-wide would be about 150,000 rats annually. The results point at the importance of a strong 3R culture, with scientific engagement, collaboration and a responsive management being vital components. A strong commitment in leadership for the 3R is recommended to be translated into cross-department and inter-profession involvement in projects for innovation, validation and implementation. Synergies between all the three Rs are observed and conclude that in silico-, in vitro- and in vivo-methods all hold the potential for applying the reduction R and should be consequently coordinated at a strategic level."

https://openalex.org/W2082078509,"To investigate demographic and clinical factors associated with employment in MS.The study included 213 (89.9%) of all MS patients in Sogn and Fjordane County, Western Norway at December 31st 2010. The patients underwent clinical evaluation, structured interviews and completed self-reported questionnaires. Demographic and clinical factors were compared between patients being employed versus patients being unemployed and according to disease course of MS. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with current employment.After a mean disease duration of almost 19 years, 45% of the population was currently full-time or part- time employed. Patients with relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS) had higher employment rate than patients with secondary (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS). Higher educated MS patients with lower age at onset, shorter disease duration, less severe disability and less fatigue were most likely to be employed.Nearly half of all MS patients were still employed after almost two decades of having MS. Lower age at onset, shorter disease duration, higher education, less fatigue and less disability were independently associated with current employment. These key clinical and demographic factors are important to understand the reasons to work ability in MS. The findings highlight the need for environmental adjustments at the workplace to accommodate individual 's needs in order to improve working ability among MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2135519336,"Background Emotion regulation theory aims to explain the interactions between individuals and the environment. In this context, Emotion Regulation Difficulties (ERD) disrupt the physiological component of emotions through the autonomic nervous system and are involved in several psychopathological states. Objective We were interested in comparing the influence of a film-elicited emotion procedure on the autonomic nervous system activity of two groups with different levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Methods A total of 63 women (undergraduate students) ranging from 18 to 27 (20.7±1.99) years old were included. Using the upper and lower quartile of a questionnaire assessing the daily difficulties in regulating emotions, two groups, one with low (LERD) and one with high (HERD) levels of emotion regulation difficulties, were constituted and studied during a film-elicited emotion procedure. Cardiac vagal activity (HF-HRV) was analyzed during three periods: baseline, film-elicited emotion, and recovery. Results The cardiovascular results showed a decrease in HF-HRV from baseline to elicitation for both groups. Then, from elicitation to recovery, HF-HRV increased for the LERD group, whereas a low HF-HRV level persisted for the HERD group. Conclusions The HERD group exhibited inappropriate cardiac vagal recovery after a negative emotion elicitation had ended. Cardiac vagal tone took longer to return to its initial state in the HERD group than in the LERD group. Prolonged cardiac vagal suppression might constitute an early marker of emotion regulation difficulties leading to lower cardiac vagal tone."

https://openalex.org/W2066143921,"Mortality and injuries caused by ship strikes in U.S. waters are a cause of concern for the endangered population of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) occupying the eastern North Pacific. We sought to determine which areas along the U.S. West Coast are most important to blue whales and whether those areas change inter-annually. Argos-monitored satellite tags were attached to 171 blue whales off California during summer/early fall from 1993 to 2008. We analyzed portions of the tracks that occurred within U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters and defined the ‘home range’ (HR) and ‘core areas’ (CAU) as the 90% and 50% fixed kernel density distributions, respectively, for each whale. We used the number of overlapping individual HRs and CAUs to identify areas of highest use. Individual HR and CAU sizes varied dramatically, but without significant inter-annual variation despite covering years with El Niño and La Niña conditions. Observed within-year differences in HR size may represent different foraging strategies for individuals. The main areas of HR and CAU overlap among whales were near highly productive, strong upwelling centers that were crossed by commercial shipping lanes. Tagged whales generally departed U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters from mid-October to mid-November, with high variability among individuals. One 504-d track allowed HR and CAU comparisons for the same individual across two years, showing similar seasonal timing, and strong site fidelity. Our analysis showed how satellite-tagged blue whales seasonally used waters off the U.S. West Coast, including high-risk areas. We suggest possible modifications to existing shipping lanes to reduce the likelihood of collisions with vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2003298566,"The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA7) is linked to schizophrenia. A partial duplication of CHRNA7 (CHRFAM7A) is found in humans on 15q13–14. Exon 6 of CHRFAM7A harbors a 2-bp deletion polymorphism, CHRFAM7AΔ2bp, which is also associated with schizophrenia. To understand the effects of the duplicated subunits on α7 receptors, we fused α7, dupα7, and dupΔα7 subunits with various fluorescent proteins. The duplicated subunits co-localized with full-length α7 subunits in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a) as well as rat hippocampal neurons. We investigated the interaction between the duplicated subunits and full-length α7 by measuring Förster resonance energy transfer using donor recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The results revealed that the duplicated proteins co-assemble with α7. In electrophysiological studies, Leu at the 9′-position in the M2 membrane-spanning segment was replaced with Cys in dupα7 or dupΔα7, and constructs were co-transfected with full-length α7 in Neuro2a cells. Exposure to ethylammonium methanethiosulfonate inhibited acetylcholine-induced currents, showing that the assembled functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) included the duplicated subunit. Incorporation of dupα7 and dupΔα7 subunits modestly changes the sensitivity of receptors to choline and varenicline. Thus, the duplicated proteins are assembled and transported to the cell membrane together with full-length α7 subunits and alter the function of the nAChRs. The characterization of dupα7 and dupΔα7 as well as their influence on α7 nAChRs may help explain the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may suggest therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2089187946,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play a critical role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Our previous study showed that miR-375 frequently downregulated in gastric cancer suppresses cell proliferation by targeting Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Here, we further found that the expression level of miR-375 is significantly decreased in metastatic gastric cancer tissues compared with the non-metastasis controls. Ectopic expression of miR-375 inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells partially by targeting JAK2. Furthermore, miR-375 expression is negatively regulated by the metastasis associated transcription factor Snail, which directly binds to the putative promoter of miR-375. Moreover, overexpression of Snail can partially reverse the inhibition of gastric cancer cell migration caused by miR-375. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-375 may be negatively regulated by Snail and involved in gastric cancer cell migration and invasion potentially by targeting JAK2."

To investigate whether gymnemic acids directly interact with human (h) sweet receptor hT1R2 + hT1R3, we used the sweet receptor T1R2 + T1R3 assay in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Similar to previous studies in humans and mice, gymnemic acids (100 μg/ml) inhibited the [Ca2+]i responses to sweet compounds in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing hT1R2 + hT1R3 but not in those expressing the mouse (m) sweet receptor mT1R2 + mT1R3. The effect of gymnemic acids rapidly disappeared after rinsing the HEK293 cells with γ-CD. Using mixed species pairings of human and mouse sweet receptor subunits and chimeras, we determined that the transmembrane domain of hT1R3 was mainly required for the sweet-suppressing effect of gymnemic acids. Directed mutagenesis in the transmembrane domain of hT1R3 revealed that the interaction site for gymnemic acids shared the amino acid residues that determined the sensitivity to another sweet antagonist, lactisole. Glucuronic acid, which is the common structure of gymnemic acids, also reduced sensitivity to sweet compounds.

Gymnemic acids (GAs) are saponins of triterpene glycoside isolated from the plant Gymnema sylvestre, which is native to central and western India (Fig. 1).

In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms for the human-specific sweet-suppressing effect of GAs. GAs directly interact with hT1R2 + hT1R3, and this interaction is inhibited by forming an inclusion complex between GAs and γ-CD. The sensitivity to GAs depends mainly on the transmembrane domain of hT1R3 and cysteine-rich domain of hT1R2. The glucuronosyl group of GAs is the key component mediating the sweet-suppressing effect. GAs are saponins with a triterpenoid structure, and more than 10 kinds of GAs and related compounds have been isolated (20.Suttisri R. Lee I.S. Kinghorn A.D.

Because of the difficulty and tediousness of the isolation of each GA, here we used a GA preparation (herein referred to as GAs to indicate several acids are in the mixture) obtained as described below without isolation of each GAs. G. sylvestre extract was comprised of an ethanol/water extract of G. sylvestre leaves. The extract was suspended in 10 ml of methanol, and the supernatant was treated with 2.5 m H2SO4 to carry out acid precipitation at pH 2.5. The precipitate was dissolved in 30 ml of 25% methanol and applied to a Diaion HP20 column. The column was washed with 25% and then 50% methanol, and the preparation of GAs was eluted with 85% methanol. The GAs were analyzed as gymnemagenin, the aglycone of GAs. The obtained GAs were redissolved in 50% ethanol, and alkaline and acid hydrolyses were performed (31.Nakamura Y. Tsumura Y. Tonogai Y. Shibata T.

Construction of human/mouse chimeras of T1Rs was performed by PCR using overlapping primers (15.Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M.

To subclone each gene into the vector, a Kozak cassette was introduced at the 5′ end before the start codon. The integrity of all DNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To obtain reproducible Ca2+ responses, cells were split every 2 days before the cells became confluent. Cells were discarded after 2 months of passages, and new cells were prepared from frozen stock. For calcium imaging experiments, cells were seeded onto a 35-mm recording chamber. After 24 h at 37 °C, confluent cells (60 and 70%) were washed in OptiMEM medium supplemented with GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen), and plasmid DNAs were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (2.0 μl per 1.0 μg of DNA). TAS1Rs (or their mutants) and Gαl6-gust44 were transfected using 0.3 μg of plasmids for 35-mm recording chambers. Ca2+ imaging assays were performed 24 h after transfection. A bath perfusion system was used for determination of the kinetics of activation. Transfected cells in 35-mm recording chambers were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and loaded with 3.0 mm Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) for 3 min at 37 °C. The dye-loaded cells were subjected to Ca2+ imaging. Taste solutions diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution were applied sequentially to the cells for 30 s with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and fluorescence images were obtained using an S Fluor 620/0.75 objective lens (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) via a cooled CCD camera (C6790, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan) fitted to a TE300 microscope (Nikon). AquaCosmos software (version 1.3, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) was used to acquire and analyze fluorescence images. A 5-min interval was maintained between each tastant's application to ensure that the cells were not desensitized as a result of the previous application of taste solutions. Responses were measured from 11 to 43 individual responding cells. Compounds were saccharin (10 mm), SC45647 (0.3 mm), aspartame (10 mm), sodium cyclamate (30 mm), d-tryptophan (10 mm), lactisole (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mm), and d-glucuronic acid sodium salt monohydrate (3, 10, 30, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm). GAs (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 50, and 100 μg/ml) and CD (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mm) were applied to the HEK293 cells for 3 and 2 min, respectively. Isoproterenol (10 μm) was used as positive control, which stimulates endogenous β-adrenergic receptors, providing that the Gα16-dependent signal transduction cascade was functional. In the analysis of single cell responses, changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored as changes in fluo-4 fluorescence. Fluorometric signals are expressed as relative fluorescence changes: ΔF/F0 = (F − F0)/F0, where F0 denotes the baseline fluorescence level. The magnitude of the calcium increases from 10 to 30 s after stimulus onset was measured and averaged. The data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the ΔF/F0 value and used for statistical analysis. EC50 and IC50 values were calculated from individual cumulative concentration-response data using curving-fitting routines of KaleidaGraph 4.0 (Synergy Software Inc., Essex Junction, VT). Differential inhibition of sweet compounds by GAs in wild-type receptors and in each of the chimeras was assessed in comparison with the control (before application of GAs) using a paired t test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. To evaluate the effects of GAs, lactisole, and glucuronic acid on sweet responses statistically, changes in mutants compared with the wild-type control were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post-hoc Tukey-Kramer method, with significance set at p < 0.05. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to analyze for the effect of GAs on the dose-response data in saccharin. An identical analysis was conducted to test for effects of CDs. All calculations were performed using the statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM, New York). Based on the sequence alignment reported by previous studies (13.Masuda K. Koizumi A.

GAs, lactisole, and glucuronic acid were introduced into models by using the program Autodock 4.0 (46.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. Automated docking using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm and an empirical binding free energy function.J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9158) Google Scholar). The models were viewed in UCSF Chimera 1.6.1 (47.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E.

In human psychophysiological studies, GAs inhibit taste sensitivity to the sweet compounds (22.Kurihara Y. Antisweet activity of gymnemic acid A1 and its derivatives.Life Sci. 1969; 8: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To examine whether GAs directly interact with the human sweet receptor, we expressed hT1R2 + hT1R3 by transient transfection in HEK293 cells along with Gα16-gust44 and then monitored activity (calcium mobilization) to the various sweet compounds before and after application of GAs. GAs inhibited the [Ca2+]i responses of hT1R2 + hT1R3-expressing HEK293 cells to SC45647, saccharin, aspartame, cyclamate, d-tryptophan, and sucrose (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Calcium responses to saccharin were inhibited by GAs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 11). After unit conversion from nanomolar to micrograms/ml to compare the potency, the IC50 value of GAs was smaller than that of lactisole, another inhibitor of the human sweet receptor. This indicated that GAs have high potency as compared with lactisole (Table 1). GAs did not alter the EC50 values for saccharin but reduced the magnitude of responses (Fig. 4), suggesting that GAs are noncompetitive inhibitors of saccharin. The sweet-suppressing effect of GAs (100 μg/ml) was diminished by rinsing cells with 10 mm γ-CD but not with α- and β-CD (Fig. 5). Similar to electrophysiological and behavioral studies in mice, sweet responses of HEK293 cells expressing the mouse sweet receptor (mT1R2 + mT1R3) were not suppressed by GAs (Fig. 6). To determine whether one or both hT1R subunits are needed for sensitivity to GAs, we examined the responses of human/mouse mismatched heterodimers to saccharin before and after application of GAs. One mismatched pair (hT1R2 + mT1R3) was not sensitive to GAs (Fig. 6). As described previously (15.Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M.

When TPP1 is tethered to TIN2/TRF1/TRF2, POT1a is thought to block replication protein A binding to the single-stranded telomeric DNA and prevent ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase activation. Similarly, TPP1/POT1b tethered to TIN2 can control the formation of the correct single-stranded telomeric overhang. Consistent with this view, the telomeric phenotypes following deletion of POT1a,b or TPP1 are phenocopied in TIN2-deficient cells. However, the loading of TRF1 and TRF2/Rap1 is additionally compromised in TIN2 KO cells, leading to added phenotypes. Therefore, it could not be excluded that, in addition to TIN2, other components of shelterin contribute to the recruitment of TPP1/POT1a,b as suggested by previous reports. To test whether TIN2 is the sole link between TPP1/POT1a,b and telomeres, we defined the TPP1 interaction domain of TIN2 and generated a TIN2 allele that was unable to interact with TPP1 but retained its interaction with TRF1 and TRF2. We demonstrated that cells expressing TIN2ΔTPP1 instead of wild-type TIN2 phenocopy the POT1a,b knockout setting without showing additional phenotypes. Therefore, these results are consistent with TIN2 being the only mechanism by which TPP1/POT1 heterodimers bind to shelterin and function in telomere protection.

https://openalex.org/W2123797278,"While humans are able to understand much about causality, it is unclear to what extent non-human animals can do the same. The Aesop's Fable paradigm requires an animal to drop stones into a water-filled tube to bring a floating food reward within reach. Rook, Eurasian jay, and New Caledonian crow performances are similar to those of children under seven years of age when solving this task. However, we know very little about the cognition underpinning these birds' performances. Here, we address several limitations of previous Aesop's Fable studies to gain insight into the causal cognition of New Caledonian crows. Our results provide the first evidence that any non-human animal can solve the U-tube task and can discriminate between water-filled tubes of different volumes. However, our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that these crows can infer the presence of a hidden causal mechanism. They also call into question previous object-discrimination performances. The methodologies outlined here should allow for more powerful comparisons between humans and other animal species and thus help us to determine which aspects of causal cognition are distinct to humans."

Nox2 activation requires two switches to be turned on simultaneously: a conformational change of the cytosolic protein p47phox and GDP/GTP exchange on the small GTPase Rac. These proteins, in an active form, bind to their respective targets, p22phox and p67phox, leading to productive oxidase assembly at the membrane. Although arachidonic acid (AA) efficiently activates Nox2 both in vivo and in vitro, the mechanism has not been fully understood, except that AA induces p47phox conformational change. Here we show that AA elicits GDP-to-GTP exchange on Rac at the cellular level, consistent with its role as a potent Nox2 activator. However, even when constitutively active forms of p47phox and Rac1 are both expressed in HeLa cells, superoxide production by Nox2 is scarcely induced in the absence of AA. These active proteins also fail to effectively activate Nox2 in a cell-free reconstituted system without AA. Without affecting Rac-GTP binding to p67phox, AA induces the direct interaction of Rac-GTP-bound p67phox with the C-terminal cytosolic region of Nox2. p67phox-Rac-Nox2 assembly and superoxide production are both abrogated by alanine substitution for Tyr-198, Leu-199, and Val-204 in the p67phox activation domain that localizes the C-terminal to the Rac-binding domain. Thus the “third” switch (AA-inducible interaction of p67phox·Rac-GTP with Nox2) is required to be turned on at the same time for Nox2 activation.

The Nox oxidases contain two distinct hemes in the N-terminal transmembrane region and FAD- and NADPH-binding sites in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and, thus form a complete electron-transporting apparatus from NADPH to O2 via FAD and hemes in a single protein. Nox2 (also known as gp91phox), the original member of the Nox family, is highly expressed in professional phagocytes such as neutrophils.

Nox2 is stably dimerized with the membrane-integrated protein p22phox, and the heterodimer assembles into the active complex with the small GTPase Rac and the specialized Nox-activating proteins p47phox and p67phox, which are recruited from the cytosol to the membrane upon cell stimulation (1.Lambeth J.D.

The assembly of the Nox2-based oxidase requires two switches to be turned on simultaneously: a conformational change of p47phox and GDP-to-GTP exchange on Rac. The stimulus-induced conformational change of p47phox, comprising 390 amino acid residues, allows the bis-SH3 domain of this protein to interact with the C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR) of p22phox, an interaction essential for Nox2 activation (17.Sumimoto H.

The PKC activator PMA also elicits GDP-to-GTP exchange on Rac in neutrophils, another event required for Nox2 activation (25.Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H.

C-terminal to the Rac-binding TPR domain, p67phox (composed of 526 amino acid residues) harbors the activation domain (amino acid residues 190–210), which is followed by two SH3 domains and a PB1 domain that intervenes between them (Fig. 1A). The activation domain is crucial for Nox2 activation but does not seem to participate in p67phox interaction with Rac-GTP (29.Hata K. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H.

Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which Rac-GTP-bound p67phox activates Nox2, although Rac-GTP is presumed to induce a conformational change of p67phox, which might direct the activation domain toward Nox2 for superoxide production. The Nox2-based oxidase can be activated in a cell-free system reconstituted with the Nox2/p22phox-abundant phagocyte membrane, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac-GTP. The activation is elicited with an in vitro activator, commonly represented by an anionic amphiphile such as AA or SDS, but not with PMA (32.Bromberg Y. Pick E. Unsaturated fatty acids stimulate NADPH-dependent superoxide production by cell-free system derived from macrophages.Cell Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33.Bromberg Y.

Biol. 2014; 1124: 339-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A target of the amphiphiles is p47phox. AA and SDS are each capable of directly disrupting the AIR-mediated inhibitory association in p47phox to render the bis-SH3 domain in a state accessible to p22phox (22.Shiose A. Sumimoto H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has remained unclear whether the conformational change of p47phox is enough to activate Nox2 in the presence of Rac-GTP. In this study, we show that AA and SDS are each able to trigger GDP-to-GTP exchange on Rac in intact cells. These anionic amphiphiles do not affect binding of Rac-GTP to p67phox, but allow the p67phox·Rac-GTP complex to interact directly with Nox2. This interaction and the subsequent superoxide production are impaired by alanine substitution for Tyr-198, Leu-199, and Val-204 in the activation domain of p67phox. Combined with the previous finding that p47phox is a target of amphiphiles (22.Shiose A. Sumimoto H.

https://openalex.org/W2075407870,"Submarine canyons are considered biodiversity hotspots which have been identified for their important roles in connecting the deep sea with shallower waters. To date, a huge gap exists between the high importance that scientists associate with deep-sea ecosystem services and the communication of this knowledge to decision makers and to the wider public, who remain largely ignorant of the importance of these services. The connectivity and complexity of marine ecosystems makes knowledge transfer very challenging, and new communication tools are necessary to increase understanding of ecological values beyond the science community. We show how the Ecosystem Principles Approach, a method that explains the importance of ocean processes via easily understandable ecological principles, might overcome this challenge for deep-sea ecosystem services. Scientists were asked to help develop a list of clear and concise ecosystem principles for the functioning of submarine canyons through a Delphi process to facilitate future transfers of ecological knowledge. These ecosystem principles describe ecosystem processes, link such processes to ecosystem services, and provide spatial and temporal information on the connectivity between deep and shallow waters. They also elucidate unique characteristics of submarine canyons. Our Ecosystem Principles Approach was successful in integrating ecological information into the ecosystem services assessment process. It therefore has a high potential to be the next step towards a wider implementation of ecological values in marine planning. We believe that successful communication of ecological knowledge is the key to a wider public support for ocean conservation, and that this endeavour has to be driven by scientists in their own interest as major deep-sea stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W2116797320,"HIV involvement of the CNS continues to be a significant problem despite successful use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Drugs of abuse can act in concert with HIV proteins to damage glia and neurons, worsening the neurotoxicity caused by HIV alone. Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug, abuse of which has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with high-risk sexual behavior, increased HIV transmission, and development of drug resistance. HIV infection and METH dependence can have synergistic pathological effects, with preferential involvement of frontostriatal circuits. At the molecular level, epigenetic alterations have been reported for both HIV-1 infection and drug abuse, but the neuropathological pathways triggered by their combined effects are less known. We investigated epigenetic changes in the brain associated with HIV and METH. We analyzed postmortem frontal cortex tissue from 27 HIV seropositive individuals, 13 of which had a history of METH dependence, in comparison to 14 cases who never used METH. We detected changes in the expression of DNMT1, at mRNA and protein levels, that resulted in the increase of global DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in a subset of cases, showed differential methylation on genes related to neurodegeneration; dopamine metabolism and transport; and oxidative phosphorylation. We provide evidence for the synergy of HIV and METH dependence on the patterns of DNA methylation on the host brain, which results in a distinctive landscape for the comorbid condition. Importantly, we identified new epigenetic targets that might aid in understanding the aggravated neurodegenerative, cognitive, motor and behavioral symptoms observed in persons living with HIV and addictions."
https://openalex.org/W2047842825,"Human cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) regulate the activities of thousands of signaling small molecules via transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (-SO3) from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the hydroxyls and primary amines of acceptors. Sulfonation controls the affinities of ligands for their targets, and thereby regulates numerous receptors, which, in turn, regulate complex cellular responses. Despite their biological and medical relevance, basic SULT mechanism issues remain unresolved. To settle these issues, and to create an in-depth model of SULT catalysis, the complete kinetic mechanism of a representative member of the human SULT family, SULT2A1, was determined. The mechanism is composed of eight enzyme forms that interconvert via 22 rate constants, each of which was determined independently. The result is a complete quantitative description of the mechanism that accurately predicts complex enzymatic behavior. This is the first description of a SULT mechanism at this resolution, and it reveals numerous principles of SULT catalysis and resolves previously ambiguous issues. The structures and catalytic behaviors SULTs are highly conserved; hence, the mechanism presented here should prove paradigmatic for the family."
https://openalex.org/W2089604375,"Reports of increasing worldwide circulation of human enterovirus-68 (EV68) are well documented. Despite health concerns posed by resurgence of these viruses, little is known about EV68 strains circulating in Kenya. In this study, we characterized 13 EV68 strains isolated in Kenya between 2008 and 2011 based on the Hypervariable 3′- end of the VP1 gene. Viral RNA was extracted from the isolates and partial VP1 gene amplified by RT-PCR, followed by nucleotide sequencing. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences revealed substitutions in Kenyan EV68 isolates absent in the prototype reference strain (Fermon). The majority of these changes were present in the BC and DE-loop regions, which are associated with viral antigenicity and virulence. The Kenyan strains exhibited high sequence homology with respect to those from other countries. Natural selection analysis based on the VP1 region showed that the Kenyan EV68 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that majority (84.6%) of the Kenyan strains belonged to clade A, while a minority belonged to clades B and C. Overall, our results illustrate that although EV68 strains isolated in Kenya were genetically and antigenically divergent from the prototype strain (Fermon), they were closely related to those circulating in other countries, suggesting worldwide transmissibility. Further, the presence of shared mutations by Kenyan EV68 strains and those isolated in other countries, indicates evolution in the VP1 region may be contributing to increased worldwide detection of the viruses. This is the first study to document circulation of EV68 in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W2100158551,"Previous studies on the nutritional and nutraceutical properties of Lignosus rhinocerotis focused mainly on the sclerotium; however, the supply of wild sclerotium is limited. In this investigation, the antioxidant capacity and cytotoxic effect of L. rhinocerotis cultured under different conditions of liquid fermentation (shaken and static) were compared to the sclerotium produced by solid-substrate fermentation. Aqueous methanol extracts of the mycelium (LR-MH, LR-MT) and culture broth (LR-BH, LR-BT) demonstrated either higher or comparable antioxidant capacities to the sclerotium extract (LR-SC) based on their radical scavenging abilities, reducing properties, metal chelating activities, and inhibitory effects on lipid peroxidation. All extracts exerted low cytotoxicity (IC50>200 µg/ml, 72 h) against selected mammalian cell lines. Several low-molecular-weight compounds, including sugars, fatty acids, methyl esters, sterols, amides, amino acids, phenolics, and triterpenoids, were identified using GC-MS and UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The presence of proteins (<40 kDa) in the extracts was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and SELDI-TOF-MS. Principal component analysis revealed that the chemical profiles of the mycelial extracts under shaken and static conditions were distinct from those of the sclerotium. Results from bioactivity evaluation and chemical profiling showed that L. rhinocerotis from liquid fermentation merits consideration as an alternative source of functional ingredients and potential substitute for the sclerotium."

https://openalex.org/W2061861156,"Aims To evaluate PIK3CA gene mutations and PIK3CA expression status in Chinese esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, and their correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes. Methods Direct sequencing was applied to investigate mutations in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA in 406 Chinese ESCC patients. PIK3CA expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry analysis. The associations of PIK3CA gene mutations and PIK3CA expression with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome were examined. Results Thirty somatic point mutations (30/406, 7.4%) were identified in exon 9 whereas no mutations were detected in exon 20. PIK3CA mutations were not correlated with clinicopathological characteristics or clinical outcomes. However in the ESCC patients with family cancer history, PIK3CA mutations were independently correlated with worse overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 10.493, 95% CI: 2.432–45.267, P = 0.002). Compared to normal esophageal tissue, PIK3CA was significantly overexpressed in cancer tissue (P<0.001). PIK3CA overexpression was independently associated with higher risk of local recurrence (multivariate HR = 1.435, 95% CI: 1.040–1.979, P = 0.028). In female ESCC patients, PIK3CA overexpression was independently correlated with worse overall survival (multivariate HR = 2.341, 95% CI: 1.073–5.108, P = 0.033). Conclusions Our results suggest PIK3CA gene mutation and overexpression could act as biomarkers for individualized molecular targeted therapy for Chinese ESCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2076996478,"Although the actin network is commonly hijacked by pathogens, there are few reports of parasites targeting microtubules. The proposed member of the LcrE protein family from some Chlamydia species (e.g. pCopN from C. pneumoniae) binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule assembly in vitro. From the pCopN structure and its similarity with that of MxiC from Shigella, we definitively confirm CopN as the Chlamydia homolog of the LcrE family of bacterial proteins involved in the regulation of type III secretion. We have also investigated the molecular basis for the pCopN effect on microtubules. We show that pCopN delays microtubule nucleation and acts as a pure tubulin-sequestering protein at steady state. It targets the β subunit interface involved in the tubulin longitudinal self-association in a way that inhibits nucleotide exchange. pCopN contains three repetitions of a helical motif flanked by disordered N- and C-terminal extensions. We have identified the pCopN minimal tubulin-binding region within the second and third repeats. Together with the intriguing observation that C. trachomatis CopN does not bind tubulin, our data support the notion that, in addition to the shared function of type III secretion regulation, these proteins have evolved different functions in the host cytosol.

Our results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the C. pneumoniae CopN-specific inhibition of microtubule assembly. Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal assemblies involved in multiple cellular functions (1.Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Microtubule polymerization dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). They form tracks along which molecular motors convey cargos and organelles through the cytoplasm. In dividing cells, they reorganize spectacularly to form the architecture of the mitotic spindle, the structure that segregates chromosomes between daughter cells. Microtubules are made of αβ-tubulin heterodimers that assemble longitudinally, head-to-tail, to form protofilaments; these protofilaments interact laterally to shape the microtubule hollow cylinder (2.Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. High-resolution model of the microtubule.Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Both tubulin subunits bind a GTP molecule. The one on α-tubulin is structural; it is non-exchangeable and not hydrolyzed. In contrast, the β-tubulin GTP is exchangeable in unassembled tubulin. Upon microtubule assembly, this nucleotide becomes hydrolyzed, and its exchange is inhibited until disassembly. The cytoskeleton is the target of intracellular parasites, most of which hijack the actin network (3.Carabeo R. Bacterial subversion of host actin dynamics at the plasma membrane.Cell Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1460-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There are also some reports of microtubule destabilization by parasites, including Escherichia coli and Shigella through their related protein EspG (4.Hardwidge P.R. Deng W. Vallance B.A. Rodriguez-Escudero I. Cid V.J. Molina M. Finlay B.B.

Microtubule-severing activity of Shigella is pivotal for intercellular spreading.Science. 2006; 314: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively. But the mechanism of action is not known, and the microtubule-destabilizing activity has even been called into question (6.Germane K.L. Ohi R. Goldberg M.B. Spiller B.W.

Chem. 2011; 286: 33992-33998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The development cycle of Chlamydia differentiates them from most other prokaryotes in that they are obligate intracellular pathogens (8.Dautry-Varsat A. Subtil A. Hackstadt T. Recent insights into the mechanisms of Chlamydia entry.Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1714-1722PubMed Google Scholar). In consequence, methods to manipulate these bacteria genetically emerged only very recently (9.Nguyen B.D. Valdivia R.H. Virulence determinants in the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis revealed by forward genetic approaches.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10.Wood D.O. Wood R.R. Tucker A.M. Genetic systems for studying obligate intracellular pathogens: an update.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2014; 17: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To circumvent these limitations, chlamydial proteins have been studied in heterologous systems. In the case of pCopN, it has been shown that its expression in yeast and mammalian cells leads to inhibition of growth and to defects in cell division that are accompanied by the disruption of the mitotic spindle (11.Huang J. Lesser C.F. Lory S. The essential role of the CopN protein in Chlamydia pneumoniae intracellular growth.Nature. 2008; 456: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This property is shared by CopN from Chlamydia abortus but not by the more distant Chlamydia trachomatis CopN (tCopN) (Fig. 1). Consistently, biochemical experiments have shown that pCopN, but not tCopN, interacts with tubulin directly and inhibits microtubule assembly in a dose-dependent manner (7.Archuleta T.L. Du Y. English C.A. Lory S. Lesser C. Ohi M.D. Ohi R. Spiller B.W. The Chlamydia effector chlamydial outer protein N (CopN) sequesters tubulin and prevents microtubule assembly.J. Biol.

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. chlamydial outer protein N designed ankyrin repeat protein CopN from C. pneumoniae CopN from C. trachomatis single-wavelength anomalous dispersion myocardin-related transcription factor root mean square. The purpose of this work was to gain further insight into pCopN function at the molecular level. We demonstrate that pCopN is a tubulin-sequestering protein that targets the β subunit longitudinal interface and binds tubulin with different affinities according to the nucleotide state. In addition, pCopN interacts directly with the microtubule nucleus and delays nucleation. We have also determined the 1.2 Å resolution structure of pCopN and mapped the surface interacting with tubulin. The structure confirms CopN as the Chlamydia homolog of the Yersinia YopN protein, as proposed (12.Hsia R.C. Pannekoek Y. Ingerowski E. Bavoil P.M.

Bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-III secretion.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); as such, it seems likely that it serves as a plug of the type III secretion system of this bacteria (14.Betts-Hampikian H.J. Fields K.A. The Chlamydial type III secretion mechanism: revealing cracks in a tough nut.Front. Microbiol. 2010; 1: 114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and is secreted during infection, albeit in small amounts (15.Fields K.A. Hackstadt T.

Rapid microtubule self-assembly kinetics.Cell. 2011; 146: 582-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and its affinity for pCopN mean that, when secreted in the cytoplasm, pCopN will be bound to tubulin. Our observations provide a framework for understanding the way secreted pCopN plays a role in the chlamydial infectious cycle. Full-length CopN and N-terminal truncation constructs were cloned by standard PCR methods from C. pneumonia and C. trachomatis genomic DNA into a pETM-11 plasmid, thus incorporating an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. C-terminal truncation and substitution mutants were obtained using PCR-based mutagenesis. The pCopN constructs used in this study are schematized in Fig. 2A. The pCopN mutations were introduced in the D29 construct, using either a pETM-11 plasmid (R268H mutant) or a pET28b plasmid (S238E/K242E, Q261E/T265E, and Q271E/T275E mutants). Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells grown in LB medium at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 18 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Proteins were purified by HisTrap affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration on Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare). All the constructs were correctly folded as judged by circular dichroism (data not shown). Proteins were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Tubulin was purified from ovine brain by two cycles of assembly-disassembly in a high molarity Pipes buffer (18.Castoldi M. Popov A.V. Purification of brain tubulin through two cycles of polymerization-depolymerization in a high-molarity buffer.Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 32: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Before use, an additional cycle of assembly-disassembly was performed to remove inactive protein. GTP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin (i.e. with the β subunit loaded with GTP or GDP, respectively) were prepared by incubation with 1 mm nucleotide followed by a desalting step to remove the excess nucleotide. Samples were analyzed by gel filtration at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate on a Superdex S200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Pipes-K, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2. Microtubule assembly was monitored turbidimetrically in duplicate recordings in a Flexstation 3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) in 96-well plates. Plates with wells containing variable amounts of tubulin for a fixed concentration of pCopN constructs in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Pipes-K, pH 6.8, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 32% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm GTP in a total volume of 200 μl were prepared on ice and then transferred to the plate reader maintained at 37 °C. Microtubule assembly was monitored by recording the absorbance at 350 nm for 45 min at 30-s intervals, with the plates being shaken for 2 s before each measurement. We checked that the steady state had been reached after the 45-min recording time for each condition tested (data not shown). To ensure that the signal was due to microtubule assembly and not to cold stable tubulin aggregates, the absorbance was corrected for the residual signal after an additional incubation of the plate for 20 min on ice. The data were also corrected for optical path length using the “PathCheck” option of the Flexstation. The plot of the corrected signal as a function of the total tubulin concentration yields a linear curve, the abscissa intercept of which represents the critical concentration for tubulin assembly. Additional experiments, in particular to evaluate the pCopN effect on microtubule nucleation and the effect on microtubule assembly of pCopN mutants and of some constructs, were performed in 50 mm Mes-K, pH 6.8, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm GTP and monitored at 350 nm with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies), using a 0.7-cm path length cuvette. pCopN was labeled with acrylodan following established protocols (19.Mignot I. Pecqueur L. Dorléans A. Karuppasamy M. Ravelli R.B. Dreier B. Plückthun A. Knossow M. Gigant B. Design and characterization of modular scaffolds for tubulin assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 31085-31094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In short, the natural cysteine of pCopN (Cys-217) was reduced and then reacted with acrylodan, following which the excess dye was removed by desalting on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). This acrylodan-labeled pCopN was used for affinity measurements with GDP-tubulin and GTP-tubulin in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Pipes-K, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and a 10 μm concentration of the relevant nucleotide. The interaction was followed by fluorescence spectrometry (λex, 280 nm; λem, 510 nm) at 20 °C in a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Agilent Technologies). Increasing amounts of tubulin were added every 2 min to a fixed (50 nm) concentration of labeled pCopN. The data were fitted to a 1:1 binding isotherm with Equation 1, ΔFluo=FluoMax×[C*]+[T]+KD+([C*]+[T]+KD)2−4·[C*]·[T]2·[C*](Eq. 1) where ΔFluo is the variation of the fluorescence signal, FluoMax is the fluorescence at saturating concentration of tubulin, [T] and [C*] are the concentrations of tubulin and labeled pCopN, respectively, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The competition for tubulin binding between FL_pCopN and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) was monitored using the fluorescence assay used for the affinity measurements. To the preformed acrylodan-labeled FL_pCopN-tubulin complex we added an excess of the D2 DARPin (19.Mignot I. Pecqueur L. Dorléans A. Karuppasamy M. Ravelli R.B. Dreier B. Plückthun A. Knossow M. Gigant B. Design and characterization of modular scaffolds for tubulin assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 31085-31094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence decrease was recorded. As a positive chase control, unlabeled FL_pCopN was added to the fluorescent complex. The fluorescence decrease associated with the fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tubulin tryptophans to S6-GDP (20.Yarbrough L.R. Fishback J.L.

Stathmin slows down guanosine diphosphate dissociation from tubulin in a phosphorylation-controlled fashion.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used to examine the kinetics of GDP release from 1 μm tubulin in the presence of a 5-fold excess of CopN. GDP-tubulin was equilibrated in 20 mm Pipes-K, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA through a PD-10 desalting column before being mixed with CopN constructs. The exchange kinetics were monitored at 20 °C using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (λex, 295 nm; λem, 330 nm). After the addition of 10 μm S6-GDP, the signal decreases at the rate of GDP release from tubulin as it is replaced by S6-GDP. Tubulin (10 μm) with or without 10 μm pCopN constructs was incubated with 10–100 μm vinblastine for 20 min on ice in 20 mm Pipes-K, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 μm GDP. After high speed centrifugation (300,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The lysines of FL_pCopN and of the D29 construct were methylated prior to crystallization (22.Schubot F.D. Waugh D.S. A pivotal role for reductive methylation in the de novo crystallization of a ternary complex composed of Yersinia pestis virulence factors YopN, SycN and YscB.Acta Crystallogr D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The methylation reaction was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at a 2 mg/ml protein concentration. To 0.5-ml aliquots, 20 μl of freshly prepared 1 m dimethylamine-borane complex (ABC) (Fluka) and 40 μl of 1 m formaldehyde were added twice, separated by an incubation time of 2 h at 4 °C. After a final 10-μl ABC addition, the reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The methylated proteins were purified on a desalting column preequilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and then concentrated to 30 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystals were obtained at 293 K by vapor diffusion in the following crystallization buffers: 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m lithium sulfate, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 for FL_pCopN and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate for D29. Before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection, crystals were transferred in the crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol. Both proteins crystallized in the P212121 space group with very similar cell dimensions (Table 1). Complete data sets were collected at 100 K on the Proxima 1 beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron, Saint Aubin, France). In each case, data were collected from a single crystal and processed with XDS (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). The structure of D29 was solved from a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment at the 1.9-Å wavelength exploiting the sulfur-SAD signal. The positions of 11 anomalous scatterers (corresponding to 7 of 12 Met + Cys residues expected in the asymmetric unit and to four ions from the crystallization buffer) were determined with SHELXD (24.Sheldrick G.M.

Surrey T. Gigant B. Knossow M. A designed ankyrin repeat protein selected to bind to tubulin caps the microtubule plus end.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12011-12016Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we quantified the effect of pCopN on tubulin assembly at steady state using critical concentration plots derived from turbidimetric measurements. The critical concentration of tubulin alone for microtubule assembly was 2.3 μm. Full-length pCopN (FL_pCopN) as well as D29 and D84, the two N-terminally truncated constructs previously studied by Archuleta and co-workers (7.Archuleta T.L. Du Y. English C.A. Lory S. Lesser C. Ohi M.D. Ohi R. Spiller B.W. The Chlamydia effector chlamydial outer protein N (CopN) sequesters tubulin and prevents microtubule assembly.J. Biol.

The critical concentration plots obtained were shifted while remaining parallel to the control straight line observed with tubulin alone, two characteristics of a sequestration mechanism (33.Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The amount of sequestered tubulin in complex with pCopN constructs can be derived from the shift of the plot. In the presence of 5 μm constructs, the apparent critical concentration varied from 6 to 7.7 μm, which corresponds to a 3.7–5.4 μm shift. We also tested the effect of D29 at a 3 μm concentration. In this case, the curve was shifted by 2.6 μm as compared with the control with tubulin alone (Fig. 2B). These values are consistent with a 1:1 tubulin/pCopN stoichiometry. They establish that pCopN is a tubulin-sequestering protein that makes a binary 1:1 tubulin-pCopN complex that is not incorporated in microtubules. In the course of these experiments, we noticed that pCopN delayed microtubule assembly, and it did so in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Microtubule assembly is a two-step process, in which a nucleus forms and subsequently elongates (Fig. 2D); the turbidity increases mainly along with microtubule elongation. We showed that raising the tubulin-pCopN complex concentration for a given free tubulin concentration correlated with a longer lag time preceding the turbidity increase (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, and as expected for a sequestering mechanism, a similar turbidity level was observed at steady state (Fig. 2C, right). This behavior is typical of the inhibition of the nucleation step (36.Carlier M.F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Hydrolysis of GTP associated with the formation of tubulin oligomers is involved in microtubule nucleation.Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data point to a dual interference of pCopN with microtubule assembly (Fig. 2D). To gain further insight into the dual mechanism of the pCopN inhibition of microtubule assembly, we mapped the pCopN footprint on tubulin by studying its interference with well characterized tubulin properties. First, we recorded the effect of pCopN on vinblastine-induced tubulin self-assembly. Vinblastine induces the formation of helical assemblies (37.Weisenberg R.C. Timasheff S.N. Aggregation of microtubule subunit protein. Effects of divalent cations, colchicine and vinblastine.Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4110-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) by promoting tubulin-tubulin longitudinal associations (38.Gigant B.

We have shown that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex subunits are markers for airway smooth muscle phenotype maturation and together with caveolin-1, play an important role in calcium homeostasis. We tested if dystrophin affects phenotype maturation, tracheal contraction and lung physiology. We used dystrophin deficient Golden Retriever dogs (GRMD) and mdx mice vs healthy control animals in our approach. We found significant reduction of contractile protein markers: smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (smMHC) and calponin and reduced Ca2+ response to contractile agonist in dystrophin deficient cells. Immunocytochemistry revealed reduced stress fibers and number of smMHC positive cells in dystrophin-deficient cells, when compared to control. Immunoblot analysis of Akt1, GSK3β and mTOR phosphorylation further revealed that downstream PI3K signaling, which is essential for phenotype maturation, was suppressed in dystrophin deficient cell cultures. Tracheal rings from mdx mice showed significant reduction in the isometric contraction to methacholine (MCh) when compared to genetic control BL10ScSnJ mice (wild-type). In vivo lung function studies using a small animal ventilator revealed a significant reduction in peak airway resistance induced by maximum concentrations of inhaled MCh in mdx mice, while there was no change in other lung function parameters. These data show that the lack of dystrophin is associated with a concomitant suppression of ASM cell phenotype maturation in vitro, ASM contraction ex vivo and lung function in vivo, indicating that a linkage between the DGC and the actin cytoskeleton via dystrophin is a determinant of the phenotype and functional properties of ASM."

https://openalex.org/W2075088102,"The monoamine system in the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in various mental disorders and has been the major target of anxiolytics and antidepressants. Clinical studies show that serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) produce better therapeutic effects than single selective reuptake inhibitors, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we found that low dose SNRIs, by acting on 5-HT(1A) and α2-adrenergic receptors, synergistically reduced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and AMPAR surface expression in prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons via a mechanism involving Rab5/dynamin-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs. The synergistic effect of SNRIs on AMPARs was blocked by inhibition of activator of G protein signaling 3, a G protein modulator that prevents reassociation of G(i) protein α subunit and prolongs the βγ-mediated signaling pathway. Moreover, the depression of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents by SNRIs required p38 kinase activity, which was increased by 5-HT(1A) and α2-adrenergic receptor co-activation in an activator of G protein signaling 3-dependent manner. These results have revealed a potential mechanism for the synergy between the serotonin and norepinephrine systems in the regulation of glutamatergic transmission in cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2022933566,"Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme that regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Dysregulation of its expression is associated with type 2 diabetes. Herein we describe the molecular mechanism underlying the glucose-mediated transcriptional regulation of the PC gene. Incubation of the rat insulin cell line INS-1 832/13 with glucose resulted in a 2-fold increase in PC mRNA expression. Transient transfections of the rat PC promoter-luciferase reporter construct in the above cell line combined with mutational analysis indicated that the rat PC gene promoter contains the glucose-responsive element (GRE), comprising three canonical E-boxes (E1, E3 and E4) and one E-box-like element (E2) clustering between nucleotides -546 and -399, upstream of the transcription start site. Mutation of any of these E-boxes resulted in a marked reduction of glucose-mediated transcriptional induction of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2) bind to E1, the Specificity Protein-1 (Sp1) binds to E2, USF2 and the carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) binds to E4, while unknown factors binds to E3. High glucose promotes the recruitment of Sp1 to E2 and, USF2 and ChREBP to E4. Silencing the expression of Sp1, USF2 and ChREBP by their respective siRNAs in INS-1 832/13 cells blunted glucose-induced expression of endogenous PC. We conclude that the glucose-mediated transcriptional activation of the rat PC gene is regulated by at least these three transcription factors."

We assessed ACV-induced nephrotoxicity and identified the differentially expressed proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. In total, 30 ICR mice were intraperitoneally administrated ACV (150 or 600 mg/kg per day) for 9 days. After administration of ACV, levels of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen increased significantly. In addition, mouse kidneys exhibited histopathological changes and reduced expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR2. In the proteomic analysis, more than 1,000 proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a total of 20 proteins were up- or down-regulated in the ACV group compared with the saline group. Among these, six proteins (MHC class II antigen, glyoxalase 1, peroxiredoxin 1, αB-crystallin, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-IIIb, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb) were identified in association with ACV-induced nephrotoxicity. These findings were confirmed by Western blotting analysis. The differential expression levels of α-BC, Prx1, Glo I and CcO Vb suggest that oxidative damage and mitochondrial injury may be involved in ACV-induced nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, VEGF and FGF may play a role in tissue repair and the restoration process following ACV nephrotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2073192575,"Gene duplication is a widespread phenomenon in genome evolution, and it has been proposed to serve as an engine of evolutionary innovation. In the present study, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of duplicate genes in the bovine genome. A total of 3131 putative duplicated gene pairs were identified, including 712 cattle-specific duplicate gene pairs unevenly distributed across the genome, which are significantly enriched for specific biological functions including immunity, growth, digestion, reproduction, embryonic development, inflammatory response, and defense response to bacterium. Around 97.1% (87.8%) of (cattle-specific) duplicate gene pairs were found to have distinct exon-intron structures. Analysis of gene expression by RNA-Seq and sequence divergence (synonymous or non-synonymous) revealed that expression divergence is correlated with sequence divergence, as has been previously observed in other species. This analysis also led to the identification of a subset of cattle-specific duplicate gene pairs exhibiting very high expression divergence. Interestingly, further investigation revealed a significant relationship between structural and expression divergence while controlling for the effect of synonymous sequence divergence. Together these results provide further insight into duplicate gene sequence and expression divergence in cattle, and their potential contributions to phenotypic divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2146957463,"The evolutionary effects of glacial periods are poorly understood for Southern Hemisphere marine intertidal species, particularly obligatory sessile organisms. We examined this by assessing the phylogeographic patterns of the southern African volcano barnacle, Tetraclita serrata, a dominant species on rocky intertidal shores. Restricted gene flow in some geographical areas was hypothesized based on oceanic circulation patterns and known biogeographic regions. Barnacle population genetic structure was investigated using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) region for 410 individuals sampled from 20 localities spanning the South African coast. The mtDNA data were augmented by generating nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences from a subset of samples. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA data reveal two distinct clades with mostly sympatric distributions, whereas nuclear analyses reveal only a single lineage. Shallow, but significant structure (0.0041-0.0065, P<0.01) was detected for the mtDNA data set, with the south-west African region identified as harbouring the highest levels of genetic diversity. Gene flow analyses on the mtDNA data show that individuals sampled in south-western localities experience gene flow primarily in the direction of the Benguela Current, while south and eastern localities experience bi-directional gene flow, suggesting an influence of both the inshore currents and the offshore Agulhas Current in the larval distribution of T. serrata. The mtDNA haplotype network, Bayesian Skyline Plots, mismatch distributions and time since expansion indicate that T. serrata population numbers were not severely affected by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), unlike other southern African marine species. The processes resulting in the two morphologically cryptic mtDNA lineages may be the result of a recent historical allopatric event followed by secondary contact or could reflect selective pressures due to differing environmental conditions."

Sizes of somata and dendritic fields do not show obvious variation at different distance from the optic disk (eccentricity). Dendrites are moderately branched. Morphological analysis (n = 23) reveals that cPAG-projecting RGCs ramified in sublamina a and b in the inner plexiform layer. These cells exhibit different stratification patterns based on the thickness of dendritic bands in sublaminas a and b: majority of analyzed cells (16 out of 23) have two bands of arborizations share similar thickness. The rest of analyzed cells (7 out of 23) exhibit thinner band in sublamina a than in sublamina b. Together, the present study suggests that cPAG of Mongolian gerbil could receive direct retinal inputs from two types of bistratified RGCs. Furthermore, a small subset of melanopsin-expressing RGCs (total 41 in 6 animals) is shown to innervate the rostral PAG (rPAG).

Control animals (Group A, n = 7) were injected conscious and kept awake at room temperature (24°C) throughout the accumulation period. In order to minimize tracer activity in periaortic BAT, Group B (n = 7) and C (n = 6) animals were injected under anaesthesia at 37°C and Group C animals were additionally pre-treated with propranolol. PET/CT acquisitions were performed prior to animal euthanasia and ex vivo analysis of FDG biodistribution.Autoradiographic imaging indicated higher FDG uptake in atherosclerotic lesions than in the normal aortic wall (all groups, P<0.05) and the blood (all groups, P<0.01) which correlated with macrophage infiltration (R = 0.47; P<0.001). However, periaortic BAT uptake was either significantly higher (Group A, P<0.05) or similar (Group B and C, P = NS) to that observed in atherosclerotic lesions and was shown to correlate with in vivo quantified aortic FDG activity.Periaortic BAT FDG uptake was identified as a confounding factor while using FDG for the non-invasive imaging of mouse atherosclerotic lesions."

Upon internalization, conformational changes within complex I adaptor proteins as well as deubiquitination of RIP1 evoke the recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain, procaspase 8, and RIP3 (6.Micheau O.

Subsequently, activated caspase 8 transmits the signal to downstream effectors such as caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), finally resulting in apoptotic cell death (23.Los M.

However, the effect of phosphorylation in controlling the AU-rich element-binding ability of TTP remains controversial. We showed earlier that MEKK1-mediated phosphorylation serves as a prerequisite for its Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination by TRAF2 (41.Schichl Y.M. Resch U. Lemberger C.E. Stichlberger D. de Martin R.

Here we focused on the specific contribution of TTP in JNK signaling. On the basis of detailed analyses of the TNF-induced signaling kinetics, we were able to correlate JNK activation with different TTP phosphorylation forms. We demonstrate that TTP inducibly associates with TNFR1 and uncover that lysine 105 of TTP, being ubiquitinated by TRAF2, is required for JNK but not NF-κB signaling.

The main goal of this study was to further define the roles for fat and dietary carbs in insulin resistance. C57BL/6 mice were fed normal chow diet (CD) or HFD containing 0.1–25.5% carbs for 5 weeks, followed by evaluations of calorie consumption, body weight and fat gains, insulin sensitivity, intratissue insulin signaling, ectopic fat, and oxidative stress in liver and skeletal muscle. The role of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the HFD-induced insulin resistance was determined in mice. The role of fat in insulin resistance was also examined in cultured cells. HFD with little carbs (0.1%) induced severe insulin resistance. Addition of 5% carbs to HFD dramatically elevated insulin resistance and 10% carbs in HFD was sufficient to induce a maximal level of insulin resistance. HFD with little carbs induced ectopic fat accumulation and oxidative stress in liver and skeletal muscle and addition of carbs to HFD dramatically enhanced ectopic fat and oxidative stress. HFD increased hepatic expression of key gluconeogenic genes and the increase was most dramatic by HFD with little carbs, and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis prevented the HFD-induced insulin resistance. In cultured cells, development of insulin resistance induced by a pathological level of insulin was prevented in the absence of fat. Together, fat is essential for development of insulin resistance and dietary carb is not necessary for HFD-induced insulin resistance due to the presence of hepatic gluconeogenesis but a very small amount of it can promote HFD-induced insulin resistance to a maximal level."
https://openalex.org/W1982568057,"Quaternary glacial oscillations are known to have caused population size fluctuations in many temperate species. Species from subtropical and tropical regions are, however, considerably less studied, despite representing most of the biodiversity hotspots in the world including many highly threatened by anthropogenic activities such as hunting. These regions, consequently, pose a significant knowledge gap in terms of how their fauna have typically responded to past climatic changes. We studied an endangered primate, the Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala, from the subtropical southern edge of the Tibetan plateau, a part of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, also known to be highly threatened due to rampant hunting. We employed a 534 bp-long mitochondrial DNA sequence and 22 autosomal microsatellite loci to investigate the factors that have potentially shaped the demographic history of the species. Analysing the genetic data with traditional statistical methods and advance Bayesian inferential approaches, we demonstrate a limited effect of past glacial fluctuations on the demographic history of the species before the last glacial maximum, approximately 20,000 years ago. This was, however, immediately followed by a significant population expansion possibly due to warmer climatic conditions, approximately 15,000 years ago. These changes may thus represent an apparent balance between that displayed by the relatively climatically stable tropics and those of the more severe, temperate environments of the past. This study also draws attention to the possibility that a cold-tolerant species like the Arunachal macaque, which could withstand historical climate fluctuations and grow once the climate became conducive, may actually be extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic exploitation, as is perhaps indicated by its Holocene ca. 30-fold population decline, approximately 3,500 years ago. Our study thus provides a quantitative appraisal of these demographically important events, emphasising the ability to potentially infer the occurrence of two separate historical events from contemporary genetic data."

https://openalex.org/W2002479108,"Electric guitar playing is ubiquitous in practically all modern music genres. In the hands of an experienced player, electric guitars can sound as expressive and distinct as a human voice. Unlike other more quantised instruments where pitch is a discrete function, guitarists can incorporate micro-tonality and, as a result, vibrato and sting-bending are idiosyncratic hallmarks of a player. Similarly, a wide variety of techniques unique to the electric guitar have emerged. While the mechano-acoustics of stringed instruments and vibrating strings are well studied, there has been comparatively little work dedicated to the underlying physics of unique electric guitar techniques and strings, nor the mechanical factors influencing vibrato, string-bending, fretting force and whammy-bar dynamics. In this work, models for these processes are derived and the implications for guitar and string design discussed. The string-bending model is experimentally validated using a variety of strings and vibrato dynamics are simulated. The implications of these findings on the configuration and design of guitars is also discussed."

Study Design A decision analytic model was applied to simulate cohorts of 10,000 HIV-infected pregnant women to compare the cost-effectiveness of two different HIV strategy combinations: (1) Women were tested and treated promptly at any time during pregnancy (Promptly treated cohort). (2) Women did not get testing or treatment until after delivery and appropriate standard treatments were offered as a remedy (Remedy cohort). Replacement feeding or exclusive breastfeeding was assigned in both strategies. Outcome measures included the number of infant HIV cases averted, the cost per infant HIV case averted, and the cost per life year(LY) saved from the interventions. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the uncertainty ranges of all outcomes. Results The remedy strategy does not particularly cost-effective. Compared with the untreated baseline cohort which leads to 1127 infected infants, 698 (61.93%) and 110 (9.76%) of pediatric HIV cases are averted in the promptly treated cohort and remedy cohort respectively, with incremental cost-effectiveness of $68.51 and $118.33 per LY, respectively. With or without the antenatal testing and treatments, breastfeeding is less cost-effective ($193.26 per LY) than replacement feeding ($134.88 per LY), without considering the impact of willingness to pay. Conclusion Compared with the prompt treatments, remedy in labor or during the postnatal period is less cost-effective. Antenatal HIV testing and prompt treatments and avoiding breastfeeding are the best strategies. Although encouraging mothers to practice replacement feeding in South Africa is far from easy and the advantages of breastfeeding can not be ignored, we still suggest choosing replacement feeding as far as possible."

The TfdEI and TfdEII kcat/Km ratios were 0.12 µM−1s−1and 0.13 µM−1s−1 and 0.216 µM−1s−1 and 0.094 µM−1s−1 for for cis- and trans-dienelactone, respectively. The kcat/Km ratios for cis-dienelactone show that both enzymes catalyse the reaction with same efficiency even though Km value differs significantly. This is the first report to characterize and compare reaction kinetics of purified TfdEI and TfdEII from Cupriavidus necator JMP134 and may be helpful for further exploration of their catalytic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2009954001,"Introduction Leishmaniasis is considered as one of the six most important infectious diseases because of its high detection coefficient and ability to produce deformities. In most cases, mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) occurs as a consequence of cutaneous leishmaniasis. If left untreated, mucosal lesions can leave sequelae, interfering in the swallowing, breathing, voice and speech processes and requiring rehabilitation. Objective To describe the anatomical characteristics and voice quality of ML patients. Materials and Methods A descriptive transversal study was conducted in a cohort of ML patients treated at the Laboratory for Leishmaniasis Surveillance of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases - Fiocruz, between 2010 and 2013. The patients were submitted to otorhinolaryngologic clinical examination by endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tract and to speech-language assessment through directed anamnesis, auditory perception, phonation times and vocal acoustic analysis. The variables of interest were epidemiologic (sex and age) and clinic (lesion location, associated symptoms and voice quality. Results 26 patients under ML treatment and monitored by speech therapists were studied. 21 (81%) were male and five (19%) female, with ages ranging from 15 to 78 years (54.5+15.0 years). The lesions were distributed in the following structures 88.5% nasal, 38.5% oral, 34.6% pharyngeal and 19.2% laryngeal, with some patients presenting lesions in more than one anatomic site. The main complaint was nasal obstruction (73.1%), followed by dysphonia (38.5%), odynophagia (30.8%) and dysphagia (26.9%). 23 patients (84.6%) presented voice quality perturbations. Dysphonia was significantly associated to lesions in the larynx, pharynx and oral cavity. Conclusion We observed that vocal quality perturbations are frequent in patients with mucosal leishmaniasis, even without laryngeal lesions; they are probably associated to disorders of some resonance structures (larynx, pharynx and nasal and oral cavities) or even to compensation mechanisms caused by the presence of lesions in the upper airways and digestive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2011266225,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that can regulate expressions of their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we propose a tri-component strategy that combines the conservation of microRNAs, homology of mRNA coding regions, and conserved microRNA binding sites in the 3′ untranslated regions to discover conserved microRNA-mRNA interactions. To validate the performance of our conservation strategy, we collected the experimentally validated microRNA-mRNA interactions from three databases as the golden standard. We found that the proposed strategy can improve the performance of existing target prediction algorithms by approximately 2–4 fold. In addition, we demonstrated that the proposed strategy could efficiently retain highly confident interactions from the intersection results of the existing algorithms and filter out the possible false positive predictions in the union one. Furthermore, this strategy can facilitate our ability to trace the homologues in different species that are targeted by the same miRNA family because it combines these three features to identify the conserved miRNA-mRNA interactions during evolution. Through an extensive application of the proposed conservation strategy to a study of the miR-1/206 regulatory network, we demonstrate that the target mRNA recruiting process could be associated with expansion of miRNA family during its evolution. We also uncovered the functional evolution of the miR-1/206 regulatory network. In this network, the early targeted genes tend to participate in more general and development-related functions. In summary, the conservation strategy is capable of helping to highlight the highly confident miRNA-mRNA interactions and can be further applied to reveal the evolutionary features of miRNA regulatory network and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2090302732,"Visual fusion is the process in which differing but compatible binocular information is transformed into a unified percept. Even though this is at the basis of binocular vision, the underlying neural processes are, as yet, poorly understood. In our study we therefore aimed to investigate neural correlates of visual fusion. To this end, we presented binocularly compatible, fusible (BF), and incompatible, rivaling (BR) stimuli, as well as an intermediate stimulus type containing both binocularly fusible and monocular, incompatible elements (BFR). Comparing BFR stimuli with BF and BR stimuli, respectively, we were able to disentangle brain responses associated with either visual fusion or rivalry. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain responses to these stimulus classes in the visual cortex, and investigated them in detail at various retinal eccentricities. Compared with BF stimuli, the response to BFR stimuli was elevated in visual cortical areas V1 and V2, but not in V3 and V4 - implying that the response to monocular stimulus features decreased from V1 to V4. Compared to BR stimuli, the response to BFR stimuli decreased with increasing eccentricity, specifically within V3 and V4. Taken together, it seems that although the processing of exclusively monocular information decreases from V1 to V4, the processing of binocularly fused information increases from earlier to later visual areas. Our findings suggest the presence of an inhibitory neural mechanism which, depending on the presence of fusion, acts differently on the processing of monocular information."
