https://openalex.org/W2154610441,"Unwelcome Dominance Stratospheric ozone is depleted by many different chemicals; most prominently, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) responsible for causing the Antarctic ozone hole. Nitrous oxide is also an ozone-depleting substance that has natural sources in addition to anthropogenic ones. Moreover, unlike CFCs, its use and emission are not regulated by the Montreal Protocol, which has helped to reverse the rate of growth of the ozone hole. Surprisingly, Ravishankara et al. (p. 123 , published online 27 August; see the Perspective by Wuebbles ) now show that nitrous oxide is the single greatest ozone-depleting substance that, if its emissions are not controlled, is expected to remain the dominant ozone-depleting substance throughout the 21st century. Reducing nitrous oxide emissions would thus enhance the rate of recovery of the ozone hole and reduce the anthropogenic forcing of climate."

The scanning tunneling microscope images atomic-scale features on surfaces, but resolving single atoms within an adsorbed molecule remains a great challenge because the tunneling current is primarily sensitive to the local electron density of states close to the Fermi level. We demonstrate imaging of molecules with unprecedented atomic resolution by probing the short-range chemical forces with use of noncontact atomic force microscopy. The key step is functionalizing the microscope's tip apex with suitable, atomically well-defined terminations, such as CO molecules. Our experimental findings are corroborated by ab initio density functional theory calculations. Comparison with theory shows that Pauli repulsion is the source of the atomic resolution, whereas van der Waals and electrostatic forces only add a diffuse attractive background."
https://openalex.org/W2033002674,"Hidden Pockets of Resistance Groups of bacteria indulge in gene swapping at frequencies correlated with prevailing selection pressures and phylogenetic relatedness. When assaulted by antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes become favored currency for exchange among bacteria. During sequencing of human gut microflora, Sommer et al. (p. 1128 ) found a very large reservoir of distinct genes that, when put into Escherichia coli , conferred resistance to a wide range of drugs. By contrast, analysis of the culturable aerobic gut microbiome, which constitutes a tiny fraction of the entire gut flora, revealed resistance genes highly similar to those harbored by human pathogens. Although there is a risk of novel modes of antibiotic resistance emerging from this reservoir, because they are evolutionarily distant, gene transfer between pathogens and the poorly known majority of the microbiome might actually be quite restricted."

https://openalex.org/W2124488916,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in cancer initiation and progression via their ability to affect expression of genes and proteins that regulate cell proliferation and/or cell death. Transcription of the three miRNA miR-34 family members was recently found to be directly regulated by p53. Among the target proteins regulated by miR-34 are Notch pathway proteins and Bcl-2, suggesting the possibility of a role for miR-34 in the maintenance and survival of cancer stem cells.We examined the roles of miR-34 in p53-mutant human pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa2 and BxPC3, and the potential link to pancreatic cancer stem cells. Restoration of miR-34 expression in the pancreatic cancer cells by either transfection of miR-34 mimics or infection with lentiviral miR-34-MIF downregulated Bcl-2 and Notch1/2. miR-34 restoration significantly inhibited clonogenic cell growth and invasion, induced apoptosis and G1 and G2/M arrest in cell cycle, and sensitized the cells to chemotherapy and radiation. We identified that CD44+/CD133+ MiaPaCa2 cells are enriched with tumorsphere-forming and tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem/progenitor cells with high levels of Notch/Bcl-2 and loss of miR-34. More significantly, miR-34 restoration led to an 87% reduction of the tumor-initiating cell population, accompanied by significant inhibition of tumorsphere growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo.Our results demonstrate that miR-34 may restore, at least in part, the tumor suppressing function of the p53 in p53-deficient human pancreatic cancer cells. Our data support the view that miR-34 may be involved in pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal, potentially via the direct modulation of downstream targets Bcl-2 and Notch, implying that miR-34 may play an important role in pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal and/or cell fate determination. Restoration of miR-34 may hold significant promise as a novel molecular therapy for human pancreatic cancer with loss of p53-miR34, potentially via inhibiting pancreatic cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995117011,"Regulating Akt The protein kinase Akt is activated in response to receptor-activated generation of the signaling second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and has roles in regulation of diverse processes from metabolism and cell survival to transcription and tumorigenesis. Yang et al. (p. 1134 ; see the Perspective by Restuccia and Hemmings ) report a previously unrecognized mode of regulation of Akt: covalent modification of Akt by linkage to lysine 63 of ubiquitin molecules. Such ubiquitination of Akt promotes localization to the cell membrane and consequent activation in cells stimulated with growth factors. TRAF6 (TNF receptor–associated factor 6) was implicated as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination of Akt. Ubiquitination of Akt may influence its role in cancer cells: A mutant form of Akt associated with human cancer showed increased ubiquitination, and depletion of TRAF6 decreased tumorigenicity of a prostate cancer cell line in a mouse cancer model."

https://openalex.org/W2001862744,"More Than the Sum of the Parts The radiative output of the Sun varies distinctly with the 11-year cycle of sunspots, although the change in energy output is small—less than a tenth of a percent in magnitude. Nevertheless, that small variation produces changes in sea surface temperatures two or three times as large as it should, and the mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear. Meehl et al. (p. 1114 ; see the news story by Kerr ) employ three global, coupled climate models to simulate this phenomenon. Two mechanisms appear to act in conjunction to cause this ocean response: a change in the abundance of stratospheric ozone owing to fluctuations of shortwave solar forcing; and a coupled surface ocean-atmosphere response. This combination of effects enhances precipitation maxima, reduces low-latitude cloud cover, and lowers the temperature of surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean, resulting in the larger warm-to-cold variation."

https://openalex.org/W2055353932,"NeuN (neuronal nuclei) is a neuron-specific nuclear protein which is identified by immunoreactivity with a monoclonal antibody, anti-NeuN. Anti-NeuN has been used widely as a reliable tool to detect most postmitotic neuronal cell types in neuroscience, developmental biology, and stem cell research fields as well as diagnostic histopathology. To date, however, the identity of its antigen, NeuN itself, has been unknown. Here, we identify NeuN as the Fox-3 gene product by providing the following evidence: 1) Mass spectrometry analysis of anti-NeuN immunoreactive protein yields the Fox-3 amino acid sequence. 2) Recombinant Fox-3 is recognized by anti-NeuN. 3) Short hairpin RNAs targeting Fox-3 mRNA down-regulate NeuN expression. 4) Fox-3 expression is restricted to neural tissues. 5) Anti-Fox-3 immunostaining and anti-NeuN immunostaining overlap completely in neuronal nuclei. We also show that a protein cross-reactive with anti-NeuN is the synaptic vesicle protein, synapsin I. Anti-NeuN recognizes synapsin I in immunoblots with one order of magnitude lower affinity than Fox-3, and does not recognize synapsin I using immunohistology. Fox-3 (also called hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 3 and D11Bwg0517e) contains an RNA recognition motif and is classified as a member of the Fox-1 gene family that binds specifically to an RNA element, UGCAUG. We demonstrate that Fox-3 functions as a splicing regulator using neural cell-specific alternative splicing of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA as a model. Identification of NeuN as Fox-3 clarifies an important element of neurobiology research."
https://openalex.org/W2167702845,"A single-base pair resolution silkworm genetic variation map was constructed from 40 domesticated and wild silkworms, each sequenced to approximately threefold coverage, representing 99.88% of the genome. We identified ~16 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, many indels, and structural variations. We find that the domesticated silkworms are clearly genetically differentiated from the wild ones, but they have maintained large levels of genetic variability, suggesting a short domestication event involving a large number of individuals. We also identified signals of selection at 354 candidate genes that may have been important during domestication, some of which have enriched expression in the silk gland, midgut, and testis. These data add to our understanding of the domestication processes and may have applications in devising pest control strategies and advancing the use of silkworms as efficient bioreactors."
https://openalex.org/W1994730862,"Dog Coats Shed Genetic Secrets The coats of domestic dogs show great variation—long, short, straight, wavy, curly, wiry, or smooth. To investigate how this variation arises, Cadieu et al. (p. 150 , published online 27 August) performed genome-wide association studies on 80 different dog breeds. The coat phenotype could be dissected into three simple traits of length, curl, and growth pattern or texture with each trait controlled by one major gene, FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor-5), KRT71 (keratin-71), and RSPO2 (R-spondin-2), respectively. In combination, variants in these three genes alone account for the vast majority of the coat phenotypes in purebred dogs in the United States. Thus, a small number of simply inherited traits can be remixed to create extraordinary phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2023869711,"'Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are thought to have formed at some distance from their host stars and to have migrated inwards at a later date. These planets provide new perspectives on the evolution of planetary systems, and the discovery of WASP-18b, the closest-orbiting and most extreme hot Jupiter yet, provides a glimpse of what may be a planet nearing the end of its life. With a close orbit, high mass (ten times that of Jupiter), and brief (0.94-day) orbital period, WASP-18b has the strongest tidal interaction of any known star–planet system. We appear to be seeing WASP-18b in a rare and short-lived state as it spirals towards its host star, destined to be destroyed within the host star's lifetime. Alternatively, the tidal dissipation this system — and perhaps other hot Jupiters — must be much weaker than that in our Solar System. 'Hot Jupiters' abound in lists of known extrasolar planets. Those closest to their parent stars have strong tidal interactions, leading to the suggestion that systems such as OGLE-TR-56 could be used as tests of tidal dissipation theory. Here, the discovery of planet WASP-18b is reported, with an orbital period of 0.94 days and a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of OGLE-TR-56b. Either WASP-18 is in a rare, short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system must be weaker than in the Solar System. The ‘hot Jupiters’ that abound in lists of known extrasolar planets are thought to have formed far from their host stars, but migrate inwards through interactions with the proto-planetary disk from which they were born1,2, or by an alternative mechanism such as planet–planet scattering3. The hot Jupiters closest to their parent stars, at orbital distances of only ∼0.02 astronomical units, have strong tidal interactions4,5, and systems such as OGLE-TR-56 have been suggested as tests of tidal dissipation theory6,7. Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94 days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses (10 MJup), resulting in a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of planet OGLE-TR-56b. Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 106, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star. Therefore either WASP-18 is in a rare, exceptionally short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system (and possibly other hot-Jupiter systems) must be much weaker than in the Solar System."
https://openalex.org/W2010097127,"Life Histories to Suit Nematode worms can profoundly manipulate their life histories in several ways. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans has two genders: males and hermaphrodites. Some clues for the evolution of this peculiar mating system have been revealed by Baldi et al. (p. 1002 ), who turned females of a related species, Caenorhabditis remanei , into hermaphrodites by modifying a gene involved in making sperm and another gene required for activating the spermatids. In most animals, the germ line is fully established during adulthood and a reproductive period is determined, at least in part, by aging of the germ line and the viability of oocytes. The reproductive longevity of hermaphrodite C. elegans can be increased at least 15-fold by starvation. Angelo and Van Gilst (p. 954 , published online 27 August; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) found that in starved worms, the germline component of the reproductive system is actively killed, with the exception of a small set of preserved stem cells. When the worms are able to feed again, these cells regenerate into an entirely new and functional germ line. But this is not all. Kim et al. (p. 994 , published online 1 October; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) show that subsets of the complex mixture of structurally related molecules in dauer pheromone act via distinct G protein–coupled receptors either to initiate longterm effects on development and physiology by modulating the neuroendocrine axis, or to trigger short-term acute effects on behavior by altering neuronal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2064606556,"The end-Permian mass extinction removed more than 80% of marine genera. Ammonoid cephalopods were among the organisms most affected by this crisis. The analysis of a global diversity data set of ammonoid genera covering about 106 million years centered on the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) shows that Triassic ammonoids actually reached levels of diversity higher than in the Permian less than 2 million years after the PTB. The data favor a hierarchical rather than logistic model of diversification coupled with a niche incumbency hypothesis. This explosive and nondelayed diversification contrasts with the slow and delayed character of the Triassic biotic recovery as currently illustrated for other, mainly benthic groups such as bivalves and gastropods."
https://openalex.org/W2031215445,"Adapting Coat Color Simple phenotypic changes can often be the target of selection—for example, variations in coat color that provide protection against detection by predators. Linnen et al. (p. 1095 ) explore the underlying molecular mechanisms behind the production of pale deer mice living on the light-colored Nebraska Sand Hills. The mice that live on the sand are significantly lighter in color than conspecifics living nearby on darker soils. This lighter color was found to be due to de novo changes at the Agouti coat color locus. Thus, rapid adaptive change does not always rely on preexisting genetic variation."

(p. 120 , published online 27 August) show that a highly selective catalyst can assemble through hydrogen bonding from a small collection of small molecules in the absence of metals. In the solid state, the catalyst comprises a central chiral phosphonium cation bound to two phenol molecules, which in turn bind a charge-compensating phenoxide ion. In solution, an oxazolone derivative appears to be able to bind in place of the phenoxide, spurring its stereoselective addition to a broad range of esters."
https://openalex.org/W2158748919,"Background The comparison of human related communication skills of socialized canids may help to understand the evolution and the epigenesis of gesture comprehension in humans. To reconcile previously contradicting views on the origin of dogs' outstanding performance in utilizing human gestures, we suggest that dog-wolf differences should be studied in a more complex way. Methodology/Principal Findings We present data both on the performance and the behaviour of dogs and wolves of different ages in a two-way object choice test. Characteristic behavioural differences showed that for wolves it took longer to establish eye contact with the pointing experimenter, they struggled more with the handler, and pups also bit her more before focusing on the human's signal. The performance of similarly hand-reared 8-week-old dogs and wolves did not differ in utilizing the simpler proximal momentary pointing. However, when tested with the distal momentary pointing, 4-month-old pet dogs outperformed the same aged hand reared wolves. Thus early and intensive socialisation does not diminish differences between young dogs and wolves in behaviour and performance. Socialised adult wolves performed similarly well as dogs in this task without pretraining. The success of adult wolves was accompanied with increased willingness to cooperate. Conclusion/Significance Thus, we provide evidence for the first time that socialised adult wolves are as successful in relying on distal momentary pointing as adult pet dogs. However, the delayed emergence of utilising human distal momentary pointing in wolves shows that these wild canines react to a lesser degree to intensive socialisation in contrast to dogs, which are able to control agonistic behaviours and inhibition of actions in a food related task early in development. We suggest a “synergistic” hypothesis, claiming that positive feedback processes (both evolutionary and epigenetic) have increased the readiness of dogs to attend to humans, providing the basis for dog-human communication."
https://openalex.org/W2001117361,"MicroRNAs are a class of sophisticated regulators of gene expression, acting as post-transcriptional inhibitors that recognize their target mRNAs through base pairing with short regions along the 3'UTRs. Several microRNAs are tissue specific, suggesting a specialized role in tissue differentiation or maintenance, and quite a few are critically involved in tumorigenesis. We studied miR-128, a brain-enriched microRNA, in retinoic acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cells, and we found that this microRNA is up-regulated in treated cells, where it down-modulates the expression of two proteins involved in the migratory potential of neural cells: Reelin and DCX. Consistently, miR-128 ectopic overexpression suppressed Reelin and DCX, whereas the LNA antisense-mediated miR-128 knockdown caused the two proteins to increase. Ectopic miR-128 overexpression reduced neuroblastoma cell motility and invasiveness, and impaired cell growth. Finally, the analysis of a small series of primary human neuroblastomas showed an association between high levels of miR-128 expression and favorable features, such as favorable Shimada category or very young age at diagnosis. Thus, we provide evidence for a role for miR-128 in the molecular events modulating neuroblastoma progression and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2004628780,"A possible explanation for the existence of the cuprate ""pseudogap"" state is that it is a d-wave superconductor without quantum phase rigidity. Transport and thermodynamic studies provide compelling evidence that supports this proposal, but few spectroscopic explorations of it have been made. One spectroscopic signature of d-wave superconductivity is the particle-hole symmetric ""octet"" of dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference modulations. Here we report on this octet's evolution from low temperatures to well into the underdoped pseudogap regime. No pronounced changes occur in the octet phenomenology at the superconductor's critical temperature Tc, and it survives up to at least temperature T ~ 1.5Tc. In the pseudogap regime, we observe the detailed phenomenology that was theoretically predicted for quasiparticle interference in a phase-incoherent d-wave superconductor. Thus, our results not only provide spectroscopic evidence to confirm and extend the transport and thermodynamics studies, but they also open the way for spectroscopic explorations of phase fluctuation rates, their effects on the Fermi arc, and the fundamental source of the phase fluctuations that suppress superconductivity in underdoped cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W2025134964,"Seven races of Striga gesnerioides parasitic on cowpea, a major food and forage legume in sub-Saharan Africa, have been identified. Race-specific resistance of cowpea to Striga involves a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat domain resistance protein encoded by the RSG3-301 gene. Knockdown of RSG3-301 expression by virus-induced gene silencing in the multirace-resistant cowpea cultivar B301 results in the failure of RSG3-301-silenced plants to mount a hypersensitive response and promotes parasite necrosis when challenged with Striga race SG3, whereas the resistance response to races SG2 and SG5 is unaltered. Our findings indicate that a gene-for-gene resistance mechanism is operating in these unique plant-plant associations."
https://openalex.org/W2073839243,"Background Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are normally implemented in a univariate framework and analyze different phenotypes in isolation. This univariate approach ignores the potential genetic correlation between important disease traits. Hence this approach is difficult to detect pleiotropic genes, which may exist for obesity and osteoporosis, two common diseases of major public health importance that are closely correlated genetically. Principal Findings To identify such pleiotropic genes and the key mechanistic links between the two diseases, we here performed the first bivariate GWAS of obesity and osteoporosis. We searched for genes underlying co-variation of the obesity phenotype, body mass index (BMI), with the osteoporosis risk phenotype, hip bone mineral density (BMD), scanning ∼380,000 SNPs in 1,000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasians, including 499 males and 501 females. We identified in the male subjects two SNPs in intron 1 of the SOX6 (SRY-box 6) gene, rs297325 and rs4756846, which were bivariately associated with both BMI and hip BMD, achieving p values of 6.82×10−7 and 1.47×10−6, respectively. The two SNPs ranked at the top in significance for bivariate association with BMI and hip BMD in the male subjects among all the ∼380,000 SNPs examined genome-wide. The two SNPs were replicated in a Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort containing 3,355 Caucasians (1,370 males and 1,985 females) from 975 families. In the FHS male subjects, the two SNPs achieved p values of 0.03 and 0.02, respectively, for bivariate association with BMI and femoral neck BMD. Interestingly, SOX6 was previously found to be essential to both cartilage formation/chondrogenesis and obesity-related insulin resistance, suggesting the gene's dual role in both bone and fat. Conclusions Our findings, together with the prior biological evidence, suggest the SOX6 gene's importance in co-regulation of obesity and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2050785224,"Many litter-decay fungi secrete heme-thiolate peroxygenases that oxidize various organic chemicals, but little is known about the role or mechanism of these enzymes. We found that the extracellular peroxygenase of Agrocybe aegerita catalyzed the H2O2-dependent cleavage of environmentally significant ethers, including methyl t-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxane. Experiments with tetrahydrofuran showed the reaction was a two-electron oxidation that generated one aldehyde group and one alcohol group, yielding the ring-opened product 4-hydroxybutanal. Investigations with several model substrates provided information about the route for ether cleavage: (a) steady-state kinetics results with methyl 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ether, which was oxidized to 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, gave parallel double reciprocal plots suggestive of a ping-pong mechanism (K(m)((peroxide)), 1.99 +/- 0.25 mM; K(m)((ether)), 1.43 +/- 0.23 mM; k(cat), 720 +/- 87 s(-1)), (b) the cleavage of methyl 4-nitrobenzyl ether in the presence of H2(18)O2 resulted in incorporation of 18O into the carbonyl group of the resulting 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, and (c) the demethylation of 1-methoxy-4-trideuteromethoxybenzene showed an observed intramolecular deuterium isotope effect [(k(H)/k(D))(obs)] of 11.9 +/- 0.4. These results suggest a hydrogen abstraction and oxygen rebound mechanism that oxidizes ethers to hemiacetals, which subsequently hydrolyze. The peroxygenase appeared to lack activity on macromolecular ethers, but otherwise exhibited a broad substrate range. It may accordingly have a role in the biodegradation of natural and anthropogenic low molecular weight ethers in soils and plant litter."
https://openalex.org/W2168406391,"Condensins I and II in vertebrates are essential ATP-dependent complexes necessary for chromosome condensation in mitosis. Condensins depletion is known to perturb structure and function of centromeres, however the mechanism of this functional link remains elusive. Depletion of condensin activity is now shown to result in a significant loss of loading of CENP-A, the histone H3 variant found at active centromeres and the proposed epigenetic mark of centromere identity. Absence of condensins and/or CENP-A insufficiency produced a specific kinetochore defect, such that a functional mitotic checkpoint cannot prevent chromosome missegregation resulting from improper attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Spindle microtubule-dependent deformation of both inner kinetochores and the HEC1/Ndc80 microtubule-capturing module, then results in kinetochore separation from the Aurora B pool and ensuing reduced kinase activity at centromeres. Moreover, recovery from mitosis-inhibition by monastrol revealed a high incidence of merotelic attachment that was nearly identical with condensin depletion, Aurora B inactivation, or both, indicating that the Aurora B dysfunction is the key defect leading to chromosome missegregation in condensin-depleted cells. Thus, beyond a requirement for global chromosome condensation, condensins play a pivotal role in centromere assembly, proper spatial positioning of microtubule-capturing modules and positioning complexes of the inner centromere versus kinetochore plates."
https://openalex.org/W2133398442,"Background Despite progress in adjuvant chemotherapy in the recent decades, pancreatic and colon cancers remain common causes of death worldwide. Bacterial toxins, which specifically bind to cell surface-exposed glycosphingolipids, are a potential novel therapy. We determined the expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer/CD77), the Shiga toxin receptor, in human pancreatic and colon adenocarcinomas. Methodology/Principal Findings Tissue lipid extracts of matched pairs of cancerous and adjacent normal tissue from 21 pancreatic and 16 colon cancer patients were investigated with thin-layer chromatography overlay assay combined with a novel mass spectrometry approach. Gb3Cer/CD77 was localized by immunofluorescence microscopy of cryosections from malignant and corresponding healthy tissue samples. 62% of pancreatic and 81% of colon adenocarcinomas showed increased Gb3Cer/CD77 expression, whereas 38% and 19% of malignant pancreas and colon tissue, respectively, did not, indicating an association of this marker with neoplastic transformation. Also, Gb3Cer/CD77 was associated with poor differentiation (G>2) in pancreatic cancer (P = 0.039). Mass spectrometric analysis evidenced enhanced expression of Gb3Cer/CD77 with long (C24) and short chain fatty acids (C16) in malignant tissues and pointed to the presence of hydroxylated fatty acid lipoforms, which are proposed to be important for receptor targeting. They could be detected in 86% of pancreatic and about 19% of colon adenocarcinomas. Immunohistology of tissue cryosections indicated tumor-association of these receptors. Conclusions/Significance Enhanced expression of Gb3Cer/CD77 in most pancreatic and colon adenocarcinomas prompts consideration of Shiga toxin, its B-subunit or B-subunit-derivatives as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these challenging malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2113023213,"Communication is an important aspect of human life, allowing us to powerfully coordinate our behaviour with that of others. Boiled down to its mere essentials, communication entails transferring a mental content from one brain to another. Spoken language obviously plays an important role in communication between human individuals. Manual gestures however often aid the semantic interpretation of the spoken message, and gestures may have played a central role in the earlier evolution of communication. Here we used the social game of charades to investigate the neural basis of gestural communication by having participants produce and interpret meaningful gestures while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While participants decoded observed gestures, the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS: premotor, parietal and posterior mid-temporal cortex), associated with motor simulation, and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), associated with mentalizing and agency attribution, were significantly recruited. Of these areas only the pMNS was recruited during the production of gestures. This suggests that gestural communication relies on a combination of simulation and, during decoding, mentalizing/agency attribution brain areas. Comparing the decoding of gestures with a condition in which participants viewed the same gestures with an instruction not to interpret the gestures showed that although parts of the pMNS responded more strongly during active decoding, most of the pMNS and the TPJ did not show such significant task effects. This suggests that the mere observation of gestures recruits most of the system involved in voluntary interpretation."

Extracellular Cl− also inhibited ENaC in Na+-transporting epithelia. The anion selectivity sequence was SCN− < SO42− < H2PO4− < F− < I− < Cl− < Br−.

ENaC is a member of the DEG/ENaC family of ion channels. A common structural feature of these channels is a large extracellular domain that plays a critical role in channel gating. For example, in ASICs, the extracellular domain functions as a receptor for protons, which transiently activate the channel by titrating residues that form an acidic pocket (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). FaNaCh is a ligand-gated family member in Helix aspersa, activated by the peptide FMRFamide (8Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P.

However, a convergence of data indicate that ENaC gating is modulated by a variety of molecules that bind to or modify its extracellular domains, including proteases (10Vallet V. Chraibi A.

These findings suggest that the ENaC extracellular domain might regulate epithelial Na+ transport by sensing and integrating diverse signals in the extracellular environment. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that ENaC activity is regulated by changes in the extracellular Cl− concentration. Several observations suggested that Cl− might be a strong candidate to regulate the channel. First, transport of Na+ and Cl− are often coupled to maintain electroneutrality. Second, ENaC is exposed to large changes in extracellular Cl− concentration. For example, in the kidney collecting duct, the urine Cl− concentration varies widely (19Rose B.D. Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders. McGraw-Hill, New York1984: 274-275Google Scholar). As the predominant anion, its concentration parallels that of Na+ in most clinical states. However, under conditions of metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, the Na+ and Cl− concentrations can become dissociated as a result of increased urinary bicarbonate (alkalosis) or ammonium (acidosis) (19Rose B.D. Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders. McGraw-Hill, New York1984: 274-275Google Scholar). Thus, ENaC is well positioned to respond to changes in Cl− concentration. Third, crystallization of ASIC1a revealed a binding site for a Cl− ion at the base of the thumb domain (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The Cl− is coordinated by Arg-310 and Glu-314 from one subunit and Lys-212 from an adjacent subunit. Although the functional role of Cl− binding to ASIC1a is unknown, it supports the hypothesis that extracellular Cl− might regulate the activity of DEG/ENaC ion channels. cDNAs for human αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC in pMT3 were cloned as described previously (2McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations αH418A, βR388A, γH396A, and γH233R were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene) and sequenced in the University of Iowa DNA Core. Oocytes were harvested from albino Xenopus laevis females and manually defolliculated following a 1-h treatment with 0.75 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Following nuclear injection of cDNAs encoding αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC (0.02 μg/μl each), cells were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) for 20–24 h prior to study. Oocytes were voltage-clamped (two-electrode voltage clamp), and currents were amplified with an oocyte clamp OC-725C (Warner Instruments), digitized with a MacLab/200 interface (ADInstruments), and recorded and analyzed with the Chart software (ADInstruments). The bathing solution was grounded with 3 m KCl-agar bridges to prevent junction potentials during changes in Cl− concentration. Unless otherwise noted, recordings were done at −60 mV in a 116 mm NaCl solution (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Low Na+ solutions (1 mm NaCl, 115 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine Cl or SO4, pH adjusted with HCl or H2SO4) were used as indicated in the legend for Fig. 5. Low chloride solutions were prepared by replacing the anion of the sodium salt with I−, Br−, F−, SCN−, H2PO4−, or SO42− and d-mannitol (to balance osmolarity). Amiloride-sensitive current was determined by adding 10 μm amiloride to the bathing solution. The pH and chloride-induced changes in amiloride-sensitive current were calculated as the -fold increase/decrease relative to the baseline current in pH 7.4, 116 NaCl solution, just prior to each test solution application. This was done to reduce the effect of time-dependent current rundown. The resulting data were plotted and fit to the Hill equation using the IGOR Pro software (WaveMetrics Inc.). Na+ self-inhibition was measured by rapidly changing the bathing solution from low sodium (1 mm) to high sodium (116 mm) and quantitated as (peak current −steady state current)/peak current. H441 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown on 0.6-cm2 permeable filter supports (Millipore) in RPMI with 8.5% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C for 5 days. Primary human airway epithelia were isolated from the trachea and bronchi of donor lungs and grown at the air-liquid interface of collagen-coated permeable filter supports, as described previously (21Karp P.H. Moninger T.O. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J.L. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 188: 115-137PubMed Google Scholar). Aprotinin (26 μg/ml) was present in the apical solution for 2 h prior to study. Short circuit Na+ current was measured in modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.) using an EC-825 epithelial voltage clamp amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.). Currents were digitized with a PowerLab interface (ADInstruments) and recorded and analyzed with the Chart software (ADInstruments). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) or with 58 mm Na2SO4, 58 mm d-mannitol, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) at 37 °C. The amiloride-sensitive short circuit current was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (10 μm) in the apical bathing solution. To determine whether extracellular Cl− modulates ENaC current, we replaced Cl− with other anions and recorded ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing human αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC. When Cl− was replaced by SO42−, amiloride-sensitive ENaC current increased by 2.4-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). This increase was rapid and reversible (see Fig. 4B). Replacement of Cl− with H2PO4− and SCN− also increased ENaC current (Fig. 1B). As a control, Cl− replacement did not significantly alter current in oocytes not expressing ENaC (not shown). We also excluded the possibility that SO42− and H2PO4− altered ENaC current by lowering Ca2+ activity in the bathing solution; the effect of Cl− replacement was not reduced when Ca2+ activity was held constant (not shown).FIGURE 4DEG mutation and proteolytic cleavage abolish response to Cl−.

As extracellular Cl− increased (replacing SO42−), there was a dose-dependent decrease in ENaC current. The maximal fraction of ENaC current inhibited by Cl− was 0.73, and half-maximal inhibition occurred at a Cl− concentration of 29.5 ± 0.25 mm. The data indicate that Cl− inhibits ENaC current at concentrations found in the kidney collecting duct and other epithelia (19Rose B.D. Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders. McGraw-Hill, New York1984: 274-275Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that removal of extracellular Cl− could alter ENaC current by reducing the concentration of intracellular Cl− (22Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To exclude this possibility, we voltage-clamped cells at +30 mV to prevent movement of Cl− out of the cell. Under these conditions, replacement of Cl− with SO42− still increased amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 1D). This result indicates that changes in extracellular Cl− are sufficient to alter ENaC current. We asked whether other anions could substitute for Cl−. When compared with SO42−, I−, Br−, and F− each decreased ENaC current. F− and I− decreased current to a smaller extent than Cl−, and Br− produced a larger decrease in current (Fig. 1E). Thus, the anion selectivity sequence for ENaC inhibition is SCN− < SO42− < H2PO4− < F− < I− < Cl− < Br−. To test the effect of extracellular chloride on native ENaC in epithelial cells, we measured short circuit current. In a human lung carcinoma cell line (H441), we measured amiloride-sensitive current when the apical and basolateral membranes were bathed in NaCl (Fig. 2A). When Cl− was replaced with SO42− on the apical and basolateral membranes (to eliminate a Cl− gradient), there was an increase in amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2A and quantitated in Fig. 2B). Results were similar in primary cultures of human airway epithelia (Fig. 2B). Thus, Cl− regulates ENaC both in Xenopus oocytes and in Na+-transporting epithelia. We hypothesized that Cl− might regulate ENaC by binding to a site analogous to the Cl− binding site observed in the crystal structure of ASIC1a (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To identify candidate residues, we lined up the ASIC1a and ENaC sequences. In general, sequence conservation in the extracellular domains is low. We therefore focused on a portion of the thumb domain where the lineup was facilitated by the presence of four highly conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 3A). In ASIC1a, the positively charged side chain of Arg-310 participates in the coordination of Cl−. In βENaC, an arginine is located one position downstream (β-Arg-388). The equivalent residues in αENaC and γENaC are histidine (418 and 396, respectively), which when protonated carry a positive charge that could coordinate Cl−. To test their role in Cl− regulation of ENaC, we mutated each of these residues to alanine. In Fig. 3B, we expressed wild-type or mutant (αH418A, βR388A, and γH396A) ENaC in Xenopus oocytes and varied the extracellular Cl− concentration. When compared with wild-type ENaC, the mutations reduced Cl−-dependent inhibition by more than 50%. We also tested the effect of mutations in individual ENaC subunits. ENaC currents in cells expressing αH418Aβγ ENaC or αβR388Aγ ENaC were also less responsive to Cl−, whereas Cl− inhibited αβγH396A channels similar to wild-type (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that α-His-418 and β-Arg-388 participate in ENaC regulation by Cl−. Although we cannot exclude a role for γ-His-396, this residue is not required for Cl− to inhibit ENaC. Because mutation of these residues did not completely abolish the effect of Cl− on ENaC, it seems likely that additional residues also contribute. Because Cl− removal or readdition altered ENaC current over a rapid time course (in seconds), it seemed likely that Cl− affected channel activity rather than changing ENaC trafficking. To more directly test this idea, we used two strategies to prevent changes in ENaC activity. First, we covalently modified a cysteine introduced at the DEG position at the extracellular end of the pore in βENaC (βS520C), a maneuver that locks ENaC in the open state (open probability = 0.96) (23Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows an oocyte expressing αβS520Cγ ENaC before (black line) and after (gray line) modification with MTSET. To emphasize the Cl−-dependent effect, the traces were normalized to the peak currents and superimposed. Before modification, Cl− decreased current similar to wild-type ENaC (Fig. 4, A, black line, and B). In contrast, Cl− had no effect on ENaC current after the introduced cysteine was modified with MTSET (Fig. 4, A, gray line, and B). As a second strategy, we took advantage of the observation that ENaC gating is disrupted by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain, which also increases open probability (12Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Treatment of wild-type ENaC with trypsin (2 μg/ml for 3 min) abolished the effect of Cl− on current (Fig. 4, C, gray line, and D). Together, the data indicate that Cl− is incapable of inhibiting ENaC channels that are locked in an open conformation or that are proteolytically cleaved and activated by trypsin. ENaC is regulated in part by changes in extracellular Na+ (Na+ self-inhibition) (13Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 14Chraïbi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Cl− might inhibit ENaC by modulating the effect of Na+ on ENaC. To test this, we quantitated Na+ self-inhibition with Cl− or SO42− as the predominant anion in the extracellular bathing solution. In Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaC, a rapid increase in extracellular Na+ (from 1 to 116 mm) produced an inward Na+ current (downward deflection) that rapidly decreased to a lower steady-state level, as a result of Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 5A). When Cl− was the anion, the fraction of amiloride-sensitive current inhibited by Na+ was 0.58 ± 0.02 (Fig. 5B). When Cl− was replaced by SO42− or SCN−, a smaller fraction of ENaC current was inhibited by Na+ (0.23 ± 0.06 and 0.25 ± 0.02, respectively) (Fig. 5, A and B). Mutation of the putative Cl− binding site in all three subunits (αH418A, βR388A, and γH396A) reduced Na+ self-inhibition to a similar extent as Cl− removal (Fig. 5, C and D). Na+ self-inhibition was also reduced by mutation of the α subunit alone but not by mutation of βENaC or γENaC (Fig. 5D). The data suggest that Cl− inhibits ENaC in part by increasing Na+ self-inhibition. If correct, then removal of Na+ from the extracellular solution should disrupt the effect of anion substitution on ENaC current. To test this prediction, we replaced extracellular Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine and measured outward amiloride-sensitive current. Under these conditions, substitution of extracellular Cl− with SO42− increased ENaC current much less (ISO42−/ICl− = 1.46 ± 0.06) than when Na+ was present in the extracellular solution (ISO42−/ICl− = 2.38 ± 0.12) (Fig. 5E). In contrast, when the putative Cl− binding sites were mutated, the residual effect of anion substitution was not altered by changes in extracellular Na+ (Fig. 5E). As a further test of the role of Na+ self-inhibition in ENaC regulation by Cl−, we mutated a residue required for Na+ self-inhibition. Previous work found that mutation of His-239 in the extracellular domain of mouse γENaC abolished Na+ self-inhibition (15Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutation of the equivalent residue in human γENaC (His-233) had a similar effect (16Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We tested whether this mutation (αβγH233R) would disrupt the effect of Cl− on ENaC. In contrast to wild-type ENaC, changes in Cl− concentration had little effect on the mutant channel (Fig. 5F). Together, the data suggest that Cl− regulates ENaC in part by modulating Na+ self-inhibition. If the histidines we identified in Fig. 3 are Cl− binding sites, then we might expect ENaC regulation by Cl− to be altered by changes in extracellular pH. The imidazole side chain of histidine has a relatively neutral pKa (6.0), although this value can shift depending on its local environment. At alkaline pH, the side chain is uncharged, but at acidic pH, it is protonated and carries a positive charge, which could enhance Cl− binding through electrostatic effects. To test this prediction, we varied the pH in the bathing solution and replaced Cl− with SO42−. Fig. 6A shows a representative current trace. At pH 6.5, Cl− removal produced a large increase in amiloride-sensitive current. At pH 8.5, Cl− removal also increased current, but the increase was smaller than at pH 6.5. Fig. 6B shows Cl− dose-response relationships at pH 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5. When compared with pH 7.4, Cl− inhibition of ENaC was increased at acidic pH and reduced at alkaline pH. Mutation of the putative Cl− binding residues (αH418A, βR388A, and γH396A) abolished the effect of pH on ENaC inhibition by Cl− (Fig. 6C). Thus, ENaC regulation by Cl− is modulated by changes in extracellular pH. Because protons increase ENaC inhibition by Cl−, this effect should tend to reduce ENaC current at acidic pH. However, in previous work, we observed the opposite; acidic pH increased ENaC current (16Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (in Fig. 6A, compare the current at pH 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5 with Cl− bathing solution). This resulted from a decrease in Na+ self-inhibition at acidic pH (16Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6D, Cl). We hypothesized that protons have two opposing effects on Na+ self-inhibition; one alters Cl− binding and increases self-inhibition (which decreases current), whereas the other is independent of Cl− and reduces self-inhibition (which increases current). To eliminate the Cl−-dependent component, we removed Cl− from the bathing solution and tested the effect of protons on Na+ self-inhibition. Under these conditions, the inhibitory effect of protons on Na+ self-inhibition was greatly enhanced; acidic pH decreased Na+ self-inhibition to a larger extent than when Cl− was the extracellular anion (Fig. 6D). Thus, although protons tend to decrease ENaC current through their effect on Cl− binding, this is countered by an independent inhibitory effect of protons on Na+ self-inhibition. The net result is increased ENaC current at acidic pH. Our findings in heterologous cells and in Na+-transporting epithelia indicate that ENaC is regulated by changes in extracellular Cl−. As the concentration of extracellular Cl− increased, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in ENaC Na+ current. Cl− could regulate ENaC directly by binding to the channel or indirectly through interactions with lipids in the plasma membrane. Based on two observations, we favor direct binding of Cl− to ENaC. First, the crystal structure of ASIC1a (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) identified a Cl− binding site in its extracellular domain, raising the possibility that an analogous site is present in ENaC. Second, Cl− inhibition of ENaC was reduced by mutation of residues in αENaC (His-418) or βENaC (Arg-388) that correspond to the ASIC1a Cl− binding site. Thus, it seems likely that these residues contribute to Cl− binding in ENaC. However, mutation of these residues did not completely abolish the effect of Cl− on ENaC current. In ASIC1, Cl− is coordinated by three residues (7Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), so it is possible that there is residual Cl− binding to other ENaC residues. Alternatively, it is possible that Cl− regulates ENaC in part through binding to a second site or through a mechanism independent of channel binding. Our data indicate that Cl− inhibits ENaC through a change in channel activity. Maneuvers that locked the channel in a high open probability state (a DEG mutation and trypsin) abolished the effect of Cl− on ENaC current. This finding is most consistent with a model in which Cl− regulates ENaC predominately through a change in channel gating, although we cannot exclude additional effects on ENaC trafficking or single channel conductance. How might this occur? Previous work indicates that ENaC gating is regulated in part by extracellular Na+, which inhibits the channel (Na+ self-inhibition) (13Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 14Chraïbi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that Na+ self-inhibition was reduced in the absence of extracellular Cl−. This finding supports a model in which Cl− inhibits ENaC gating by stabilizing the Na+ self-inhibited state. Perhaps the binding of Na+ to ENaC is enhanced when the channel is bound to Cl−. However, changes in Na+ self-inhibition do not completely explain the effects of Cl− on ENaC current. For example, upon removal of Na+ from the extracellular bathing solution, the effect of Cl− on ENaC was dramatically reduced but not abolished (Fig. 5E). Moreover, mutation of the putative Cl− binding site in βENaC reduced ENaC regulation by Cl−, but it had no effect on Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 5D). These observations suggest that in addition to its effect on Na+ self-inhibition, Cl− may have a direct effect on ENaC activity that is independent of its effect on Na+ self-inhibition. We found that extracellular protons alter the effect of Cl− on ENaC; acidic pH enhanced inhibition, whereas alkaline pH reduced inhibition. Together with our previous data, this indicates that protons modulate ENaC through at least two independent mechanisms. We propose a model in which titration of the histidine residues that form the Cl− binding site (His-418 in αENaC and possibly His-396 in γENaC) increase Cl− binding, resulting in reduced ENaC current at acidic pH. This effect is opposed by titration of additional residues, which decreases Na+ self-inhibition, resulting in increased current at acidic pH (16Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the net effect of pH on ENaC current is determined by the relative contribution of these two mechanisms. As a result, ENaC regulation by pH might vary under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions. For example, when the Cl− concentration is low (e.g. volume depletion), acidic pH would have a greater stimulatory effect on ENaC than when the Cl− concentration is high (e.g. volume expansion). ENaC is not the only cation channel that is modulated by extracellular Cl−. For example, Cl− and other anions shift the voltage dependence of voltage-gated Na+ channels (24Dani J.A. Sanchez J.A. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The selectivity sequence for voltage-gated Na+ channels approximated the lyotropic series (SO42− < F− < Cl− < NO3− < Br− < I− < SCN−), where the anion effect is primarily related to the energy required for its dehydration rather than the energy of interaction between the anion and its binding site. This situation is observed when the binding site has a relatively low affinity for anions (25Hille B. Ionic channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 288-290Google Scholar). With ENaC, the anion selectivity sequence (SCN− < SO42− < H2PO4− < F− < I− < Cl− < Br−) also corresponded generally to the lyotropic series, although SCN− and I− were displaced from their predicted positions. Together with the Cl− dose-response relationship, the data indicate that the ENaC binding site has a relatively low affinity for anions. This feature is important because it allows ENaC to be regulated by Cl− concentrations found in urine and airway surface liquid. What is the physiological role of ENaC regulation by Cl−? In the kidney collecting duct, the urine Na+ and Cl− concentrations can vary over a wide range (19Rose B.D. Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders. McGraw-Hill, New York1984: 274-275Google Scholar). Previous work indicates that changes in Na+ concentration regulate the rate of Na+ transport through two distinct mechanisms: Na+ self-inhibition (13Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol.

We speculate that Cl− regulates Na+ transport in an analogous manner. For example, a drop in collecting duct Cl− concentration under conditions of hypovolemia would facilitate Na+ absorption, whereas increases in Cl− concentration in hypervolemia would reduce Na+ absorption. Similar to ENaC regulation by Na+, this mechanism may function to maintain Na+ and volume homeostasis. Regulation of ENaC by Cl− may also serve to indirectly regulate Cl− absorption because the transport of Cl− is coupled to Na+ transport to maintain electroneutrality. Together with previous work, our findings support a model in which the extracellular domains of ENaC function as sensors by which a variety of extracellular signals modulate epithelial Na+ absorption.

Survival and replication inside macrophages is critical for establishment of chronic Brucella infection. Virulent smooth B. abortus strain 2308 inhibits programmed macrophage cell death and replicates inside macrophages. Cattle B. abortus vaccine strain RB51 is an attenuated rough, lipopolysaccharide O antigen-deficient mutant derived from smooth strain 2308. B. abortus rough mutant RA1 contains a single wboA gene mutation in strain 2308. Our studies demonstrated that live RB51 and RA1, but not strain 2308 or heat-killed Brucella, induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in murine RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages. The same phenomenon was also observed in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages from mice immunized intraperitoneally with vaccine strain RB51 using the same dose as regularly performed in protection studies. Programmed macrophage cell death induced by RB51 and RA1 was inhibited by a caspase-2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAD-FMK). Caspase-2 enzyme activation and cleavage were observed at the early infection stage in macrophages infected with RB51 and RA1 but not strain 2308. The inhibition of macrophage cell death promoted the survival of rough Brucella cells inside macrophages. The critical role of caspase-2 in mediating rough B. abortus induced macrophage cell death was confirmed using caspase-2 specific shRNA. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated in macrophages infected with rough B. abortus as demonstrated by increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c to cytoplasm in macrophages infected with rough Brucella. These results demonstrate that rough B. abortus strains RB51 and RA1 induce apoptotic and necrotic murine macrophage cell death that is mediated by caspase-2. The biological relevance of Brucella O antigen and caspase-2-mediated macrophage cell death in Brucella pathogenesis and protective Brucella immunity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2051129767,"Most longitudinal studies showed increased relative mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus until now. As a result of major changes in treatment regimes over the past years, with more stringent goals for metabolic control and cardiovascular risk management, improvement of life expectancy should be expected. In our study, we aimed to assess present-day life expectancy of type 2 diabetes patients in an ongoing cohort study.We included 973 primary care type 2 diabetes patients in a prospective cohort study, who were all participating in a shared care project in The Netherlands. Vital status was assessed from May 2001 till May 2007. Main outcome measurement was life expectancy assessed by transforming actual survival time to standardised survival time allowing adjustment for the baseline mortality rate of the general population. At baseline, mean age was 66 years, mean HbA(1c) 7.0%. During a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 165 patients died (78 from cardiovascular causes), and 17 patients were lost to follow-up. There were no differences in life expectancy in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared to life expectancy in the general population. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, concentrating on the endpoints 'all-cause' and cardiovascular mortality, a history of cardiovascular disease: hazard ratio (HR) 1.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.37), and HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.56-4.28); and albuminuria: HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.26-2.35), and HR 1.83 (95% CI 1.17-2.89), respectively, were significant predictors, whereas smoking, HbA(1c), systolic blood pressure and diabetes duration were not.This study shows a normal life expectancy in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes patients in primary care when compared to the general population. A history of cardiovascular disease and albuminuria, however, increased the risk of a reduction of life expectancy. These results show that, in a shared care environment, a normal life expectancy is achievable in type 2 diabetes patients."
https://openalex.org/W2141234798,"Background Transmission of tuberculosis (TB) to health care workers (HCWs) is a global issue. Although effective infection control measures are expected to reduce nosocomial TB, HCWs' infection has not been assessed enough in TB high burden countries. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of TB infection and its risk factors among HCWs in Hanoi, Viet Nam. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 300 HCWs including all staff members in a municipal TB referral hospital received an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-TubeTM, followed by one- and two-step tuberculin skin test (TST) and a questionnaire-based interview. Agreement between the tests was evaluated by kappa statistics. Risk factors for TB infection were analyzed using a logistic regression model. Among the participants aged from 20 to 58 years (median = 40), prevalence of TB infection estimated by IGRA, one- and two-step TST was 47.3%, 61.1% and 66.3% respectively. Although the levels of overall agreement between IGRA and TST were moderate, the degree of agreement was low in the group with BCG history (kappa = 0.29). Working in TB hospital was associated with twofold increase in odds of TB infection estimated by IGRA. Increased age, low educational level and the high body mass index also demonstrated high odds ratios of IGRA positivity. Conclusions/Significance Prevalence of TB infection estimated by either IGRA or TST is high among HCWs in the hospital environment for TB care in Viet Nam and an infection control program should be reinforced. In communities with heterogeneous history of BCG vaccination, IGRA seems to estimate TB infection more accurately than any other criteria using TST."
https://openalex.org/W2156939833,"Background The tumor suppressor homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) by phosphorylating serine 46 (Ser46) is a crucial regulator of p53 apoptotic function. HIPK2 is also a transcriptional co-repressor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) restraining tumor angiogenesis and chemoresistance. HIPK2 can be deregulated in tumors by several mechanisms including hypoxia. Here, we sought to target hypoxia by restoring HIPK2 function and suppressing HIF-1α, in order to provide evidence for the involvement of both HIPK2 and p53 in counteracting hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Upon exposure of colon and lung cancer cells to hypoxia, by either low oxygen or cobalt, HIPK2 function was impaired allowing for increased HIF-1α expression and inhibiting the p53-apoptotic response to drug. Cobalt suppressed HIPK2 recruitment onto HIF-1α promoter. Hypoxia induced expression of the p53 target MDM2 that downregulates HIPK2, thus MDM2 inhibition by siRNA restored the HIPK2/p53Ser46 response to drug. Zinc supplementation to hypoxia-treated cells increased HIPK2 protein stability and nuclear accumulation, leading to restoration of HIPK2 binding to HIF-1α promoter, repression of MDR1, Bcl2, and VEGF genes, and activation of the p53 apoptotic response to drug. Combination of zinc and ADR strongly suppressed tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting HIF-1 pathway and upregulating p53 apoptotic target genes. Conclusions/Significance We show here for the first time that hypoxia-induced HIPK2 deregulation was counteracted by zinc that restored HIPK2 suppression of HIF-1 pathway and reactivated p53 apoptotic response to drug, underscoring the potential use of zinc supplementation in combination with chemotherapy to address hypoxia and improve tumor treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2004747651,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation potentials. It has been established that epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications could be critical for determining the fate of stem cells. In this study, full human genome promoter microarrays and expression microarrays were used to explore the roles of histone modifications (H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2) upon the induction of MSC osteogenic differentiation. Our results revealed that the enrichment of H3K9Ac was decreased globally at the gene promoters, whereas the number of promoters enriched with H3K9Me2 was increased evidently upon osteogenic induction. By a combined analysis of data from both ChIP-on-chip and expression microarrays, a number of differentially expressed genes regulated by H3K9Ac and/or H3K9Me2 were identified, implicating their roles in several biological events, such as cell cycle withdraw and cytoskeleton reconstruction that were essential to differentiation process. In addition, our results showed that the vitamin D receptor played a trans-repression role via alternations of H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2 upon MSC osteogenic differentiation. Data from this study suggested that gene activation and silencing controlled by changes of H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2, respectively, were crucial to MSC osteogenic differentiation."

Leukocyte chemotaxis underlies leukocyte migration, infiltration, trafficking, and homing that are not only important for normal leukocyte functions, but also have a important role in inflammation-related diseases. Leukocyte chemotaxis is regulated by leukocyte chemoattractants that include bacterial by-products such as formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, complement proteolytic fragments such as C5a, and the superfamily of chemotactic cytokines, chemokines. These chemoattractants bind to their specific cell G protein-coupled receptors and are primarily coupled to the Gi family of G proteins to regulate leukocyte chemotaxis. Previous studies have established that the Rho family of small GTPases regulates leukocyte migration (1Ridley A.J. J.

Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA are the three best studied Rho small GTPases. In myeloid cells, Cdc42 regulates directionality by directing where F-actin and lamellipodia are formed, and Rac regulates F-actin formation in the lamellipodia, which provides a driving force for cell motility (3Allen W.E.

Previous biochemical and genetic studies have revealed how Cdc42 and Rac may be regulated by chemokine receptors in leukocytes. Chemokine receptors can regulate Cdc42 via a Rho-GEF PIXα, which is regulated by Gβγ from the Gi proteins via the interactions between Gβγ and Pak1 and between Pak1 and PIXα in myeloid cells 12Li Z.

GEF115 was found in the leading edges of polarized mouse neutrophils, whereas PDZ Rho-GEF was found in the uropods of differentiated HL-60 cells. Both Rho-GEFs were believed to mediate pertussis toxin-resistant activation of RhoA in these cells. However, a significant portion of RhoA activity in leukocytes are pertussis toxin-sensitive, which is presumably regulated by the α and/or βγ subunits from the Gi proteins.

Therefore, we used a siRNA-based loss of function screen in an attempt to identify the GEFs that regulate myeloid cell migration and RhoA activity. One of the candidates, Arhgef5, was found to be directly activated by Gβγ to regulate RhoA and has an important role in immature DC migration. In addition, Arhgef5 deficiency attenuated allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model. The full-length Arhgef5 cDNA and its truncated mutants were amplified and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector carrying a FLAG tag. The exchange activity-deficient Arhgef5 mutant Arhgef5DH was generated by substituting Ala residues for Leu245 and Leu246. For the in vitro binding assay, Arhgef5 cDNA was subcloned into the pET21-His vector. His-tagged Arhgef5 was expressed in BL21(DE3)-competent cells and subsequently purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). Recombinant RhoA, Rhoteckin-RBD, and PAK-PBD, and Elmo were prepared from bacteria as GST fusion proteins. The Gβ1γ2 protein was prepared as previously described (12Li Z. Hannigan M. Mo Z. Liu B.

The cDNAs of RhoB, RhoC, RhoD, RhoG, and RhoQ as well as the dominant negative forms of RhoC, RhoD, and RhoF were acquired from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resources Center carrying an HA tag at their N termini. DNA sequences of all expression constructs were verified by sequencing. Antibodies specific to HA, His, and FLAG were acquired from Covance. HEK293T cells and Raw264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The B lymphoid cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The method to culture immature and mature dendritic cells from mouse bone marrow was described in detail (44Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rössner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse bone marrow cells were collected by flushing the femurs. After lysis of the red blood cells, the cells were cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml mouse recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech). After 5 days, cultured cells were collected and used for immature DC migration assays. Alternatively, the immature DCs were treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) for 24 h and used for mature DC migration assays. The shRNA vector, which was named pAS, was modified based on pSuper (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) by incorporating a GFP-luciferase fusion protein expression unit. The sequences for these shRNAs are shown in supplemental Table S1. For screening, the shRNAs and control vector were transfected into Raw264.7 cells using Lipofectamine Plus. The cells were collected 48 h later by trypsinization and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. They were then loaded into the upper chambers of 24-well transwell plates (Costar, 5 μm pore size). The lower chambers were filled with the same medium, but supplemented with 10 nm C5a (Sigma). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Migrated cells were detached from the lower surface of the transwell inserts by trypsin and EDTA and lysed for luciferase assays. The chemotactic indices were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity of migrated cells in the presence of C5a by that of its absence. For DC migration assays, BM-derived immature DCs or mature DCs were collected and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and loaded onto the upper chambers of transwell plates. Immature DCs were stimulated with 300 ng/ml MIP-1α (PeproTech), whereas mature DCs were stimulated with 60 ng/ml CCL-19 (PeproTech) for 4 h at 37 °C. Migrated cells were then counted and stained with CD11c for flow cytometric analysis. The chemotaxis indices were calculated by dividing the number of migrated immature (CD11cmid) or mature (CD11chigh) DCs in the presence of a chemotactic ligand by that in its absence. To evaluate the role of Arhgef5 and -15 in mature DC chemotaxis, bone marrow-derived immature DCs were collected and transfected with synthetic siRNA duplex oligos of Arhgef5 and Arhgef15 using the Amaxa Nucleofector system (Amaxa Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, lipopolysaccharide was added into the culture to induce DC maturation. Mature DCs were collected for the transwell migration assay as described above 24 h after the induction. The target sequences for the Arhgef5 and Arhgef15 siRNAs were CAGGAGGAATTTAATAATACA and AAGTATTAAATTAATCTAATA, respectively. For evaluating lymphocyte migration, splenocytes were used in the transwell assay in response to 10 nm SDF-1. After 3 h incubation at 37 °C, migrated cells were counted and stained with anti-CD3-FITC and anti-B220-R-phycoerythrin. The numbers of migrated T and B cells were determined based on the cell number and their relative percentages, and chemotactic indices were computed as described above. For macrophage chemotaxis assay, macrophages were obtained from the mouse peritonea elicited by thioglycolate. Similar transwell assays were carried out with 10 nm C5a (Sigma) as the stimulus. The pulldown assays for determining the activity of small GTPases were carried essentially as previously described. In brief, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Arhgef5 or its inactive mutant Arhgef5DH with one of the HA-tagged small GTPases. After 24 h transfection, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 m NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm orthovanadate) containing recombinant GST-Rhoteckin-RBD for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC pulldown, GST-PAK-CRIB for Rac, RhoD, and RhoQ pulldown, or GST-Elmo for RhoG pulldown. Bound GTPases were detected by Western analysis with an anti-HA antibody. Cells were stimulated with or without 30 ng/ml SDF-1 for 15 s before they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then washed and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. After washing, cells were blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with purified GST-RBD at room temperature for 1 h followed by Alexa 633-conjugated anti-GST antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). After washing, cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of GFP-positive populations that represent cells carrying the pAS vector was determined. The exchange activity of Arhgef5 was determine for its ability to promote the loading of N-methylanthraniloyl-GTP (Mant-GTP, from JENA Bioscience) to recombinant RhoA as previously described (45Rojas R.J. Kimple R.J. Rossman K.L. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, purified RhoA (0.12 μm) was incubated in an assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 10 μm MANT-GTP and recombinant proteins of 0.85 μm Arhgef5 and/or 1 μm Gβγ. Immediately after mixing, fluorescence intensity was determined by a fluorometer (Wallac Vector, 1420 multilabel counter) with excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 440 nm. HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates and transfected with the luciferase reporter construct SRE-luc, normalization plasmid GFP, and other plasmids shown in the figures by using Lipofectamine Plus. After transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h before the GFP intensity was measured by a fluorometer. The cells were then lysed, and their luciferase activities were determined by a luminometer. Data are presented after the luciferase activity was normalized against the GFP intensity. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Gβ1γ2 and FLAG-tagged Arhgef5 or its mutants for 24 h. The cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). Immunoprecipitation was then carried out with an anti-FLAG antibody and Protein A/G beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were subjected to Western analysis with anti-Gβ1 antibody. Total RNAs were extracted from bone marrow-derived immature and mature DCs using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR was performed. The sense oligo for Ephexin is GAACTGATCGCACAGTTGGA, and the antisense oligo is ATCTTCCGGACACCCTCATT. The sense oligo for Arhgef15 is ATCACTCAGCCCA-AGAGTGG, and the antisense oligo is AGATGGTGTCTGGGGAACAG. The sense oligo for Arhgef5 is TATGTCACCAACCAGACC, and the antisense oligo is ACCTGACTGATGAAGTTCCT. The migration of DCs from the skin to lymph node was determined by FITC skin painting as previously described (46Macatonia S.E. Knight S.C. Edwards A.J. Griffiths S. Fryer P. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1654-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In brief, FITC (Sigma) was dissolved in a 50:50 (v/v) acetone/dibutylphthalate mixture at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Mice were anesthetized and their abdominal fur shaved. The FITC solution (0.25 ml/animal) was applied to the shaved skin. Twenty-four hours later, inguinal lymph nodes were harvested and treated with collagenase D (1 mg/ml, Roche) for 20 min at 37 °C. The lymph nodes were then smashed onto 70 μm cell strainers to produce cell suspensions. The cells were collected and stained with PE-CD11c and analyzed by a flow cytometer. A BAC clone that contains the Arhgef5 gene was acquired from the BACPAC Resources Center at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA. Exons 5–9, which encode residues Ala1153–Lys1355 in the DH domain of Arhgef5, were floxed with the LoxP sequences in the gene-targeting construct. The Arhgef5 mutant mouse line was generated at the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility of the University of Connecticut Health Center using the ES cell line 129S6 derived from 129SvEvTac/C57BL/6J F1 blastocysts. The chimeric mice were crossed with 129S1-Hprt1-Cre from JAX to produce germline excision of the sequences between the two LoxP sites. Finally, mice heterozygous for the disrupted Arhgef5 gene were interbred to produce homozygous mice. Animals from F1 to F3 were used in this study. Mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection with 200 μl of OVA-alum suspension (0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg/ml aluminum hydroxide). Eight days after immunization, mice were challenged with an aerosol of 1% FITC-OVA in phosphate-buffered saline, delivered by an ultrasonic nebulizer (OMRON, Compair) for 20 min. FITC-OVA was prepared by mixing 2 mg/ml of FITC solution in carbonate buffer (220 mm, pH 9.6) with OVA at 10 mg/ml. The mixture was gently rotated overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Unbound FITC was removed by ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane in a 15-ml filtration cell (Amicon). One day after challenge, the mice were anesthetized. Their trachea were cannulated, and their lungs lavaged five times with 1 ml of pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline. The bronchial lymph nodes were then collected. Cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min. Cytospin preparations of cells were stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring) and differentials were performed on 200 cells based on morphology and staining characteristics. The supernatant of BAL fluids were analyzed for IL-4 levels using a mouse IL-4 ELISA kit (Endogen). Lymph nodes were passed through a cell strainer (BD Falcon), and cells were counted and stained with R-phycoerythrin-CD11c (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by a flow cytometry (Caliber, BD Biosciences). The thymidine kinase mutant HSV-2 viruses were prepared and inoculated intravaginally into Arhgef5-null and wild type littermates (1 × 106 plaque-forming units of HSV-2) as previously described (47Sato A. Iwasaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16274-16279Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Vaginal washes were collected daily, and the levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were determined by ELISA. On day 6, mice were euthanized, and CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were isolated from iliac and inguinal lymph nodes. The T cells were co-cultured with naïve wild type splenocytes and heat-inactivated HSV-2 of varying plaque-forming units (for CD4+ T cells) or 1 μg/ml gB peptide (for CD8+ T cells) for 3 days. The levels of IFN-γ in the conditioned media were determined by ELISA. Statistical comparisons between different groups or treatments were performed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the roles of Rho-GEFs in leukocyte chemotaxis, we carried out a siRNA-based functional screen for Rho-GEFs that may play a role in migration of macrophage-like Raw264.7 cells. We generated a mini vector-based shRNA library targeting 38 Rho-GEFs, whose expression could be detected by RT-PCR in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). The shRNA vector was modified based on pSuper (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) by incorporating a GFP-luciferase fusion protein expression unit; thus, cells producing shRNA can be monitored by the expression of GFP and/or luciferase. This vector was named pAS. All of the GEF shRNAs were validated based their ability to knock down endogenous GEF expression detected by quantitative RT-PCR and/or coexpressed cDNAs if available (data not shown). To test the effects of these shRNAs on RAW264.7 cell migration, cells were transfected with one of the shRNAs, and the empty pAS was used as a negative control. Two days after transfection, transwell migration assays were carried out, and the migratory ability of the cells expressing a GEF shRNA was compared with that of the control cells. Of 38 GEF shRNAs we screened, 6 shRNAs showed more than 50% inhibition (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Because siRNAs are known to have off-target effects, we tried to validate the effects by constructing a second shRNA expression plasmid that has a different targeting sequence for these 6 putative hits. We successfully generated the second shRNAs for 5 of these 6 putative hits. Among these 5 shRNAs, only Arhgef5 shRNA showed more than 50% inhibition of RAW264.7 cell migration (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1A). To further validate siRNA specificity, we coexpressed an Arhgef5 expression plasmid together with its shRNA plasmid to determine whether effects of shRNA can be rescued. To prevent the silencing effect of the shRNA on expression of exogenous Arhgef5, we introduced silent mutations at the shRNA targeting sequence of the Arhgef5 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of Arhgef5 effectively rescued the effect of Arhgef5 shRNA on RAW264.7 cell migration. We also tested the effect of Arhgef5 shRNA on the migration of J774 cells; the shRNA could also effectively inhibit its migration, which could be rescued by expression of the silently mutated Arhgef5 (Fig. 1C). The efficiency of this Arhgef5 siRNA was validated as shown in Fig. 1D. Putting all of these results together, we believe that Arhgef5 may have an important role in the migration of these two myeloid cell lines. Arhgef5, as a member of the Rho-GEF superfamily, possesses a DH-PH tandem domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Some members of the subfamily, including Arhgef15 (24Ogita H. Kunimoto S. Kamioka Y. Sawa H. Masuda M. Mochizuki N. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Ephexin-1 (25Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M.

Miki T. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were shown to activate RhoA, whereas the other (SGEF) was shown to activate RhoG (27Ellerbroek S.M. Wennerberg K.

We tested the effects of Arhgef5 on a number of Rho small GTPases. Previous studies have shown that the RhoA-binding domain of Rhotekin (RBD) has a high affinity for a subset of GTP-bound small Rho GTPases that include RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 29Aspenström P. Fransson A. Saras J. Biochem.

These interactions have been used to determine the levels of active small GTPases in pulldown assays (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of Arhgef5, but not an Arhgef5 mutant with its DH domain mutated, led to a strong increase in the levels of active RhoA and RhoB, resulting in weak activation of RhoC and RhoG. Expression of Arhgef5 had no effect on the level of active RhoD, RhoV, RhoQ, or Rac1 (Fig. 2A). Previous studies also showed that GEFs generally exhibit high affinities for the GTP-free mutant forms of small GTPases they regulate (32Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consistent with the pulldown assay results, Arhgef5 co-immunoprecipitated with RhoA-N19, but not RhoC-N19 or RhoD-N31 (Fig. 2B). In addition, RhoF-N33 did not show detectable interaction with Arhgef5 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Arhgef5 may not regulate RhoF. These results indicate that Arhgef5, Ephexin-1, and Arhgef15, which are more homologous in amino acid sequences than SGEF, belong to a subgroup that potently activates RhoA rather than RhoG. Next, we wanted to assess the significance of Arhgef5 in chemoattractant-induced small GTPase activation. Because of the relative low transfection efficiency for leukocytes and the large number of cells required for the pulldown assays particularly for detection of e"
https://openalex.org/W2030757537,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15LO) plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetes and has been implicated in low density lipoprotein oxidation. Murine macrophages express high levels of 12/15LO and are key cells involved in the accumulation and efflux of oxidized low density lipoprotein in the arterial wall. During this process, macrophages up-regulate scavenger receptors that regulate lipid uptake, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, that regulate lipid efflux. We have previously demonstrated that 12/15LO enhances the turnover and serine phosphorylation of ABCG1. In the current study, we further elucidate the mechanisms by which 12/15LO regulates ABCG1. Proteasomal inhibitors blocked the down-regulation of ABCG1 expression and resulted in accumulation of phosphorylated ABCG1. Macrophages that lack 12/15LO have enhanced transporter expression, reduced ABCG1 phosphorylation, and increased cholesterol efflux. Conversely, macrophages that overexpress 12/15LO have reduced ABCG1 expression, increased transporter phosphorylation, and reduced cholesterol efflux. 12/15LO plays a key role in activating the MAPK pathway. Inhibition of the p38 or JNK pathways with pharmacological inhibitors or dominant negative constructs blocked 12S-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid-mediated degradation of ABCG1. Moreover, we isolated macrophages from JNK1-, JNK2-, and MKK3-deficient mice to analyze the involvement of specific MAPK pathways. JNK2- and MKK3-, but not JNK1-deficient macrophages were resistant to the down-regulation of ABCG1 protein, reduction in efflux, and increase in serine phosphorylation by 12S-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid. These findings provide evidence that 12/15LO regulates ABCG1 expression and function through p38- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, and that targeting these pathways may provide novel approaches for regulating cholesterol homeostasis. 12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15LO) plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetes and has been implicated in low density lipoprotein oxidation.

A role for 12/15LO activity in the vessel wall in regulating the clearance of excess cholesterol from macrophages and contributing to the development of macrophage foam cell formation has not been fully elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that 12/15LO activity in macrophages enhances the degradation of ABCG1, resulting in reduced cholesterol efflux (22Nagelin M.H. Srinivasan S. Lee J. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Correlating with increased turnover of the transporter, the 12/15LO eicosanoid product 12SHETE enhanced the serine phosphorylation of ABCG1 (22Nagelin M.H. Srinivasan S. Lee J. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The current study provides further understanding of the mechanisms by which 12/15LO regulates ABCG1 expression and function. We have found that 12/15LO activates JNK2 and p38 MAPK pathways to enhance transporter phosphorylation and degradation.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from mice as described above. Four million cells were transfected with 1 μg of dnp38, dnMKK4, dnMKK7, or pcDNA control constructs by nucleofection using a mouse macrophage nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection efficiency was ∼65% as measured by green fluorescent protein transfection. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with 500 nm 12SHETE for 30 min, and protein was collected for analysis as described. Cholesterol efflux assays were performed as described, with minor modification (25Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well. To measure effects on cholesterol efflux, cells were radiolabeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted FBS. After radiolabeling, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 2 h in 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (FAFBSA). In some experiments, macrophages were treated with 500 nm 12SHETE in 0.2% FAFBSA for 2 h. Cholesterol efflux was conducted for 4 or 8 h at 37 °C in media containing: 1) 0.2% FAFBSA, 2) 0.2% FAFBSA plus 15 μg/ml lipid-free human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), or 3) 0.2% FAFBSA plus 50 μg of protein/ml of human HDL. Human apoA-I and HDL were isolated as described previously (26Nichols A.B. Ravenscroft C. Lamphiear D.E. Ostrander Jr., L.D. JAMA. 1976; 236: 1948-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efflux medium was removed and a 100-μl aliquot was taken for 3H radioactivity determination. Adherent cells were rinsed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were dried, and isopropanol was added for overnight extraction at room temperature. A 100-μl aliquot of the extract was taken for 3H radioactivity determination. Results are expressed as [3H]cholesterol in medium/([3H]cholesterol in medium + cell) × 100%. Specific efflux to apoA-I or HDL was calculated by subtracting nonspecific efflux in the presence of 0.2% FAFBSA only. RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4 containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) was added to macrophages to generate whole cell lysates. Lysates were sonicated, and protein was quantified via a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1 h with 2.5% milk-Tris-buffered saline plus 1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature. Fifty micrograms of whole cell lysate was used to detect all proteins. ABCA1 and ABCG1 antibodies (1:500 dilution) were incubated with the blot at 4 °C overnight in 2.5% milk-TBST. The 12/15LO antibody (1:1000 dilution) was incubated with the blot at 4 °C overnight in 2.5% Milk-TBST. ABCA1, ABCG1, and 12/15LO blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) in 2.5% milk-TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The β-actin antibody (1:10000 dilution) was incubated with the blot for 1 h at room temperature in 2.5% milk-TBST. The β-actin blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) in 2.5% milk-TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence and normalized to β-actin as gel loading control. Densitometry was performed using Stratagene Zero D-Scan densitometry software. Total cellular RNA was collected from macrophages using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of cDNA was synthesized using the Iscript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Total cDNA was diluted 1:10 in H2O, and 4 μl was used for each real-time condition using a Bio-Rad MyIQ Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences were as follows: ABCA1 (forward 5′-GGTTTGGAGATGGTTATACAATAGTTGT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCGGAAACGCAAGTCC-3′), ABCG1 (forward 5′-TTCCCCTGGAGATGAGTGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGTAGGCCACAGGGAACAT-3′), LXR alpha (forward 5′-GGATAGGGTTGGAGTCAGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGAGCGCCTGTTACACTGTT-3′), LXR beta (forward 5′-GCTCAGGAGCTGATGATCCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGCTTGATCCTCGTGTAG-3′), and cyclophilin (forward 5′-TGGAGAGCACCAAGACAGACA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCCGGAGTCGACAATGAT-3′). Samples were normalized to cyclophilin using the ΔCt method. Macrophage lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against ABCG1 (Novus Biologicals). The antibody-antigen complex was isolated by protein A-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Each gel lane received equal amounts of immunoprecipitated protein. ABCG1 phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphoserine antibody (Biomol) that recognizes a broad range of serine-phosphorylated proteins. Full-length FLAG-tagged human ABCG1 open reading frame 678 (ORF678) and truncated FLAG-tagged human ABCG1 ORF638 were generously provided by Dr. John Oram (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (28Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30150-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). ABCG1 ORF638 mutation constructs on CKII consensus sites (Ser-45, Ser-205, and Ser-349) and N-terminal serines (Ser-65, Ser-70, Ser-119, Ser-141, and Ser-168) to alanines were generated by PCR using a QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum then transiently transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data for all experiment comparisons between groups was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods using the StatView 6.0 software program. Data is graphically represented as the mean ± S.E., in which the mean consists of a minimum of three experiments performed in triplicate. Comparisons between groups and tests of interactions were performed assuming a two-factor analysis with the interaction term testing each main effect with the residual error testing the interaction. All comparisons were made using Fisher's least standard difference procedure, so that multiple comparisons were performed at the alpha = 0.05 level only if the overall F-test from the ANOVA were significant at p < 0.05 (29Milliken G.A. Stat. Med. 1995; 14: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the 12/15LO product 12SHETE enhances the serine phosphorylation of ABCG1 in macrophages (22Nagelin M.H. Srinivasan S. Lee J. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Increased serine phosphorylation correlated with enhanced turnover of the transporter (22Nagelin M.H. Srinivasan S. Lee J. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We performed dose-response experiments to examine whether this response was specific for the 12/15LO pathway. 12SHETE treatment reduced ABCG1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Another product of the 12/15LO pathway, 15SHETE, also reduced ABCG1 expression, but at a higher concentration than that observed for 12SHETE (Fig. 1B). Further, we examined the effects of 5SHETE and 12RHETE, which are products of the 5(S)-lipoxygenase and 12(R)-lipoxygenase pathways, respectively. At concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 μm, we observed no change in ABCG1 expression by 5SHETE or 12RHETE (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that this response is specific to products of the 12/15LO pathway. Additionally, we treated macrophages with the fatty acid substrate of the 12/15LO pathway, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid also reduced ABCG1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E), but the reduction in ABCG1 occurred at higher concentrations and longer incubation times than for 12/15LO eicosanoids. We hypothesized that 12SHETE targets ABCG1 for degradation by the proteasome. To evaluate this hypothesis, C57BL6/J (B6) macrophages were pre-treated with the proteasomal inhibitors lactacystin or MG132 for 30 min before addition of 12SHETE for 30 min. As shown previously (22Nagelin M.H. Srinivasan S. Lee J. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 12SHETE reduced ABCG1 protein levels (Fig. 1F). Both lactacystin and MG132 blocked the degradation of ABCG1 protein by 12SHETE (Fig. 1F). Moreover, lactacystin treatment enhanced the accumulation of phosphorylated ABCG1 (Fig. 1G), indicating that serine phosphorylation of ABCG1 by 12SHETE likely targets ABCG1 for proteasomal degradation. To examine whether 12/15LO activity in the macrophage can regulate ABCG1 expression and function, we treated B6 macrophages with the 12/15LO pharmacological inhibitor cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate for 24 h. Treatment of B6 macrophages with cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate resulted in a 2-fold increase in ABCG1 protein expression (Fig. 2A). Next we isolated bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice deficient for 12/15LO (LOKO). LOKO macrophages had a significant 2-fold increase in ABCG1 and ABCA1 protein expression (Fig. 2B) compared with wild-type B6 macrophages. Concomitant with these findings, we observed a reduction in serine phosphorylation of ABCG1 in LOKO macrophages (Fig. 2C). Moreover, we observed no changes in mRNA expression of ABCG1, ABCA1, LXRα, or LXRβ expression (data not shown). To further examine a role for 12/15LO in regulating ABCG1 protein levels, we overexpressed 12/15LO in B6 macrophages with an adenovirus (indicated AdLO) for 48 h. We confirmed that the adenovirus increased 12/15LO expression ∼2-fold compared with macrophages treated with a control adenovirus (indicated AdLacZ) (Fig. 3A). B6 macrophages treated with AdLO had almost no ABCG1 protein expression (Fig. 3A). We previously generated transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J (B6) background that modestly overexpressed the murine 12/15LO gene (designated LOTG) (9Reilly K.B. Srinivasan S. Hatley M.E. Patricia M.K. Lannigan J. Bolick D.T. Vandenhoff G. Pei H. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9440-9450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). LOTG mice had significant elevations in levels of urinary 12SHETE and 13S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, the primary eicosanoid products of the 12/15LO pathway, and a 2-fold increase in 12/15LO protein expression in vivo (9Reilly K.B. Srinivasan S. Hatley M.E. Patricia M.K. Lannigan J. Bolick D.T. Vandenhoff G. Pei H. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. J. Biol.

We confirmed transgene overexpression of 12/15LO in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from these mice (Fig. 3B). Bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from LOTG mice had a significant 40% reduction in ABCG1 protein expression compared with B6 (Fig. 3C). No change in ABCA1 protein expression was observed (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we observed an increase in serine phosphorylation of ABCG1 by immunoprecipitation in macrophages from LOTG mice (Fig. 3D). Additionally, ABCG1 and ABCA1 mRNA expression was unchanged (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitory effects of 12/15LO on ABCG1 expression are not attributable to reduced ABCG1 mRNA expression. Because ABCG1 is known to regulate cholesterol efflux, we next assayed the effects of 12/15LO activity on this process. B6, LOKO, or LOTG macrophages were labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and HDL- and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was measured. Tall and colleagues have reported that HDL is the preferred cholesterol acceptor from ABCG1, whereas lipid-free apoA-I is the preferred cholesterol acceptor from ABCA1 (30Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). LOKO macrophages had a significant increase in cholesterol efflux measured for 4 or 8 h to HDL compared with B6 macrophages (Fig. 4). Conversely, LOTG macrophages had a significant reduction in cholesterol efflux measured for 4 or 8 h to HDL (Fig. 4). No change in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was measured in either genotype (Fig. 4) at 4 h; however, after 8 h we observed a significant increase in cholesterol efflux from LOKO bone marrow-derived macrophages and a significant reduction in efflux from LOTG bone marrow-derived macrophages to lipid-free apoA-I. ABCG1 degradation is not regulated by PKA- or PKC-dependent pathways. There is evidence that phosphorylation plays an important role in the function of ABCA1. Hayden and colleagues have reported that site-specific serine phosphorylation of ABCA1 by PKA regulates apoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux (31See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S.

https://openalex.org/W1963539737,"Food searching strategies of animals are key to their success in heterogeneous environments. The optimal search strategy may include specialized random walks such as Levy walks with heavy power-law tail distributions, or persistent walks with preferred movement in a similar direction. We have investigated the movement of the soil amoebae Dictyostelium searching for food. Dictyostelium cells move by extending pseudopodia, either in the direction of the previous pseudopod (persistent step) or in a different direction (turn). The analysis of ∼4000 pseudopodia reveals that step and turn pseudopodia are drawn from a probability distribution that is determined by cGMP/PLA2 signaling pathways. Starvation activates these pathways thereby suppressing turns and inducing steps. As a consequence, starved cells make very long nearly straight runs and disperse over ∼30-fold larger areas, without extending more or larger pseudopodia than vegetative cells. This ‘win-stay/lose-shift’ strategy for food searching is called Starvation Induced Run-length Extension. The SIRE walk explains very well the observed differences in search behavior between fed and starving organisms such as bumble-bees, flower bug, hoverfly and zooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W2154785870,"One methodology that has met success to infer gene networks from gene expression data is based upon ordinary differential equations (ODE). However new types of data continue to be produced, so it is worthwhile to investigate how to integrate these new data types into the inference procedure. One such data is physical interactions between transcription factors and the genes they regulate as measured by ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiments. These interactions can be incorporated into the gene network inference procedure as a priori network information. In this article, we extend the ODE methodology into a general optimization framework that incorporates existing network information in combination with regularization parameters that encourage network sparsity. We provide theoretical results proving convergence of the estimator for our method and show the corresponding probabilistic interpretation also converges. We demonstrate our method on simulated network data and show that existing network information improves performance, overcomes the lack of observations, and performs well even when some of the existing network information is incorrect. We further apply our method to the core regulatory network of embryonic stem cells utilizing predicted interactions from two studies as existing network information. We show that including the prior network information constructs a more closely representative regulatory network versus when no information is provided."

The development of high throughput genomic technologies such as microarrays provide a new molecular tool to gain insight in the complexity and relationships between diseases, as they provide data on the simultaneous activity of multiple genes, gene networks and cellular pathways.We have constructed genome wide expression profiles from snap frozen post-mortem tissue from the medial temporal lobe of patients with four neurodegenerative disorders (5 AD, 5 PSP, 5 PiD and 5 FTD patients) and 5 control subjects. All patients were matched for age, gender, ApoE-epsilon and MAPT (tau) haplotype. From all groups a total of 790 probes were shown to be differently expressed when compared to control individuals. The results from these experiments were then used to investigate the correlations between clinical, pathological and molecular findings. From the 790 identified probes we extracted a gene set of 166 probes whose expression could discriminate between these disorders and normal ageing.From genome wide expression profiles we extracted a gene set of 166 probes whose expression could discriminate between neurological disorders and normal ageing.

https://openalex.org/W2001129416,"Background Rats receive information from other conspecifics by observation or other types of social interaction. Such social interaction may contribute to the effective adaptation to changes of environment such as situational switching. Learning to avoid dangerous places or objects rapidly occurs with even a single conditioning session, and the conditioned memory tends to be sustained over long periods. The avoidance is important for adaptation, but the details of the conditions under which the social transmission of avoidance is formed are unknown. We demonstrate that the previous experience of avoidance learning is important for the formation of behaviors for social transmission of avoidance and that the experienced rats adapt to a change of situation determined by the presence or absence of aversive stimuli. We systematically investigated social influence on avoidance behavior using a passive avoidance test in a light/dark two-compartment apparatus. Methodology/Principal Findings Rats were divided into two groups, one receiving foot shocks and another with no aversive experience in a dark compartment. Experienced and inexperienced rats were further divided into subjects and partners. In Experiment 1, each subject experienced (1) interaction with an experienced partner, (2) interaction with an inexperienced partner, or (3) no interaction. In Experiment 2, each subject experienced interaction with a partner that received a shock. The entering latency to a light compartment was measured. The avoidance behavior of experienced rats was inhibited by interaction with inexperienced or experienced partners in a safely-changed situation. The avoidance of experienced rats was reinstated in a dangerously-changed situation by interaction with shocked rats. In contrast, the inexperienced rats were not affected by any social circumstances. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that transmitted information among rats can be updated under a situational change and that the previous experience is crucial for social enhancement and inhibition of avoidance behavior in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2126401694,"Background Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter with important roles in the regulation of neurobehavioral processes, particularly those regulating affect in humans. Drugs that potentiate serotonergic neurotransmission by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (SSRIs) are widely used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Although the regulation of serotonin synthesis may be an factor in SSRI efficacy, the effect of chronic SSRI administration on 5-HT synthesis is not well understood. Here, we describe effects of chronic administration of the SSRI citalopram (CIT) on 5-HT synthesis and content in the mouse forebrain. Methodology/Principal Findings Citalopram was administered continuously to adult male C57BL/6J mice via osmotic minipump for 2 days, 14 days or 28 days. Plasma citalopram levels were found to be within the clinical range. 5-HT synthesis was assessed using the decarboxylase inhibition method. Citalopram administration caused a suppression of 5-HT synthesis at all time points. CIT treatment also caused a reduction in forebrain 5-HIAA content. Following chronic CIT treatment, forebrain 5-HT stores were more sensitive to the depleting effects of acute decarboxylase inhibition. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic citalopram administration causes a sustained suppression of serotonin synthesis in the mouse forebrain. Furthermore, our results indicate that chronic 5-HT reuptake inhibition renders 5-HT brain stores more sensitive to alterations in serotonin synthesis. These results suggest that the regulation of 5-HT synthesis warrants consideration in efforts to develop novel antidepressant strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2050377304,"Genetic and genomic studies highlight the substantial complexity and heterogeneity of human cancers and emphasize the general lack of therapeutics that can match this complexity. With the goal of expanding opportunities for drug discovery, we describe an approach that makes use of a phenotype-based screen combined with the use of multiple cancer cell lines. In particular, we have used the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel that includes drug sensitivity measures for over 40,000 compounds assayed on 59 independent cells lines. Targets are cancer-relevant phenotypes represented as gene expression signatures that are used to identify cells within the NCI-60 panel reflecting the signature phenotype and then connect to compounds that are selectively active against those cells. As a proof-of-concept, we show that this strategy effectively identifies compounds with selectivity to the RAS or PI3K pathways. We have then extended this strategy to identify compounds that have activity towards cells exhibiting the basal phenotype of breast cancer, a clinically-important breast cancer characterized as ER-, PR-, and Her2- that lacks viable therapeutic options. One of these compounds, Simvastatin, has previously been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro and importantly, has been associated with a reduction in ER-, PR- breast cancer in a clinical study. We suggest that this approach provides a novel strategy towards identification of therapeutic agents based on clinically relevant phenotypes that can augment the conventional strategies of target-based screens."

Here, we present the structure of LsrF, unliganded and in complex with two phospho-AI-2 analogues, ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate. The crystal structure shows that LsrF is a decamer of (alphabeta)(8)-barrels that exhibit a previously unseen N-terminal domain swap and have high structural homology with aldolases that process phosphorylated sugars. Ligand binding sites and key catalytic residues are structurally conserved, strongly implicating LsrF as a class I aldolase."

While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2055944641,"Background The ability to characterize the development of metabolic function in neonatal rodents has been limited due to technological constraints. Low respiratory volumes and flows at rest pose unique problems, making it difficult to reliably measure O2 consumption, CO2 production, respiratory quotient (RQ), and energy expenditure (EE). Our aim was to develop and validate a commercial-grade indirect calorimetry system capable of characterizing the metabolic phenotype of individual neonatal rodents. Methodology/Principal Findings To address this research need, we developed a novel, highly sensitive open-circuit indirect calorimetry system capable of analyzing respiratory gas exchange in a single neonatal rodent pup. Additionally, we derived an equation from known metabolic relationships to estimate inlet flow rates, improving the efficiency of data collection. To validate the neonatal rodent indirect calorimetry system and evaluate the applicability of the derived equation for predicting appropriate flow rates, we conducted a series of experiments evaluating the impact of sex, litter size, time of day (during the light phase), and ambient temperature on neonatal rat metabolic parameters. Data revealed that the only metabolic parameter influenced by litter size is a neonatal rat's RQ, with rat pups reared in a small litter (5 pups) having lower RQ's than rat pups reared in either medium (8 pups) or large (11 pups) litters. Furthermore, data showed that ambient temperature affected all metabolic parameters measured, with colder temperatures being associated with higher CO2 production, higher O2 consumption, and higher energy expenditure. Conclusion/Significance The results of this study demonstrate that the modified Panlab Oxylet system reliably assesses early postnatal metabolism in individual neonatal rodents. This system will be of paramount importance to further our understanding of processes associated with the developmental origins of adult metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2102926785,"The study of functional RNAs of various sizes and structures requires efficient methods for their synthesis and purification. Here, 23 group I intron variants ranging in length from 246 to 341 nucleotides -- some containing exons -- were subjected to a native purification technique previously applied only to shorter RNAs (<160 nucleotides). For the RNAs containing both exons, we adjusted the original purification protocol to allow for purification of radiolabeled molecules. The resulting RNAs were used in folding assays on native gel electrophoresis and in self-splicing assays. The intron-only RNAs were subjected to the regular native purification scheme, assayed for folding and employed in crystallization screens. All RNAs that contained a 3' overhang of one nucleotide were efficiently cleaved off from the support and were at least 90% pure after the non-denaturing purification. A representative subset of these RNAs was shown to be folded and self-splicing after purification. Additionally, crystals were grown for a 286 nucleotide long variant of the Clostridium botulinum intron. These results demonstrate the suitability of the native affinity purification method for the preparation of group I introns. We hope these findings will stimulate a broader application of this strategy to the preparation of other large RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2132719731,"Background Enterococci, and especially multiresistant Enterococcus faecium, are increasingly found colonizing hospitalized patients. This increased prevalence of colonization is not only associated with an increased prevalence of infections caused by enterococci, but also by infections with other nosocomial pathogens. In this study we investigated the causality of this observed relationship, by determining the influence of intestinal colonization with E. faecium on pulmonary defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methodology/Principal Findings Three groups of mice were tested; 2 groups of mice were pre-treated with vancomycin, of which one group was subsequently treated by oral gavage of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE). The third group did not receive any pre-treatment. P. aeruginosa pneumonia was induced in all mice. Vancomycin treatment resulted in intestinal gram-negative bacterial overgrowth and VRE treatment resulted in colonization throughout the intestines. All 3 groups of mice were able to clear P. aeruginosa from the lungs and circulation, with comparable lung cytokine responses and lung damage. Mice treated with vancomycin without VRE colonization displayed modestly increased plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-10. Conclusion Overgrowth of E. faecium and/or gram-negative bacteria does not impact importantly on pulmonary defense against P. aeruginosa pneumonia."
