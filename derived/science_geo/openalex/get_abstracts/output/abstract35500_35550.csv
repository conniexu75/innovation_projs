https://openalex.org/W1599831143,"Abstract PKI-(5-24)-amide is a 20-residue peptide with the sequence, Thr5-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-A la-Ile-His- Asp24-NH2, that corresponds to the active portion of the heat-stable inhibitor protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Cheng, H.-C., Kemp, B. E., Pearson, R. B., Smith, A. J., Misconi, L., Van Patten, S. M., and Walsh, D. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 989-992). Amino acid residues in PKI-(5-24)-amide responsible for the potent inhibition (Ki = 2.3 nM) of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase were further investigated using deletion and substitution analogs of the synthetic peptide. Residues 5, 23, and 24 were not required for activity since the 17-residue PKI-(6-22)-amide retained full potency. Sequential removal of the first seven amino acids from the NH2 terminus of PKI-(5-24)-amide caused a progressive 50-fold loss of inhibitory potency. In contrast, substitution of either Thr6, Asp9, or Ile11 with alanine, or Ala8 by leucine, in PKI-(5-22)-amide produced less than 3-fold decreases in potency. Of the 2 aromatic residues in PKI-(5-22)-amide, the individual substitution of Phe10 and Tyr7 by alanine caused, respectively, 90- and 5-fold decreases in inhibitory potency, demonstrating important roles for each. This NH2-terminal portion of the peptide is believed to contain a significant portion of alpha-helix. Many recognition or structural determinants are also essential in the COOH-terminal portion of PKI-(5-22)-amide. In addition to the basic subsite provided by the three arginines, several other of the residues are critical for full inhibitory potency. Substitution of Ile22 by glycine in either PKI-(5-22)-amide or PKI-(14-22)-amide lowered the inhibitory potency by 150- and 50-fold, respectively. Separate replacement of Gly17 or Asn20, in either PKI-(5-22)-amide or PKI-(14-22)-amide, caused 7-15-fold decreases in potency. Substitution of both Gly17 and Asn20 together (in PKI-(14-22)-amide) produced a synergistic loss of inhibitory activity. [Leu13,Ile14]PKI-(5-22)-amide, a doubly substituted analog exhibited a 42-fold increase in Ki value. We conclude that Ser13 and/or Gly14, Gly17, Asn20, and Ile22 each contribute important features to the binding of these inhibitory peptides to the protein kinase, either by providing recognition determinants, inducing structure, and/or allowing essential peptide backbone flexibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1608374437,"Synthetic peptides based on the COOH-terminal 21 residues of hirudin were prepared in order to 1) evaluate the role of this segment in hirudin action toward thrombin, 2) define the shortest peptide derivative with anticoagulant activity, and 3) investigate the role of tyrosine sulfation in the peptides' inhibitory activities. A hirudin derivative of 20 amino acids, Hir45-64 (derived from residues 45-64 of the hirudin polypeptide), was found to effect a dose-dependent increase in the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of normal human plasma but to have no measurable inhibitory activity toward thrombin cleavage of a tripeptidyl p-nitroanilide substrate. Anticoagulant activity in hirudin derivatives was comparable in peptides of 20, 16, and 12 residues truncated from the NH2 terminus. Additional truncated peptides prepared by synthesis and carboxypeptidase treatment reveal that the minimal sequence of a hirudin peptide fragment with maximal anticoagulant activity is contained within the sequence: NH2-Asn-Gly-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-COOH. The 12-residue derivative thus identified was reacted with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in the presence of sulfuric acid to yield a Tyr-sulfated peptide, S-Hir53-64. By comparison to unsulfated peptide, S-Hir53-64 was found to contain a specific inhibitory activity enhanced by one order of magnitude toward increase in APTT and to effect a dose-dependent increase in thrombin time of normal human plasma to yield a 4-fold increase in thrombin time with 2.5 micrograms/ml peptide using 0.8 units/ml alpha-thrombin. Comparison of S-Hir53-64 to hirudin in thrombin time and APTT assays reveals a 50-fold difference in molar specific activities toward inhibition of thrombin. Comparison of antithrombin activities of S-Hir53-64 using a variety of animal thrombins demonstrates greatest inhibitory activity toward murine, rat, and human enzymes and a 10-fold reduced activity toward bovine thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1578978258,"The effects of purinergic agonists on phosphatidylcholine (PC) breakdown and prostacyclin synthesis were investigated in cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) prelabeled with [3H]choline and [14C]myristic acid. Both labels were selectively incorporated into PC. In BPAEC prelabeled with [3H]choline, ATP stimulated a rapid 5-fold increase in intracellular free [3H]choline. [3H]Choline formation was associated with a concomitant loss of 3H from PC, and it was not preceded by an increase in the 3H content of other PC degradation products. In BPAEC prelabeled with [14C]myristic acid, ATP stimulated a rapid increase in [14C]phosphatidic acid and [14C]diacylglycerol. These changes were associated with a loss of 14C from PC but not from phosphatidylinositol. In permeabilized BPAEC prelabeled with [3H]choline, ATP and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) stimulated an increase in [3H]choline but not [3H]phosphocholine. The effects of ATP and GTP gamma S were synergistic at low GTP gamma S concentrations. Permeabilized BPAEC did not convert exogenous [3H]phosphocholine to [3H]choline. These data are consistent with the notion that purinergic agonists stimulate PC breakdown by a phospholipase D mechanism. This suggestion was supported by the observation that in the presence of ethanol, ATP stimulated the formation of [14C]phosphatidylethanol in BPAEC prelabeled with [14C]myristic acid. Several adenine nucleotides and related purine derivatives were compared for their effectiveness in stimulating PC breakdown and prostacyclin synthesis. The chemical specificity observed for the two responses indicated that both were mediated by the P2Y purinoceptor subtype. PC breakdown stimulated by ATP occurred prior to the maximum rate of release of prostacyclin into the medium. Taken together these data indicate that PC breakdown in endothelial cells stimulated with purinergic agonists is due, at least in part, to the activation of a phospholipase D that is coupled to purinoceptors by a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In conjunction with previous data on the effects of bradykinin, these findings suggest an important role for PC breakdown in the mechanism of signal transduction in endothelial cells stimulated with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1563991419,"Microsomal preparations from retinal pigment epithelium carry out phosphatidylcholine synthesis upon incubation with 1-palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acyl-CoA. Phosphatidylcholine synthesized in situ in this manner is an acyl donor for retinyl ester synthesis, demonstrating the existence of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase. Although acyl transfer to retinol is from the 1-position of phosphatidylcholine, the fatty acid in the 2-position is important in substrate recognition. The finding of this novel enzyme activity in retinal pigment epithelial microsomes suggests that phosphatidylcholine is the endogenous acyl donor in CoA-independent retinol esterification observed in these preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1500471999,"African green monkeys were fed diets containing low and moderate cholesterol concentrations with either polyunsaturated or unsaturated fat as 40% of calories. Plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apoB concentrations generally were higher in animals fed (a) the higher dietary cholesterol concentration and (b) saturated fat. At necropsy, liver and intestine were removed, and measurement of mRNAs for LDL receptors (liver) and for apolipoprotein B (liver and intestine) was done. Monkey small intestine mucosa made exclusively apoB48 while the liver made only apoB100, although apoB mRNA in both tissues was the same size (14 kilobases). No dietary cholesterol or fat effects were found for apoB mRNA abundance in the liver, while the animals fed the higher dietary cholesterol level had 50% lower levels of hepatic LDL receptor mRNA. In a separate group of animals, livers were perfused and the rate of apoB secretion was measured. No dietary fat effect on apoB secretion rate was found, and no relationship between plasma LDL cholesterol concentration and the rate of hepatic apoB production existed. These findings support the idea that the dietary factors that increase LDL concentrations act by reducing clearance of apoB-containing particles rather than by increasing production of these lipoproteins. Hepatic LDL receptor mRNA was similar in abundance in polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat-fed animals, suggesting that the difference in plasma cholesterol concentration between these groups is not mediated via effects on LDL receptor mRNA abundance. The level of intestinal apoB mRNA was about 30% higher in animals fed the moderate dietary cholesterol concentration. Earlier studies have shown that more cholesterol is transported in chylomicrons from the intestine when dietary cholesterol levels are higher, and the increased intestinal apoB mRNA abundance may reflect increased intestinal cholesterol transport and chylomicron apoB48 production."
https://openalex.org/W1598340803,"The gene encoding the secreted 53-kDa metalloprotease (protease B) and the 5′ end of the gene encoding the secreted 55-kDa metalloprotease (protease C) of the Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi have been sequenced. The predicted sequences of the two proteases do not have typical signal sequences at their NH2 termini. Both proteases are synthesized as inactive higher molecular weight precursors (zymogens proB and proC) which are secreted into the external medium where divalent cation-mediated activation occurs. The activation of proB occurs with a t½ of less than 5 min at 37 °C in Luria broth medium, whereas that of proC occurs with a t1/2 of about 150 min. The NH2 termini of purified proteases B, proB, and C were sequenced. ProB starts at the initiator methionine whereas B and C start, respectively, at residues +16 and +18 of the sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence. A short NH2-terminal extension is therefore removed during the activation process, most likely by an autocatalytic mechanism. Protease B shows a high degree of sequence homology with the secreted 50-kDa metalloprotease of Serratia marcescens, which also lacks a signal peptide and for which an inactive higher molecular weight form has been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1586686759,"Platelet membrane GPIIbIIIa is a member of the family receptors named integrins that recognize RGD sequences in their ligands. GPIIbIIIa interacts with at least three different adhesive ligands: fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. These interactions are inhibited by RGD-containing peptides and by peptides corresponding to a sequence unique to fibrinogen in the COOH-terminal domain of its γ chain (HLGGAKQAGDV). Two RGD sequences are present in fibrinogen Aα chain: an RGDS sequence at A α 572–575, and an RGDF sequence at Aα 95–98. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the RGDF sequence and the γ COOH-terminal domain both reacted specifically with fibrinogen in solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoprecipitated the protein in solution. The Fab fragments prepared from these antibodies inhibited fibrinogen-platelet interaction and aggregation. These results demonstrate that these two sequences are both accessible within the fibrinogen molecule and are both implicated in ligand binding and cell-cell interaction. In addition, by further examining the interaction of the γ chain peptide with platelets, it was found that RGDF and the γ peptide produced a similar dose-dependent inhibition of the binding of the labeled γ peptide to ADP-stimulated platelets. These results provide evidence that the RGDF sequence present at the Aα 95–98 constitutes with the γ 401–411 sequence two recognition sites interacting with the same site or with mutually exclusive sites on GPIIbIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1653700630,"Genomic clones encompassing the entire human elastin gene, including 11 kilobases flanking the ATG translation initiation codon, have been obtained and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and extensive DNA sequencing. These analyses demonstrated that functionally distinct hydrophobic and cross-linking domains of the protein are segregated into separate exons throughout the gene. All exons are multiples of three nucleotides, and exon:intron borders always split codons in the same way which permits cassette-like alternative splicing. The 5'-flanking region lacks a canonical TATA sequence, is G + C-rich, and contains several SP1 binding sites and an AP2 binding site. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments indicate that transcription is initiated at multiple sites in the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1485380500,"We have purified to apparent homogeneity an oxysterol binding protein from cytosol of hamster livers. This protein, which corresponds to the protein described by Taylor and Kandutsch (Taylor, F. R., and Kandutsch, A. (1985) Chem. Phys. Lipids 38, 187-194), binds oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol but does not bind cholesterol or steroid hormones in vitro. It may participate in the feedback repression of enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis and the low density lipoprotein receptor. The protein was purified more than 40,000-fold with a series of ion exchange chromatography steps. The final preparation contained a doublet of peptides with molecular weights (Mr) of 101,000 and 96,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These components formed a complex that migrated on gel filtration with an apparent Mr of 280,000 in the absence or presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The amino acid sequence of a tryptic peptide from this protein complex was obtained, and a monoclonal antipeptide antibody was prepared. The antibody stained both the 101,000- and 96,000-Da proteins on immunoblots, suggesting that these two components are closely related and that one may be a modified or proteolyzed form of the other. With the purified protein now available, it should become possible to determine the role, if any, that this protein plays in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2108068214,"Abstract Studies reported previously from this laboratory have demonstrated that membranes from the pigment epithelium of the vertebrate eye can transform free all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol as well as 11-cis- and all trans-retinyl esters (Bernstein, P. S., Law, W. C., and Rando, R. R. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 1849-1853; Bernstein, P. S., Law, W. C., and Rando, R. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16848-16857; Fulton, B. S., and Rando, R. R. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 7938-7945). The congeneric retinals are also formed under conditions where retinol redox activity is present. Here we report the successful solubilization of both the retinyl ester synthetase and isomerase activities from the pigment epithelium membranes of the bovine eye. The zwitterionic detergent Zwittergent 3-14(N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate; cmc 0.012%) gave optimal solubilization of both activities. Three initial criteria for successful solubilization were used. First, high speed centrifugation (greater than 150,000 x g) left the activities in the supernatant. Second, the solubilized enzymatic activities were found in the included volume upon gel filtration. Finally, the solubilized activities were quantitatively passed through a 0.22-microns filter. Employing anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography results in a partial purification of the retinyl ester synthetase (approximately 189-fold). The solubilized retinoid isomerase is also partially purified (approximately 10-14-fold) following anion exchange chromatography. It is also shown that the membrane-bound and solubilized ester synthetase catalyzes the esterification of retinol using added lecithins as exogenous acyl donors. In addition, evidence is provided indicating that there is a positional selectivity for the acyl group transfer from the lecithin to retinol. The transfer occurs largely, if not entirely, from the 1-position of the lecithin."
https://openalex.org/W140087283,"The rat alpha-thyroid hormone receptor gene encodes through alternative splicing at least three protein isoforms with different functions, and three mRNA species (2.6, 5.4, 6.8 kilobase (kb) in size) are detected using alpha gene-specific probes (Mitsuhashi, T., Tennyson, G. E., Nikodem, V. M. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 5804-5808). In the present study, the identities of these mRNAs were analyzed by Northern analysis, and it was demonstrated that in rat brain the receptor protein is encoded by the minor 5.4- and 6.8-kb mRNAs and the variant proteins are encoded by the major 2.6-kb mRNA. Relative quantities of these mRNAs were determined by RNase protection assay, and the ratio of the receptor mRNAs to the variant mRNAs was estimated to be 1:6 in adult brain. The ratio between the mRNAs was regulated in both a tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific manner. The receptor mRNA levels were also regulated by the thyroid state of the animal showing an increased level in hypothyroid rat liver while those in brain were not affected. Analysis of the alpha-thyroid hormone receptor gene suggested that the choice between two poly-adenylation sites and subsequent RNA processing appear to generate the 3' heterogeneity of these alternative mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W94613862,"We have purified from nuclear extracts of Drosophila Kc cells a 36-kDa protein, DmS-II, which has an effect on the elongation properties of RNA polymerase II. DmS-II stimulates RNA polymerase II during the transcription of double-stranded DNA templates when the nonphysiological divalent cation manganese is present. In the presence of physiological mono- and divalent cations, the factor reduces the tendency of RNA polymerase II to pause at specific sites along a dC-tailed template including the major pause encountered after 14 nucleotides have been incorporated. Based on its size and chromatographic properties, as well as its ability to stimulate RNA polymerase II activity in the presence of manganese, the protein seems to be analogous to a factor S-II purified from mouse cells (Sekimizu, K., Kobayashi, N., Mizuno, D., and Natori, S. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 5064-5070). We have used a completely defined system and show that the properties of DmS-II are intrinsic to the factor and not mediated through other factors."
https://openalex.org/W115701967,"The structure of the insulin receptor was studied with polyclonal antibodies obtained from rabbits which were immunized with synthetic peptides having a sequence identity to three regions of the alpha-subunit and five regions of the beta-subunit. None of the alpha-subunit antibodies including alpha-Pep8 (residues 40-49 (Ullrich, A., Bell, J.R., Chen, E.Y., Herrera, R., Petruzzelli, L.M., Dull, T.J., Gray, A., Coussens, L., Liao, Y.-C., Tsubokawa, M., Mason, A., Seeburg, P.H., Grunfeld, C., Rosen, O.M., and Ramachandran, J.

(1985) Cell 313, 747-758], or alpha-Pep6 (residues 1-7, 9) immunoprecipitated the human insulin receptor solubilized from IM-9 lymphocytes; however, alpha-Pep8 immunoprecipitated the dithiothreitol-reduced receptor. Antibodies prepared against the N terminus of the beta-subunit (alpha-Pep5, residues 780-790) and the ATP binding site (alpha-Pep3, residues 1013-1022) did not react with the intact receptor under any conditions; however, antibodies to the C terminus of the beta-subunit (alpha-Pep1, residues 1314-1324) and to the juxta-membrane region (alpha-Pep3, residues 952-962) immunoprecipitated the solubilized receptor in both its phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. In contrast, the antibody reactive with the regulatory region of the beta-subunit which contains the major autophosphorylation sites (alpha-Pep2, residues 1143-1154) only precipitated the phosphorylated form. Thus the conformation of the extracellular domain of the receptor is rigid and stabilized by disulfide bonds, whereas several regions of the intracellular domain are accessible to antibodies and undergo conformational changes during autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1547473925,"Hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase activity was demonstrated in rat liver cytosol using as substrate [1-14C] hepoxilin A3, a recently described hydroxy epoxide derivative of arachidonic acid. The enzyme was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity using conventional chromatographic procedures resulting in 41-fold purification. The protein eluted during isoelectric focusing at a pI in the 5.3-5.4 range. The specific activity of the purified protein was 1.2 ng/microgram protein/20 min at 37 degrees C. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under denaturing conditions, a molecular mass value of 53 kDa was observed. Using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme activity corresponded to the main protein band. The purified protein used hepoxilin A3 as preferred substrate converting it to trioxilin A3. The enzyme was marginally active toward other epoxides such as leukotriene A4 and styrene oxide. The Mr, pI, and substrate specificity of the hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase indicate that this enzyme is different from the recently reported leukotriene A4 hydrolase from human erythrocytes and rat and human neutrophils and constitutes a hitherto undescribed form of epoxide hydrolase with specificity toward hepoxilin A3. Tissue screening for enzyme activity revealed that this enzyme is ubiquitous in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1487231441,"Leaf thionins of barley have been identified as a novel class of cell wall proteins, toxic to plant pathogenic fungi, and possibly involved in the defense mechanism of plants (Bohlmann, H., Clausen, S., Behnke, S., Giese, H., Hiller, C., Reimann-Philipp, U., Schrader, G., Barkholt, V., and Apel, K., (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1559–1565). In the present work a second subfraction of thionins has been detected within the leaf cell, mainly in the vacuole. Thionins of both groups are closely related to each other. They are toxic to phytopathogenic fungi as well as to plant protoplasts, they share similar amino acid sequences, and their synthesis in etiolated seedlings of barley is down-regulated by light. Despite these similarities each of the two subfractions of thionins could be clearly distinguished by its subcellular distribution. In ultrathin sections of embedded etiolated leaf material, cell wall thionins could be immunogold labeled specifically by an antiserum raised against a fusion protein of Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and the 15,000 Mr precursor polypeptide of thionins. This antiserum did not react with intracellular thionins. Inversely, intracellular thionins were recognized specifically by an anti-serum raised against soluble leaf thionins. The possible function of intracellular thionins as part of a defense mechanism has been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493233363,"Bile acid-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase activity was measured in subcellular fractions of rat liver homogenate. The conversion of [14C]choloyl-CoA and [14C]chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA into the corresponding [14C]tauro- and glyco-bile acids was calculated after isolation of the product by high performance liquid chromatography. There was an enrichment of bile acid-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase activity in the light mitochondrial (L) fraction and to a lesser extent in the microsomal fraction. Surprisingly, no enrichment was found in the cytosolic fraction. Subfractionation of the L-fraction by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation, showed that the activity of the N-acyltransferase had a bimodal distribution and co-sedimented with peroxisomes (particulate catalase) and microsomes (esterase). The highest specific amidation activity of both choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA was always found in the most peroxisome-rich fractions. [14C]Taurocholate formation in the peroxisomal fraction was 2.2 mumol/mg of protein/min. Striking differences were observed in the Km values and the saturation concentrations for glycine and taurine. The peroxisomal amidation of [14C]choloyl-CoA had a Km for taurine of 0.9 x 10(-3) M and for glycine of 17 x 10(-3) M. The results are consistent with the possibility that most of de novo synthesized bile acids conjugate to taurine by a peroxisomal bile acid-taurine N-acyltransferase in rat liver. The bile acids deconjugated in the gut and recirculating to the liver may be activated and amidated by the microsomal enzyme system prior to biliary secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1505317991,"Human smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells express closely related myosin alkali light chains which are different from the isoforms present in striated muscle tissues. To date no information on the amino acid sequence of these mammalian nonstriated muscle isoforms has been available. We have isolated full-length cDNA clones encoding the nonmuscle (lym4) and smooth muscle (GT6) myosin light chains (MLCs) from cultured human lymphoblasts and heart aorta smooth muscle cells, respectively. Here we present the complete nucleotide sequences for both cDNA clones, together with the deduced amino acid sequences for the peptides. Both cDNAs contain the same open reading frame for 151 amino acids with 5 amino acid differences located in the C terminus. These differences are encoded by a block of 44 nucleotides which is present only in the smooth muscle (SM) mRNA. To identify the human gene coding for the two MLC isoforms, we have isolated and sequenced the nonmuscle (NM)/SM MLC gene, together with several intronless pseudogenes. A single functional gene was found containing 7 exons which are utilized for the coding information of the SM MLC mRNA. In contrast, the NM MLC mRNA does not contain sequences encoded by exon 6 which corresponds to the 44 nucleotides expressed in SM mRNA. This genomic configuration suggests that both the smooth muscle and nonmuscle MLCs in man are generated from the identical primary transcript by alternative splicing pathways taking place in a tissue-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1542815244,"Three African swine fever virus structural proteins of relative molecular weights 150,000, 37,000, and 34,000 (p150, p37, and p34) are derived from precursors with relative molecular weights 220,000, 60,000, and 39,000 (pp220, pp60, and pp39) by proteolytic cleavage after the second Gly residue in the sequence Gly-Gly-Ala/Gly. A search of the National Biomedical Research Foundation Data Bank revealed that several adenovirus proteins, ubiquitin, and an interferon-induced 15-kDa protein are also derived from precursors that are cleaved at the sequence Gly-Gly-X, where X is often an amino acid residue with a hydrophobic side chain. The sequence Gly-Gly-X together with other physical properties of the protein seems to be a recognition sequence for the processing of a variety of viral and cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1538212423,"In the presence of phenylalanine and molecular oxygen, activated phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin. The oxidation of this tetrahydropterin cofactor also proceeds if the substrate, phenylalanine, is replaced by its product, tyrosine, in the initial reaction mixture. These two reactions have been defined as coupled and uncoupled, respectively, because in the former reaction 1 mol of phenylalanine is hydroxylated for every mole of tetrahydrobiopterin oxidized, whereas in the latter reaction there is no net hydroxylation of tyrosine during the oxidation of the tetrahydropterin. During the course of the coupled oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin, a pterin 4a-carbinolamine intermediate can be detected by ultraviolet spectroscopy (Kaufman, S. (1976) in Iron and Copper Proteins (Yasunobu, K. T., Mower, H. F., and Hayaishi, O., eds) pp. 91-102, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York). Dix and Benkovic (Dix, T. A., and Benkovic, S. J. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 5839–5846) have postulated that the formation of this intermediate only occurs when the oxidation of the tetrahydropteridine is tightly coupled to the concomitant hydroxylation of the aromatic amino acid. However, during the tyrosine-dependent uncoupled oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin by phenylalanine hydroxylase, we have detected the formation of a spectral intermediate with ultraviolet absorbance that is essentially identical to that of the carbinolamine. Furthermore, this absorbance can be eliminated by the addition of 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase, an enzyme which catalyzes the dehydration of the 4a-carbinolamine. Quantitation of this intermediate suggests that there are two pathways for the tyrosine-dependent uncoupled oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin by phenylalanine hydroxylase because only about 0.3 mol of the intermediate is formed per mol of the cofactor oxidized."
https://openalex.org/W1498183721,"Abstract Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) potentiates protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent responses such as the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism in macrophages (Aderem, A. A., Cohen, D. S., Wright, S. D., and Cohn, Z. A. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 164, 165-179). Concomitantly, LPS promotes the myristoylation of a 68K PKC substrate, shown to be equivalent to the 80/87K PKC substrate found in brain and fibroblasts (Aderem, A. A., Albert, K. A., Keum, M. M., Wang, J. K., Greengard, P., and Cohn, Z. A. (1988) Nature 332, 362-364). We have now examined the effect of LPS on the phosphorylation of this 68K PKC substrate. We report here that LPS modifies the kinetics and extent of phosphorylation of the 68K protein. While treatment with LPS alone induces low level phosphorylation of the 68K protein, it markedly increases the rate of subsequent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-dependent phosphorylation of this protein. Phosphorylation in LPS-treated macrophages was maximal 1-2 min after administration of PMA, while maximal phosphorylation in macrophages not exposed to LPS was only achieved 6 min after addition of PMA. In addition to increasing the rate of PMA-dependent phosphorylation of the 68K protein in macrophages, LPS also promoted the phosphorylation of a novel peptide on the 68K protein. Thus while PMA stimulated the phosphorylation of two thermolytic phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 1 and 2), the low level of phosphorylation observed with LPS alone was found to occur on phosphopeptides 1 and 2 as well as on a novel phosphopeptide (phosphopeptide 3). Furthermore, LPS treatment of macrophages potentiated phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides when the cells were subsequently stimulated with PMA. While phosphorylation stimulated by LPS and PMA was slightly more than additive for phosphopeptides 1 and 2, it was markedly synergistic (increased 14.5-fold) for phosphopeptide 3. Phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides occurred exclusively on serine. It is possible that LPS-induced myristoylation of the 68K protein directs it to the membrane where its phosphorylation is enhanced by its close association with PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1510827875,"Rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) is a 14.3-kDa cytosolic protein which binds long chain free fatty acids (ffa) and is believed to participate in intracellular movement and/or distribution of ffa. In the studies described here fluorescently labeled ffa were used to examine the physical nature of the ffa-binding site on FABP. The fluorescent analogues were 16- and 18-carbon ffa with an anthracene moiety covalently attached at eight different points along the length of the hydrocarbon chain (AOffa). Emission maxima of all FABP-bound AOffa were found to be considerably blue-shifted with respect to emission of phospholipid membrane-bound AOffa, suggesting a high degree of motional constraint for protein-bound ffa. Large fluorescence quantum yields and long excited state life-times indicate that the FABP-binding site for ffa is highly hydrophobic. Analysis of rotational correlation times for the FABP-bound AOffa suggest that the ffa are tightly bound to the protein. Variation of the quantum yield with attachment site suggests that the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acyl chain is located near the aqueous surface of the FABP. The rest of the ffa hydrocarbon chain is buried within the protein in a hydrophobic pocket and is particularly constrained at the midportion of the acyl chain."
https://openalex.org/W1543829610,"Acyl-peptide hydrolase catalyzes the removal of an N alpha-acetylated amino acid residue from an N alpha-acetylated peptide. Two overlapping degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on the sequence of a CNBr tryptic peptide, derived from purified rat acyl-peptide hydrolase, were synthesized and used to screen a rat liver lambda gt11 cDNA library. A 2.5-kilobase cDNA was cloned and sequenced. This clone contained 2364 base pairs of rat acyl-peptide hydrolase sequence but lacked a translational initiation codon. Using a 220-base pair probe derived from near the 5'-end of this almost full-length cDNA to rescreen the library, full-length clones were isolated, which contained an in-frame ATG codon at nucleotides 6-8 and encoded the NH2-terminal sequence, Met-Glu-Arg-Gln.... The DNA sequence encoded a protein of 732 amino acid residues, 40% of which were confirmed by protein sequence data from 19 CNBr or CNBr tryptic peptides. The isolated enzyme is NH2-terminally blocked (Kobayashi, K., and Smith, J. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11435-11445), and based on the NH2-terminal protein sequence deduced from the DNA sequence and the sequence of the most NH2-terminal CNBr peptide, it is likely that the NH2-terminal residue is an acetylated methionine residue, since such residues are frequently juxtaposed to glutamyl residues (Persson, B., Flinta, C., von Heijne, G., and Jornvall, H. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 152, 523-527). The RNA blot analysis revealed a single message of 2.7 kilobases in various rat tissues examined. Although this enzyme is known to be inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and acetylalanine chloromethyl ketone (Kobayashi, K., and Smith, J. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11435-11445), no strong similarity in protein sequence has been found with other serine proteases. This result suggests that acyl-peptide hydrolase may be a unique serine protease."
https://openalex.org/W1489831960,"Abstract Incubation of murine peritoneal macrophages with platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl(C16 + C18)-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine) results in the rapid accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and mobilization of intracellular calcium (Prpic, V., Uhing, R. J., Weiel, J. E., Jakoi, L., Gawdi, G., Herman, B., and Adams, D. O. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 363-372). We have further investigated the relationship of phosphoinositide metabolism to accumulation of DAG and the possible involvement of protein kinase C in the accumulation of DAG in response to PAF. DAG accumulation proceeds at a slower rate than the accumulation of either [3H] inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or total [3H]inositol phosphates. Accumulation of DAG from additional precursors is suggested from both an estimation of the mass of total inositol phosphates produced and the accumulation of [3H]choline in response in PAF. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged pretreatment with phorbol ester or inhibition of the enzyme with sphingosine inhibited the PAF-generated accumulation of DAG at 10 min by approximately 80%. Under the same conditions, no inhibition of PAF-stimulated generation of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was observed. Similar inhibition was observed when 10 microM ionomycin or 0.1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were used to stimulate accumulation of DAG. The results suggest that PAF stimulates the accumulation of DAG from source other than phosphatidylinositol metabolism in peritoneal macrophages and that this occurs subsequent to the activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W257427902,"Changing extracellular pH (pHo) from 7.4 to 6.1 increased [3H]inositol bis- and trisphosphates approximately 10- and 5-fold, respectively, in 15 s in human fibroblasts. [3H]Inositol phosphate increased less rapidly than the polyphosphates. Bradykinin similarly increased [3H]inositol phosphates. Shifting pHo from 7.4 to 6.0 evoked a large spike in cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) which was primarily caused by the release of stored Ca2+. Changing pHo from 7.4 to 6.0 decreased cytoplasmic pH to approximately 7.0. Moderate decreases in intracellular pH had no effect on [Ca2+]i or 45Ca2+ efflux. Decreasing pHo strikingly increased 45Ca2+ efflux and decreased total cell Ca2+ similarly to bradykinin. Changing pHo from 7.4 to approximately 6.4 produced half-maximal effects on [Ca2+]i, 45Ca2+ efflux, and total Ca2+. Cycling pHo between 7.4 and 6.0 produced repetitive decreases and increases in total Ca2+. Bradykinin released the Ca2+ which was reaccumulated after an acid pulse indicating that Ca2+ had returned to the hormone-sensitive pool. Decreasing pHo also released stored Ca2+ from coronary endothelial, neuroblastoma, and umbilical artery muscle cells, but not from rat aortic smooth muscle or human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. We suggest that lowering pHo stimulates a phosphoinositidase-coupled receptor by protonating a functional group with a pKa near 6.5."
https://openalex.org/W1521392303,"Human macrophage differentiation inducing factor (DIF) can induce differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells into macrophage-like cells in vitro. A procedure is described for purification of DIF from serum-free human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cell-conditioned medium. The procedure included concentration of a conditioned medium by ultrafiltration, lentil lectin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography using Mono S and Mono Q. DIF-A of pI 9.0 and DIF-B of pI 8.8 were obtained after a final purification with a Mono Q column, and both DIF gave a single peak with a molecular weight of approximately 51,000 determined by gel chromatography. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of DIF-A showed a noticeable homology with murine leukemia inhibitory factor. Human DIF-A was found to induce maturation of human and murine leukemic cells into both macrophage-like cells with nitro blue tetrazolium reducing activity and phagocytic cells, but was found to suppress proliferation of these leukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521413977,"The nitrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii is composed of the MoFe protein (Av1), an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, and the Fe protein (Av2), a gamma 2 dimer. During turnover of the enzyme, electrons are transferred from Av2 to Av1 in parallel with the hydrolysis of MgATP. Using the cross-linking reagent, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, we have identified some of the properties of the complex between the two components. The cross-linking reaction was highly specific yielding a single apparent Mr = 97,000 protein. The amount of cross-linked product was essentially independent of whether MgATP or MgADP were in the reaction. Also, the amount was maximum at high ratios of Av2 to Av1. The Mr = 97,000 protein was characterized by amino acid analysis and Edman degradation and was found to be consistent with a 1:1 complex of an Av2 gamma subunit and an Av1 beta subunit (the amino terminal serine subunit). The complex was no longer active in the nitrogenase reaction which supports, but does not prove, the requirement for dissociation of the complex after each electron transferred. Nitrogenase activity and cross-linking were inhibited in an identical way by NaCl, which suggests that electrostatic forces are critical to the formation of the electron transfer complex."
https://openalex.org/W1537090927,"The addition of hyaluronate to intact chick embryonic heart fibroblasts enriched with a hyaluronate-binding protein (HABP) stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine/threonine residues in cellular proteins. A protein complex containing a hyaluronate-binding protein (cell-HABP) was isolated from the cultured heart fibroblasts. The isolated complex (Mr approximately 1 x 10(6] contained phosphoproteins that exhibited protein kinase activity specifically stimulated by hyaluronate. Both tyrosine and serine residues in the protein complex were phosphorylated in response to this glycosaminoglycan. The hyaluronate-stimulated protein kinase activity was tightly associated with cell-HABP in vitro; enzyme activity co-immunoprecipitated with cell-HABP using a monospecific anti-HABP antibody and co-eluted with cell-HABP when chromatographed on a column of Sephacryl S-1000 in 2.0 M guanidine hydrochloride. The uniqueness of the cell-HABP-associated protein kinase activity was suggested by both its specific response to hyaluronate, relative to related glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and chondroitin sulfate or to growth factors such as epidermal growth factor or insulin, and its antigenic distinction from other protein kinases such as growth factor receptors. These results point to a new mechanism by which glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronate, may modify cell behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1480178455,"A partially purified preparation of human erythrocyte protein 4.9, consisting of 48-, 52-, and 55-kilodalton polypeptides, is capable of bundling rabbit muscle actin in vitro (Siegel, D. L., and Branton, D. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 775–785). Purification schemes, peptide mapping, antibody cross-reactivity, and chemical cross-linking techniques show that the 48- and 52-kDa polypeptides are sequence-related phosphorylated components, whereas the 55-kDa polypeptide is not. Purified protein 4.9 (dematin), consisting of 48- and 52-kDa polypeptides, effectively bundles actin in vitro; under similar conditions, the isolated 55-kDa polypeptide does not bundle actin. In fact, when added back to purified dematin, fractions containing the 55-kDa polypeptide can completely abolish dematin's actin-bundling activity. The basis for this inhibitory activity is an endogenous protein kinase that phosporylates both the 48- and 52-kDa isoforms of dematin, thus abolishing dematin's actin-bundling activity (Husain-Chishti, A., Levin, A., and Branton, D. (1988) Nature 334, 718–721). Although the endogenous kinase often co-purifies with the 55-kDa polypeptide, it can be separated from the 55-kDa polypeptide and has the characteristics of a catalytic subunit of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1481481001,"A new hydroxylated, very long-chain fatty acid has been isolated and characterized from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Rhizobium trifolii ANU 843. The lipid A of the organism was degraded by mild alkali and borohydride and the products methylated, peracetylated, and fractionated on a C18 reverse-phase column. The major lipid fraction was reduced with lithium triethylborohydride, methylated, peracetylated, and subjected to thin layer chromatography. The methylated peracetylated acid and the reduced diacetylated diol (1,27-dihydroxyoctacosane diacetate) were isolated and characterized by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy using homonuclear decoupling. The identity and linkage of the new fatty acid in the lipopolysaccharide was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy of purified lipid A fractions and similar NMR studies of lipid A after acylation by phenylisocyanate. In the native LPS, the 27-hydroxy C-28 fatty acid is acylated at the 27-hydroxy position by other 3-hydroxy fatty acids. About 50% of the total fatty acid content of the LPS of R. trifolii ANU 843 is 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid. This oxyacyloxy structure involving 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic appears to be the major structural feature of the lipid A of this organism."
https://openalex.org/W1495168738,"We examined the extranuclear effects of thyroid hormones on human platelets. Pretreatment with DL-thyroxine or DL-triiodothyronine inhibited collagen-induced aggregation, in a dose-dependent manner, but other derivatives of thyroid hormone had no significant effects. In contrast to collagen, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced aggregation was not affected by thyroid hormones at the same concentration range. Thyroxine also inhibited the release of [14C] serotonin from collagen-stimulated platelets, with a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of 20,000-dalton protein. Thyroxine and triiodothyronine had inhibitory effects on myosin light chain kinase purified from human platelets and inhibited more markedly the myosin light chain kinase than protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, L-thyroxine behaved as a competitive inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase toward calmodulin, and the Ki value was calculated to be 2.6 microM. To determine whether or not thyroxine directly binds myosin light chain kinase, we prepared an affinity column, using L-thyroxine as the ligand. Myosin light chain kinase was selectively bound to the column while calmodulin passed through. We also designed a procedure for the purification of myosin light chain kinase from human platelets, using L-thyroxine-affinity chromatography. A markedly increased purification was thus achieved, and DEAE-cellulose and L-thyroxine-affinity chromatography were made feasible. These results suggest that thyroxine can serve as a pharmacological tool for elucidating the biological significance of myosin light chain kinase-mediated reactions and is a pertinent ligand which can be used to purify myosin light chain kinase from platelets as a substitute for calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1596834868,"We have investigated the effects of podophyllotoxin on the dynamic properties of microtubules assembled from pure tubulin dimer. Excess podophyllotoxin causes the complete disassembly of microtubules, through formation of a tubulin-GTP-podophyllotoxin ternary complex with a dissociation rate constant of 160 s-1 at 37 degrees C, similar to that found upon extensive isothermal dilution in this buffer system. Addition of substoichiometric concentrations of podophyllotoxin causes partial disassembly of microtubules through production of an equivalent amount of the ternary complex. Microtubule length measurements and incorporation of [3H]GTP-tubulin dimer show that podophyllotoxin can suppress the dynamic instability of tubulin dimer microtubules and that it acts substoichiometrically in so doing. We interpret the action of substoichiometric podophyllotoxin on microtubule ends in terms of effects on interconversion of growing and shrinking microtubules in a dynamic system in which tubulin-GTP-podophyllotoxin is kinetically analogous to tubulin-GTP in addition and to tubulin-GDP in dissociation. The ability to suppress dynamic instability may be one way in which drugs such as podophyllotoxin, acting at relatively low concentrations, are able to arrest cell growth and development in a selective way, without necessarily affecting the integrity of the major part of the cytoskeletal microtubule network."
https://openalex.org/W1507661712,"Regulation of albumin gene expression is believed to be mediated by multiple nuclear factors that interact with cis-acting DNA sequences within the first 160 base pairs (bp) of the promoter. The minimal promoter sequence required to generate tissue-specific expression has not been clearly defined. We have constructed a series of transient expression vectors containing progressive deletions of the mouse albumin gene 5′-flanking sequence fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and include the Moloney murine leukemia viral (Mo-MuLV) enhancer. Promoter activity was determined in mouse hepatoma and fibroblast cell lines by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and S1 nuclease analyses. All constructions were compared with −623 Albcat-Mo-MuLV which contains all the sequence homology between the rat and mouse promoters. Low levels of expression were observed with −60 Albcat-Mo-MuLV (10%) in hepatoma but not fibroblast cells. Addition of promoter sequence to −208 bp progressively increased activity to 190% in the hepatoma cells, while −308 and −1612 Albcat-Mo-MuLV had activity similar to the −623 Albcat-Mo-MuLV level, and −3000 Albcat-Mo-MuLV showed a 2-fold reduction in transcriptional activity. The inclusion of promoter sequences upstream of −60 generated low levels of expression in the fibroblasts. We also show that factors from mouse liver nuclear extracts protect at least five regions of the albumin promoter upstream of −160. Our results indicate that tissue specificity is established within the proximal promoter region and that additional cis-acting elements that may have a functional role in the efficiency of albumin gene expression are located upstream of −160 bp."
https://openalex.org/W1485457766,"Abstract The reaction of horseradish peroxidase with alkylhydrazines results in delta-meso-alkylation of the prosthetic heme group and enzyme inactivation (Ator, M. A., David, S. K., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14954-14960). As reported here, enzyme inactivation is associated with the accumulation of intermediates that absorb at approximately 835 nm. The properties of these intermediates, including their collapse to give meso-alkylhemes, identify them as isoporphyrins. The t1/2 values for inactivation and formation of the isoporphyrin intermediate at 25 degrees C are, respectively, 11.6 and 12.5 min for methylhydrazine (2.0 mM), 8.7 and 7.2 min for ethylhydrazine (1.0 mM), and 30 and 25 s for phenylethylhydrazine (50 microM). The isoporphyrin intermediates are surprisingly long-lived, with half-lives (35 degrees C, pH 7.0) of 9, 28, 96, and 450 min for, respectively, the phenylethyl, methyl, n-butyl, and ethyl analogues. pH studies show that protonation of a group with pKa = 5.0-6.5 accelerates isoporphyrin decay and decreases steady state isoporphyrin accumulation. Horseradish peroxidase reconstituted with delta-meso-methylheme, unlike horseradish peroxidase with a heme that has a larger meso-substituent, is catalytically active but is more sensitive to H2O2-mediated degradation of the prosthetic group than is the native enzyme. The delta-meso-methylheme prosthetic group is converted in the reaction with H2O2 to a biliverdin-like product. The results implicate highly stabilized isoporphyrin intermediates in the inactivation of horseradish peroxidase by alkylhydrazines and indicate that inactivation by the meso-alkyl groups is due to steric interference with electron delivery to the heme edge rather than to intrinsic electronic consequences of meso-alkylation. The structural features that stabilize the cationic isoporphyrins may also be involved in stabilization of the Compound I porphyrin radical cation."
https://openalex.org/W1571380377,"Abstract The hydrolysis of 1,3-dioleoylglycerol and related substrates by mammalian pancreatic carboxylester lipases was studied. Mixed lipid films of substrates with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine at the argon-buffer interface were exposed to relatively high levels of monomeric porcine pancreatic carboxylester lipase for a brief period. With either 1,3-dioleoylglycerol, 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, trioleoylglycerol, or oleoylmethanol as a substrate, the percentage of substrate hydrolysis increased abruptly from near zero to near 100% with increasing proportion of substrate in the film. The phospholipid was not hydrolyzed. Using 1,3-dioleoylglycerol as the substrate with either the dimeric, porcine pancreatic carboxylester lipase, human pancreatic carboxylester lipase, or human milk bile salt-stimulated lipase gave results identical to those obtained with the porcine monomer. Hydrolysis of 1,3-dioleoylglycerol by porcine monomeric carboxylester lipase was independent of the initial surface pressure of the film. However, a strong correlation was observed between hydrolysis and interfacial lipid composition at all surface pressures, even if bulk 1,3-dioleoylglycerol was also present. The ultrasensitive dependence of hydrolysis on interfacial lipid composition, i.e. lipid-lipid interactions, suggests that such switching may contribute to the regulation of diacylglycerol levels in cells where they function in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1602233733,"A second core oligosaccharide fragment has been isolated and characterized from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Rhizobium trifolii ANU 843. The oligosaccharide is a tetrasaccharide composed of galactose, galacturonic acid, mannose, and 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid. The mannose residue is alpha-linked to the 4-position of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid and the galacturonic acid residue is alpha-linked to the 6-position of mannose. The galactose residue, which is acetylated at the 4-position, is attached to the 4-position of mannose by an alpha-linkage. All of the aldoses are in the pyranose form. The composition of the tetrasaccharide was determined by gas-liquid chromatography of the alditol acetate derivatives of the component monosaccharides. The configuration of anomeric linkages was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was performed on acetylated, per(trideutero)acetylated and underivatized tetrasaccharide giving sequence information in addition to information on the residue which was acetylated. Similar studies were performed on the oligosaccharide after reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride and peracetylation with labeled and unlabeled acetic anhydride as before. Further linkage and sequence analysis was obtained from methylation analysis, and from electron impact mass spectrometry of the per(trideutero)acetylated oligosaccharide and from collision-induced dissociation fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry using linked scans at constant B/E on the cyanoborohydride-reduced, per (trideutero)acetylated oligosaccharide. The exact location of the acetyl group was deduced from 1H NMR double resonance experiments in conjunction with mass spectrometric data."
https://openalex.org/W77011442,"Tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of N-glycosylation, was used to study the function of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in cultured human skin fibroblasts. When cells were preincubated in the presence of 0.5 micrograms/ml of the drug the incorporation of [3H]mannose into the receptor was completely prevented and that of [3H]glucosamine was reduced to approximately 41% of the control value. The [35S]methionine radioactivity detected in receptor core protein of tunicamycin-treated cells was about 52% of that measured in the receptor of control cells. The decrease in the radioactivity was similar in both the mature receptor as well as in its precursor form, and it was significantly greater than that found in total protein. The rates of receptor degradation in control- and tunicamycin-treated cells were comparable. Neither cell surface appearance of the newly synthesized LDL receptor nor its recycling were affected by tunicamycin. However, the LDL receptor produced in tunicamycin-treated cells was smaller in molecular size, and it exhibited an about 50% lower binding capacity when compared with its counterpart synthesized in control cells. This indicates that there is a relationship between N-glycosylation and the ligand binding activity of the LDL receptor. The possible role of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in optimizing the biological activity of the LDL receptor is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1509881871,"Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated native high density lipoproteins and apolipoproteins AI, AII, and CI, stimulate the release of human placental lactogen (hPL) from trophoblast cells in culture. To examine the mechanisms by which these apolipoproteins stimulate hPL release, we have studied hPL secretion in response to several synthetic peptide analogs of the amphipathic helical structure of the apolipoproteins. The magnitude of the stimulation of hPL release in response to the analog peptides correlated with the ability to displace apolipoproteins from high density lipoprotein and with other measures of phospholipid binding affinity such as the increase in alpha-helicity and the size of complexes formed between the peptide and phospholipid. The correlation of stimulatory ability and lipid affinity suggests that the action of the apolipoproteins on hPL release may be mediated through an interaction with plasma membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1530005945,"Abstract The complete peptide map of purified folded recombinant human insulin-like growth factor II (rhIGF-II) was determined to verify its sequence and disulfide bonding scheme. Each peptide generated by digestion with pepsin was purified and characterized by amino acid analysis, amino acid sequence analysis, and fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry. Some peptides were also sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry. The rhIGF-II peptide map was compared to that of rat insulin-like growth factor II and to that of a disulfide-bonded isomer of rhIGF-II. The data obtained in these studies are consistent with the conclusion that the rhIGF-II obtained from Escherichia coli has the correct amino acid composition, sequence, and the native disulfide-bonded structure. The binding affinities of these forms of recombinant IGF-II for IGF carrier proteins were measured in an IGF binding protein assay. The disulfide isomer of rhIGF-II was 160-fold less potent than native rhIGF-II in the competitive protein binding assay. These studies illustrate the need to characterize recombinant polypeptides containing disulfide bonds to allow the native structure to be verified before characterizing the biological properties of such molecules in hopes of elucidating their physiologic functions."
https://openalex.org/W1536999933,"Abstract We examined the mechanism through which fasting selectively increases the secretion of apoE while it decreases the secretion of all lipoprotein lipids (Davis, R. A., Boogaerts, J. R., Borchardt, R. A., Malone-McNeal, M., and Archambault-Schexnayder, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14137-14144). Livers were obtained from rats that were fed chow plus drinking water (control) and drinking water only (fasted) for three days. Livers were extracted for both total and poly(A) RNA. Using full length, nick-translated 32P-labeled cDNA probes for both apoE and beta-actin, the relative abundance was determined by slot blot hybridization assays. There was 2-fold more apoE mRNA in the livers of fasted rats. Furthermore, translation of poly(A) RNA using a reticulocyte lysate showed a similar 2.3-fold increase in the synthesis of immunoprecipitable [35S]methionine-labeled apoE. The 2-fold increase in translatable apoE mRNA correlates with a similar increase in apoE secretion. We also characterized the form of apoE secreted by hepatocytes from fasted cells. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the medium was separated by agarose 0.5m column chromatography. The majority of the apoE secreted cells from both control and fasted rats eluted in fractions that contained no detectable lipid. Furthermore, almost all of the increased apoE secreted by fasted cells was in these lipid-deficient fractions. The isoform distribution of apoE secreted by cells from both groups consisted of six major apoE isoforms. Consistent with previous results, treatment with neuraminidase transformed the acidic forms into the three most basic, suggesting that the three most acidic isoforms contain varying amounts of sialic acid. The isoform pattern of apoE secreted by cells from fasted rats was significantly enriched in two acidic isoforms, while it was significantly decreased in the major basic isoform. Moreover, when oleic acid (1 mM) was added to the culture medium to stimulate lipogenesis, the amount of apoE secreted with lipid increased as did the more basic isoforms. These data suggest that the secretion of lipid-deficient apoE by cells from fasted rats is the result of increased mRNA and a concomitant reduction in lipogenesis. Furthermore, the parallel shift of both the amount of apoE secreted associated with lipid as well as its isoform pattern to a more basic one by oleic acid suggests that the lipid availability plays a role in determining the lipid complement and sialic acid content of apoE secreted by the hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1508801967,"Monomeric actin labeled with the fluorescent probe N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1,5-I-AEDANS-actin) displays a fast fluorescence intensity increase immediately upon addition of salt and then a slow fluorescence intensity change concurrent with Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange at the high affinity divalent cation binding site on actin. The fast change appears to reflect competitive binding of K+ at low affinity (nonspecific) sites and of Mg2+ or Ca2+ at low and intermediate affinity sites. Binding of cation at the low affinity sites (but apparently not at the intermediate affinity sites) results in an increase in k-Ca and k-Mg and thus a decrease in affinity for divalent cations at the high affinity site. The effect of Mg2+ on k-Ca is twice that of K+ for equal fractional saturations of the low affinity binding, and the effect of K+ and Mg2+ together on k-Ca reflects competitive binding at the low affinity sites. Thus the affinity and kinetics of divalent cation binding at the high affinity site of actin are significantly affected by concurrent cation binding at low affinity sites."
https://openalex.org/W1514233449,"The murine Leydig tumor cell line, MLTC-1, contains a gonadotropin receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase. Although the binding of human choriogonadotropin (hCG) initially causes cells to accumulate cAMP, in time, the response to hCG is attenuated by desensitization. Treating intact cells with the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or with diacylglycerol also causes desensitization of the hCG response. These compounds are activators of calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC). Treating MLTC-1 cells with TPA or dioctanoylglycerol increased the portion of PKC in the cell membrane fraction. This phenomenon is associated with activation of PKC. Treating isolated membranes with purified PKC desensitize the hCG response. Thus, desensitization caused by TPA or dioctanoylglycerol is probably mediated by PKC. PKC is normally activated when phosphoinositides are metabolized to diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates. There was no significant accumulation of inositol phosphates when cells were treated with hCG. hCG did not increase the portion of PKC in the cell membrane fraction. However, hCG could desensitize isolated membranes, but TPA could not. We conclude that although protein kinase C activity can desensitize the gonadotropin response, hCG does not cause desensitization by activating PKC. The implications of this observation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1590738537,"Abstract alpha-Secondary tritium kinetic isotope effects ranging from 1.17 to 1.26 were measured for the hydrolysis of alpha-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride (forming beta-D-glucose) catalyzed by several glucoamylases and a glucodextranase. These results indicate that cleavage of the C-F bond is slow and that the enzymic transition state has significant oxo-carbonium ion character. Strong support for this conclusion is provided by the agreement found in the case of Rhizopus niveus glucoamylase (alpha-TV/K 1.26; Km 26 mM) between measured values of the alpha-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (alpha-DV/K 1.16; alpha-DV 1.20) and those calculated from the tritium isotope effect. The data are consistent with the promotion of an intramolecular elimination of fluoride by the present exo-alpha-glucanases based on their ability to stabilize, perhaps with a counter ion, the development of a carbonium ion-like transition state. Although the oxo-carbonium ion is formally denoted as an intermediate it could represent a transition state along a reaction pathway to a covalent glucosyl intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1579691816,"cAMP is a mediator of inter- and intracellular events in Dictyostelium discoideum and is thought to act through specific receptors. Eight forms of cAMP-binding proteins have been described in this organism: four forms of a cell surface receptor, a cell surface and extracellular phosphodiesterase, an intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase (CAK), and a recently identified cAMP-binding protein (CABP1) that is present on the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. In this study we have analyzed the cyclic nucleotide specificity of these cAMP-binding proteins using 13 derivatives of cAMP with modifications in the adenine, ribose, and phosphate moiety. The results suggest that the cAMP-binding proteins belong to three groups: (i) four forms of the cell surface receptor, (ii) two forms of an intracellular receptor (CABP1 and CAK), and (iii) cell surface and extracellular phosphodiesterase. cAMP is probably bound to the surface receptors in the anti conformation in a hydrophobic cleft of the receptor with essential interactions at N6H2' and O3'. In contrast, cAMP is probably bound to CAK and CABP1 in the syn conformation with essential interactions at O2', O3', O5', and exocyclic oxygen. Finally, binding of cAMP to phosphodiesterase involves only O3' and exocyclic oxygen. The cyclic nucleotide specificity of cAMP-induced processes in D. discoideum indicates that the cell surface receptors participate in the transduction of the cAMP signal during chemotaxis and cell differentiation. Functions for CABP1 and CAK in these processes are presently elusive."
https://openalex.org/W1534680436,"The feeding of mevinolin plus cholestyramine to rats results in the production of a form of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR-CM) having thiol/disulfide redox properties different from those of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isolated from animals which had been given only cholestyramine (HMGR-C). The second-order rate constant for the inactivation of HMGR-CM by GSSG is 7-fold slower than for HMGR-C, while the second-order rate constant for the reactivation of oxidized enzyme by GSH is 100-fold slower. However, in the presence of saturating concentrations of both substrates, the rate constants for thiol/disulfide exchange are similar for both forms of the enzyme. HMGR-CM behaves as if a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide having a Kox of 27 ± 4 is formed at equilibrium. In contrast, HMGR-C has previously been shown to form a protein-protein disulfide (Cappel, R. E., and Gilbert, H. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12204–12212). Both forms of the enzyme are more difficult to oxidize thermodynamically in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. For HMGR-CM, NADPH alone has no effect on the equilibrium constant for oxidation, but hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA alone makes the enzyme approximately twice as difficult to oxidize. Under physiological conditions, HMGR-CM is thermodynamically more difficult to oxidize than HMGR-C. HMGR-C can be converted to HMGR-CM by in vitro treatment with mevinolinate. A direct or indirect interaction of mevinolin with HMGR-C results in some persistent, as yet undefined, structural alteration which inhibits the formation of a protein-SS-protein disulfide upon oxidation by glutathione disulfide."
https://openalex.org/W2136940941,"Binding of RecA to poly(dG-m6dC) and poly(dG-dC) under B- and Z-form conditions was studied using circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD). LD revealed a quantitative binding of RecA to Mg2+-induced Z-form poly(dG-mSdC) with a stoichiometry of 3.1 base pairs/RecA monomer, which is slightly larger than the 2.7 base pairs observed for the B-form. The LD spectra indicate a preferentially perpendicular orientation of DNA bases and a rather parallel orientation of the tryptophan residues relative to the fiber axis in both complexes. The association rate of RecA to Z-form DNA was found to be slower than to B-form. CD measurements showed that the polynucleotide conformation is retained upon RecA binding, and CD and LD confirm that RecA binds to both forms of DNA. The Mg2+-induced Z-form is shown to be retransformed into B-form, both in free and in RecA-complexed polynucleotides by addition of NaCl, whereas the B + Z transition cannot be induced by addition of Mg2+ when the polynucleotide is complexed with RecA. From this it is inferred that RecA does not stabilize the Z-conformation of the polynucleotide but that it can kinetically “freeze” the polynucleotide in its B-conformation. On all essential points, the same conclusions were also reached in a corresponding study of unmethylated poly(dG-dC) with the Z-form induced by Mn2+."
https://openalex.org/W1630359088,"The three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin a, a single-chain, 62-residue protein neurotoxin from snake venom, has been determined to 2.0-A resolution by x-ray crystal structure analysis. Molecular replacement methods were used, and the structure refined to a residual R = 0.17. The sites of 62 water molecules and 1 sulfate ion have been located and refined. The structure of erabutoxin a is very similar to that established earlier for erabutoxin b. These toxins from venom of the same snake differ in sequence only at residue 26, which is Asn in erabutoxin a and His in erabutoxin b. The substitution leads to only minor variations in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the distribution of thermal parameters and the implied regional mobilities are similar in the two structures. In particular, the highly mobile character of the peripheral segment Pro44-Gly49 in both structures supports the specific role proposed for this segment in neurotoxin binding to the acetylcholine receptor. Forty-eight of the solvent sites determined are first surface positions; approximately one-half of these are equivalent to solvent sites in erabutoxin b."
https://openalex.org/W1592931615,"Abstract On modification of arginine residues with 2,3-butanedione, the Thermus caldophilus L-lactate dehydrogenase is converted to an activated form that is independent of an allosteric effector, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2). The conformation of NAD+ bound to the modified enzyme in the absence of Fru-1,6-P2 was investigated by means of proton NMR, analyzing the time dependence of the transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (TRNOE) and TRNOE action spectra. The inter-proton distances determined on TRNOE analysis indicated that both the nicotinamide riboside moiety and the adenosine moiety of NAD+ were in the anti conformation, the ribose rings being in the C3'-endo form. This conformation was almost the same as that of NAD+ bound to the native enzyme-Fru-1,6-P2 complex, rather than that of NAD+ bound to the free native enzyme. These results suggest that the C3'-endo-anti form of the enzyme-bound NAD+ is essential for the activation of the T. caldophilus L-lactate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1510433582,"For the baboon endogenous virus to infect human cells a specific region on chromosome 6 is required for viral DNA replication and integration. In studying the kinetics of baboon endogenous virus DNA replication we show that linear DNA was synthesized as the predominant species after infection and that unintegrated DNA persisted after many cell passages. Examination of integrated DNA revealed the failure of the virus to integrate at early passages. With continuous replication, however, virus integration was observed, but at multiple sites in the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W1501425205,"A synthetic peptide, corresponding to the 14-amino acid tryptic fragment containing phosphorylation sites one and two of bovine mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, was coupled to Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin and used to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies. A positive signal was observed when Western blots of bovine, porcine, or yeast mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes were probed with the antibodies but not with blots of bacterial, cellular slime mold, plant mitochondrial, or plant plastid pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. The antibodies also gave a positive signal when used to probe blots of the bovine kidney branched chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation/inactivation of rat liver mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex could be inhibited by prior incubation with the anti-peptide antibodies."
