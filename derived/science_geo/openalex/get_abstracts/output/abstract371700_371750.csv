https://openalex.org/W2123879591,"The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2128006942,"Quantum physics exhibits remarkable distinguishing characteristics. For example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not allow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be stronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be transmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do not single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share such traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum correlations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It states that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown to him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be correlated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is bounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains to her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to the standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is respected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all the no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum correlations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob access to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit is sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the value of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We suggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be one of the foundational properties of Nature."
https://openalex.org/W2783677708,"Mutations in genes of the RAS family are preset on about 20% of human cancers, making RAS proteins prime potential targets for cancer therapy. Direct targeting of RAS proteins has not so far been productive, but two papers published in this issue offer the prospect of alternative targets in a signalling pathway downstream of RAS. Using a synthetic lethality RNAi screen, Barbie et al. identify TBK1 as a kinase in the NF-κB signalling pathway that is essential for the survival of KRAS-transformed cells. TBK1 induces anti-apoptotic signals and may be a therapeutic cancer target. And in an elegant mouse model for lung cancer driven by Kras mutation and loss of p53, Meylan et al. show that NF-κB signalling is activated by the concerted actions of these two alterations and required for tumour initiation and tumour maintenance. NF-κB transcription factors have been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, but despite extensive biochemical characterization of NF-κB signalling, its requirement in tumour development is not completely understood. Here, the NF-κB pathway is shown to be required for the development of tumours in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma in a p53-status-dependent manner, providing support for the development of NF-κB inhibitory drugs as targeted therapies. NF-κB transcription factors function as crucial regulators of inflammatory and immune responses as well as of cell survival1. They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis2,3,4,5,6. However, despite extensive biochemical characterization of NF-κB signalling during the past twenty years, the requirement for NF-κB in tumour development in vivo, particularly in solid tumours, is not completely understood. Here we show that the NF-κB pathway is required for the development of tumours in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 (also known as Trp53) and expression of oncogenic Kras(G12D) resulted in NF-κB activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conversely, in lung tumour cell lines expressing Kras(G12D) and lacking p53, p53 restoration led to NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-κB signalling induced apoptosis in p53-null lung cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumours in vivo, from the time of tumour initiation or after tumour progression, resulted in significantly reduced tumour development. Together, these results indicate a critical function for NF-κB signalling in lung tumour development and, further, that this requirement depends on p53 status. These findings also provide support for the development of NF-κB inhibitory drugs as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined mutations in Kras and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2168649860,"The tumour stroma is believed to contribute to some of the most malignant characteristics of epithelial tumours. However, signalling between stromal and tumour cells is complex and remains poorly understood. Here we show that the genetic inactivation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts of mouse mammary glands accelerated the initiation, progression and malignant transformation of mammary epithelial tumours. This was associated with the massive remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), innate immune cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis. Loss of Pten in stromal fibroblasts led to increased expression, phosphorylation (T72) and recruitment of Ets2 to target promoters known to be involved in these processes. Remarkably, Ets2 inactivation in Pten stroma-deleted tumours ameliorated disruption of the tumour microenvironment and was sufficient to decrease tumour growth and progression. Global gene expression profiling of mammary stromal cells identified a Pten-specific signature that was highly represented in the tumour stroma of patients with breast cancer. These findings identify the Pten-Ets2 axis as a critical stroma-specific signalling pathway that suppresses mammary epithelial tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2067780273,"Millions of people regularly obtain insufficient sleep. Given the effect of sleep deprivation on our lives, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways affected by sleep deprivation is clearly of social and clinical importance. One of the major effects of sleep deprivation on the brain is to produce memory deficits in learning models that are dependent on the hippocampus. Here we have identified a molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation alters hippocampal function. Sleep deprivation selectively impaired 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, reduced cAMP signalling, and increased activity and protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep-deprivation-induced deficits in cAMP signalling, synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings demonstrate that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal function by interfering with cAMP signalling through increased PDE4 activity. Thus, drugs that enhance cAMP signalling may provide a new therapeutic approach to counteract the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1980216636,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as an important model for studies of the regulation of fat storage. C. elegans feed on bacteria, and various strains of E. coli are commonly used in research settings. However, it is not known whether particular bacterial diets affect fat storage and metabolism.Fat staining of fixed nematodes, as well as biochemical analysis of lipid classes, revealed considerable differences in fat stores in C. elegans growing on four different E. coli strains. Fatty acid composition and carbohydrate levels differ in the E. coli strains examined in these studies, however these nutrient differences did not appear to have a causative effect on fat storage levels in worms. Analysis of C. elegans strains carrying mutations disrupting neuroendocrine and other fat-regulatory pathways demonstrated that the intensity of Nile Red staining of live worms does not correlate well with biochemical methods of fat quantification. Several neuroendocrine pathway mutants and eating defective mutants show higher or lower fat storage levels than wild type, however, these mutants still show differences in fat stores when grown on different bacterial strains. Of all the mutants tested, only pept-1 mutants, which lack a functional intestinal peptide transporter, fail to show differential fat stores. Furthermore, fatty acid analysis of triacylglycerol stores reveals an inverse correlation between total fat stores and the levels of 15-methylpalmitic acid, derived from leucine catabolism.These studies demonstrate that nutritional cues perceived in the intestine regulate fat storage levels independently of neuroendocrine cues. The involvement of peptide transport and the accumulation of a fatty acid product derived from an amino acid suggest that specific peptides or amino acids may provide nutritional signals regulating fat metabolism and fat storage levels."
https://openalex.org/W2165794817,"For imaging beyond the diffraction limit, to resolve tiny features in cells for example, researchers have so far had to rely on tagging the imaged object with fluorescent chromophores or on other microscopy techniques that do not exploit fluorescence but are much less sensitive. A team from the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard has now developed an alternative approach known as stimulated emission microscopy, incorporating experimental techniques previously used in other multiphoton microscopies. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated in applications including label-free microvascular imaging and monitoring lacZ gene expression with a chromogenic reporter. The technique is orders of magnitude more sensitive than absorption, is not subject to interference from other chromophores in the sample, and is amenable to three-dimensional sectioning. Importantly, all molecules are potential targets for stimulated emission microscopy, so it can be used to image non-fluorescing substances such as haemoglobin previously inaccessible to super-resolution microscopy. Imaging beyond the diffraction limit — to resolve tiny features in cells, for example — has had to rely on tagging the imaged substance with fluorescent chromophores or other techniques that are much less sensitive, like absorption. The use of stimulated emission (a property, unlike fluorescence, which all molecules can have) is now reported; sensitivity is orders of magnitude higher than for spontaneous emission or absorption contrast, and fluorescence is not used. Fluorescence, that is, spontaneous emission, is generally more sensitive than absorption measurement, and is widely used in optical imaging1,2. However, many chromophores, such as haemoglobin and cytochromes, absorb but have undetectable fluorescence because the spontaneous emission is dominated by their fast non-radiative decay3. Yet the detection of their absorption is difficult under a microscope. Here we use stimulated emission, which competes effectively with the nonradiative decay, to make the chromophores detectable, and report a new contrast mechanism for optical microscopy. In a pump–probe experiment, on photoexcitation by a pump pulse, the sample is stimulated down to the ground state by a time-delayed probe pulse, the intensity of which is concurrently increased. We extract the miniscule intensity increase with shot-noise-limited sensitivity by using a lock-in amplifier and intensity modulation of the pump beam at a high megahertz frequency. The signal is generated only at the laser foci owing to the nonlinear dependence on the input intensities, providing intrinsic three-dimensional optical sectioning capability. In contrast, conventional one-beam absorption measurement exhibits low sensitivity, lack of three-dimensional sectioning capability, and complication by linear scattering of heterogeneous samples. We demonstrate a variety of applications of stimulated emission microscopy, such as visualizing chromoproteins, non-fluorescent variants of the green fluorescent protein, monitoring lacZ gene expression with a chromogenic reporter, mapping transdermal drug distributions without histological sectioning, and label-free microvascular imaging based on endogenous contrast of haemoglobin. For all these applications, sensitivity is orders of magnitude higher than for spontaneous emission or absorption contrast, permitting nonfluorescent reporters for molecular imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2024772182,"The wound response prohormone jasmonic acid (JA) accumulates rapidly in tissues both proximal and distal to injury sites in plants. Using quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after flash freezing of tissues, we found that JA accumulated within 30 s of injury in wounded Arabidopsis leaves (p = 3.5 e−7). JA augmentation distal to wounds was strongest in unwounded leaves with direct vascular connections to wounded leaves wherein JA levels increased significantly within 120 s of wounding (p = 0.00027). This gave conservative and statistically robust temporal boundaries for the average velocity of the long distance signal leading to distal JA accumulation in unwounded leaves of 3.4–4.5 cm min−1. Like JA, transcripts of the JA synthesis gene LIPOXYGENASE2 (LOX2) and the jasmonate response gene JAZ10.3 also accumulated to higher levels in directly interconnected leaves than in indirectly connected leaves. JA accumulation in a lox2-1 mutant plant was initiated rapidly after wounding then slowed progressively compared with the wild type (WT). Despite this, JAZ10.3 expression in the two genotypes was similar. Free cyclopentenone jasmonate levels were similar in both resting WT and lox2-1. In contrast, bound cyclopentenone jasmonates (arabidopsides) were far lower in lox2-1 than in the WT.

https://openalex.org/W2026531906,"One of the oldest questions in biology is, why are there separate sexes? More animals reproduce by cross-fertilization than by 'selfing', despite the cost of producing males and finding mates. Two advantages of cross-fertilization or outcrossing that could outweigh its cost are commonly suggested: the ability to evolve rapidly and avoidance of inbreeding, but it is hard to test for these experimentally. An experiment in which 'selfing' and 'outcrossing' variants of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes were subjected to selective pressures now provides a practical test, and both potential standard explanations appear to have a role in promoting outcrossing. The tendency of organisms to reproduce by cross-fertilization, despite the advantages of self-fertilization and particularly the cost of males, is one of the oldest puzzles of evolutionary biology. Two advantages of outcrossing that could outweigh this cost have been suggested: the avoidance of inbreeding and an enhanced ability to adapt to environmental change. Here, the study of outcrossing in populations of Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that both of these explanations are correct. The tendency of organisms to reproduce by cross-fertilization despite numerous disadvantages relative to self-fertilization is one of the oldest puzzles in evolutionary biology. For many species, the primary obstacle to the evolution of outcrossing is the cost of production of males1, individuals that do not directly contribute offspring and thus diminish the long-term reproductive output of a lineage. Self-fertilizing (‘selfing’) organisms do not incur the cost of males and therefore should possess at least a twofold numerical advantage over most outcrossing organisms2. Two competing explanations for the widespread prevalence of outcrossing in nature despite this inherent disadvantage are the avoidance of inbreeding depression generated by selfing3,4,5 and the ability of outcrossing populations to adapt more rapidly to environmental change1,6,7. Here we show that outcrossing is favoured in populations of Caenorhabditis elegans subject to experimental evolution both under conditions of increased mutation rate and during adaptation to a novel environment. In general, fitness increased with increasing rates of outcrossing. Thus, each of the standard explanations for the maintenance of outcrossing are correct, and it is likely that outcrossing is the predominant mode of reproduction in most species because it is favoured under ecological conditions that are ubiquitous in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2061647070,"Although seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is generally attributed to the crystal-preferred orientation of olivine, the strong trench-parallel anisotropy observed in several subduction systems is difficult to explain in terms of olivine anisotropy, even if the entire mantle wedge were to act as an anisotropic source. Using high-pressure deformation experiments, Ikuo Katayama and colleagues show that the crystal-preferred orientation of serpentine, the main hydrous mineral in the upper mantle, can produce the strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy observed in such subduction systems. Although seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is generally attributed to the crystal-preferred orientation of olivine, the strong trench-parallel anisotropy observed in several subduction systems is difficult to explain in terms of olivine anisotropy. Using high-pressure deformation experiments, it is now shown that the crystal-preferred orientation of serpentine, the main hydrous mineral in the upper mantle, can produce the strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy observed in such subduction systems. Seismic anisotropy is a powerful tool for detecting the geometry and style of deformation in the Earth’s interior, as it primarily reflects the deformation-induced preferred orientation of anisotropic crystals1,2. Although seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is generally attributed to the crystal-preferred orientation of olivine3, the strong trench-parallel anisotropy (delay time of one to two seconds) observed in several subduction systems4,5 is difficult to explain in terms of olivine anisotropy, even if the entire mantle wedge were to act as an anisotropic source. Here we show that the crystal-preferred orientation of serpentine, the main hydrous mineral in the upper mantle, can produce the strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy observed in subduction systems. High-pressure deformation experiments reveal that the serpentine c-axis tends to rotate to an orientation normal to the shear plane during deformation; consequently, seismic velocity propagating normal to the shear plane (plate interface) is much slower than that in other directions. The seismic anisotropy estimated for deformed serpentine aggregates is an order of magnitude greater than that for olivine6, and therefore the alignment of serpentine in the hydrated mantle wedge results in a strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy in the case of a steeply subducting slab. This hypothesis is also consistent with the presence of a hydrous phase in the mantle wedge, as inferred from anomalously low seismic-wave velocities7."

World Health Organization, Geneva2008: 14-21Google Scholar). However, understanding of many of its key physiological processes, particularly those contributing to intracellular survival, is limited. One element of Mtb physiology that may prove important for therapeutic development is its unusually high number of cytochromes P450 (P450s). P450s are heme-dependent mono-oxygenases that utilize reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H relayed via electron transfer proteins to activate heme-bound O2. Typical of actinomycete genomes, that of Mtb includes 20 genes encoding P450s (2.Munro A.W. McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Warman A.J. Lewis G. Roitel O. Sutcliffe M.J. Kemp C.A. Modi S. Scrutton N.S.

In these bacteria, P450s are typically involved in the initial catabolism of growth substrates and in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

These results are consistent with several mutant screens, which previously identified numerous genes in the cholesterol degradation pathway as having an impact on intracellular growth and survival in both mouse and macrophage models (11.Rengarajan J.

In this work, we examined the role of Cyp125 in the mycobacterial catabolism of cholesterol using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was used as a model for cholesterol catabolism in Mtb, as the cholesterol catabolic clusters share 99% nucleotide sequence identity and the igr operons, containing cyp125, are identical in sequence. The expression of cyp125 in BCG was investigated, and a deletion strain was prepared and characterized with respect to growth and metabolite accumulation. Cyp125 of Mtb H37Rv was heterologously produced and purified. The steroid binding properties of the enzyme were investigated. Finally, the activity of Cyp125 was reconstituted in vitro, and the reaction product was characterized. The findings shed new light on the initiation of cholesterol catabolism in mycobacteria. Cholesterol, 4-cholesten-3-one, and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 26-Cholestenoic acid was a gift from Dr. Robert van der Geize. An EDTA-bridged β-cylodextrin dimer was a gift from Dr. José Vázquez Tato. Restriction enzymes and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) and Roche Applied Science (Laval, Quebec), respectively. All other reagents were of HPLC or analytical grade. Water for buffers was purified using a Barnstead Nanopure DiamondTM system (Dubuque, Iowa) to a resistivity of at least 18 mΩ. Reverse transcriptase quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed as described previously (18.Gonçalves E.R. Hara H. Miyazawa D. Davies J.E. Eltis L.D. Mohn W.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 6183-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using 5′-6FAM-TCGCGCGTGAGGAC-3′ as the probe and 5′-TGATCCCGCGATTCAAGAA-3′ and 5′-GCATGACGAAGCGCTGAAC-3′ as the forward and reverse PCR primers, respectively. cDNA was synthesized using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamers. The sigA gene was used as an internal standard in multiplex reactions and the Ct values were normalized (ΔCt) by subtracting those of the internal standard. Significant differences in ΔCt values were tested using a two-sample Student's t test assuming unequal variances. Relative fold differences were calculated as 2−ΔΔCt where ΔΔCt = ΔCt treatment − ΔCt control. For production and purification of Cyp125H37Rv, Rv3545c was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCAATAGCATATGCCCAGCCCCAATCTGCCG-3′ and 5′-GCCAAGCTTCTGTTCCGCAGTGGGATCGAAATC-3′. The amplicon was digested with NdeI and HindIII (cleavage sites underlined in primer sequences) and ligated into NdeI- and HindIII-digested pTipQC2, yielding the expression vector pTipCP125. An identical allelic exchange construct was used to replace the cyp125 gene of BCG-Pasteur (BCG_3609c) and Mtb H37Rv (Rv3545c) with a γδres-sacB-hyg-γδres cassette comprising the sacB and hygromycin resistance genes flanked by res-sites of the γδ-resolvase. Upstream and downstream flanking DNA regions of cyp125 were amplified by PCR employing the oligonucleotide pairs cyp125-LL (5′-TTTTTTTTGCATAAATTGCCGATCAACCCGGCAATCAGATG-3′) and cyp125-LR (5′-TTTTTTTTGCATTTCTTGCGCTCGACAAAG TCTCCAGAACC-3′) introducing BstAPI restriction sites (underlined) for amplification of the upstream flanking region cyp125-L; cyp125-RL (5′-TTTTTTTTCCATAGATTGGATCTTTAACGCCGTAGCCGACC-3′) and cyp125-RR (5′-TTTTTTTTCCATCTTTTGGGTTGACAGCGGCTTACCGAAC- 3′) introducing Van91I restriction sites (underlined) for amplification of the downstream flanking region cyp125-R. Amplified cyp125-L and cyp125-R were digested with BstAPI and Van91I, respectively, and ligated with Van91I-digested p0004S vector arms, 5T. Hsu and W. R. Jacobs, Jr., unpublished results. resulting in the knock-out construct pcyp125 which was linearized with PacI and cloned and packaged into the temperature-sensitive phage phAE159 6J. Kriakov and W.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), yielding the knock-out phage phcyp125. Allelic exchange in BCG and H37Rv using the phage phcyp125 was achieved by specialized transduction as reported previously (19.Bardarov S. Bardarov Jr., S. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Sambandamurthy V. Larsen M. Tufariello J. Chan J. Hatfull G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), resulting in the mutant, Δcyp125, in which nucleotides 506–1167 of the cyp125 gene (1,302 bp) are deleted and replaced by the γδres-sacB-hyg-γδres cassette (Fig. 1A). The mutant was verified by Southern analysis of BamHI-digested genomic DNA using radiolabeled cyp125-R as probe (Fig. 1B). For complementation of the Δcyp125 mutant, the cyp125 gene from BCG was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-TCGCAGCTGCATAAAAGGAGATCACTCGTGTCGTGGAATCACCAGTCAGTGG-3′ (introducing a PvuII site (underlined) and a ribosome binding site (bold) and 5′-GCCAAGCTTCTGTTCCGCAGTGGGATCGAAATC-3′ (introducing a HindIII restriction site (underlined)). Amplicons were cloned via the primer-induced restriction sites (underlined) as a PvuII-HindIII fragment downstream of the constitutive hsp60 promoter into plasmid pMV361KanR, which allows single copy integration into the genome and complementation in trans, resulting in the complemented mutant strain Δcyp125 attBL5::pMV361::cyp125 (Δcyp125-C). An empty vector control strain (Δcyp125-V) consisted of Δcyp125 attBL5::pMV361. Strain BCG was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 basal medium (BD-Difco) plus 0.5% Tyloxapol. Steroids were added to the medium dissolved in the Tyloxapol prior to autoclaving. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C on a bottle roller at one rotation per minute. As the low aqueous solubility of cholesterol results in turbidity, optical density was not used as a quantitative measure of cell growth. Rather, growth was measured on the basis of total protein, determined by disrupting cells via hot alkaline lysis followed by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. H37Rv strains were grown in a minimal medium (1 g/liter KH2PO4, 2.5 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.15 g/liter asparagine, 50 mg/liter ferric ammonium citrate, 0.5 g/liter MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 0.5 mg/liter CaCl2, 0.1 mg/liter ZnSO4, 0.05% (v/v) Tyloxapol) containing no additional carbon source or 0.5 mm cholesterol. Cholesterol was added from a stock solution dissolved in isopropanol to the culture tubes. After complete evaporation of the solvent, the liquid medium was added, heated to 80 °C, and a homogenous dispersion was produced by ultrasonication. Exponentially growing precultures were washed and starved in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tyloxapol (0.05%, v/v) for 48 h before inoculation of test cultures. Growth was monitored by measuring colony forming units (CFU) by plating serial dilutions of cultures onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Spark, MD) and 0.5% (v/v) glycerol. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed using an HP 6890 series GC system fitted with an HP-5MS 30 m × 250 μm column and an HP 5973 mass-selective detector (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Unity 500 MHz and Inova 600 MHz (Varian Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Chemical shifts, δ, are reported in ppm relative to CHCl3 (1H: δ = 7.24) and CDCl3 (13C: δ = 77.0) as internal standards. Cyp125 was heterologously produced in R. jostii RHA1 using the expression plasmid pTipCP125. Electrocompetent R. jostii RHA1 cells were transformed with pTipCP125 by electroporation using a Bio-Rad MicroPulser apparatus and Bio-Rad 0.1 cm GenePulser cuvettes. Transformed cells were grown on Luria-Bertani broth (LB) agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C for 2 days. Colonies were used to inoculate 50 ml of LB supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, which was then incubated at 30 °C shaking at 200 rpm for 2 days. 10 ml of this preculture were used to inoculate 1 liter of the LB medium, incubated at 30 °C until the OD reached 0.5, and supplemented with thiostrepton to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The cells were allowed to grow for another 20 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Pellets were washed three times with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 containing 10% glycerol and frozen at −80 °C until use. To purify Cyp125, the cell pellet from 3 liters of culture was suspended in 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5 supplemented with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). The suspended cells were subjected to 5 rounds of bead-beating for 3 min, alternating with 10 min of cooling on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged for 7 min at 4,600 × g, and the supernatant was further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 45 min. The protein was purified by chromatography using an Äkta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences): the cell-free extract (∼30 ml) was passed through a syringe-driven 0.45-μm filter and loaded (in 10-ml aliquots) onto a 1 × 10 cm column of SourceTM15Q (GE Healthcare) resin equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5. After washing the column with 0.10 m NaCl, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.10–0.16 m NaCl over six column volumes at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Red-colored fractions containing Cyp125, eluting at 0.14 m NaCl, were pooled, exchanged into 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml protein, flash frozen as beads in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Cyp125 concentrations were estimated by measuring thiolate-ligated heme iron using the extinction coefficient ϵ449–490 = 91 mm−1 cm−1 for the reduced CO-difference spectrum (20.Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). KshB was purified as described previously (6.Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermojacketed cuvette holder (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). The CO-bound form of Cyp125 was generated by first incubating samples with ∼8 mm sodium dithionite for 10 min then slowly bubbling with CO for 30 s. The proportion of purified protein containing high-spin ferric heme iron was estimated by comparing the spectra of Cyp125 to linear combinations of the spectra of Cyp125 in a high spin state (generated by adding 12 μm 4-cholesten-3-one in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (BCD) to 3.3 μm enzyme) and substrate-free P450Cam from Pseudomonas putida, generated as described previously (21.Eltis L.D. Karlson U. Timmis K.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The same values were obtained using low spin Cyp125 from R. jostii RHA1 as a standard (17.Rosloniec K. Wilbrink M.H. Capyk J.K. Mohn W.W. Ostendorf M. Van der Geize R. Dijkhuizen L. Eltis L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate-induced spectral responses were recorded in 0.1 mm KPi pH 7.0 by titrating solutions of Cyp125 with 1.0 mm stock solutions of 4-cholesten-3-one or cholesterol in either 10% BCD or 10 mm of an EDTA-linked β-cyclodextrin dimer (22.Alcalde M.A. Antelo A. Jover A. Meijide F. Tato J.V. J. Incl. Phenom. Macrocycl. Chem. 2009; 63: 309-317Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated using a quadratic equation as described for Cyp125 of R. jostii RHA1 (17.Rosloniec K. Wilbrink M.H. Capyk J.K. Mohn W.W. Ostendorf M. Van der Geize R. Dijkhuizen L. Eltis L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Non-linear least-squares fitting was done using the program R (23.The R Development Core TeamR: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria2008Google Scholar). Cyp125 activity was measured by monitoring substrate and product concentrations using a Waters 2695 Separations HPLC module equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector and a 250 × 4.60 mm C18 Prodigy 10u ODS-Prep column (Phenominex, Torrance, CA). Solvents used for HPLC analysis were 0.5% aqueous phosphoric acid (A) and methanol (B). Compounds were detected at 422 nm and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient from 80–90% B over 5 min, followed by isocratic elution at 90% B for 10 min, a gradient from 90–100% B for 5 min, and further isocratic elution for 15 min. Under these conditions, elution times for 4-cholesten-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one-26-ol were 38.5 and 22.0 min, respectively. Concentrations of 4-cholesten-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one-26-ol were calculated from their respective peak areas using a standard curve of 4-cholesten-3-one and assuming that the extinction coefficients for the two compounds are similar; the R2 value for the standard curve was >0.99. The standard assay was performed in air-saturated 0.10 m potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 containing 900 μm NADH, 50 μm 4-cholesten-3-one, 1.5 μm KshB, and 1.6 μm Cyp125. Stock solutions of 1 mm 4-cholesten-3-one were made in 10% BCD and stored at 4 °C; stock solutions of 180 mm NADH were made fresh daily in water and stored on ice. Assays were conducted in multiple tubes containing 200 μl of the standard assay mixture. At each time point, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 200 μl of methanol and vigorous mixing. To investigate if cyp125 is up-regulated in BCG during growth on cholesterol, RT-qPCR was used to analyze cells growing on cholesterol versus on glucose, both sampled when at approximately half of final culture density. The cells grown on cholesterol exhibited a 7.1-fold increase in the level of normalized cyp125 transcript (n = 4, p < 0.05). These results correlate well with the expression ratio of 11 found for RHA1 cyp125 (ro04679) during growth on cholesterol versus pyruvate (3.van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), as well as for expression ratios of other cholesterol catabolic genes in BCG grown on cholesterol versus glucose (2.1- and 4.6-fold for hsaC and kshA, respectively) (3.van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Growth of both BCG and H37Rv was robust on 0.5 mm cholesterol. For BCG, growth kinetics were very similar on cholesterol or 10 mm acetate (Figs. 2 and 3). To determine if Cyp125 is essential for growth on cholesterol, cyp125 deletion mutants were created in both BCG and H37Rv using a transduction phage method. Southern blot analysis confirmed the expected chromosomal deletion and disruption (Fig. 1). The BCG Δcyp125 strain grew normally on 10 mm acetate, with kinetics very similar to BCG (Fig. 2A). Both strains also showed some growth on the basal medium with no added carbon source, because of a low level of glutamate. As hypothesized, BCG Δcyp125 failed to grow on cholesterol. Moreover, the protein yield of the mutant was lower in the cholesterol-supplemented medium than in the no-carbon control, suggesting an inhibitory effect of cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, growth was tested on medium containing acetate plus cholesterol. While the WT exhibited a higher protein yield than on either cholesterol or acetate alone, the BCG Δcyp125 mutant strain exhibited a protein yield similar to that on acetate alone. Thus, cholesterol is not inhibitory to this mutant under all conditions. Finally, all growth phenotypes observed for the BCG Δcyp125 mutant could be complemented with cyp125 provided in trans while the empty vector control strain exhibited the same growth phenotypes as the mutant strain in medium supplemented with acetate or cholesterol (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Final protein yields of wild-type (BCG), mutant (Δcyp125), and complementation (Δcyp125-C) strains. Cultures were incubated for 14 days in basal medium supplemented with no added substrate (A), 10 mm acetate (B), 0.5 mm cholesterol (C), or 10 mm acetate plus 0.5 mm cholesterol (D). Plotted values represent mean values of 3–6 replicates, and error bars indicate S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Strain BCG was additionally able to grow on 4-cholesten-3-one. The growth phenotype of BCG Δcyp125 on 4-cholesten-3-one was the same as on cholesterol: the mutant was unable to grow on 4-cholesten-3-one, and 4-cholesten-3-one inhibited its growth on the basal medium (data not shown). Thus, Cyp125 is also necessary for metabolism of this compound. BCG failed to grow on ergosterol, β-sitosterol, cholic acid, or progesterone. The former three steroids did not inhibit growth on the basal medium in the manner of cholesterol, but progesterone did so. In contrast to the BCG mutant, the H37Rv Δcyp125 mutant was not impaired in growth on cholesterol. The wild-type and mutant strains had nearly identical growth kinetics (Fig. 2B). This demonstrates a clear difference in the capacity of BCG and H37Rv to metabolize cholesterol. Cyp125 has been proposed to catalyze the obligate first step in cholesterol catabolism in R. jostii RHA1 (17.Rosloniec K. Wilbrink M.H. Capyk J.K. Mohn W.W. Ostendorf M. Van der Geize R. Dijkhuizen L. Eltis L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the same would be true for Mtb and BCG, given the similarity of the cholesterol catabolic pathway in rhodococci and mycobacteria (3.van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we compared cholesterol depletion in cultures of BCG versus BCG Δcyp125 during growth in medium with acetate plus cholesterol. BCG completely removed cholesterol in 19 days and did not accumulate any detectable steroid metabolites (Fig. 4). By contrast, Δcyp125 exhibited slower cholesterol removal and stoichiometrically accumulated 4-cholesten-3-one. Thus, cells lacking Cyp125 transform cholesterol via the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD)-catalyzed oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl group and subsequent C5-C4 isomerization of the ring structure double bond (8.Yang X. Dubnau E. Smith I. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9058-9067Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Subsequent transformation is blocked in cells lacking Cyp125 activity. 3β-HSD acts intracellularly (8.Yang X. Dubnau E. Smith I. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9058-9067Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar"
https://openalex.org/W2035832775,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small fragments of single-stranded RNA containing 18-24 nucleotides, and are generated from endogenous transcripts. MicroRNAs function in post-transcriptional gene silencing by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs, resulting in translational repression. We have developed a system to study the role of miRNAs in cell differentiation. We have found that one of the miRNAs tested in our system (miR-378, also called miR-378*) plays a role in modulating nephronectin-mediated differentiation in the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. Nephronectin is an extracellular matrix protein, and we have demonstrated that its over-expression enhanced osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation. Furthermore, we found that the nephronectin 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) contains a binding site for miR-378. Stable transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells with miR-378 inhibited cell differentiation. MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nephronectin exhibited higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation as compared with cells transfected with nephronectin containing the 3'UTR in the early stages of development, suggesting that endogenous miR-378 is present and active. However, in the later stages of MC3T3-E1 development, the differentiation rates were opposite, with higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation in the cells over-expressing the 3'UTR of nephronectin. This appeared to be the consequence of competition between nephronectin and UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GalNAc-T7 or GalNT7) for miR-378 binding, resulting in increased GalNT7 activity, which in turn lead to increased nephronectin glycosylation and product secretion, thereby resulting in a higher rate of osteoblast differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2035657815,"The mammalian cochlea is innervated by two classes of sensory neurons. Type I neurons make up 90-95% of the cochlear nerve and contact single inner hair cells to provide acoustic analysis as we know it. In contrast, the far less numerous type II neurons arborize extensively among outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells. Their scarcity and smaller calibre axons have made them the subject of much speculation, but little experimental progress for the past 50 years. Here we record from type II fibres near their terminal arbors under OHCs to show that they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input. The type II peripheral arbor conducts action potentials, but the small and infrequent glutamatergic excitation indicates a requirement for strong acoustic stimulation. Furthermore, we show that type II neurons are excited by ATP. Exogenous ATP depolarized type II neurons, both directly and by evoking glutamatergic synaptic input. These results prove that type II neurons function as cochlear afferents, and can be modulated by ATP. The lesser magnitude of synaptic drive dictates a fundamentally different role in auditory signalling from that of type I afferents."
https://openalex.org/W1999595265,"Under anaerobic conditions, several species of green algae perform a light-dependent hydrogen production catalyzed by a special group of [FeFe] hydrogenases termed HydA. Although highly interesting for biotechnological applications, the direct connection between photosynthetic electron transport and hydrogenase activity is still a matter of speculation. By establishing an in vitro reconstitution system, we demonstrate that the photosynthetic ferredoxin (PetF) is essential for efficient electron transfer between photosystem I and HydA1. To investigate the electrostatic interaction process and electron transfer between PetF and HydA1, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic analyses with several site-directed mutagenesis variants of HydA1 and PetF enabled us to localize the respective contact sites. These experiments in combination with in silico docking analyses indicate that electrostatic interactions between the conserved HydA1 residue Lys(396) and the C terminus of PetF as well as between the PetF residue Glu(122) and the N-terminal amino group of HydA1 play a major role in complex formation and electron transfer. Mapping of relevant HydA1 and PetF residues constitutes an important basis for manipulating the physiological photosynthetic electron flow in favor of light-driven H(2) production."
https://openalex.org/W2075646920,"Background Political elections are dominance competitions. When men win a dominance competition, their testosterone levels rise or remain stable to resist a circadian decline; and when they lose, their testosterone levels fall. However, it is unknown whether this pattern of testosterone change extends beyond interpersonal competitions to the vicarious experience of winning or losing in the context of political elections. Women's testosterone responses to dominance competition outcomes are understudied, and to date, a clear pattern of testosterone changes in response to winning and losing dominance competitions has not emerged. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study investigated voters' testosterone responses to the outcome of the 2008 United States Presidential election. 183 participants provided multiple saliva samples before and after the winner was announced on Election Night. The results show that male Barack Obama voters (winners) had stable post-outcome testosterone levels, whereas testosterone levels dropped in male John McCain and Robert Barr voters (losers). There were no significant effects in female voters. Conclusions/Significance The findings indicate that male voters exhibit biological responses to the realignment of a country's dominance hierarchy as if they participated in an interpersonal dominance contest."
https://openalex.org/W2151545731,"Background Carboxysomes are polyhedral protein microcompartments found in many autotrophic bacteria; they encapsulate the CO2 fixing enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) within a thin protein shell and provide an environment that enhances the catalytic capabilities of the enzyme. Two types of shell protein constituents are common to carboxysomes and related microcompartments of heterotrophic bacteria, and the genes for these proteins are found in a large variety of bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings We have created a Halothiobacillus neapolitanus knockout mutant that does not produce the two paralogous CsoS4 proteins thought to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral carboxysomes and related microcompartments. Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses indicated that the mutant predominantly forms carboxysomes of normal appearance, in addition to some elongated microcompartments. Despite their normal shape, purified mutant carboxysomes are functionally impaired, although the activities of the encapsulated enzymes are not negatively affected. Conclusions/Significance In the absence of the CsoS4 proteins the carboxysome shell loses its limited permeability to CO2 and is no longer able to provide the catalytic advantage RubisCO derives from microcompartmentalization. This study presents direct evidence that the diffusion barrier property of the carboxysome shell contributes significantly to the biological function of the carboxysome."
https://openalex.org/W2021472201,"In the past few years, adult renal progenitor/stem cells (ARPCs) have been identified in human kidneys, and particularly in Bowman's capsule and proximal tubules. They may play an important role in the kidney regenerative processes and might prospectively be the ideal cell type for the treatment of both acute and chronic renal injury. In this study, microarray analysis identified 6 gene clusters that discriminated normal human glomerular and tubular ARPCs from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. The top-scored pathway in the ARPC gene expression profile contained growth factor receptors and immune system-related genes, including tolllike receptor 2 (TLR2). Stimulation of TLR2 by ligands that mime inflammatory mediators or damage associated molecular pattern molecules induced secretion of elevated amounts of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, IL-8, and C3 via NF-κB activation. TLR2 stimulation also increased the ARPC proliferation rate, suggesting a role for TLR2 in ARPC activation via autocrine signaling. Moreover, TLR2 stimulation improved ARPC differentiation into renal epithelial cells and was responsible of ARPC branching morphogenesis and tubule-like structures formation. For the first time, this study provides a genomic characterization of renal multipotent progenitor cells and shows that TLR2 found on ARPCs might be responsible for their activation in the kidney, orchestrating the activation of crucial signaling networks necessary for renal repair.—Sallustio, F., De Benedictis, L., Castellano, G., Zaza, G., Loverre, A., Costantino, V., Grandaliano, G., Schena, F.

https://openalex.org/W2009596922,"We report characterization and the crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 CYP125, a P450 implicated in metabolism of host cholesterol and essential for establishing infection in mice. CYP125 is purified in a high spin form and undergoes both type I and II spectral shifts with various azole drugs. The 1.4-Å structure of ligand-free CYP125 reveals a “letterbox” active site cavity of dimensions appropriate for entry of a polycyclic sterol. A mixture of hexa-coordinate and penta-coordinate states could be discerned, with water binding as the 6th heme-ligand linked to conformation of the I-helix Val267 residue. Structures in complex with androstenedione and the antitubercular drug econazole reveal that binding of hydrophobic ligands occurs within the active site cavity. Due to the funnel shape of the active site near the heme, neither approaches the heme iron. A model of the cholesterol CYP125 complex shows that the alkyl side chain extends toward the heme iron, predicting hydroxylation of cholesterol C27. The alkyl chain is in close contact to Val267, suggesting a substrate binding-induced low- to high-spin transition coupled to reorientation of the latter residue. Reconstitution of CYP125 activity with a redox partner system revealed exclusively cholesterol 27-hydroxylation, consistent with structure and modeling. This activity may enable catabolism of host cholesterol or generation of immunomodulatory compounds that enable persistence in the host. This study reveals structural and catalytic properties of a potential M. tuberculosis drug target enzyme, and the likely mode by which the host-derived substrate is bound and hydroxylated. We report characterization and the crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 CYP125, a P450 implicated in metabolism of host cholesterol and essential for establishing infection in mice. CYP125 is purified in a high spin form and undergoes both type I and II spectral shifts with various azole drugs. The 1.4-Å structure of ligand-free CYP125 reveals a “letterbox” active site cavity of dimensions appropriate for entry of a polycyclic sterol. A mixture of hexa-coordinate and penta-coordinate states could be discerned, with water binding as the 6th heme-ligand linked to conformation of the I-helix Val267 residue. Structures in complex with androstenedione and the antitubercular drug econazole reveal that binding of hydrophobic ligands occurs within the active site cavity. Due to the funnel shape of the active site near the heme, neither approaches the heme iron. A model of the cholesterol CYP125 complex shows that the alkyl side chain extends toward the heme iron, predicting hydroxylation of cholesterol C27. The alkyl chain is in close contact to Val267, suggesting a substrate binding-induced low- to high-spin transition coupled to reorientation of the latter residue. Reconstitution of CYP125 activity with a redox partner system revealed exclusively cholesterol 27-hydroxylation, consistent with structure and modeling. This activity may enable catabolism of host cholesterol or generation of immunomodulatory compounds that enable persistence in the host. This study reveals structural and catalytic properties of a potential M. tuberculosis drug target enzyme, and the likely mode by which the host-derived substrate is bound and hydroxylated."
https://openalex.org/W2024684733,"Major biological and cultural innovations in late Pliocene hominin evolution are frequently linked to the spread or fluctuating presence of C(4) grass in African ecosystems. Whereas the deep sea record of global climatic change provides indirect evidence for an increase in C(4) vegetation with a shift towards a cooler, drier and more variable global climatic regime beginning approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), evidence for grassland-dominated ecosystems in continental Africa and hominin activities within such ecosystems have been lacking.We report stable isotopic analyses of pedogenic carbonates and ungulate enamel, as well as faunal data from approximately 2.0 Ma archeological occurrences at Kanjera South, Kenya. These document repeated hominin activities within a grassland-dominated ecosystem.These data demonstrate what hitherto had been speculated based on indirect evidence: that grassland-dominated ecosystems did in fact exist during the Plio-Pleistocene, and that early Homo was active in open settings. Comparison with other Oldowan occurrences indicates that by 2.0 Ma hominins, almost certainly of the genus Homo, used a broad spectrum of habitats in East Africa, from open grassland to riparian forest. This strongly contrasts with the habitat usage of Australopithecus, and may signal an important shift in hominin landscape usage."
https://openalex.org/W2060653943,"Nitric oxide exerts a plethora of biological effects via protein S-nitrosylation, a redox-based reaction that converts a protein Cys thiol to a S-nitrosothiol. However, although the regulation of protein S-nitrosylation has been the subject of extensive study, much less is known about the systems governing protein denitrosylation. Most recently, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductases were shown to mediate both basal and stimulus-coupled protein denitrosylation. We now demonstrate that protein denitrosylation by thioredoxin is regulated dynamically by thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), a thioredoxin inhibitor. Endogenously synthesized nitric oxide represses Txnip, thereby facilitating thioredoxin-mediated denitrosylation. Autoregulation of denitrosylation thus allows cells to survive nitrosative stress. Our findings reveal that denitrosylation of proteins is dynamically regulated, establish a physiological role for thioredoxin in protection from nitrosative stress, and suggest new approaches to manipulate cellular S-nitrosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2162693101,"It is commonly assumed that, with time, an initially labile memory is transformed into a permanent one via a process of consolidation. Yet, recent evidence indicates that memories can return to a fragile state again when reactivated, requiring a period of reconsolidation. In the study described here, we found that participants who memorized a story immediately after they had recalled neutral and emotional experiences from their past were impaired in their memory for the neutral (but not for the emotional) experiences one week later. The effect of learning the story depended critically on the preceding reactivation of the autobiographical memories since learning without reactivation had no effect. These results suggest that new learning impedes the reconsolidation of neutral autobiographical memories."
https://openalex.org/W2008669845,"The effects of altering N-cadherin N-glycosylation on several cadherin-mediated cellular behaviors were investigated using small interfering RNA and site-directed mutagenesis. In HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, small interfering RNA-directed knockdown of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), a glycosyltransferase up-regulated by oncogene signaling, caused decreased expression of N-linked beta(1,6)-branched glycans expressed on N-cadherin, resulting in enhanced N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, but had no effect on N-cadherin expression on the cell surface. This effect on adhesion was accompanied by decreased cell migration and invasion, opposite of the effects observed when GnT-V was overexpressed in these cells (Guo, H. B., Lee, I., Kamar, M., and Pierce, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 52412-52424). A detailed study using site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that three of the eight putative N-glycosylation sites in the N-cadherin sequence showed N-glycan expression. Moreover, all three of these sites, located in the extracellular domains EC2 and EC3, were shown by leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin binding to express at least some beta(1,6)-branched glycans, products of GnT-V activity. Deletion of these sites had no effect on cadherin levels on the cell surface but led to increased stabilization of cell-cell contacts, cell-cell adhesion- mediated intracellular signaling, and reduced cell migration. We show for the first time that these deletions had little effect on formation of the N-cadherin-catenin complex but instead resulted in increased N-cadherin cis-dimerization. Branched N-glycan expression at three sites in the EC2 and -3 domains regulates N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact formation, outside-in signaling, and cell migration and is probably a significant contributor to the increase in the migratory/invasive phenotype of cancer cells that results when GnT-V activity is up-regulated by oncogene signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2110201939,"More than 41,000 spider species are known with about 400-500 added each year, but for some well-known groups, such as the giant golden orbweavers, Nephila, the last valid described species dates from the 19(th) century. Nephila are renowned for being the largest web-spinning spiders, making the largest orb webs, and are model organisms for the study of extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and sexual biology. Here, we report on the discovery of a new, giant Nephila species from Africa and Madagascar, and review size evolution and SSD in Nephilidae.We formally describe N. komaci sp. nov., the largest web spinning species known, and place the species in phylogenetic context to reconstruct the evolution of mean size (via squared change parsimony). We then test female and male mean size correlation using phylogenetically independent contrasts, and simulate nephilid body size evolution using Monte Carlo statistics.Nephila females increased in size almost monotonically to establish a mostly African clade of true giants. In contrast, Nephila male size is effectively decoupled and hovers around values roughly one fifth of female size. Although N. komaci females are the largest Nephila yet discovered, the males are also large and thus their SSD is not exceptional."
https://openalex.org/W2092109921,"Akt is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. Akt is differentially activated by growth factors and oxidative stress by sequential phosphorylation of Ser(473) by mTORC2 and Thr(308) by PDK1. On these bases, we investigated the mechanistic connection of H(2)O(2) yield, mitochondrial activation of Akt1 and cell cycle progression in NIH/3T3 cell line with confocal microscopy, in vivo imaging, and directed mutagenesis. We demonstrate that modulation by H(2)O(2) entails the entrance of cytosolic P-Akt1 Ser(473) to mitochondria, where it is further phosphorylated at Thr(308) by constitutive PDK1. Phosphorylation of Thr(308) in mitochondria determines Akt1 passage to nuclei and triggers genomic post-translational mechanisms for cell proliferation. At high H(2)O(2), Akt1-PDK1 association is disrupted and P-Akt1 Ser(473) accumulates in mitochondria in detriment to nuclear translocation; accordingly, Akt1 T308A is retained in mitochondria. Low Akt1 activity increases cytochrome c release to cytosol leading to apoptosis. As assessed by mass spectra, differential H(2)O(2) effects on Akt1-PDK interaction depend on the selective oxidation of Cys(310) to sulfenic or cysteic acids. These results indicate that Akt1 intramitochondrial-cycling is central for redox modulation of cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2018733138,"The Chlorella virus enzyme vAL-1 (38 kDa), a member of polysaccharide lyase family 14, degrades the Chlorella cell wall by cleaving the glycoside bond of the glucuronate residue (GlcA) through a β-elimination reaction. The enzyme consists of an N-terminal cell wall-attaching domain (11 kDa) and a C-terminal catalytic module (27 kDa). Here, we show the enzyme characteristics of vAL-1, especially its pH-dependent modes of action, and determine the structure of the catalytic module. vAL-1 also exhibited alginate lyase activity at alkaline pH, and truncation of the N-terminal domain increased the lyase activity by 50-fold at pH 7.0. The truncated form vAL-1(S) released di- to hexasaccharides from alginate at pH 7.0, whereas disaccharides were preferentially generated at pH 10.0. This indicates that vAL-1(S) shows two pH-dependent modes of action: endo- and exotypes. The x-ray crystal structure of vAL-1(S) at 1.2 Å resolution showed two antiparallel β-sheets with a deep cleft showing a β-jelly roll fold. The structure of GlcA-bound vAL-1(S) at pH 7.0 and 10.0 was determined: GlcA was found to be bound outside and inside the cleft at pH 7.0 and 10.0, respectively. This suggests that the electric charges at the active site greatly influence the binding mode of substrates and regulate endo/exo activity. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that vAL-1(S) has a specific amino acid arrangement distinct from other alginate lyases crucial for catalysis.

IntroductionChlorella viruses belong to a group of large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses and infect unicellular eukaryotic green algae of the genus Chlorella in a manner similar to bacteriophages. The infection cycle is as follows: (i) attachment of the virus to a host cell, (ii) digestion of the cell wall by viral enzymes, (iii) insertion of viral DNA into the host cell, and (iv) release of amplified viruses out of the host cell (1.Meints R.H.

https://openalex.org/W1966361788,"Prion diseases are considered to be transmissible. The existence of sporadic forms of prion diseases such as scrapie implies an environmental source for the infectious agent. This would suggest that under certain conditions the prion protein, the accepted agent of transmission, can survive in the environment. We have developed a novel technique to extract the prion protein from soil matrices. Previous studies have suggested that environmental manganese is a possible risk factor for prion diseases. We have shown that exposure to manganese is a soil matrix causes a dramatic increase in prion protein survival (approximately 10 fold) over a two year period. We have also shown that manganese increases infectivity of mouse passaged scrapie to culture cells by 2 logs. These results clearly verify that manganese is a risk factor for both the survival of the infectious agent in the environment and its transmissibility."

Lack of sequence homology to other families of protease inhibitors suggested that mycocypins inhibit their target cysteine protease by a unique mechanism and that a novel fold may be found. The crystal structures of the complex of clitocypin with the papain-like cysteine protease cathepsin V and of macrocypin and clitocypin alone have revealed yet another motif of binding to papain like-cysteine proteases, which in a yet unrevealed way occludes the catalytic residue. The binding is associated with a peptide-bond flip of glycine that occurs before or concurrently with the inhibitor docking. Mycocypins possess a beta-trefoil fold, the hallmark of Kunitz-type inhibitors. It is a tree-like structure with two loops in the root region, a stem comprising a six-stranded beta-barrel, and two layers of loops (6 + 3) in the crown region. The two loops that bind to cysteine cathepsins belong to the lower layer of the crown loops, whereas a single loop from the crown region can inhibit trypsin or asparaginyl endopeptidase, as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. These loops present a versatile surface with the potential to bind to additional classes of proteases. When appropriately engineered, they could provide the basis for possible exploitation in crop protection."
https://openalex.org/W2030399953,"The anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Although several studies have indicated the importance of Bcl-2 in maintaining skeletal integrity, the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Bcl-2(-/-) mice are growth-retarded and exhibit increased bone volume of the primary spongiosa, mainly due to the decreased number and dysfunction of osteoclasts. Osteoblast function is also impaired in Bcl-2(-/-) mice. Ex vivo studies on osteoblasts and osteoclasts showed that Bcl-2 promoted the differentiation, activation, and survival of both cell types. Because Bcl-2(-/-) mice die before 6 weeks of age due to renal failure and cannot be compared with adult wild type mice, we generated Bcl-2(-/-)Bim(+/-) mice, in which a single Bim allele was inactivated, and compared them with their Bcl-2(+/-)Bim(+/-) littermates. Loss of a single Bim allele restored normal osteoclast function in Bcl-2(-/-) mice but did not restore the impaired function of osteoblasts, and the mice exhibited osteopenia. These data demonstrate that Bcl-2 promotes the differentiation, activity, and survival of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The balance between Bcl-2 and Bim regulates osteoclast apoptosis and function, whereas other pro-apoptotic members are important for osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2113966797,"Recently, we discovered that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside are biosynthetic precursors of NAD(+), which are utilized through two pathways consisting of distinct enzymes. In addition, we have shown that exogenously supplied nicotinamide riboside is imported into yeast cells by a dedicated transporter, and it extends replicative lifespan on high glucose medium. Here, we show that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside are authentic intracellular metabolites in yeast. Secreted nicotinamide riboside was detected with a biological assay, and intracellular levels of nicotinamide riboside, nicotinic acid riboside, and other NAD(+) metabolites were determined by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. A biochemical genomic screen indicated that three yeast enzymes possess nicotinamide mononucleotide 5'-nucleotidase activity in vitro. Metabolic profiling of knock-out mutants established that Isn1 and Sdt1 are responsible for production of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside in cells. Isn1, initially classified as an IMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase, and Sdt1, initially classified as a pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, are additionally responsible for dephosphorylation of pyridine mononucleotides. Sdt1 overexpression is growth-inhibitory to cells in a manner that depends on its active site and correlates with reduced cellular NAD(+). Expression of Isn1 protein is positively regulated by the availability of nicotinic acid and glucose. These results reveal unanticipated and highly regulated steps in NAD(+) metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2066102297,"How migration evolved represents one of the most poignant questions in evolutionary biology. While studies on the evolution of migration in birds are well represented in the literature, migration in bats has received relatively little attention. Yet, more than 30 species of bats are known to migrate annually from breeding to non-breeding locations. Our study is the first to test hypotheses on the evolutionary history of migration in bats using a phylogenetic framework.In addition to providing a review of bat migration in relation to existing hypotheses on the evolution of migration in birds, we use a previously published supertree to formulate and test hypotheses on the evolutionary history of migration in bats. Our results suggest that migration in bats has evolved independently in several lineages potentially as the need arises to track resources (food, roosting site) but not through a series of steps from short- to long-distance migrants, as has been suggested for birds. Moreover, our analyses do not indicate that migration is an ancestral state but has relatively recently evolved in bats. Our results also show that migration is significantly less likely to evolve in cave roosting bats than in tree roosting species.This is the first study to provide evidence that migration has evolved independently in bat lineages that are not closely related. If migration evolved as a need to track seasonal resources or seek adequate roosting sites, climate change may have a pivotal impact on bat migratory habits. Our study provides a strong framework for future research on the evolution of migration in chiropterans."
https://openalex.org/W1975743085,"Background Hyperhomocysteinemia, characterized by increased plasma homocysteine level, is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. On the contrary, patients with Down syndrome appear to be protected from the development of atherosclerosis. We previously found a deleterious effect of hyperhomocysteinemia on expression of DYRK1A, a Down-syndrome-associated kinase. As increased expression of DYRK1A and low plasma homocysteine level have been associated with Down syndrome, we aimed to analyze the effect of its over-expression on homocysteine metabolism in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Effects of DYRK1A over-expression were examined by biochemical analysis of methionine metabolites, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme activities. We found that over-expression of Dyrk1a increased the hepatic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activities, concomitant with decreased level of plasma homocysteine in three mice models overexpressing Dyrk1a. Moreover, these effects were abolished by treatment with harmine, the most potent and specific inhibitor of Dyrk1a. The increased NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activities were also found in lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with Down syndrome. Conclusions/Significance Our results might give clues to understand the protective effect of Down syndrome against vascular defect through a decrease of homocysteine level by DYRK1A over-expression. They reveal a link between the Dyrk1a signaling pathway and the homocysteine cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1993772368,"Metabolic substrate utilization of the human failing heart is an area of controversy. The purpose of this study is to directly quantify myocardial substrate utilization in moderately severe heart failure, type 2 diabetes and healthy controls using simultaneous coronary sinus and arterial blood sampling. Patients with heart failure (n = 9, mean NYHA 2.7±0.5), with type 2 diabetes (n = 5) and with normal heart function (n = 10) were studied after an overnight fast in connection with electrophysiological investigations/treatments. A systemic infusion of [2H2]palmitate allowed for the calculation of absolute palmitate extraction across the heart. Blood samples were analysed for non-esterified fatty acids, triacylglycerol, glycerol, glucose, pyruvate, lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and blood gases after simultaneous sampling of arterial and coronary sinus blood. Arterio-coronary sinus metabolite concentration differences and fractional extractions for all substrates were similar between the groups. The absolute NEFA uptakes assessed by [2H2]palmitate extraction were also similar between the groups. Using direct measurements of metabolic substrate uptake by arterio-venous difference technique, the compensated human failing heart does not appear to have reduced myocardial fatty acid uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2168869363,"Post-translational modification of protein cysteine residues is emerging as an important regulatory and signaling mechanism. We have identified numerous putative targets of redox regulation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. One enzyme, isocitrate lyase (ICL), was identified both as a putative thioredoxin target and as an S-thiolated protein in vivo. ICL is a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle that allows growth on acetate as a sole source of carbon. The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of the redox regulation of Chlamydomonas ICL using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods. The results clearly show that purified C. reinhardtii ICL can be inactivated by glutathionylation and reactivated by glutaredoxin, whereas thioredoxin does not appear to regulate ICL activity, and no inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond could be formed under any of the conditions tested. Glutathionylation of the protein was investigated by mass spectrometry analysis, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme was found to be protected from irreversible oxidative inactivation by glutathionylation of its catalytic Cys178, whereas a second residue, Cys247, becomes artifactually glutathionylated after prolonged incubation with GSSG. The possible functional significance of this post-translational modification of ICL in Chlamydomonas and other organisms is discussed.

The possible functional significance of this post-translational modification of ICL in Chlamydomonas and other organisms is discussed. The importance of redox regulation and redox signaling linked to post-translational modifications of cysteine residues of proteins starts to be widely recognized. Indeed, cysteine residues can undergo different states of oxidation, such as sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acid, but also protein disulfide bridges (intra- or intermolecular), S-thiolation (mainly glutathionylation), or nitrosylation. These post-translational redox modifications are mainly under the control of two types of ubiquitous disulfide oxidoreductases: thioredoxins (TRXs) 2The abbreviations used are: TRXthioredoxinGRXglutaredoxinICLisocitrate lyaseCrICLC. reinhardtii ICLBioGSSGbiotinylated oxidized glutathioneWTwild typeDTTdithiothreitolDTTredreduced dithiothreitolIAMiodoacetamideMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightPTSperoxisomal targeting signal. and glutaredoxins (GRXs). thioredoxin glutaredoxin isocitrate lyase C. reinhardtii ICL biotinylated oxidized glutathione wild type dithiothreitol reduced dithiothreitol iodoacetamide matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight peroxisomal targeting signal. Oxido-reduction of intra- or interprotein disulfide bridges is probably the most extensively studied redox modification. It is mainly controlled by TRXs, which play a major role in redox signaling and oxidative stress responses. In photosynthetic organisms, different approaches led to the identification of ∼400 putative TRX targets implicated in nearly all cell processes (1.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Massot V. Keryer E.

Besides TRX-dependent regulation of the redox state of protein disulfide bonds, glutathionylation has recently emerged, among other thiol-based post-translational modifications, as an important redox-based signaling mechanism (3.Rouhier N.

This modification consists in the formation of a mixed disulfide between an accessible free thiol on a protein and a molecule of glutathione. In mammals, glutathionylation occurs under oxidative stress conditions and can protect specific cysteine residues from irreversible oxidation but can also modulate, either positively or negatively, the activity of numerous proteins. Although the precise mechanisms leading to glutathionylation in vivo is still unknown, the reverse reaction, named deglutathionylation, is catalyzed by GRX, proteins belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily (6.Zaffagnini M.

We have identified numerous putative targets of redox regulation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a convenient model organism for the study of basic biological processes, including photosynthesis and eukaryotic flagella and basal body functions (9.Merchant S.S.

Science. 2007; 318: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). A proteomic approach, based on the use of a monocysteinic TRX affinity columns, allowed the identification of 55 putative TRX targets in Chlamydomonas total extracts (10.Lemaire S.D. Guillon B.

More recently, we employed a strategy based on radiolabeling of the glutathione pool by [35S]cysteine to identify 25 proteins undergoing S-thiolation in vivo in Chlamydomonas cells (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One enzyme, isocitrate lyase (ICL), was identified both as a putative TRX target and as an S-thiolated protein in vivo. ICL (EC 4.1.3.1) catalyzes the first committed step of the glyoxylate cycle. The function of the glyoxylate cycle was first proposed by Kornberg and Krebs (12.Kornberg H.L. Krebs H.A. Nature. 1957; 179: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) to account for microbial growth on two-carbon compounds as a sole carbon source. In oil-rich seed plants, the glyoxylate cycle is used during seedling development to convert lipids to carbohydrates in the growing seedling (13.Graham I.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In this cycle, ICL cleaves a C–C bond of isocitrate to form glyoxylate and succinate, and malate synthase uses glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to form malate. These two enzymes, specific of the glyoxylate cycle, are widely distributed among microorganisms, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and algae (14.Schnarrenberger C. Martin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 868-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotic organisms, ICL is localized in glyoxysomes, a specialized form of peroxisome. ICL has been isolated and characterized from a variety of sources, and biochemical studies have shown that the enzymes from different species have similar catalytic properties and kinetic mechanisms (15.Vanni P. Giachetti E. Pinzauti G. McFadden B.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 95: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In C. reinhardtii, ICL allows growth on acetate as a sole carbon source, and its expression was shown to be regulated by light at the mRNA level (16.Petridou S. Foster K. Kindle K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The activity of C. reinhardtii ICL (CrICL) could be increased in total soluble extracts by TRX-mediated reduction, suggesting that the enzyme might contain cysteine residues involved in the formation of a regulatory disulfide (10.Lemaire S.D. Guillon B. Le Maréchal P. Keryer E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7475-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, purified recombinant ICL was shown to undergo glutathionylation in vitro in the presence of GSSG, which promoted formation of two glutathione adducts on the protein with a concomitant loss of enzyme activity (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that CrICL, and therefore the assimilation of acetate in Chlamydomonas, are redox-regulated. The existence of two redox active cysteines has also been suggested for Phycomyces blakasleeanus ICL (17.Rúa J. Soler J. Busto F. de Arriaga D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 35: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the case of CrICL, it is clear that the enzyme contains one or more redox-sensitive cysteines whose oxidation state could affect protein activity. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of this redox regulation of ICL as well as the role of thiol/disulfide interchange and/or glutathionylation in this regulation remain unclear. In this work, we analyzed the effects of different types of oxidizing molecules, such as GSSG, oxidized DTT, or H2O2, on Chlamydomonas ICL and determined the regulatory role of TRXs and GRXs. Moreover, we investigated the glutathionylation using activity assays, mass spectrometry analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and Western blotting. The results presented detail the molecular mechanism of redox regulation of Chlamydomonas ICL and clarify the type of redox post-translational modifications involved and their effect on the enzyme activity. NAP-5 columns and 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid were purchased from GE Healthcare and Pierce, respectively. GSH, GSSG, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Glu-C endoproteases were from Roche Applied Science. All of the other reagents were from Sigma. A water-soluble biotinylation reagent, EZ link sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, Perbio Science (Cramlington, UK)), was used to generate biotinylated oxidized glutathione (BioGSSG) by coupling biotin to the primary amino groups of glutathione disulfide (Sigma) under mild alkaline conditions. Specifically, the biotinylation reagent (50 μl, 48 mm) was added to GSSG (50 μl, 32 mm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and the mixture was left to derivatize for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, any remaining biotinylation reagent was quenched by adding 35 μl of 0.6 m ammonium carbonate buffer (NH4HCO3). Production and purification of recombinant cytosolic GRX1 and TRXh1 from C. reinhardtii and NADPH-thioredoxin reductase b from Arabidopsis thaliana were previously reported (6.Zaffagnini M.

Recombinant Chlamydomonas ICL was produced and purified as previously described (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol.

Protein expression was induced at 27 °C for 16 h by the addition of 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to exponentially growing cells. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using an Ni2+ HiTrap chelating resin (HIS-Select® nickel affinity gel, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass and purity of the protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining after dialysis against 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 64,540 m−1·cm−1. The resulting homogeneous protein was stored at −20 °C. The specific activity of purified ICL was 9.5 ± 0.2 μmol·min−1·mg−1, a value within the upper range reported for ICL from diverse sources (20.Chang A. Scheer M. Grote A. Schomburg I. Schomburg D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D588-D592Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A total of four cysteine residues in ICL, at positions 165, 178, 247, and 301, were altered by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using as a template the pET-3c-HIS/ICL vector previously obtained (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The couples of primers listed in supplemental Table 1 were used according to the procedures of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C165S/C247S double mutant of ICL was obtained by PCR using the primers for Cys247 mutagenesis and the plasmid containing the C165S mutation as template. The ICL triple mutant vector C165S/C247S/C301S was obtained by subcloning the NcoI/BamHI region of the C301S vector into the C165S/C247S plasmid. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for overexpression, and production and purification procedures were performed as described above for the wild type (WT) protein. ICL activity was assayed according to Michelet et al. (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm threo-dl-isocitrate, 4 mm phenylhydrazine, and enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. Isocitrate cleavage was measured by the change in absorbance at 324 nm associated with the formation of glyoxylate phenylhydrazone (molar extinction coefficient at 324 nm = 17,000 m−1·cm−1). Before each treatment, recombinant WT ICL and its variants were treated with 20 mm reduced dithiothreitol (DTTred) for 1 h at room temperature and desalted on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. Inactivation treatments were performed at room temperature by treating 10 μm recombinant protein with oxidized DTT (10 mm alone or in the presence of 10 μm TRXh1), GSSG (5 mm), H2O2 (1 or 0.1 mm), or 0.1 mm H2O2 in the presence of 0.5 mm GSH. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn in order to assay enzyme activity monitored as described above. The reversibility of the different treatments was assessed by incubating for 20 min the treated enzymes in the presence 20 mm DTTred at room temperature. To prepare inactive proteins, WT ICL and its variants were treated with 5 mm GSSG for 16 h at room temperature in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer. All reactivation treatments were performed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, at room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained ICL (10 μm) and DTTred (20 or 0.2 mm) or 5 mm GSH. ICL reactivation was also tested in the presence of TRXh1 (20 μm) supplemented with either 0.2 mm DTTred or 0.3 mm NADPH and 0.22 μm A. thaliana NADPH-thioredoxin reductase b. The reactivation of ICL was also determined in the presence of GRX1 (1 μm) supplemented with either 0.2 mm DTTred or 5 mm GSH with or without the addition of 0.2 mm NADPH and 6 μg/ml yeast glutathione reductase. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn in order to assay enzyme activity monitored as described above. The prereduced proteins were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) in the presence of 2 mm BioGSSG. After a 1-h incubation, BioGSSG-treated samples were alkylated in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetamide (IAM) or treated with 20 mm DTTred for 30 min to assess the reversibility of the reaction. Control samples were incubated with 100 mm IAM for 30 min in the dark prior to incubation in the presence of 2 mm BioGSSG. All treatments were performed at room temperature. Proteins were then loaded on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-biotin antibodies (1:5000 dilution; Sigma). Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (21.Durrant I. Nature. 1990; 346: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). ICL (50 μm) was reduced with 20 mm DTTred for 1 h at room temperature and desalted on NAP-5 columns equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. Reduced ICL was subsequently treated with 5 mm GSSG for 5 h at room temperature, followed by a dialysis against 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2. The number of free thiols in prereduced or GSSG-treated samples was determined spectrophotometrically under non-denaturing conditions with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (22.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21365) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–10 μm protein was added to a solution containing 200 μm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After 10 min at room temperature, the absorbance at 412 nm was determined. A molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m−1·cm−1 was used to calculate the number of titrated sulfhydryl groups. The effect of ICL glutathionylation on enzyme secondary structure was examined by CD. Measurements were carried out on a 202 AVIV Associates spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ) using a semimicro quartz rectangular 1 × 10 × 40-mm cuvette. ICL samples (10 μm in 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2) were maintained at 22 °C. Spectra were recorded while scanning in the far-UV region (190–260 nm), with bandwidth of 1.0 nm, step size of 1.0 nm, integration time of 30 s, and three repeats. The output of the CD spectrometer was converted into molar ellipticity units (degrees·cm2·dmol−1) based on the protein concentration, amino acid content, and cuvette thickness. For molecular mass determinations, WT ICL and its variants were reduced as described previously. Prereduced proteins were treated for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature with 5 mm GSSG. At the indicated times, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses were performed before and after treatment in the presence of 20 mm DTTred for 30 min at room temperature. For that purpose, 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1.5 μl of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1.5 μl of this premix was deposited onto the sample plate and allowed to dry under a gentle air stream at room temperature. Mass determination of ICL and its variants were carried out on whole proteins as described (23.Sicard-Roselli C. Lemaire S. Jacquot J.P. Favaudon V. Marchand C. Houée-Levin C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3481-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Determination of glutathionylated cysteines was performed after overnight proteolytic cleavage of ICL treated with 5 mm GSSG for 24 h and dialyzed. 10 μl of glutathionylated ICL were mixed for 20 min at 20 °C in the dark with 2 μl of 80 mm IAM and 2 μl of 500 mm ammonium bicarbonate. 13 mg of urea were also added, and incubation was prolonged for 20 min under the same conditions. Urea was partially removed by precipitation at 0 °C for 10 min. For acidic digestion, 3 μl of supernatant were mixed with 4.5 μl of 250 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) and 2 μl of Glu-C endoproteinase at a concentration of 100 ng/μl in double-distilled H2O. All volumes were adjusted to 12 μl with double-distilled H2O. For peptide mass fingerprints, 1 μl of digests, before and after 10 mm DTTred treatment at alkaline pH, was mixed with 9 μl of a half-saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. 1.5 μl of this final solution was deposited onto the sample plate and allowed to dry under a gentle air stream at room temperature. Mass spectra were acquired as described previously (24.Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Meyer Y. Decottignies P. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 6528-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All of the results reported are representative of at least three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that CrICL is more closely related to bacterial ICL than to higher plant ICL (supplemental Fig. 1). The sequence of Chlamydomonas ICL shares higher sequence identity with the E. coli enzyme (61%) than with its A. thaliana counterpart (31%). Two major groups can be distinguished in the ICL family, as previously observed (25.Serrano J.A. Bonete M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26.Watanabe S. Takada Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3393-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One corresponds to bacterial-type ICLs and includes the Chlamydomonas enzyme, whereas the second group corresponds to eukaryotic-type ICLs and contains sequences from organisms such as higher plants or yeast. Moreover, ICL sequences from this second group differ from those of Chlamydomonas and bacteria by an insertion of ∼100 amino acids. Higher plants ICLs are localized to peroxisomes and harbor a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS). CrICL does not present any obvious PTS1 or PTS2 sequence and is therefore considered to be localized in the cytosol (16.Petridou S. Foster K. Kindle K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ICL does not contain any PTS, and the protein was demonstrated, by fractionation and GFP fusion, to be only located in the cytoplasm and not associated with organelles, even under growth conditions that induce peroxisome proliferation (27.Taylor K.M. Kaplan C.P. Gao X. Baker A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Chaves R.S. Herrero P. Ordiz I. Angeles del Brio M. Moreno F. Gene. 1997; 198: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CrICL contains four cysteines, two of which (Cys165 and Cys247) are unique to Chlamydomonas (supplemental Fig. 1A). Cys301 is only conserved in bacterial-type ICLs, whereas Cys178 is conserved in all organisms, consistent with its role in catalysis (29.Robertson A.G. Nimmo H.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30.Rehman A. McFadden B.A. Curr. Microbiol. 1997; 35: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) Because two cysteine residues of ICL have been previously suggested to be sensitive to redox modifications (10.Lemaire S.D. Guillon B. Le Maréchal P. Keryer E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7475-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M.

Soler J. Busto F. de Arriaga D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 35: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), based on sequence conservation, Cys178 and Cys301 appear as the most likely candidates. Three-dimensional modeling of CrICL suggests that these two residues are the two closest cysteines in the enzyme but are too distant to allow formation of a disulfide bridge (Fig. 1). The analysis of available ICL structures also suggests that the distance between cysteines of different monomers is not compatible with the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. In addition, two strictly conserved histidine residues, His167 and His180, which have been shown to be important for the activity of the E. coli enzyme (31.Diehl P. McFadden B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are located in proximity of Cys165 and Cys178 and could enhance the reactivity of these cysteines. We have previously identified CrICL among putative TRX targets retained on a monocysteinic TRX affinity column, and reduced TRX was found to increase ICL activity in total extracts (10.Lemaire S.D. Guillon B. Le Maréchal P. Keryer E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7475-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggested the existence of a TRX-reducible disulfide bond in CrICL whose reduction would increase ICL activity. In order to investigate the formation of a disulfide bond in recombinant Chlamydomonas ICL, the enzyme was prereduced with 20 mm DTTred in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), desalted in the same buffer using an NAP-5 column, and subsequently treated with different oxidizing molecules. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE revealed that no intermolecular disulfide bond could be formed after oxidant treatment (data not shown). When the reduced protein was incubated for 30 min in the presence of 20 mm oxidized DTT alone or in the presence of cytosolic TRXh1, no inhibition of ICL activity was observed compared with untreated samples (data not shown). These results suggest that no disulfide bond can be formed in the presence of oxidized DTT alone or supplemented with TRXh1. We have previously observed that a prolonged incubation of ICL for 24 h in the presence of 5 mm GSSG resulted in a complete inactivation of the enzyme, which could be reverted by DTTred (11.Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Vanacker H. Le Maréchal P. Marchand C. Schroda M. Lemaire S.D. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we have explored the kinetics of GSSG inactivation of ICL. CrICL was incubated in the presence of 5 mm GSSG for 30 min, and protein activity was assayed before and after DTTred treatment as described above for other oxidizing molecules. As shown in Fig. 2, ICL activity was inhibited to 50% and fully reverted by DTTred. In order to better understand the kinetics of inactivation, CrICL was incubated with 5 mm GSSG, and the activity was followed for 2 h (Fig. 3). In these conditions, a loss of catalytic activity was observed, and after 1 h of incubation, CrICL retained 20% of its initial activity, decreasing further to 10% after 2 h.FIGURE 3Kinetics of inactivation of CrICL by GSSG. Prereduced CrICL (10 μm) was incubated in the presence (closed circles) or absence (open squares) of 5 mm GSSG. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times to assay enzyme activity.

The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in mammalian memory formation. Methodology / Principal Finding Based on the identification of genes markedly up-regulated during BDNF-induced synaptic consolidation in the hippocampus, we selected genetic variants that were tested in three independent samples, from Norway and Scotland, of adult individuals examined for cognitive abilities. In all samples, we show that markers in the doublecortin- and calmodulin kinase like 1 (DCLK1) gene, are significantly associated with general cognition (IQ scores) and verbal memory function, resisting multiple testing. DCLK1 is a complex gene with multiple transcripts which vary in expression and function. We show that the short variants are all up-regulated after BDNF treatment in the rat hippocampus, and that they are expressed in the adult human brain (mostly in cortices and hippocampus). We demonstrate that several of the associated variants are located in potential alternative promoter- and cis-regulatory elements of the gene and that they affect BDNF-mediated expression of short DCLK1 transcripts in a reporter system. Conclusion These data present DCLK1 as a functionally pertinent gene involved in human memory and cognitive functions."

Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) retain the anabolic properties of androgens in bone and muscle while having reduced effects in other tissues. We describe two structurally similar 4-aza-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) ligands, Cl-4AS-1, a full agonist, and TFM-4AS-1, which is a SARM. TFM-4AS-1 is a potent AR ligand (IC50, 38 nm) that partially activates an AR-dependent MMTV promoter (55% of maximal response) while antagonizing the N-terminal/C-terminal interaction within AR that is required for full receptor activation. Microarray analyses of MDA-MB-453 cells show that whereas Cl-4AS-1 behaves like 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), TFM-4AS-1 acts as a gene-selective agonist, inducing some genes as effectively as DHT and others to a lesser extent or not at all. This gene-selective agonism manifests as tissue-selectivity: in ovariectomized rats, Cl-4AS-1 mimics DHT while TFM-4AS-1 promotes the accrual of bone and muscle mass while having reduced effects on reproductive organs and sebaceous glands. Moreover, TFM-4AS-1 does not promote prostate growth and antagonizes DHT in seminal vesicles. To confirm that the biochemical properties of TFM-4AS-1 confer tissue selectivity, we identified a structurally unrelated compound, FTBU-1, with partial agonist activity coupled with antagonism of the N-terminal/C-terminal interaction and found that it also behaves as a SARM.

https://openalex.org/W2124432401,"Background To control and manipulate cellular signaling, we need to understand cellular strategies for information transfer, integration, and decision-making. A key feature of signal transduction is the generation of only a few intracellular messengers by many extracellular stimuli. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we model molecular cross-talk between two classic second messengers, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium, and show that the dynamical complexity of the response of both messengers increases substantially through their interaction. In our model of a non-excitable cell, both cAMP and calcium concentrations can oscillate. If mutually inhibitory, cross-talk between the two second messengers can increase the range of agonist concentrations for which oscillations occur. If mutually activating, cross-talk decreases the oscillation range, but can generate ‘bursting’ oscillations of calcium and may enable better filtering of noise. Conclusion We postulate that this increased dynamical complexity allows the cell to encode more information, particularly if both second messengers encode signals. In their native environments, it is unlikely that cells are exposed to one stimulus at a time, and cross-talk may help generate sufficiently complex responses to allow the cell to discriminate between different combinations and concentrations of extracellular agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2052175235,"Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulation at infection sites are critical events of host defense. The involvement of leukotriene (LT) B4 and platelet-activating factor (PAF) in TLR ligand-induced activation of inflammatory cell functions is essentially unknown. Using an in vitro model of human PMN migration through human endothelial cell monolayers’ we demonstrate that prototypic ligands of TLR1/2, 2/6, 3, 4, 5, and 7/8 promote PMN migration, an effect markedly inhibited by 3 LTB4 receptor antagonists (70–80% inhibition at 100 nM compared to vehicle-treated cells), 3 PAF receptor antagonists (20–50% inhibition at 10 nM), 3 LT biosynthesis inhibitors (75–85% inhibition at 100 nM), and 1 cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) inhibitor (90% inhibition at 1 μM). Accordingly, selected TLR ligands caused Ser505-phosphorylation of cPLA2α and measurable LTB4 and PAF biosynthesis in the transmigration assay. As negative controls, interleukin-8- and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-elicited migration in vitro was not inhibited either by an LTB4 receptor antagonist or by the cPLA2α inhibitor. Finally, LTB4 and PAF receptor antagonists inhibited (up to ~65% at optimal doses) TLR ligand-induced PMN infiltration in the mouse air-pouch model. These studies unravel the critical involvement of de novo LTB4 and PAF biosynthesis in PMN migration elicited by TLR ligands.—Lefebvre, J.

https://openalex.org/W2095180064,"Pharmacological intervention of redox balance in cancer cells often results in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, attracting much attention for the development of a new generation of targeted therapy in cancer. However, little is known about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream activities leading cells to death.We here report a systematic detection of transcriptome changes in response to oxidative signals generated in leukemia cells upon fenretinide treatment, implicating the occurrence of numerous stress-responsive events during the fenretinide induced apoptosis, such as redox response, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, translational repression and proteasome activation. Moreover, the configuration of these relevant events is primarily orchestrated by stress responsive transcription factors, as typically highlighted by NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Several lines of evidence suggest that the coordinated regulation of these transcription factors and thus their downstream genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress-responsive events regulating pro-apoptotic and apoptotic activities at the temporal and spatial levels, typifying oxidative stress-mediated programmed death rather than survival in cancer cells.This study provides a roadmap for understanding oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, which may be further developed into more sophisticated therapeutic protocols, as implicated by synergistic induction of cell apoptosis using proteasome inhibitors with fenretinide."
https://openalex.org/W1985525843,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a novel nuclear receptor that participates in a hierarchical network of transcription factors regulating the development and physiology of such vital organs as the liver, pancreas, and kidney. Among the various transcriptional coregulators with which HNF4α interacts, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) represents a novel coactivator whose activation is unusually robust and whose binding mode appears to be distinct from that of canonical coactivators such as NCoA/SRC/p160 family members. To elucidate the potentially unique molecular mechanism of PGC-1α recruitment, we have determined the crystal structure of HNF4α in complex with a fragment of PGC-1α containing all three of its LXXLL motifs. Despite the presence of all three LXXLL motifs available for interactions, only one is bound at the canonical binding site, with no additional contacts observed between the two proteins. However, a close inspection of the electron density map indicates that the bound LXXLL motif is not a selected one but an averaged structure of more than one LXXLL motif. Further biochemical and functional studies show that the individual LXXLL motifs can bind but drive only minimal transactivation. Only when more than one LXXLL motif is involved can significant transcriptional activity be measured, and full activation requires all three LXXLL motifs. These findings led us to propose a model wherein each LXXLL motif has an additive effect, and the multiple binding modes by HNF4α toward the LXXLL motifs of PGC-1α could account for the apparent robust activation by providing a flexible mechanism for combinatorial recruitment of additional coactivators and mediators.

Its full activity is achieved through the interactions of the HNF4α homodimer with DNA and various coactivators, including NCoA/SRC-1/p160 family members and others that, in turn, recruit the histone acetyltransferase activity containing general coactivators such as CBP/p300 and pCAF and mediators bringing the remainder of the basal transcriptional machinery (10.McKenna N.J.

Royer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 921-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PGC-1α activation of HNF4α is unusually robust, with both a tight physical interaction and several orders of magnitude greater increase in transcriptional activity than those mediated by other coactivators (18.Yoon J.C.

Thus, the NR-binding mode of PGC-1α is believed to be distinct from that of canonical coactivators such as SRC-1 (31.Bourdoncle A. Labesse G. Margueron R. Castet A. Cavaillès V. Royer C.A. J. Mol.

Here we present the crystal structure of the HNF4α-LBD bound to PGC-1α LXXLL motifs and the ensuing transcriptional and binding studies with the NR-box mutants, which showed that individual NR-boxes of PGC-1α can bind to the same binding pocket of HNF4α but drive very minimal transactivation. When more than one LXXLL motif is involved, significant transactivational activity can be measured, and all three NR-boxes are required for full activation, suggesting an additive effect by individual LXXLL motifs. These findings with HNF4α/PGC-1α interactions provide a new paradigm in NR/coactivator recognitions and should be relevant to the underlying mechanism for glucose homeostasis and diabetic pathophysiology. Comparisons between our new structure and the previous structures of the ERRα/PGC-1α LXXLL motif (40.Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M.

Because it has been suggested that the hinge region of HNF4α might also be needed for interaction with PGC-1α (43.Iordanidou P. Aggelidou E. Demetriades C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21810-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we used residues 120–368 of human recombinant HNF4α, containing the hinge region and the LBD, and residues 74–219 of human recombinant PGC-1α, containing all three LXXLL motifs (Fig. 1). DNA encoding the fragment of HNF4α with a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site was cloned into the pCDF Duet (Novagen) vector, whereas DNA encoding the fragment of PGC-1α with a GST tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site was cloned to pET41a (Novagen) vector. These vectors were cotransformed into Escherichia coli to generate the complex in vivo. Plasmids harboring HNF4α and PGC-1α were cotransformed into BL21 (DE3) under the selection of streptomycin and kanamycin. Both proteins were expressed, and the pure complex was obtained following sequential affinity chromatography on Talon beads (Clontech), tobacco etch virus protease digestion, ion exchange, and gel filtration. Dynamic light scattering data indicated a homogeneously populated complex favorable for crystallization. The pure complexes were dissolved in the optimal buffer (20 mm BisTris (pH 6.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) that maximizes the monodispersity of the samples (44.Jancarik J. Pufan R. Hong C. Kim S.H. Kim R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) for initial crystallization screening at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method. The initial crystals were grown with 10% 1-propanol, 10% PEGMME5K, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.6). The crystals were improved by the addition of 20 mm phenol, which yielded bigger crystals through decreased nucleation (Fig. 2A). The presence of both proteins in the crystals was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 2B). The crystals belong to the space group P4222 with the unit cell dimensions a = b = 113.049 Å, c = 57.322 Å.

There is one HNF4α-LBD-ligand-PGC-1α-NR-box fragment ternary complex (half of the functional dimeric complex) in the crystal asymmetric unit resulting in 40.5% solvent content. Oscillation images (every 0.5°) were collected at 100 K, and the data were processed using the HKL2000 software package (Table 1) (45.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Our previous structure of human HNF4α-LBD (Protein Data Bank accession code 1PZL) (47.Duda K. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

The best solution was obtained with a correlation coefficient of 50.3%, 17.0% above the second best solution. The Rcryst value after the molecular replacement was 0.51. After one round of rigid-body refinement by the CNS program (48.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), Rcryst and Rfree dropped to 0.43 and 0.44, respectively. Difference maps were calculated, and the electron densities corresponding to the PGC-1α fragment and the bound fatty acid were clearly visible (Fig. 2C). Model building was done with O (49.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the refinement continued by simulated annealing using CNS, with restraints placed on bond lengths, bond angles, nonbonded contacts, and temperature factors of neighboring atoms. Inclusion of individual atomic temperature factors and addition of solvent atoms during the later stages of refinement were accompanied by a substantial decrease in Rfree values. TLS (translation/libration/screw rotation) refinement was applied to the final models using Refmac5 (50.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) with rigid body assignments recommended by the TLSMD server (51.Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Structure validation tools such as MolProbity (52.Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar) and WHAT_CHECK (53.Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) were used to assess the quality of the structure; the final refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. The QuickChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the constructs with mutations in the LXXLL motifs (to LXXAA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid templates used in the mutagenesis protocol were pET41a GST-PGC-1α-(74–219) and pCMV Sport6 PGC-1α-(full-length). All constructs with the mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. HNF4α-(120–368) and human PPARγ-(187–477) GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli, although full-length wild-type and mutated 35S-labeled PGC-1α proteins were produced with a TnT reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription and translation kit (Promega). About 1 μg of fusion protein was mixed with 30 μl of the in vitro translate in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Binding was performed for 5 h at 4 °C, and the mixtures were loaded onto the beads containing glutathione. Immobilized GST protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using Coomassie Blue staining and probing with a GST-specific antibody (GE Healthcare). For PPARγ and PGC-1α binding in the supplemental material, 1 μm triglitazone was added as an agonist for PPARγ. The beads were then washed multiple times with the binding buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the 35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. HeLa cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). The luciferase constructs were prepared as described previously (54.Lu P. Rha G.B. Melikishvili M. Wu G. Adkins B.C. Fried M.G. Chi Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33685-33697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HNF4α-binding element (−64 to −52) from the human Hnf1α promoter (−298 to the first AGT) was subcloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basis (Promega) (pGL3-HNF1α). The full-length cDNA of human PGC-1α (wild-type or mutants) was subcloned into the pCMV Sport6 vector (Invitrogen). For transcription assays, HeLa cells were transfected using Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 20 ng of pcDNA3 HNF4α and PCMV Sport6 PGC-1α wild-type or mutants, 50 ng of pGL3-HNF1α, and 5 ng of pRL-TK (control Renilla luciferase vector) were used for transfection of 1 × 105 cells seeded on 24-well plate 1 day before transfection. Forty eight h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with luciferase lysis buffer supplied with the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) and LMax luminometer (Molecular Devices). All values were normalized by the relative ratio of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. At least three independent transfections were performed in quadruplicate. For PPARγ transfection in the supplemental material, a total of 25 ng of pcDNA3.1 PPARγ and 250 ng of pCMV Sport6 PGC-1α wild-type or mutants, 25 ng of pGL3 PPRE (AB)2, and 10 ng of pRL-TK (control Renilla luciferase vector) were used for transfection of 1 × 105 cells seeded on a 24-well plate 1 day before transfection. Five h after transfection, medium was removed, and 1 μm triglitazone was added. For statistical analysis, data were expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent groups. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls method using SigmaStat 3.1 software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). p < 0.01 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Protein/protein interactions were quantitatively measured by ITC using a high precision VP-ITC titration calorimeter (GE Healthcare). Both purified proteins were prepared in crystallization optimal buffer containing 20 mm BisTris (pH 6.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. These samples were degassed for 5 min and pre-cooled to 5 °C below the actual experimental temperature of 20 °C prior to sample loading. A defined amount (typically 1 ml) of HNF4α recombinant protein was titrated against 1:20 molar (or higher for weaker interactions) concentration of PGC-1α wild type or the mutant proteins in the thermostated cell by means of 25 individual injections via a syringe. No exogenous ligands were added for the experiments. The stoichiometry, thermodynamic parameters, and binding affinities were calculated by fitting the data using the software Origin 7.0 (MicroCal). The binding isotherm was fitted by a nonlinear least square regression using the One Set of Sites model. The binding Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was calculated from enthalpy changes (ΔH) and association constant (Ka) through the equation, ΔG = −RTln Ka, where R was the gas constant and T was the absolute temperature in Kelvin. Meanwhile, the stoichiometry (n) of the interaction was determined from the One Set of Sites model. The crystallization methods and structure determination are described under “Experimental Procedures”; typical crystals and the final refinement statistics are shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1, respectively. Even though our gel filtration analysis suggests that all three LXXLL motifs are needed for stable complex formation (supplemental Fig. S1), the crystal structure of HNF4α-LBD-PGC-1α complex structure shows only one LXXLL motif bound to the canonical binding pocket (Fig. 2, C and D). The overall structure is thus very similar to that of the HNF4α-LBD-SRC-1 peptide complex we reported previously (supplemental Fig. S2) (47.Duda K. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23311-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of three NR-boxes in PGC-1α protein used for crystallizat"
https://openalex.org/W2135735505,"The molecular mechanism of thrombin activation by Na+ remains elusive. Its kinetic formulation requires extension of the classical Botts-Morales theory for the action of a modifier on an enzyme to correctly account for the contribution of the E*, E, and E:Na+ forms. The extended scheme establishes that analysis of kcat unequivocally identifies allosteric transduction of Na+ binding into enhanced catalytic activity. The thrombin mutant N143P features no Na+-dependent enhancement of kcat yet binds Na+ with an affinity comparable to that of wild type. Crystal structures of the mutant in the presence and absence of Na+ confirm that Pro143 abrogates the important H-bond between the backbone N atom of residue 143 and the carbonyl O atom of Glu192, which in turn controls the orientation of the Glu192-Gly193 peptide bond and the correct architecture of the oxyanion hole. We conclude that Na+ activates thrombin by securing the correct orientation of the Glu192-Gly193 peptide bond, which is likely flipped in the absence of cation. Absolute conservation of the 143–192 H-bond in trypsin-like proteases and the importance of the oxyanion hole in protease function suggest that this mechanism of Na+ activation is present in all Na+-activated trypsin-like proteases.

IntroductionRegulation of activity through metal ion complexation plays a key role in many enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and over one-third of known proteins are metalloproteins (1.Ibers J.A. Holm R.H. Science. 1980; 209: 223-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Castagnetto J.M. Hennessy S.W. Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Pique M.E.

The earliest evidence for monovalent cation (M+) activation of enzymes was provided by Boyer (4.Boyer P.D. Lardy H.A. Phillips P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 146: 673-681Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with the discovery of the absolute requirement of K+ by pyruvate kinase (5.Kachmar J.F. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 669-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monod demonstrated Na+-dependent catalytic rate enhancement in β-galactosidase (6.Cohn M. Monod J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1951; 7: 153-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following these discoveries, many enzymes were observed to display increased activity in the presence of M+ (7.Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent classification of M+-activated enzymes groups them based on the selectivity of the effect, as established by kinetic studies, and the mechanism of activation, as shown from structural analysis (8.Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation can be established from crystal structures as cofactor-like or allosteric. In the former case, the M+ anchors the substrate to the active site of the enzyme, often acting in tandem with a divalent cation like Mg2+. In this mechanism of activation, called Type I, the M+ is absolutely required for catalysis. In the latter, called Type II, the M+ enhances enzyme activity through conformational transitions triggered upon binding to a site where the M+ makes no direct contact with substrate. In this case, that is most relevant to the clotting enzyme thrombin and related trypsin-like proteases (9.Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10.Page M.J. Di Cera E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the M+ acts as an allosteric effector and is not absolutely required for catalysis.Earlier kinetic studies on the hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates by Orthner and Kosow revealed that thrombin is optimally active in the presence of Na+ (11.Orthner C.L. Kosow D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 63-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect originally observed in factor Xa by the same group (12.Orthner C.L. Kosow D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 400-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in activated protein C by Steiner and Castellino (13.Steiner S.A. Amphlett G.W. Castellino F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14.Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J.

Curiously, the original observation on thrombin was at odds with the accepted view at the time that salts, and Na+ in particular, actually acted as inhibitors of thrombin hydrolysis of synthetic substrates (17.Curragh E.F. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1964; 93: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18.Workman E.F. Lundblad R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 544-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the inhibitory effect of Na+ was rationalized as a direct perturbation of the catalytic His57 that would reduce effectiveness of the charge relay system (18.Workman E.F. Lundblad R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 544-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wells and Di Cera demonstrated that the Na+ activation of thrombin is specific and allosteric and involves the transition of the enzyme between two active forms (19.Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leading to an increase in kcat and a decrease in Km. These forms are E (Na+-free) with low activity and E:Na+ (Na+-bound) with high activity, originally defined as the slow and fast forms (19.Wells C.M. Di Cera E.

Therefore, studies on the molecular mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin are key to understand the function and regulation of this and many other clotting enzymes.The role of two active species in equilibrium, E and E:Na+, can be cast mathematically in terms of the well known Botts-Morales scheme for the action of a “modifier” on enzyme function (64.Botts J. Morales M. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1953; 49: 696-707Crossref Google Scholar). In this scheme, binding of Na+ to thrombin is expected to produce a single kinetic phase reflecting the conversion of E into E:Na+. Recent findings, however, indicate that this is not the case. Na+ binding to thrombin and meizothrombin-desF1 gives rise to two kinetic phases, one fast (in the microsecond time scale) due to Na+ binding to E to produce E:Na+ (23.Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 65.Gianni S. Ivarsson Y. Bah A. Bush-Pelc L.A. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 131: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and another considerably slower (in the millisecond time scale) that reflects a pre-equilibrium between E and another form, E*, that is unable to bind Na+ or substrate to the active site (23.Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 66.Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The three forms of thrombin lead to the kinetic scheme (Scheme 1).Two Na+-free forms E* and E interconvert with kinetic rate constants kr and k−r, and E interacts with Na+ with a rate constant kA to populate E:Na+, that may dissociate into the parent components with a rate constant k−A. The presence of E* redefines the slow form (19.Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a mixture of two conformations in equilibrium, E* and E, which requires extension of the Botts-Morales scheme to ensure a rigorous treatment of the allosteric effect of Na+ on thrombin. In addition, more information is needed on the molecular events that translate Na+ binding into enhanced catalytic activity as reported by the values of kcat and kcat/Km. Site-directed mutagenesis may become advantageous if mutants defective for allosteric transduction of the Na+ effect can be identified and crystallized in the presence and absence of Na+. One such mutant is presented in this study and helps define a major structural transition linked to Na+ binding to thrombin.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe human thrombin mutant N143P was constructed, expressed, and purified to homogeneity as reported elsewhere (20.Prasad S.

H-d-Phe-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide (FPK), and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR) were determined from analysis of progress curves and corrected for product inhibition as detailed elsewhere (67.Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, in the presence of 200 mm NaCl or choline chloride (ChCl). Values of s = kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrates H-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FGR), FPF, FPK, and FPR, the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen, cleavage of the protease-activated receptors PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, and activation of protein C in the absence or presence of 100 nm thrombomodulin and 5 mm CaCl2 were determined as reported elsewhere (26.Dang Q.D.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) under physiological experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C.Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX20 spectrometer, with excitation at 280 nm and a cutoff filter at 305 nm (23.Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples of wild-type or N143P thrombin at a final concentration of 50 nm in 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 8.0, at 15 °C were mixed 1:1 with 60-μl solutions of the same buffer containing variable amounts of NaCl (up to 400 mm) kept at constant ionic strength of 400 mm with ChCl. The baseline was measured with 400 mm ChCl in the mixing syringe. Each trace was determined in quadruplicate. Na+ binding was also studied in the presence of saturating amounts (1 mm) of the active site inhibitor benzamidine to establish the contribution of the E*-E interconversion to the total fluorescence change detected in the absence of inhibitor. Under these conditions, Scheme 1 predicts that binding of benzamidine would shift the E*-E equilibrium in favor of E, so that binding of Na+ would only cause the transition of E to E:Na+. Accordingly, the total fluorescence change in the presence of benzamidine was ∼50% of that measured in the absence of inhibitor and was not due to an inner filter effect of benzamidine estimated at <5% after proper correction (69.Liu Y. Kati W. Chen C.M. Tripathi R. Molla A. Kohlbrenner W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the E*-E equilibrium was perturbed with saturating amounts of the active site inhibitor argatroban, featuring a negligible inner filter effect.Binding of the active site inhibitor argatroban was studied directly by isothermal titration calorimetry under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, 200 mm NaCl, or ChCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, using an iTC200 calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) with the sample cell containing thrombin and the syringe injecting argatroban (70.Gandhi P.S. Page M.J. Chen Z. Bush-Pelc L. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24098-24105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sample volume for iTC200 was 204.6 μl, and the total volume of injected ligand was 39.7 μl. The thermal equilibration step at 25 °C was followed by an initial 60-s delay step and subsequently an initial 0.2-μl injection. Typically, 19 serial injections of 2 μl and 1 last injection of 1.5 μl of ligand were performed at an interval of 180 s. The stirring speed was maintained at 1000 rpm, and the reference power was kept constant at 5 microcalories/s. The heat associated with each injection of ligand was integrated and plotted against the molar ratio of ligand to macromolecule. Thermodynamic parameters were extracted from a curve fit to the data using the software (Origin 7.0) provided by MicroCal according to a one-site binding model.Crystals of the thrombin mutant N143P were obtained at 22 °C using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method, with each reservoir containing 500 μl. Equal volumes (1 μl) of the protein sample and reservoir solution (see Table 1) were mixed to prepare the hanging drops. Diffraction quality crystals grew in 2 weeks and were cryoprotected in a solution similar to the reservoir solution but containing 15% (v/v) glycerol prior to flash freezing. X-ray diffraction data for the N143P mutant in the E:Na+ form were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline Biocars 14-BMC, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL), and those for the N143P mutant in the E* form were collected with a home source Mar345 detector (MarResearch, Germany). The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL2000 software package (71.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (36112) Google Scholar).

The presence of E* produces an extended scheme as given in Scheme 2.SCHEME 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The active forms E and E:Na+ feature different values of kinetic rate constants for binding (k1,0, k1,1) and dissociation (k−1,0, k−1,1) of substrate S, as well as rates of substrate conversion into product (k2,0, k2,1). The parameters KA = kA/k−A and KA′ = kA′/k−A′ are the equilibrium association constants for Na+ binding to E and ES, respectively. The ratio r = k−r/kr = [E*]/[E] is the equilibrium constant for the E*-E interconversion and removal of E* (r = 0) converts Scheme 2 into the well known Botts-Morales scheme. To derive the expressions for the independent parameters s = kcat/Km and kcat, Scheme 2 must be solved for the velocity of product formation at steady state, v, per unit active enzyme concentration, etot. The solution is known in the case of the Botts-Morales scheme (9.Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 64.Botts J. Morales M. Trans.

https://openalex.org/W2131399825,"Predicting protein function from primary sequence is an important open problem in modern biology. Not only are there many thousands of proteins of unknown function, current approaches for predicting function must be improved upon. One problem in particular is overly-specific function predictions which we address here with a new statistical model of the relationship between protein sequence similarity and protein function similarity.Our statistical model is based on sets of proteins with experimentally validated functions and numeric measures of function specificity and function similarity derived from the Gene Ontology. The model predicts the similarity of function between two proteins given their amino acid sequence similarity measured by statistics from the BLAST sequence alignment algorithm. A novel aspect of our model is that it predicts the degree of function similarity shared between two proteins over a continuous range of sequence similarity, facilitating prediction of function with an appropriate level of specificity.Our model shows nearly exact function similarity for proteins with high sequence similarity (bit score >244.7, e-value >1e(-62), non-redundant NCBI protein database (NRDB)) and only small likelihood of specific function match for proteins with low sequence similarity (bit score <54.6, e-value <1e(-05), NRDB). For sequence similarity ranges in between our annotation model shows an increasing relationship between function similarity and sequence similarity, but with considerable variability. We applied the model to a large set of proteins of unknown function, and predicted functions for thousands of these proteins ranging from general to very specific. We also applied the model to a data set of proteins with previously assigned, specific functions that were electronically based. We show that, on average, these prior function predictions are more specific (quite possibly overly-specific) compared to predictions from our model that is based on proteins with experimentally determined function."
https://openalex.org/W2103450029,"The question of how people recognize themselves and separate themselves from the environment and others has long intrigued philosophers and scientists. Recent findings have linked regions of the ‘default brain’ or ‘intrinsic system’ to self-related processing. We used a paradigm in which subjects had to rely on subtle sensory-motor synchronization differences to determine whether a viewed movement belonged to them or to another person, while stimuli and task demands associated with the “responded self” and “responded other” conditions were precisely matched. Self recognition was associated with enhanced brain activity in several ROIs of the intrinsic system, whereas no differences emerged within the extrinsic system. This self-related effect was found even in cases where the sensory-motor aspects were precisely matched. Control conditions ruled out task difficulty as the source of the differential self-related effects. The findings shed light on the neural systems underlying bodily self recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2098567431,"The group randomized trial (GRT) is a common study design to assess the effect of an intervention program aimed at health promotion or disease prevention. In GRTs, groups rather than individuals are randomized into intervention or control arms. Then, responses are measured on individuals within those groups. A number of analytical problems beset GRT designs. The major problem emerges from the likely positive intraclass correlation among observations of individuals within a group. This paper provides an overview of the analytical method for GRT data and applies this method to a randomized cancer prevention trial, where multiple binary primary endpoints were obtained. We develop an index of extra variability to investigate group-specific effects on response. The purpose of the index is to understand the influence of individual groups on evaluating the intervention effect, especially, when a GRT study involves a small number of groups. The multiple endpoints from the GRT design are analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model and the stepdown Bonferroni method of Holm."
https://openalex.org/W2014829133,"Transcription machinery from a variety of organisms shows striking mechanistic similarity. Both multi- and single subunit RNA polymerases have evolved an 8-10-base pair RNA-DNA hybrid as a part of a stably transcribing elongation complex. Through characterization of halted complexes that can readily carry out homopolymeric slippage synthesis, this study reveals that T7 RNA polymerase elongation complexes containing only a 4-base pair hybrid can nevertheless be more stable than those with the normal 8-base pair hybrid. We propose that a key feature of this stability is the topological threading of RNA through the complex and/or around the DNA template strand. The data are consistent with forward translocation as a mechanism to allow unthreading of the topological lock, as can occur during programmed termination of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1988313771,"It has been shown previously that sub-complexes of the 26 S proteasome can regulate gene expression via non-proteolytic mechanisms. One such mechanism is the disruption of activator.promoter complexes in an ATP-dependent fashion, which was discovered in the context of the yeast Gal4 system. This activity strongly inhibits Gal4-driven gene expression unless the activator is mono-ubiquitylated, which protects it from the ATPases. To address whether this paradigm is also applicable to medically important mammalian transcriptional activators we report here a study of the interaction of the proteasomal ATPases with p53. It is shown that p53 binds directly to the ATPases via its C-terminal tetramerization and regulatory domain and that p53.promoter complexes are indeed vulnerable to ATPase-dependent disruption by the ATPase complex in vitro. Knockdown of one of the ATPases, Rpt6, in living cells results in increased occupancy of the p21(waf1) promoter by p53 and increased expression of the gene, consistent with the idea that the proteasomal ATPases negatively regulate p53 function in a non-proteolytic fashion."
