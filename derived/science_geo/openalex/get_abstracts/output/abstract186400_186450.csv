https://openalex.org/W2023003113,"In an electric field, the flow of electrons in a solid produces an entropy current in addition to the familiar charge current. This is the Peltier effect, and it underlies all thermoelectric refrigerators. The increased interest in thermoelectric cooling applications has led to a search for more efficient Peltier materials and to renewed theoretical investigation into how electron-electron interaction may enhance the thermopower of materials such as the transition-metal oxides. An important factor in this enhancement is the electronic spin entropy, which is predicted to dominate the entropy current. However, the crucial evidence for the spin-entropy term, namely its complete suppression in a longitudinal magnetic field, has not been reported until now. Here we report evidence for such suppression in the layered oxide Na(x)Co2O4, from thermopower and magnetization measurements in both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. The strong dependence of thermopower on magnetic field provides a rare, unambiguous example of how strong electron-electron interaction effects can qualitatively alter electronic behaviour in a solid. We discuss the implications of our finding--that spin-entropy dominates the enhancement of thermopower in transition-metal oxides--for the search for better Peltier materials."

https://openalex.org/W2000932071,"Pancreatic cancer is resistant to almost all cytotoxic drugs. Currently, gemcitabine appears to be the only clinically active drug but, because of pre-existing or acquired chemoresistance of most of the tumor cells, it failed to significantly improve the outcome of pancreatic carcinoma patients. The current study examined the relevance of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and PI3K/Akt in the resistance of five pancreatic carcinoma cell lines towards gemcitabine. Treatment for 24 h with gemcitabine (0.04-20 micro M) led to a strong induction of apoptosis in PT45-P1 and T3M4 cells but not in BxPc-3, Capan-1 and PancTu-1 cells. These resistant cell lines exhibited a high basal NF-kappaB activity in contrast to the sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, gemcitabine showed a dose-dependent induction of NF-kappaB. At a dose of 0.04 micro M, gemcitabine still induced apoptosis in the sensitive cell lines, but did not induce NF-kappaB. In addition, NF-kappaB inhibition by MG132, sulfasalazine or the IkappaBalpha super-repressor strongly diminished the resistance against gemcitabine (0.04-20 micro M). In contrast to this obvious correlation between basal NF-kappaB activity and gemcitabine resistance, PI3K/Akt seems not to be involved in gemcitabine resistance of these cell lines. Neither did the basal Akt activity correlate with the sensitivity towards gemcitabine treatment, nor did the inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002 alter gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that constitutive NF-kappaB activity confers resistance against gemcitabine and that modulation of this activity by pharmacological or genetic approaches may have therapeutical potential when combined with gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1544875189,"Observations of the afterglows of γ-ray bursts (GRBs) have revealed that they lie at cosmological distances, and so correspond to the release of an enormous amount of energy1,2. The nature of the central engine that powers these events and the prompt γ-ray emission mechanism itself remain enigmatic because, once a relativistic fireball is created, the physics of the afterglow is insensitive to the nature of the progenitor. Here we report the discovery of linear polarization in the prompt γ-ray emission from GRB021206, which indicates that it is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a strong magnetic field. The polarization is at the theoretical maximum, which requires a uniform, large-scale magnetic field over the γ-ray emission region. A large-scale magnetic field constrains possible progenitors to those either having or producing organized fields. We suggest that the large magnetic energy densities in the progenitor environment (comparable to the kinetic energy densities of the fireball), combined with the large-scale structure of the field, indicate that magnetic fields drive the GRB explosion."
https://openalex.org/W2012032353,"The mechanism that causes high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials (cuprates) is still unknown, more than 15 years after it was discovered1. As the charge carriers (electrons or holes) are introduced into the parent antiferromagnetic insulator, a process called doping, the material evolves from an insulator to a superconductor, and eventually to a normal metal. This marked change of physical properties with doping2,3,4,5,6,7 indicates that doping dependence (non-universality) might be a general feature of these materials, but we find that, on the contrary, the low-energy Fermi velocity of electrons is in fact universal, even among different superconductor families."

https://openalex.org/W2021860877,"Postnatal cardiac myocytes respond to stress signals by hypertrophic growth and activation of a fetal gene program. Recently, we showed that class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppress cardiac hypertrophy, and mice lacking the class II HDAC, HDAC9, are sensitized to hypertrophic signals. To further define the roles of HDACs in cardiac hypertrophy, we analyzed the effects of HDAC inhibitors on the responsiveness of primary cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic agonists. Paradoxically, HDAC inhibitors imposed a dose-dependent blockade to hypertrophy and fetal gene activation. We conclude that distinct HDACs play positive or negative roles in the control of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. HDAC inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials as anti-cancer agents. Our results suggest that these inhibitors may also hold promising clinical value as therapeutics for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Postnatal cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophic growth in response to a variety of stress signals (reviewed in Ref. 1Frey N. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The hypertrophic response is characterized by increases in myocyte size and protein synthesis, assembly and organization of sarcomeres, and activation of a fetal gene program. Although traditionally considered an adaptive response to pathological signaling, chronic expression of fetal cardiac genes in the heart can result in maladaptive changes in cardiac contractility and calcium handling that culminate in dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and sudden death from arrhythmias (2Lowes B.D.

Moreover, increasing evidence in rodent models indicates that cardiac function is preserved when hypertrophy is inhibited in the face of stress signaling, pointing to the potential importance of therapeutic strategies for modulating the hypertrophic process (3Harding V.B.

Recent studies have revealed key roles for chromatin-modifying enzymes in the control of cardiac hypertrophy (10Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The structure of chromatin is governed by the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones (13Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7575) Google Scholar, 14Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone tails by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; ET-1, endothelin-1; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor-2; NaB, sodium butyrate; PE, phenylephrine; TSA, trichostatin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; ET-1, endothelin-1; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor-2; NaB, sodium butyrate; PE, phenylephrine; TSA, trichostatin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin. results in relaxation of nucleosomal structure and transcriptional activation. Acetylated histones also serve as targets for binding of bromo-domain proteins that possess HAT activity and act as transcriptional activators. The actions of HATs are opposed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), which deacetylate nucleosomal histones, thereby promoting chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Mammalian HDACs can be divided into three classes based on their similarity with three yeast HDACs (reviewed in Refs. 15Gray S. Ekstrom T. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar and 16Marmorstein R. Structure. 2001; 9: 1127-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) are expressed ubiquitously and consist mainly of a deacetylase domain. Members of class II (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9) are highly expressed in striated muscle and brain and have an extended N terminus in addition to the catalytic domain. Class III HDACs resemble the yeast HDAC Sir2, which is activated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (17Imai S.-I. Armstrong C. Daeberlain M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Class II HDACs interact with a variety of positive and negative cofactors as well as other HDACs through their N-terminal regions (reviewed in Ref. 18Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These regions also contain two conserved phosphorylation sites for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and other kinases that confer responsiveness to calcium signaling. Phosphorylation of these sites creates docking sites for 14-3-3 chaperone proteins, which escort the class II HDACs out of the nucleus, resulting in activation of genes that would otherwise be repressed by these HDACs (reviewed in Ref. 19McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). One of the important targets of HDACs in muscle cells is the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcription factor (reviewed in Ref. 20McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the adult heart, MEF2 proteins exhibit only basal activity, which is dramatically enhanced by calcium-dependent stress signals that induce hypertrophy (21Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The activation of MEF2 by hypertrophic signals can be explained, at least in part, by the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of class II HDACs and subsequent recruitment of HATs by MEF2. Several recent observations have implicated HDACs and HATs in the control of cardiac hypertrophy. First, expression of signal-resistant mutants of class II HDACs in primary cardiomyocytes silences the fetal gene program and renders myocytes insensitive to hypertrophic agonists (11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Overexpression of class II HDACs also blocks MEF2 activation by hypertrophic stimuli (10Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Second, knock-out mice lacking HDAC9 are supersensitive to stress signals and develop massively hypertrophic hearts when stressed (11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Third, the HAT p300 associates with the MEF2 and GATA4 transcription factors, which regulate fetal cardiac genes, and enhances their transcriptional activity (22Dai Y. Markham B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of p300 induces hypertrophy of primary cardiomyocytes (12Gusterson R. Jazrawi E. Adcock I. Latchman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Numerous pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have been identified including trichostatin A (TSA) (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sodium butyrate (NaB) (25Boffa L. Vidali G. Mann R. Allfrey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3364-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HC-toxin (26Brosch G. Ransom R. Lechner T. Walton J. Loidl P. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), subercyl-anilide hydroxamic acid (27Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 93: 5705-5708Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and pyroxamide (28Butler L.M. Webb Y. Agus D.B. Higgins B. Tolentino T.R. Kutko M.C. LaQuaglia M.P. Drobnjak M. Cardo-Cordon C. Scher H.I. Breslow R. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 962-970PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structure analyses of HDAC-TSA and HDAC-subercyl-anilide hydroxamic acid complexes reveal how these inhibitors interact specifically with the catalytic core and abolish HDAC enzymatic activity (29Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Inhibiting HDAC activity with these pharmacological agents alters gene expression; however, instead of simply activating gene transcription as would be expected to result from blocking the repressive activity of HDACs, these inhibitors result in increases as well as decreases in expression of specific genes (30Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 31Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 971-976PubMed Google Scholar). In several cell types, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to block growth and promote quiescence and differentiation (28Butler L.M. Webb Y. Agus D.B. Higgins B. Tolentino T.R. Kutko M.C. LaQuaglia M.P. Drobnjak M. Cardo-Cordon C. Scher H.I. Breslow R. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Clin.

HDAC inhibitors have also shown promise as anti-cancer agents, which may reflect their ability to selectively derepress expression of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21 (reviewed in Ref. 37Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 783-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of class II HDACs to suppress cardiac hypertrophy, we sought to determine whether HDAC inhibitors would mimic the effect of genetic deletion of HDAC9 (11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and thereby promote cardiac hypertrophy. Paradoxically, we found that treatment of cultured cardiac myocytes with HDAC inhibitors prevented hypertrophy, sarcomere organization, and activation of the fetal gene program normally evoked by hypertrophic agonists. Taken together with our prior findings, these results suggest that HDACs play dual roles as repressors and activators of cardiac hypertrophy. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Hearts were dissected from 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan), minced in PBS, and digested with pancreatin (0.1% w/v, Sigma) in PBS. Cells were resuspended in DMEM:M199 (4:1) containing horse serum (10%), fetal bovine serum (FBS) (5%), l-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin and pre-plated for 2 h to separate adherent fibroblasts from cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were plated in 6-well dishes (1 × 106 cells/well) containing laminin-coated glass coverslips. Following the indicated treatments, cells were fixed with formalin (10%) in PBS, permeabilized, and blocked with PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (0.1%) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (3%) and incubated in the same solution but with primary antibodies for sarcomeric α-actinin (mouse monoclonal, 1:200 dilution, Sigma) or atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200 dilution, Peninsula Laboratories). Coverslips were washed five times in PBS and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories) followed by a brief incubation with Hoechst dye 33342 (H-3570, Molecular Probes). Coverslips were washed five times in PBS, one time with water, and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Proteins were visualized with a fluorescence microscope, and images were captured using a digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). ANF and Ribosomal S6 Protein Cytoblot Assay—Cytoblot analyses were performed as described previously (38Stockwell B.R. Haggarty S.J. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 71-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with modifications. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence as described above with the exception that cells were centrifuged through a Percoll gradient prior to pre-plating to further enrich for myocytes. Myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated 96-well dishes (1 × 104 cells/well) in DMEM containing FBS (10%), l-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin. Following overnight culture, growth medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with Neutridoma-SP (which contains albumin, insulin, transferrin, and other defined organic and inorganic compounds) (0.1% v/v, Roche Applied Science) and the indicated agonists and inhibitors. After 48 h of treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) in PBS (30 min), permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) in PBS (10 min), and blocked with BSA (1%) in PBS (1 h). Cells were incubated with PBS containing BSA (1%), normal goat serum (1%), and primary antibodies against either ANF (mouse monoclonal, 10 μg/ml, Biodesign) or ribosomal S6 protein (rabbit polyclonal, 50 μg/ml, Cell Signaling Technologies) for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing BSA (1%) and incubated in the same solution but containing HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:1000 and 1:400, respectively, Jackson Laboratories). Cells were washed twice with PBS containing BSA (1%) and one time with PBS alone. Luminol (Pierce) was added to the cells, and luminescence was detected using a fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All of the manipulations were performed at room temperature. [3H]Leucine Incorporation and DNA Content—Cardiomyocytes were incubated with [3H]leucine (1.0 mCi/ml, 172 Ci/mmol Sp. Activity, ICN Biochemicals) in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). After a 6-h incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in trichloroacetic acid (10%; 30 min, on ice). Afterward, the cells were washed twice with trichloroacetic acid (5%), once more with water, and then lysed in NaOH (0.25 n). Lysates were measured in one-sixth volume of scintillation fluid by a scintillation counter (Beckman). For DNA content, cardiomyocytes were lysed in Tris buffer (10 nm; pH 8.0) containing EDTA (25 mm; pH 8.0), NaCl (100 mm), SDS (1%), and proteinase K (200 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science) overnight at 55 °C. DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and then resuspended in 100 μl of water. DNA content was subsequently measured at a 260-nm wavelength in a UV spectrophotometer (Beckman). α-Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) Cytoblot Assay—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated 96-well dishes (1 × 104 cells/well) in DMEM containing l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin-streptomycin, and charcoal-stripped FBS (10%), which lacks thyroid hormone, a known inducer of α-MHC expression. Following overnight culture, growth medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with Neutridoma (0.1% v/v) and the indicated concentrations of either TSA or NaB. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with methanol (30 min, on ice). Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and blocked with PBS containing BSA (0.1%; 60 min, room temperature). Cells were incubated with anti-rat cardiac α-MHC (mouse monoclonal hybridoma supernatant BA-G5, 200 μl/well, ATCC) (1 h, room temperature). Cells were washed three times with PBS containing BSA (1%) and incubated with the same solution but containing HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Southern Biotechnology) (1 h, room temperature). Cells were washed three times with PBS containing BSA (1%), luminol (Pierce) was added, and luminescence was detected using a fusion plate reader. Anti-acetylhistone Immunoblot Analysis—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated 10-cm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish) in DMEM containing FBS (10%), l-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin. Following overnight culture, growth medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing Neutridoma (0.1%), phenylephrine (PE) (20 μm), and the indicated concentrations of TSA. After 48 h of treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and whole cell protein extracts were prepared in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing EGTA (10 mm), EDTA (5 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were sonicated briefly and clarified by centrifugation. Total protein from each treatment group (15 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-acetylhistone H4 primary antibody (06–946; 1:4000, Upstate Biotechnology) and an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (4050; 1:10,000, Southern Biotechnology) dilution. Protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Adenylate Kinase Release Assay—Adenylate kinase was measured in culture supernatants employing the bioluminescent ToxiLight kit (Bio-Whittaker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were run in a 96-well format, and values were measured using a fusion plate reader. RNA Analysis—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated 10-cm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish). Following the indicated treatments, RNA was isolated from cardiomyocytes using TriZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was vacuum-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using a 96-well format dot blotter (BioRad). Membranes were blocked in 4× SSC containing SDS (1%), 5× Denhardt's reagent, sodium pyrophosphate (0.05%), and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml; 4 h, 50 °C) and incubated with 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml; 14 h, 50 °C). Sequences of oligonucleotides were as follows: ANF, 5′-AATGTGACCAAGCTGCGTGACACACCACAAGGGCTTAGGATCTTTTGCGATCTGCTCAAG-3′; α-skeletal actin, 5′-TGGAGCAAAACAGAATGGCTGGCTTTAATGCTTCAAGTTTTCCATTTCCTTTCCACAGGG-3′; α-MHC, 5′-CGAACGTTTATGTTTATTGTGGATTGGCCACAGCGAGGGTCTGCTGGAGAGG-3′; β-MHC, 5′-GCTTTATTCTGCTTCCACCTAAAGGGCTGTTGCAAAGGCTCCAGGTCTGAGGGCTTC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GGAACATGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAG-3′. Blots were washed twice with 0.5× SSC containing SDS (0.1%; 10 min, 50 °C) and analyzed by autoradiography. Hybridization signals were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Promoter-Reporter Assays—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated 6-well dishes (1 × 106 cells/well) in DMEM: M199 (4:1), 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, l-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter under the control of 3 kilobases of the mouse ANF promoter (39Thuerauf D.J. Hansford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a CMV-lacZ reporter using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to treatment for an additional 24 h with the indicated agonists and inhibitors. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Inhibition of ANF Expression by HDAC Inhibitors—To begin to investigate the potential effects of HDAC inhibitors on cardiac hypertrophy, we assayed for expression of ANF, a secreted peptide and sensitive marker of hypertrophy, in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with a series of hypertrophic agonists. As shown in Fig. 1A, the treatment of cardiomyocytes with FBS, PE, or endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced ANF expression as detected by a cytoblot immunoassay. In the presence of TSA at concentrations of up to 5 nm, we observed little or no effect on ANF expression. However, at higher concentrations of TSA, ANF levels decreased to that found in unstimulated cells. NaB also inhibited ANF expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cardiomyocytes with TSA, NaB, or HC-toxin also inhibited PE-induced expression of ANF mRNA (Fig. 1C), demonstrating a direct effect of HDAC inhibitors on the fetal cardiac gene program. To determine whether repression of ANF expression by HDAC inhibitors correlated with increases in cardiomyocyte histone acetylation, the effect of TSA treatment on histone H4 acetylation was monitored by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, the ability of TSA to increase global histone H4 acetylation closely mirrored its capacity to block ANF expression (Fig. 1A). Agonist-dependent increases in ANF expression can also be monitored by immunostaining cardiomyocytes with ANF-specific antibodies. Following stimulation with PE and FBS, prominent ANF expression is observed within the secretory pathway as evidenced by its perinuclear localization (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the reduction in ANF protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 1, A and C), ANF immunostaining was significantly diminished in the presence of TSA, although residual expression was detectable. Some reports have associated HDAC inhibitors with cell death (26Brosch G. Ransom R. Lechner T. Walton J. Loidl P. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 40Butler L. Agus D.B. Scher H.I. Higgins B. Rose A. Cordon-Cardo C. Thaler H.T. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M.

Therefore, we examined whether TSA and NaB were cytotoxic to cardiomyocytes by assaying for the release of adenylate kinase into the culture medium as a measurement of cell membrane integrity. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing doses of TSA (up to 100 nm) (A) and NaB (up to 25 mm) (B) did not increase adenylate kinase in the culture medium. These results suggest that inactivation of ANF expression is a specific effect of HDAC inhibition, not an indirect consequence of cytotoxicity. In subsequent experiments, we used 85 nm TSA or 5 mm NaB unless otherwise indicated. Inhibition of Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy by HDAC Inhibitors—To further examine the potential effects of HDAC inhibitors on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, we stained myocytes for α-actinin, a component of the contractile apparatus. The sarcomeres of unstimulated primary neonatal cardiomyocytes are disorganized; however, stimulation with PE, FBS, or ET-1 results in the appearance of a highly organized sarcomeric structure and an increase in cell size (Fig. 3A). In the presence of TSA, agonist-mediated sarcomere organization was blocked. A hallmark of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is enhanced protein synthesis, resulting in increased total cellular protein. We assayed for changes in protein synthesis by measuring accumulation of the ribosomal subunit S6. As shown in Fig. 3B, PE stimulated S6 protein expression ∼2-fold and TSA treatment totally abolished this increase. Comparable results were obtained when either FBS or ET-1 was employed to stimulate hypertrophy (data not shown). Similarly, TSA prevented the PE-induced increase in protein synthesis as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 3C). Together, these findings indicate that HDAC inhibitors specifically antagonize the program for cardiac hypertrophy without affecting cell viability. Inhibition of the Fetal Gene Program by HDAC Inhibitors—To further assess the ability of HDAC inhibitors to prevent myocyte hypertrophy, we examined the effect of TSA on expression of fetal cardiac genes. Hypertrophic growth is typically accompanied by a switch in MHC expression from the α- to β-isoforms. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, TSA prevented the up-regulation of β-MHC mRNA expression in response to PE and instead provoked an increase in expression of α-MHC transcripts, which are normally down-regulated in response to hypertrophic agonists. TSA not only prevented the agonist-induced reduction in α-MHC expression but also increased α-MHC mRNA and protein levels in unstimulated cells as did NaB (Fig. 4, A–C, and data not shown). The up-regulation of α-MHC in the presence of HDAC inhibitors suggests that HDAC inhibition reverses the hypertrophic program and further indicates that the effects are not the result of cytotoxicity. The increase in expression of α-skeletal actin that typically accompanies hypertrophy was also blocked by TSA (Fig. 4, A and D). Inhibition of the ANF Promoter by HDAC Inhibitors—To begin to decipher the mechanism whereby HDAC inhibitors prevented expression of fetal cardiac genes, we assayed the effect of TSA, NaB, and HC-toxin on activity of the ANF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 5A, HDAC inhibitors interfered with the ability of PE to stimulate ANF promoter activity. This effect was specific because the inhibitors did not affect activity of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that HDAC inhibitors selectively interfere with the expression or activity of an activator of the ANF promoter rather than the proteins involved in general transcription. Postnatal cardiac myocytes activate a well defined program of hypertrophic growth and fetal gene expression in response to a variety of stress signals and diverse agonists. Previous studies demonstrated that cardiac hypertrophy is suppressed by class II HDACs (11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and enhanced by p300 HAT (12Gusterson R. Jazrawi E. Adcock I. Latchman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, we expected that HDAC inhibitors would stimulate hypertrophy by relieving the repression imposed by class II HDACs. Unexpectedly, our results show that HDAC inhibitors are highly effective in suppressing hypertrophy and the fetal gene program in primary cardiomyocytes. How can the seemingly paradoxical effects of HDAC inhibitors on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy be reconciled with our previous findings that class II HDACs block hypertrophy? One possibility is that the mechanism whereby class II HDACs suppress hypertrophy and the fetal gene program is independent of deacetylase activity. In this regard, the deacetylase domains of class II HDACs are not required for transcriptional repression because these HDACs recruit other corepressors to target genes (42Fischle W. Dequiedt F.

Consistent with this conclusion, MITR (MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor), a splice variant of HDAC9 that lacks a deacetylase domain, is highly effective in repressing MEF2 activity and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (11Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that different classes of HDACs suppress distinct sets of genes that influence the hypertrophic program (Fig. 6). For example, while class II HDACs suppress pro-hypertrophic genes, class I HDACs might repress expression of anti-hypertrophic genes. If the anti-hypertrophic gene products are dominant over the genes suppressed by class II HDACs, one would expect HDAC inhibitors to block hypertrophy. The HDAC inhibitors used in this study inhibit both class I and II HDACs (48Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding possible selective effects of HDAC inhibitors on individual HDAC family members (49Furumai R. Matsuyama A. Kobashi N. Lee K. Nishiyama M. Nakajima H. Tanaka A. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4916-4921PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that class III HDACs are involved in the TSA effect, because they are TSA-insensitive (50Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5807-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 51Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the activity of one or more class I HDACs is dominant over the anti-hypertrophic effect of class II HDACs. What might be the gene targets for pro-hypertrophic HDACs? As mentioned above, one possibility is that such HDACs are required for repression of one or more genes whose products repress hypertrophy. Accordingly, inhibition of these HDACs could result in derepression of such anti-hypertrophic genes and a consequent block to hypertrophy. Several such genes have been shown to repress hypertrophy including those encoding glycogen synthase kinase-3 (52Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D.

A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and class II HDACs. We have assayed expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and various HDACs in the presence of TSA and have observed no effect. Whether the anti-hypertrophic effect of HDAC inhibitors involves other known or novel genes remains to be determined. The present findings contrast with those of a previous study (57Kuwahara K. Saito Y. Ogawa E. Takahashi N. Nakagawa Y. Naruse Y. Harada M. Hamanaka I. Izumi T. Miyamoto M. Kishimoto I. Kawakami R. Nakanishi M. Mori N. Nakao K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which reported that ANF expression was induced by low doses of TSA. The effects of higher doses were not reported. In that study, the induction of ANF expression was shown to be dependent on the inactivation of a repressive element known as a neuron-restrictive silencer element in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. However, we have found that HDAC inhibitors can block activation of the ANF promoter by hypertrophic agonists (Fig. 5), which would be independent of such a mechanism. HDAC inhibitors not only prevented hypertrophy but also stimulated expression of α-MHC, which is normally down-regulated during hypertrophy. These findings suggest that these inhibitors fully antagonize the hypertrophic program rather than selectively inhibiting only a subset of genes involved in this process. A previous study (58Adolph E.A. Subramaniam A. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5349-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a MEF2 binding site upstream of the α-MHC gene was required for the repression of the gene. Given that class II HDACs repress the activity of MEF2, up-regulation of α-MHC in the presence of HDAC inhibitors could reflect derepression of MEF2 activity at this site or it could represent an indirect effect of these inhibitors on other transcriptional regulators. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to block tumor cell proliferation, in part, by causing cell death (reviewed in Ref. 40Butler L. Agus D.B. Scher H.I. Higgins B. Rose A. Cordon-Cardo C. Thaler H.T. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5165-5170PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that suppression of hypertrophy by HDAC inhibitors is a nonspecific consequence of cytotoxicity, our results argue against this interpretation because multiple inhibitors suppressed hypertrophy at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those that caused cellular demise. Moreover, the concentrations in which these inhibitors suppressed hypertrophy are comparable to those reported in other studies to specifically inhibit histone deacetylation and other cellular processes. HDAC inhibitors have shown efficacy as anti-cancer agents in humans and animal models (56Kwon H. Kim M. Kim D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 36: 110-119PubMed Google Scholar, 59Marks P. Rifkind R.

It remains to be determined whether HDAC inhibitors will also prove to be efficacious in suppressing pathological cardiac signaling in vivo. Nevertheless, the results of this study point to the potential usefulness of such inhibitors in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy, which frequently progresses to heart failure. We thank C. Davis and N. Frey for discussions and technical help as well as J. Page and A. Tizenor for assistance with the preparation of this paper."

Dawson V.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Clinically, PD generally presents with brady-kinesia, resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and postural instability. PD is a heterogeneous disease, and the majority of the cases appear to have sporadic origins. At the same time, the disorder can also be associated with specific genetic defects, especially for cases of familial PD (2Gasser T. J. Neurol. 2001; 248: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Giasson B.I. Lee V.M.-Y.

Ten different genetic loci have been linked with familial PD, and the genes responsible for PD at these loci include the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E.

Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was discovered that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are linked with autosomal recessive early onset familial PD (8Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C.J. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Two types of disruptions of this gene have been identified in PD patients. One is a deletion of several of its exons, which abolishes the production of the DJ-1 protein. The other disruption is a single point mutation, giving rise to the L166P mutant at the protein level. This mutant has a different cytoplasmic distribution and is believed to be functionally inactive. Therefore, loss of the normal function of DJ-1 appears to contribute to PD. The exact biological function of the DJ-1 protein is currently unknown. It may play a role in the oxidative stress response, and this function could be important in preventing the onset of PD (8Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C.J. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P.

On the other hand, DJ-1 may also be associated with several other biological processes. It was first identified as an oncogene, because it can transform NIH3T3 cells in cooperation with the ras oncogene (11Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The DJ-1 protein is also involved in the fertilization process in rat and mouse (12Wagenfeld A.

Yeung C.-H. Shivaji S. Sundareswaran V.R. Ariga H. Cooper T.G. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 954-963PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the protein may be secreted under some circumstances, which has also been observed in breast cancers (16Le Naour F. Misek D.E. Krause M.C. Deneux L. Giordano T.J. Scholl S. Hanash S.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3328-3335PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, DJ-1 was identified as the regulatory subunit of a 400-kDa RNA-binding protein complex and its presence inhibits the binding of RNA by the complex (17Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The DJ-1 protein is a positive regulator of the androgen receptor by sequestering its negative regulators PIASxα (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) or DJBP (DJ-1-binding protein) (18Takahashi K.

Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the androgen receptor might be related to the effects of this protein on fertility. PIAS proteins are SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier-1) ligases and control their target proteins by sumoylation (20Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PIASxα can sumoylate DJ-1 on the Lys-130 residue (18Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). DJBP is almost exclusively expressed in the testis in humans. It negatively modulates the androgen receptor by recruiting histone deacetylases. DJ-1 can inhibit this recruitment, thereby leading to the activation of the androgen receptor (19Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar). The human DJ-1 protein contains 189 amino acid residues. It belongs to the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily of proteins, which are conserved in many different organisms (Fig. 1). The function of ThiJ is currently unknown, although it might be related to the biosynthesis of thiamin (21Mizote T. Tsuda M. Smith D.D.S. Nakayama H. Nakazawa T.

PfpI is an intracellular protease that was first identified from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (23Halio S.B. Blumentals I.I. Short S.A. Merrill B.M. Kelly R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is present in most bacteria and archaea. The crystal structure of the closely related intracellular protease PH1704 from Pyrococcus horikoshii revealed the presence of a Cys-100/His-101/Glu-74′ catalytic triad (primed residue indicate a different monomer) with the active site at the interface of neighboring monomers in a hexameric oligomer (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A Cys-185/His-186/Asp-214 catalytic triad was found in a structural homolog of this protease, the heat shock protein Hsp31 from E. coli (25Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this chaperone, however, shares only a 19% identity with that of PH1704. The DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI proteins also share limited sequence and structural homology to those of the type I glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) domains, which contain a Cys-His-Glu/Asp catalytic triad (26Horvath M.M. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2001; 42: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the Cys residue in the active site of the PfpI proteases is conserved among all of the members of the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily, the His and Asp/Glu residues are not conserved in DJ-1 and its close homologs (Fig. 1). To determine the composition of this putative active site in DJ-1 and to obtain a better understanding for the possible molecular function of this protein, we have determined its crystal structure at a 1.8-Å resolution. We have also characterized the disease-causing L166P mutant in solution, which suggests that the DJ-1 protein may function only as a dimer. Protein Expression and Purification—The gene for human DJ-1 was subcloned into the pET24d vector and overexpressed in E. coli at 20 °C. The recombinant protein contains a hexa-histidine tag at the C terminus. After cell lysis, the soluble protein was purified by nickel-agarose affinity, anion exchange, and gel-filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 30 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol and stored at –80 °C. There are no Trp residues in DJ-1, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The C-terminal His tag was not removed for crystallization. For the production of selenomethionyl proteins, the expression construct was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli DL41(DE3) cells. The bacterial growth was carried out in defined LeMaster media (27Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), and the protein was purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type protein. Mutagenesis—The L166P and K130R single site mutants of human DJ-1 were created with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm the incorporation of the correct mutation. The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified following the same protocol as for the wild-type protein. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of the DJ-1 wild-type and mutant proteins were prepared by the vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Initial crystallization conditions for the wild-type protein were identified by sparse-matrix screening with commercial kits (Hampton Research). The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10–12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. The protein was at a concentration of 15 mg/ml (diluted 1:1 with 30 mm Tris (pH 8.0) from the original stock). Both hexagonal bipyramid and plate crystals appeared overnight. They were cryoprotected with a solution containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 35% (w/v) PEG3350 and flash-frozen in liquid propane. For crystals of the K130R mutant, the reservoir contained 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 20% (w/v) PEG3350, and 50 mm CaCl2. The protein was at 10 mg/ml concentration pre-mixed with 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 25% (w/v) PEG3350, and 200 mm ammonium acetate. Crystals in the shape of thin plates were cryoprotected with a solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) and 35% (w/v) PEG3350 and flash-frozen in liquid propane for data collection at 100 K. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an ADSC (Area Detector Systems Corporation) CCD at the X4A beamline of Brookhaven National Laboratory. The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). A selenomethionyl single wavelength anomalous diffraction data set to 1.8-Å resolution was collected on a hexagonal bipyramid crystal. It belongs to space group P3121, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The plate-shaped crystal of the wild-type protein belongs to space group P21 with four dimers in the asymmetric unit. A diffraction data set to 2.2-Å resolution was collected for this crystal. The K130R mutant crystal belongs to space group C2 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Its diffraction data set extended to 1.7-Å resolution.

Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Reflection phases to 1.8-Å resolution were calculated based on the single wavelength anomalous diffraction data and improved with the program SOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), which also automatically located 80% of the residues in the molecule. The full atomic model was built into the electron density with the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The structures of the monoclinic crystal form and the K130R mutant were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program COMO (32Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The statistics on the structure refinement are summarized in Table I. The Structure Determination—The crystal structure of wild-type human DJ-1 protein in a trigonal crystal form has been determined at 1.8-Å resolution by the selenomethionyl single wavelength anomalous diffraction method (34Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The positions of the Se sites were determined by direct methods (29Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), which enabled the phasing of the reflections and automatic tracing of 80% of the residues in the protein (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The current atomic model contains residues 2–188 of DJ-1 together with 199 water molecules. The last residue of the protein and the C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (LEHHHHHH) are not visible in the electron density map. The atomic model has excellent agreement with the experimental data with a R-factor of 19.0% (Table I). The r.m.s. deviation from ideal values in bond lengths and bond angles are 0.004 Å and 1.3°, respectively. All of the residues with the exception of Cys-106 are located in favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown). The Cys-106 residue has a strained main chain conformation (see below). We have also determined the crystal structure at 2.2-Å resolution of the wild-type protein in a monoclinic crystal form (Table I) by the molecular replacement method (32Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Rossmann M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This crystal contains four dimers of DJ-1 in the asymmetric unit, allowing us to assess the conformational flexibility of the monomer and dimer of DJ-1. The structure of the K130R mutant of human DJ-1 has been determined at 1.7-Å resolution by the molecular replacement method (Table I). This crystal form is not isomorphous to either of the native crystals. The structure shows that the K130R side chains in both monomers are involved in crystal-packing interactions with neighboring dimers in the crystal, and these interactions are different from those for the Lys-130 side chain in the wild-type crystals. Structure of the DJ-1 Monomer—The structure of the monomer of DJ-1 has the α/β-fold with 11 β-strands (β1–β11) and 8 α-helices (αA–αH) (Fig. 2A). The central β-sheet of the structure contains seven strands. The six parallel strands of this sheet are arranged similar to those in the Rossmann-fold with the distinction that the third strand is very short in the DJ-1 structure (β5 with only two residues) (Figs. 1 and 2A). Outside the central β-sheet, strands β3 and β4 form a β-hairpin structure and are involved in the dimerization of DJ-1 (see below). Strands β8 and β9 together with helix αF form a β-α-β motif, which contributes the conserved His-126 residue to the putative active site of DJ-1 (Fig. 2A). Most of the helices flank the two faces of the β-sheet (Fig. 2B). The only exception is helix αH at the extreme C terminus of DJ-1. It projects away from the rest of the protein and only contacts helices αA and αG in the monomer (Fig. 2B). Residues 181–187 in helix αH are conserved to be hydrophobic amino acids among the DJ-1 and ThiJ proteins (Fig. 1). These residues mediate the interactions with helices αA and αG as well as the dimerization of DJ-1 (see below). The Dimer of DJ-1—Gel-filtration and light-scattering studies showed that wild-type DJ-1 protein exists as dimers in solution. 2X. Tao and L. Tong, unpublished data. In the trigonal crystal of the wild-type protein, there is a monomer of DJ-1 in the asymmetric unit. The other monomer of the dimer is related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 3A). The αA helices of the two monomers come into close contact in the core of the dimer (Fig. 3B). At one edge of the interface, the β3-β4 hairpin is situated right next to the dimer 2-fold axis, such that a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet is formed across the dimer (Fig. 3A). At the other edge, the β11-αG loop interacts with residues near the C terminus of the other monomer, including those in helix αH (Fig. 3B). These interactions may also be important to stabilize the conformation of the αH helix at the C terminus of DJ-1. In the monoclinic crystal form of the wild-type protein, there are four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Structural comparisons among these dimers and the dimer in the trigonal crystal form show that the organizations of the dimers are essentially the same. The r.m.s. distance between equivalent Cα atoms of any pair of these dimers is approximately 0.35 Å. The αB helix shows conformational variability among the four dimers in the monoclinic crystal, and this helix also has weak electron density in the trigonal crystal. The organization of the dimer is also conserved in that of the K130R mutant with a r.m.s. distance of 0.3 Å for 374 pairs of equivalent Cα atoms of the wild-type and mutant dimers. The DJ-1 dimer has an extensive interface between the two monomers. A total of 1200 Å2 of the surface area of each monomer is buried at this interface, involving mostly residues that are conserved among DJ-1 proteins (Fig. 1). Our structural and solution observations therefore suggest that this dimer is likely to be a stable and conserved oligomerization state for these proteins. Interestingly, a deletion mutant of DJ-1 removing residues 178 to the C terminus (Fig. 1) is still mostly dimeric in solution (data not shown), suggesting that either the αH helix has a minor role in the dimerization of DJ-1 or the C-terminal hexahistidine tag (LEHHHHHH) is partially rescuing the dimer formation. On the other hand, the deletion mutant lacking residues 173 to the C terminus forms large aggregates of various sizes (molecular masses of 200–400 kDa) with little dimeric species in solution. Structural Homologs of DJ-1—The structure of DJ-1 bears the strongest similarity to that of PH1704 from P. horikoshii (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a member of the PfpI family, and the two proteins share 22% amino acid sequence identity. The r.m.s. distance is 1.1 Å for 137 equivalent Cα atoms between DJ-1 and PH1704. Most of the secondary structure elements are superimposable between the two proteins (Fig. 2C). However, the αH helix at the C terminus of DJ-1 does not have a structural equivalent in PH1704. Sequence comparisons suggest that all of the PfpI family members lack this helix, because they are approximately 15 residues shorter than DJ-1 at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The quaternary structure of PH1704 and DJ-1 are entirely different, despite the homology in the sequence and structure of their monomers. In contrast to the dimeric association of DJ-1, a hexameric structure roughly obeying 32 symmetry was observed in the crystal of PH1704 (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This hexamer can be considered as a trimer of dimers, and the interface of the dimer is mediated by the αA and αG helices. However, such a mode of dimerization is not possible with DJ-1 as it is blocked by the extra αH helix in DJ-1. Therefore, the DJ-1 dimer is formed by a different arrangement of the αA and αG helices of the two monomers and the αH helices also contribute to the dimerization interface (Fig. 3A). In addition, the contribution of the β3–β4 hairpin to the dimer interface is unique to DJ-1 (Fig. 3A). The dimerization of Hsp31, a structural homolog of PH1704 and DJ-1, is mediated by segments outside the PfpI/DJ-1-fold (25Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Searches against the Protein Data Bank with the program Dali (36Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) showed that DJ-1 also shares significant structural similarity with the C-terminal domain in the catalase hydroperoxidase II (HPII) (37Bravo J. Mate M.J. Schneider T. Switala J. Wilson K. Loewen P.C. Fita I. Proteins. 1999; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as has been suggested earlier (26Horvath M.M. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2001; 42: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. distance for 136 equivalent Cα atoms between DJ-1 and this C-terminal domain (residues 600–753) is 2.0 Å. The amino acid identity for these residues is however only 12%. This domain in HPII lacks the β8–β10 insertion (Fig. 2D), which accounts for its smaller size. At the C terminus, HPII also has a helix but it is running in an opposite direction from the αH helix in DJ-1. The exact function of this C-terminal domain in HPII is not fully understood. It mediates the dimer interface in the tetramer of the enzyme and helps to form the substrate channel leading to the active site (37Bravo J. Mate M.J. Schneider T. Switala J. Wilson K. Loewen P.C. Fita I. Proteins. 1999; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This domain may also facilitate the folding of the full-length enzyme, as deletion mutants lacking this domain cannot accumulate in the cell. The dimerization of this domain in HPII uses the unique αH helix at the C terminus and is different from that in DJ-1. Structural homology between the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily and the GAT domains has also been suggested earlier (26Horvath M.M. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2001; 42: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the actual similarity is rather limited. The GAT domains lack the β3–β4 hairpin structure in DJ-1 but contain significantly more elaborate insertions between αE and β10. Moreover, the binding site for glutamine in GAT is blocked by the β6-αC loop in the DJ-1 structure. Therefore, it is unlikely that DJ-1 can have GAT function. The Putative Catalytic Residues of DJ-1—The exact biochemical function of the DJ-1 protein is currently not known. However, structural and sequence comparisons with homologous proteins can provide valuable hints as to the possible roles of this protein in oxidative stress response, androgen receptor regulation, and other processes. A cysteine residue is conserved among all of the members of the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily, and the residue has been proposed as the catalytic nucleophile for the PfpI family of intracellular proteases (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This residue is equivalent to Cys-106 in human DJ-1 (Fig. 1) and is located just after strand β7 in the structure (Fig. 2A). The main chain of this residue assumes a strained conformation with φ and ψ torsion angles of 66 and –114°, respectively, which is also observed in the structures of PH1704 and Hsp31 (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The structural conservation of this Cys residue in DJ-1 suggests that it may also have a catalytic role in the biochemical function of this protein, identifying this region of the structure as the putative active site of DJ-1. In both the PfpI proteases and the Hsp31 chaperone, the Cys residue is part of a Cys-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad (24Du X. Choi I.-G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The second member His residue in the triad follows immediately after the Cys residue in the primary sequence of these proteins (Figs. 1 and 2C). In DJ-1, however, the residue immediately after Cys-106 is Ala (Fig. 1), signifying that there are differences between DJ-1 and the PfpI proteases in this active site. Our structures show that His-126, from the β8-αF loop and conserved among all of the DJ-1 proteins (Fig. 1), is placed near the Cys-106 side chain in the putative active site of DJ-1 (Fig. 4A). The His-126 residue could be the second member of the catalytic machinery for DJ-1. The distance between the side chains of Cys-106 and His-126 is 4.2 Å in the current structure (Fig. 4A) similar to the distance of approximately 5 Å that is found in the active site of caspases (38Watt W.

In this study the ability of OEA to modulate the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) was explored. OEA alone did not activate TRPV1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes under control conditions, but produced a differential modulation of agonist-evoked responses.

In sensory neurons, OEA-induced Ca2+ rises that were selective for capsaicin-sensitive cells, inhibited by the TRPV1 blocker, capsazepine, and occurred in a PKC-dependent manner.

OEA production and release are stimulated by feeding and inhibited during fasting (1Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J.

These anorexic actions are mediated by stimulation of vagal sensory nerves that in turn stimulate the brainstem and hypothalamus. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that brain administration of OEA is ineffective in reducing food intake, and the effects of OEA are lost by ablation of vagal nerves with neonatal capsaicin treatment (1Rodriguez de Fonseca F.

OEA is structurally similar to anandamide (AEA) (Fig. 1A), but unlike AEA has no activity at cannabinoid receptors (3Piomelli D. Beltramo M. Giuffrida A. Stella N. Neurobiol Dis. 1998; 5: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AEA is an agonist at the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) (4Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M.

S. A. 2000; 97: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), suggesting a broader function for this receptor in addition to pain signaling. The results show that OEA differentially modulates agonist-evoked TRPV1 currents. Moreover, OEA directly activates TRPV1 and excites sensory neurons expressing TRPV1, both of which occur in a PKC-dependent manner. Thus, during PKC stimulation the TRPV1 channel may contribute to the sensory nerve actions of OEA. Tissues were harvested using protocols approved by the Georgetown University Animal Use and Care Committee. Dorsal root ganglion (ORG) neurons were obtained from P7–18 rats killed by CO2 narcosis/decapitation. Oocytes were harvested from adult, female Xenopus laevis anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate (0.5 g/l). Frogs were humanely killed following final collection of oocytes. Oocyte Electrophysiology—Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 30–50 ng of rat TRPV1 cRNA. Double electrode voltage clamp was performed using a Warner amplifier (Warner Instruments, OC725C). All the experiments were performed at room temperature of ∼22 °C. Oocytes were placed in a perspex chamber and continuously super-fused (3–5 ml/min) with Ca2+-free ringer solution containing (in mm): 100 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1 Mg2+ and titrated to pH 7.35 with ∼5 mm NaOH. For solutions < pH 6.0, HEPES was replaced with 10 mm MES. Ca2+-free conditions were used to minimize VR1 tachyphylaxis and contamination from Ca2+-activated Cl– currents. Electrodes were filled with 2 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1 MΩ. Oocyes were routinely voltage-clamped at –60 mV. Voltage ramps consisted of 500 ms pulses from –60 mV (holding potential) to +60 mV. Unless otherwise indicated, leak currents measured under control conditions were subtracted from agonist-induced currents. For H+ experiments, the test responses were normalized to responses with pH 4 in the same oocyte. DRG Electrophysiology—Single-channel patch clamp recordings were performed using an EPC8 amplifier (HEKA). The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 Na gluconate, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3; and the pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 Na gluconate, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. The current signal was sampled at 3 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Currents were further filtered for display purposes. Open probability was evaluated from continuous data stretches of at least 20 s. Ca2 + -imaging—DRG neurons were loaded with 1 μm Fluo4-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min. Neurons were washed for a further 10–20 min prior to recording. The dye was excited at 488 ± 15 nm, and emitted fluorescence was filtered with a 535 ± 25 nm bandpass filter, captured by a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and read into a computer. Analysis was performed offline using Simple PCI software (Compix Inc., Cranberry, PA). Drugs were applied using pressure injection pipettes (1–3 μm diameter) positioned at a distance of ∼50–100 μm from the neuron of interest. Pressure alone (<1 psi) did not elicit any Ca2+ responses. Chemicals—Capsaicin, casazepine, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) were obtained from Sigma. OEA and AEA were obtained from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). Bisindolylmaleimide 1 (BIM) was from ICN (Aurora, Ohio). Drugs were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO (BIM, 2 mm) or ethanol (10 mm for PDBu and 100 mm for all other drugs) and diluted into physiological solution prior to experiments. OEA solutions were made fresh before every experiment because we found that bioactivity of these solutions decreased markedly with time (half-life of ∼30 min in standard buffer). Data are given as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test. The effect of OEA on capsaicin receptors was studied by applying the fatty acid to cloned rat TRPV1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. OEA alone (1–80 μm) produced no detectable currents at membrane potentials range from –60 to +60 mV (Figs. 1B and 2B). In contrast, OEA markedly enhanced TRPV1 currents activated by acidic (pH 4) solution (Fig. 1B). The potentiation of H+-gated currents by OEA was rapidly reversible, suggesting that OEA directly interacts with the TRPV1 channel. The dose-response relationship for activation by H+ (Fig. 1D) shows that OEA (20 μm) enhanced the maximal response without significantly altering the affinity for protons. The effects of OEA on responses to the TRPV1 agonists, anandamide (AEA) and capsaicin, were also explored. In contrast, to the results observed with protons, OEA partly inhibited currents evoked by AEA and had no effect on capsaicin-evoked responses (Fig. 1C). The inhibition of AEA evoked responses by OEA may arise either from a competitive interaction at TRPV1 (whereby OEA displaces AEA thereby reducing AEA-mediated channel activation), or alternatively, by inhibition of active AEA uptake. Subsequent experiments tested whether PKC could alter the sensitivity of TRPV1 to OEA. PKC is a critical regulator of TRPV1 activity and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 enhances agonist-induced responses and lowers the threshold for activation by heat and protons (9Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 10Vellani V. Mapplebeck S. Moriondo A. Davis J.B. McNaughton P.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). After pretreatment with the phorbol ester, PDBu, used to stimulate PKC, OEA (10 μm) alone was capable of activating current (Fig. 2A). OEA-induced current reversed at ∼–5 to –10 mV (the reversal potential for capsaicin-evoked current), exhibited outward rectification characteristic of TRPV1 (Fig. 2B), and could be blocked with the TRPV1 inhibitor, capsazepine (10 μm, n = 4). Further, OEA produced no current in uninjected oocytes. Thus, these results indicate that the current activated by OEA is via TRPV1 channels. The dose response relationship for OEA following PKC stimulation shows that OEA produced half-maximal activation at ∼2 μm concentrations at room temperature (Fig. 2C). This value is comparable with the EC50 for AEA, under similar conditions (4Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Hogestatt E.D. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 5Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Jerman J.C. Nasir S. Gray J. Muir A.I. Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). To test whether PKC signaled through direct phosphorylation of the TRPV1 channel or via accessory proteins, these experiments were repeated with oocytes expressing TRPV1 channels lacking the serine residues (S502A and S800A), identified as critical for PKC regulation (11Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These mutant channels retained sensitivity to H+ and capsaicin but were completely unresponsive to OEA after phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 3, A–C). In summary, 10 μm OEA evoked little detectable current (<5 nA) at –60 mV in these mutant receptors (n = 8) compared with 145 ± 27 nA for wild type TRPV1 (n = 9). Thus, phosphorylation of the TRPV1 channel by PKC is a critical prerequisite for direct activation by OEA. In addition, the potentiation of H+-evoked currents by OEA was smaller in mutant compared with wild-type receptors (Fig. 3D). These data show that PKC regulates both the direct effects of OEA and the effects of OEA on agonist-induced responses. To assess whether OEA could activate endogenous TRPV1 channels, Ca2+ imaging of cultured adult sensory neurons was performed, using the Ca2+ permeability of TRPV1 as a marker of channel activity. DRG neurons were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fluo4, and treated sequentially with OEA (10 μm) and capsaicin (2 μm) to confirm expression of TRPV1. Fig. 4, A and B, shows the results from representative capsaicin-sensitive neurons conducted with or without PDBu pretreatment (500 nm, 3–5 min). In the absence of PDBu, OEA did not produce a Ca2+ rise. In contrast, after treatment with PDBu, OEA produced a clear Ca2+ elevation although somewhat smaller than a saturating capsaicin concentration. Note that normalized Ca2+ rises in response to capsaicin were smaller after PDBu treatment because PKC activation alone evokes a small Ca2+ rise via TRPV1 (9Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In summary, responses to OEA after PDBu were observed in 28 of 38 neurons with a mean increase of ∼1.6-fold (n = 38) compared with ∼4.4-fold for 2 μm capsaicin (Fig. 4C). No responses to OEA were seen in capsaicin-insensitive cells, either before or after PDBu, or in the presence of capsazepine (10 μm, Fig. 4C). In addition, no significant responses to OEA were seen after treatment with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide 1 (BIM, 1 μm, n = 24). Thus, the excitation of sensory neurons by OEA likely occurs via activation of TRPV1, and as with the cloned TRPV1, requires activation of PKC. To test further an action of OEA on TRPV1, single channel recordings were made from cell-free patches of DRG neurons. Application of capsaicin to the intracellular face of cell-free patches activated single channel TRPV1 activity with a characteristic conductance of ∼90–100 picoSiemens (Fig. 5A). When cells were pretreated with PDBu to activate PKC these patches exhibited a low level of spontaneous TRPV1 activity, as previously reported (9Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and consistent with the whole oocyte data. Fig. 5B shows data from one experiment where the probability of being open (Po) was 0.02. This channel activity was markedly increased by 20 μm OEA (Po = 0.19) and further enhanced by 3 μm capsaicin (Po = 0.49). In summary, in five patches OEA increased the Po of TRPV1 channels from 0.02 ± 0.01 to 0.14 ± 0.02. Thus, these experiments at the single channel level directly confirm an action of OEA on capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 channels. This study has identified the TRPV1 channel as a potential sensory nerve target of OEA. OEA regulated the activity of both cloned and endogenous TRPV1 channels. At rest, OEA did not directly gate the TRPV1 channel but instead modulated agonist-induced responses; OEA enhanced the effects of protons ∼3-fold and inhibited the current activated by AEA by ∼50%. Importantly, OEA alone activated TRPV1 channels following stimulation of PKC. This effect was dependent on phosphorylation of TRPV1 because mutant receptors lacking critical PKC phosphorylation sites were unresponsive to OEA, and a PKC inhibitor blocked the actions of OEA in sensory neurons. PKC also enhanced the synergistic action of OEA and protons. These data confirm the important role for PKC in TRPV1 channel regulation. Many of the signaling factors that activate or sensitize sensory nerves, including bradykinin and extracellular ATP, use signaling pathways that converge on PKC activation (9Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 12Tominaga M. Wada M. Masu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6951-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation provides yet another pathway for TRPV1 sensitization (13De Petrocellis L. Harrison S. Bisogno T. Tognetto M. Brandi I. Smith G.D. Creminon C. Davis J.B. Geppetti P. Di Marzo V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and may also be relevant to OEA signaling. OEA could regulate TRPV1 by indirect or direct mechanisms. OEA can inhibit the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (15Jonsson K.O. Vandevoorde S. Lambert D.M. Tiger G. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), an enzyme that breaks down AEA to arachidonic acid. This could lead to increased cellular levels of AEA and thus enhanced TRPV1 activity. In addition, OEA may inhibit the facilitated transport of AEA in neurons. This could explain inhibition of AEA evoked responses by OEA, although there are no reports of facilitated transport of AEA in oocytes. Alternatively, several lines of evidence point to a direct action on the channel. First, OEA activated TRPV1 channels when applied to the intracellular face of cell-free patches. Second, activation by OEA required phosphorylation of TRPV1 and was absent in TRPV1 receptors lacking critical serines (Ser-502 and Ser-800). These data suggest that activation by OEA occurs through a direct mechanism and independent of AEA metabolism and transport. A direct action of OEA at the AEA-binding site on TRPV1 would also be consistent with the observed inhibition of AEA currents. In contrast to the data reported here, Smart et al. (16Smart D. Jonsson K.O. Vandevoorde S. Lambert D.M. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) report that OEA enhances AEA-mediated Ca2+ flux through TRPV1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. These differences may be due to the expression system used (including variations in the levels of fatty acid amide hydrolase and AEA transporters), and the question will need to be reevaluated in primary sensory neurons. Although OEA exhibited a relatively low potency of ∼2 μm, and produced only a modest activation of TRPV1 when compared with capsaicin or protons, it is important to note that these experiments were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C). TRPV1 is gated by noxious heat >43 °C (17Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). In addition, agonists of TRPV1 generally lower the temperature dependence of activation (18Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that responses to OEA, especially after PKC activation, would be markedly greater at 37 °C than the responses observed here at 22 °C. The finding that OEA regulates TRPV1 activity may be relevant to the satiety actions of this lipid. OEA is believed to excite vagal sensory afferents (1Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 2Gomez R.

J Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9612-9617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these neurons highly express TRPV1 (7Michael G.J. Priestley J.V. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1844-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of these TRPV1 channels in vagal neurons by OEA may contribute to the excitatory actions of OEA. Further experiments in vagal neurons are needed to confirm this directly. Interestingly, AEA, an endogenous cannabinoid also activates TRPV1, but in contrast to OEA produces a well described hyperphagia believed to be mediated via actions at both central (19Di Marzo V. Goparaju S.K. Wang L. Liu J. Batkai S. Jarai Z. Fezza F. Miura G.I. Palmiter R.D. Sugiura T. Kunos G. Nature. 2001; 410: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) and peripheral cannabinoid receptors (2Gomez R. Navarro M. Ferrer B. Trigo J.M. Bilbao A. Del Arco I. Cippitelli A. Nava F. Piomelli D. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. J Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9612-9617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OEA, in contrast, lacks cannabinoid activity and appears to act exclusively by exciting peripheral vagal sensory neurons. Indeed, OEA may counteract the hyperphagic effects of AEA (2Gomez R. Navarro M. Ferrer B. Trigo J.M. Bilbao A. Del Arco I. Cippitelli A. Nava F. Piomelli D. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. J Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9612-9617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it may be significant that OEA can inhibit AEA-evoked activation of TRPV1. The PKC dependence of OEA effects on TRPV1 suggests that OEA might synergize with other signaling molecules to mediate its excitatory action. One attractive candidate is the peripheral satiety factor, cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK like OEA is released during feeding and signals via type A CCK receptors located on vagal nerves (20Broberger C. Holmberg K. Shi T.J. Dockray G. Hokfelt T. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Bray G.A. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2000; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This leads to activation of the phospholipase C-PKC pathway. Thus, activation of PKC during CCK signaling could act synergistically with OEA to excite vagal neurons.

Rab5-transfected cells exhibited abnormally large endosomes immunoreactive for Rab5 and early endosomal antigen 1, resembling the endosome morphology seen in affected neurons from AD brain. The levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in conditioned medium were increased more than 2.5-fold following Rab5 overexpression. In Rab5 overexpressing cells, the levels of β-cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APP) carboxyl-terminal fragments (βCTF), the rate-limiting proteolytic intermediate in Aβ generation, were increased up to 2-fold relative to APP holoprotein levels. An increase in β-cleaved soluble APP relative to α-cleaved soluble APP was also observed following Rab5 overexpression. βCTFs were co-localized by immunolabeling to vesicular compartments, including the early endosome and the trans-Golgi network.

These abnormalities include increased early endosome volume, increased expression or altered localization of proteins involved in the regulation of endocytosis, early endosomal fusion, and recycling (such as Rab5, early endosomal antigen 1, rabaptin 5, and Rab4), and an atypical increase in the levels of lysosomal hydrolases within the early endosome (29Cataldo A.M.

Recently, we modeled one aspect of these endocytic pathway changes, the increased expression of the 46-kDa mannose-6-phosphate receptor, which can mediate enhanced delivery of lysosomal proteases to early endosomes, and showed that this led to increased Aβ secretion from cells (31Mathews P.M.

The cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.1% saponin or 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to the antibody-containing solutions. The coverslips were mounted in GelMount (Fisher) and viewed using epifluorescent or laser confocal scanning microscopy. Receptor-mediated and Fluid Phase Uptake—Receptor-mediated uptake was examined using fluorescent-tagged transferring Tf-Alexa 586 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

ELISAs—5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 35-mm culture dishes and transfected as described above. The conditioned medium was collected after 40 h, and debris was removed with a rapid centrifugation and frozen in aliquots prior to ELISA determination of Aβ levels. Following the collection of conditioned medium, Triton X-100 lysates (1% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaC1, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors) were prepared and frozen for later determination of cell-associated APP metabolite levels. The Aβ40- and Aβ42-specific sandwich ELISAs used by our laboratory and the determination of human Aβ levels in the conditioned medium of cells have been described in detail (42Mathews P.M. Jiang Y.

Cell-associated βCTF levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA employing C1/6.1 as the capture antibody and JRF/AβN/25 as the detection antibody. The cell lysates were loaded neat or diluted 1:2 into Nunc-Immuno Plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) previously coated with 10 μg/ml C1/6.1 in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 0.05% NaN3, pH 8.5, and blocked as described for the Aβ ELISAs (42Mathews P.M.

A synthetic peptide (DAEFRHD KMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN), kindly provided by Dr. D. Westaway at the University of Toronto, containing the JRF/AβN/25 epitope at its amino terminus (in bold type) and the C1/6.1 epitope at its carboxyl terminus (in italics) was used as a standard. Using an aliquot of the Triton X-100 cell lysate, an additional ELISA developed to detect APP holoprotein as well as the cell-associated CTFs (APP/total CTF ELISA) was run. This ELISA uses C1/6.1 as the capture antibody, as does the βCTF ELISA, and employs a second carboxyl-terminal APP antibody for detection (C2/7.1; see Table I). A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 99 residues of human APP and both the C1/6.1 and C2/7.1 epitopes (GST-βPP672–770) (46Islam K. Levy E. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 265-271PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. E. Levy at New York University, was used as the standard in this ELISA. The βCTF ELISA and the APP/total CTF ELISA have the sensitivity to detect these metabolites in cell extracts (∼8 and 250 fmol/ml cell lysate, respectively; see Fig. 6A) and show strong correlation with βCTF or APP holoprotein levels when analyzed by other methods (data not shown). Throughout, ELISA measurements were determined from standard curves run on the same plate and represent the means of two or more wells. Endocytic Pathway Up-regulation by Overexpression of Rab5— Up-regulation of the endocytic pathway and its potential effect on APP processing was modeled in L cells stably overexpressing APP695 (L/APP) that were transiently transfected with human Rab5. Efficiency of transfection in multiple experiments was assessed by counting human Rab5-immunoreactive cells in randomly chosen fields, and typical levels of expression are shown in Fig. 1. The human-specific Rab5 mAb did not label nontransfected cells (Fig. 1A) but consistently labeled more than ∼45% of the cells when transfected with 0.5 μg of Rab5 cDNA/5 × 105 cells. This percentage increased close to 75% as the amount of Rab5 cDNA was increased (∼55% at 1.0 μg/5 × 105 cells and ∼75% at 3.0 μg/5 × 105 cells). Western blot analysis showed that although Rab5 protein levels increased significantly with the cDNA amounts used for transfections, Rab5 protein levels increased considerably more than percentage of transfected cells (Fig. 1B). This observation reflected the finding that at the higher cDNA amounts individual Rab5 transfected cells expressed extremely high levels of protein, which was found by immunolabeling to fill the cytosol rather than increase the labeling of endosomes (Fig. 1A). We next sought to correlate Rab5 overexpression in this system to an effect on the endocytic pathway. Earlier studies have shown that Rab5 overexpression increases the size of early endosomes (33Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). More detailed confocal analysis of cells immunolabeled with an anti-Rab5 antibody that recognizes both the mouse and human protein revealed small, uniform vesicular compartments in the control cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the control, Rab5 transfected cells contained numerous atypically large Rab5-positive vacuolar compartments (Fig. 2B), which were morphologically similar to those seen in neurons from AD brain (Fig. 2C). This morphologic alteration in early endosomes was confirmed using a second early endosomal marker, EEA1, both in the Rab5 transfected cells and in sections of human brain (Fig. 2, D–F). The pattern of endogenous EEA1 labeling in Rab5 overexpressing cells (Fig. 2E) closely resembles the pattern of enlarged early endosomal labeling seen in AD brain (Fig. 2F; see also Refs. 29Cataldo A.M.

Moreover, we confirmed that the enlarged EEA1-immunoreactive early endosomes found in cells overexpressing Rab5 were co-immunolabeled with the human specific Rab5 mAb (Fig. 2G) and EEA1 (Fig. 2H). We next examined the functional consequences of Rab5 overexpression by evaluating its effect on receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytic uptake (Fig. 3).

We previously identified a 70-kDa cell envelope protein in Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae that mediates binding of histatin (Hst) 5. Isolation of Hst 5-binding protein followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as the heat shock protein Ssa1p. Ssa protein and Hst 5-binding protein were found to be co-localized on immunoblots of yeast β-mercaptoethanol cell wall extracts and cytosolic fractions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed strong interactions between Ssa1p and both Hst 3 and Hst 5. To assess functional roles of Ssa proteins in the Hst 5 antifungal mechanism in vivo, both binding and fungicidal assays were carried out using S. cerevisiae isogenic SSA1/SSA2 mutants. 125I-Hst 5 binding assays showed saturable binding (K d = 2.57 × 10–6m) with the wild-type SSA1/SSA2 strain; however, Hst 5 binding with the Δssa1ssa2 double mutant was reduced (K d = 1.25 × 10–6m). Cell wall HSP70 proteins were also diminished, but still detectable, in S. cerevisiae Δssa1ssa2 cells and are likely to be Ssa3p or Ssa4p. Hst 5 (31 μm) killed 80% of the wild-type cells in fungicidal assays at room temperature. However, only 50–60% killing of the single mutants (Δssa1 and Δssa2) was observed, and fungicidal activity was further reduced to 20–30% in the Δssa1ssa2 double mutant. Incubation of cells under heat shock conditions increased the sensitivity of cells to Hst 5, which correlated with increased Hst 5-binding activity in Δssa1ssa2 cells, but not in wild-type cells.

Scand. 1998; 56: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A major component of host nonimmune defense systems is salivary histatins, a family of small (3–4 kDa), histidine-rich, cationic proteins secreted by major salivary glands in humans and higher primates (2Oppenheim F.G. Xu T. McMillian F.M. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7472-7477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pollock J.J. Denepitiya L. MacKay B.J. Ianoco V.J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 702-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histatin (Hst) 1The abbreviations used are: Hst, histatin; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; HstBP, histatin-binding protein; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; contig, group of overlapping clones. 5 is the most potent of the 12 histatin family members. It has fungicidal activity at physiological concentrations found in saliva (15–30 μm) against blastoconidial and filamentous forms of Candida albicans (4Xu T. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Oppenheim F.G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hst 5 possesses both fungistatic and fungicidal activities in vitro against a spectrum of other fungi, including Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cryptococcus neoformans (5Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, Hst 5 is effective against azole- or amphotericin-resistant strains of these fungi (6Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting fundamental differences in their mechanisms of action. Thus, Hst 5 or its derivatives could potentially be used as alternative or complementary antifungal drug therapies for oral candidiasis. Salivary Hst 5 does not function as a classical pore-forming antibiotic (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol.

Rather, the fungicidal mechanism of Hst 5 is a multistep process initially characterized by binding with a yeast cell envelope protein, followed by intracellular translocation and efflux of ions including K+, Mg2+, and ATP (3Pollock J.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18872-18879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that binding of Hst 5 with cell-surface proteins of C. albicans was closely tied to its killing activity (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Hst 5-specific binding was not detected in C. albicans spheroplasts following removal of the cell wall structure, and spheroplasts were 14-fold less susceptible to Hst 5 killing compared with the intact cells. Our in vivo binding experiments showed that whole fungal cells have ∼106 saturable binding sites/cell with an affinity (K d) for Hst 5 of ∼1 × 10–6m (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We identified a single component from whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE, of ∼67 kDa in C. albicans and 67–70 kDa in S. cerevisiae, that was responsible for binding Hst 5 (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon cellular fractionation of yeast whole cell lysates, this Hst 5-binding protein was consistently found in yeast cell envelope fractions, but, unexpectedly, was also detected in the cytosolic fraction. This 70-kDa Hst 5-binding protein was detected only in Hst 5-sensitive C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, but not in human neutrophil membranes or human embryonic kidney epithelial cells. Thus, the selective toxicity of Hst 5 to eukaryotic fungal cells rather than host mammalian cells may be due to specific interactions between Hst 5 and this 70-kDa binding protein. In this regard, cell wall receptor-mediated binding and import of toxic proteins have been identified as a selective mechanism for the S. cerevisiae yeast K1 killer toxin system (11Breinig F. Tipper D.J. Schmitt M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hst 5 binding is followed by internalization and ultimately causes increased levels of reactive oxygen species, depletion of intracellular ATP, total cell volume reduction, and cell cycle arrest (12Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C. Veerman E.C. Amerongen A.V. Abee T. J. Biol.

Intracellular expression of Hst 5 alone results in substantial cell death, suggesting intracellular effector sites (15Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, Hst 5 binding with cell-surface proteins is precedent to its translocation to other cellular effector sites. Hst 5 binding and translocation within C. albicans cells are closely related and are temperature- and energy-dependent processes. The binding, cellular uptake, and fungicidal activity of Hst 5 were enhanced when cells were preincubated at 37 °C, whereas these processes were reduced when cells were maintained at 0–4 °C (9Xu Y. Ambudkar I. Yamagishi H. Swaim W. Walsh T.J. O'Connell B.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2256-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gyurko C. Lendenmann U. Helmerhost E.J. Troxler R.F. Oppenheim F.G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2001; 79: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of C. albicans cells with sodium azide reduced internalization of Hst 5 (12Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C. Veerman E.C. Amerongen A.V. Abee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7286-7291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and provided substantial protection against Hst 5 killing (10Koshlukova S.E. Lloyd T.L. Araujo M.W. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18872-18879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, Hst 5 binding, translocation, and toxicity are closely tied processes and are optimal under conditions in which cells are transferred to higher temperatures (37 °C) and have ample intracellular ATP. To isolate the Hst 5-binding protein, we used sequential column chromatography of whole cell lysates of C. albicans, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and identified this protein as the heat shock protein Ssa1/2p. Here, we report the in vivo functional characterization of Ssa1p by co-localization of Hst 5-binding protein with Ssa protein, the positive interaction between these two proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis, and the correlation of the binding and fungicidal activities of Hst 5 in isogenic SSA1 and/or SSA2 deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae. Consistently, we found that the SSA1 and SSA2 genes were required for binding and fungicidal activities of Hst 5. Strains and Materials—The C. albicans strains used were SC5314 and DS1 (a clinical isolate) (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Dr. E. A. Craig (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) generously provided the following S. cerevisiae isogenic SSA mutant strains with the indicated genotypes: JH27A (wild-type SSA, GAL2 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 lys2 Δtrp1 ura3-52), JN114 (Δssa1, ssa1::HIS3), JN115 (Δssa2, ssa2::LEU2), and MW123 (Δssa1ssa2, ssa1::HIS3, ssa2::LEU2) (17Nelson R.J. Heschl M.F. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All strains were maintained on YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) agar plates and recultured monthly from–70 °C stock. YPD agar and media were from Difco. Na125I was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Isolation and Purification of Hst 5-binding Proteins—The histatin-binding protein (HstBP) was isolated and purified from large-scale whole cell lysates of C. albicans. C. albicans cells (∼20–25 g) were washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 15 ml of cold lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and nonionic detergent (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2.5% Triton X-100). Cells lysates were prepared in a 50-ml Bead Beater Chamber (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) with 15 ml of prechilled 0.5-mm glass beads by vortexing for five 1-min bursts at 4 °C. The efficiency of cell lysis was monitored by microscopic observation. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the clear supernatant was collected and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column (1.6 × 95 cm, fine) that was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Fractions (1.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots (200 μl) were removed and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western transfer to monitor for HstBP-positive fractions by overlay assay as previously described (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HstBP-positive fractions (fractions 21–26) were pooled and fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.0 × 15 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The column was eluted with 0.25 m phosphate buffer (25 ml), followed by a linear elution gradient (0.25–0.5 m) of phosphate buffer over 50 ml. Fractions (1.2 ml) were collected, and aliquots were monitored for HstBP by overlay assay as described above. Two fractions (fractions 17 and 18) that eluted midway in the gradient were highly enriched for HstBP. Overlay assays showed that the HstBP-positive band was separated from other minor proteins in the fraction and permitted clear excision (see Fig. 1, lane 2). This 70-kDa HstBP-positive band was excised and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the peptides were subjected to MALDI-MS analysis at the Yale Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource and the HHMI Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Identified peptide masses were data base-searched using the ProFound algorithm, which relies upon the NCBI non-redundant data base, and the PeptideSearch algorithm, which is based on the EBI non-redundant data base. 2Available at info.med.yale.edu/wmkeck. Both searches matched the same protein, the heat shock protein Ssa1p in C. albicans with a top score of 1.0e + 00. Cellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Localization of Ssa proteins in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae isogenic SSA mutant strains was examined by three sequential cellular fractionation steps consisting of 1) β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) cell wall extraction, 2) glucanidase cell wall extraction, and 3) cytosolic fractionation using published protocols (18Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lopez-Ribot J.L. Chaffin W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4724-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and β-ME-sensitive cell wall components were released by incubation of the cell suspension in ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% (v/v) β-ME for 30 min at 37 °C. The supernatant containing the β-ME cell wall extract was collected following centrifugation at 500 × g. The β-ME-treated cells were then washed with 1 m sorbitol and resuspended in spheroplast buffer (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.8), 25 mm EDTA, and 100 μl β-glucanidase) for 40–60 min at 30 °C until 90% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts. Cells were gently centrifuged at 500 × g, and cell wall material released from the β-glucanidase treatment was collected in the supernatant. The cell pellet containing spheroplasts was lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer using glass bead disruption as described above, and the cytosolic fraction was collected following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The cell wall extracts (β-ME- and glucanidase-extracted components) and cytosolic fractions were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed following Western transfer. Ssa proteins were detected using mouse anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen Biotech Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) as the secondary antibody. To verify that the detected Ssa proteins were identical to HstBP, blots probed with anti-HSP70 antibody were probed in parallel with biotinylated Hst 5 (20Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Araujo M.W. Patel R.C. Dong J. Bruenn J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3310-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Western blots of C. albicans cellular fractions were blocked by incubation with 1% skim milk for 2 h, and biotinylated Hst 5 (250 nm) was then added as the primary probe. Protein with bound biotinylated Hst 5 was visualized by colorimetric development following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) for 1 h. The presence of HSP70 proteins in the cell wall of S. cerevisiae wild-type SSA or Δssa1ssa2 strains following room temperature or heat shock incubation was detected in β-ME cell wall extracts as described above. For heat shock conditions, cells maintained at room temperature were transferred to prewarmed (37 °C) buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min before cell wall extraction. Equal amounts of total cell wall proteins (15 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-HSP70 antibody as described above. Construction of a Yeast Two-hybrid System—Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used as a host for construction and maintenance of the plasmids used in this study and was cultivated in LB medium (Difco). Ampicillin was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The DupLEX-A™ yeast two-hybrid system kit was from OriGene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). Standard conditions for plasmid DNA isolation, molecular cloning, transformation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were used (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and the GeneRuler 100-bp DNA Ladder Plus marker were from Fermentas Inc. (Hanover, MD). The Fast-Link™ DNA ligation kit was from Epicentre Technologies Corp. (Madison, WI). Purification of restriction digests and PCR mixtures was done using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). SC5314 genomic DNA was isolated using a PUREGENE d-6000A DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and was used as template for amplification of the SSA1 open reading frame. Plasmid Construction—The open reading frame of the C. albicans SSA1 gene was amplified using the forward (f) primer nSSA1-f (5′-ATCccatggATGTCTAAAGCTGTTGGTATTGA-3′) and the reverse (r) primer xSSA1-r (5′-ATCctcgagATCAACTTCTTCAACAGTTGGTC-3′) as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by three-step cycling of 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 57 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C and a 5-min final extension at 72 °C. The sequences encoding Hst 3 and Hst 5 were amplified using plasmid pCMVH3 (22O' Connell B.C. Xu T. Walsh T.J. Sein T. Mastrangeli A. Crystal R.G. Oppenheim F.G. Baum B.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2255-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as template employing the following primers: for Hst 3, nHIS3/5-f (5′-ATCccatggGATTCACATGCAAAGAGACATC-3′) and xHIS3-r (5′-ATCctcgagATTGTCATACAGATAATTTGATCTA-3′); and for Hst 5, nHIS3/5-f and xHIS5-r (ATCctcgagATAGCCTCGATGTGAATGATGC-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by three-step cycling of 15-s denaturation at 94 °C, 15-s annealing at 57 °C, and 30-s extension at 72 °C and a 2-min final extension at 72 °C. The NcoI (forward primers) and XhoI (reverse primers) restriction sites introduced for in-frame cloning purposes into the bait and target plasmids are shown in lowercase in the above sequences. Thus amplified, the coding sequences were cloned as NcoI-XhoI restriction fragments into plasmid pEG202 to yield the LexA-bait fusion plasmids pB-SSA1 (LexA-Ssa1), pB-HIS3 (LexA-Hst 3), and pB-HIS5 (LexA-Hst 5), respectively. Likewise, the same fragments were cloned into the target plasmid pJG4-5, in which the unique EcoRI cloning site had been converted to an NcoI site since the C. albicans SSA1 open reading frame contains two EcoRI sites. The resulting fusion plasmids were designated pT-SSA1, pT-HIS3, and pT-HIS5, respectively. All constructs were verified for in-frame cloning by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid System Analysis—The yeast host strain EGY48 was first transformed with plasmids harboring the bait fusion genes and the reporter plasmid pSH18-34. All baits were assayed for autoinduction and nuclear localization. The plasmids containing the target fusion genes were then transformed into the strains that already contained the bait and reporter plasmids. Activation of the lacZ reporter gene was quantified by performing liquid culture β-galactosidase assays (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The resulting values are expressed as (A 420 nm/culture A 600 nm × (volume of culture) × (assay time in min)) × 1000 and were calculated from triplicate assays for five independent clones performed on four independent measurements for each bait-target combination. Iodination of His 5 and Binding Assays—Hst 5 was iodinated using the chloramine-T method, following which Hst 5 retains full biological activity and binding specificity (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed using wild-type and mutant SSA strains of S. cerevisiae grown under the same conditions as used for the fungicidal assays. The cells were washed and suspended at a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml in binding buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Cell suspensions (25 μl, ∼106 cells) were incubated with 125I-Hst 5 for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with binding buffer, and cellular bound ligand was measured in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated as total 125I-Hst 5 bound minus nonspecific bound, where nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Hst 5. Cells were assayed for each experimental point in triplicate. Data were fitted to a single binding site equation to obtain binding curves and K d values using Prism Version 3.03 software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Binding of 125I-Hst 5 (6 μm) with S. cerevisiae wild-type SSA or Δssa1ssa2 mutant strains was examined using cells incubated at room temperature or following heat shock as described for fungicidal assays below. Differences in binding between cells following heat shock were calculated as the -fold change of bound 125I-Hst 5 relative to the binding activity of wild-type SSA at room temperature in three independent experiments. Unpaired Student's t test was used to compare sets of data. Fungicidal Assays—The antifungal activities of Hst 5 with SSA mutants were examined by microdilution plate assays as described previously (7Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. S. cerevisiae SSA strains (wild-type SSA, Δssa1, Δssa2, and Δssa1ssa2) were inoculated into 10 ml of YPD medium and grown overnight at 23 °C with rotary agitation until the cell density reached ∼1.4–1.6 at 600 nm. Cells were washed twice with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and resuspended at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (20 μl) were mixed with 20 μlofHst 5 and incubated at room temperature (23 °C) with constant shaking for 1.5 h. For heat shock conditions, cells maintained at room temperature were transferred to prewarmed (37 °C) buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before addition of Hst 5. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for another 1.5 h with Hst 5. Hst 5 was diluted (and the reaction stopped) by addition of 360 μl of 10 mm phosphate buffer. Cells were spread onto YPD agar plates and incubated for 36–48 h until colonies could be visualized. Percent cell killing was calculated as (1–(number of colonies from suspensions with Hst 5/number of colonies from control suspensions)) × 100. C. albicans HstBP Identified as the Heat Shock Protein Ssa1p—To identify the 70-kDa cell envelope Hst 5-binding protein, we developed a purification protocol using large-scale whole cell lysates of C. albicans and sequential column chromatography on Sephadex G-200, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion-exchange fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Eluant fractions positive for Hst 5-binding activity were determined by overlay assay using biotinylated Hst 5 as a primary probe. Purified Hst 5-binding protein was eluted from the midpoint of a 0.25–0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer linear elution gradient of a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion-exchange column. This fraction contained primarily a 67–70-kDa protein band as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 2), which strongly bound Hst 5 in overlay assays (lane 3). This Hst 5-binding protein was excised and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the fragments were analyzed by MALDI-MS. The peptide masses were data base-searched and identified as Ssa1p in C. albicans with the top score of 1.0e + 00. The predicted size of this protein is 70.31 kDa, a close match with the estimated size of the Hst 5-binding protein found in both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Sequence Alignment of the SSA Family in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae—S. cerevisiae contains four SSA genes (SSA1–4), whereas only two SSA family members (SSA1 and SSA2) have been identified in C. albicans by screening a cDNA expression library (18Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24La Valle R. Bromuro C. Ranucci L. Muller H.M. Crisanti A. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deduced amino acid sequence of C. albicans SSA2 from the cDNA clones showed only partial sequence information (193 amino acids) at the C terminus (24La Valle R. Bromuro C. Ranucci L. Muller H.M. Crisanti A. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain full sequences of both Ssa1p and Ssa2p in C. albicans and to identify homologies among these proteins in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, a BLAST similarity search (tBlastn) against the C. albicans genome data base 3Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/genom_table_cgi?organism=euk. was done using the S. cerevisiae Ssa1p sequence as query (Swiss-Prot accession number P10591). The results revealed two homologous genome sequences in C. albicans identified as contig 6–2136 and contig 6–2375. A tBlastn search using the S. cerevisiae Ssa2p sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P10592) as query showed the same results. However, the tBlastn search using S. cerevisiae Ssa3p and Ssa4p sequences as query (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P09435 and P22202, respectively) did not find out other homologous Ssa protein members in C. albicans, thus confirming that C. albicans contains only Ssa1p and Ssa2p. Additional analyses using DNA-protein translation tools 4Available at us.expasy.org/tools/#translate. identified the 5′-3′ frame 2 to contain the correct whole coding sequences for SSA1 and SSA2. Protein similarity search using the SIM alignment tool 5Available at us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sim.pl?prot. between the deduced amino acid sequences and the published amino acid sequences (18Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24La Valle R. Bromuro C. Ranucci L. Muller H.M. Crisanti A. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that the translated sequence from contig 6–2136 represents C. albicans SSA1 and that the translated sequence from contig 6–2375 represent C. albicans SSA2.

Elevated levels of HIF-1α induce expression of genes with critical roles in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism, processes that are essential for tumor expansion. Here we examine the involvement of FOXO4 (also known as AFX), a member of the forkhead transcription factor superfamily that is negatively regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, in the regulation of HIF-1α protein expression. Nuclear expression of FOXO4 results in the suppression of various responses to hypoxia, including decreased vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin expression. Interestingly, FOXO4 down-regulates the HIF-1α protein levels, consistent with the lack of hypoxia responsiveness. Previous results have revealed a role for prolyl hydroxylation and resultant von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) interactions in the ubiquitinproteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1α. However, neither inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases nor mutation of HIF-1α-hydroxylated prolines involved with pVHL-mediated binding inhibits the observed FOXO4-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1α. These results suggest a novel alternate mechanism for hypoxic regulation that is dependent upon the level of activation of FOXO4-mediated transcription.

Phosphorylation of these transcription factors results in nuclear export and cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins as well as other factors. Lack of nuclear localization of FOXO4-type forkhead family members is highly beneficial to the proliferative and survival states of the cell, because expression programs induced by this category of transcription factors include the expression of proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis (8Nakamura N.

Thus, inhibition of FOXO4-type transcription factor nuclear localization and the subsequent lack of expression of a variety of proteins involved in cellular quiescence and death constitute a major end point for the activated PI3K pathway. This fact is highlighted by examination of a range of late-stage tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, where this kinase cascade is hyperactivated by the mutational loss of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that is the major negative regulator of this pathway (18Li D.M.

The activation of this pathway in these tumors results in a high degree of resistance to many cytotoxic agents, including radiation and chemotherapy. It is, therefore, likely that examination of the diversity of functions regulated by this pathway may result in enhanced treatments for the many tumors that benefit from PI3K activation. In addition to intracellular survival mechanisms such as the PI3K pathway, rapidly proliferating cells in embryonic and oncogenically transformed tissues require an increased blood supply to maintain a normal nutritive and oxygenated state. This is accomplished by the induction of angiogenic and hematopoietic factors, including VEGF and EPO. When the cell is exposed to reduced oxygen levels or hypoxia as a result of tissue expansion or tumor growth, a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) becomes stabilized and activates the expression of VEGF, EPO, GLUT-1, and others that are involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism (23Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). HIF-1 consists of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and the steady-state quantity of the α subunit is tightly controlled by degradative processes in response to changing oxygen concentrations. The molecular mechanisms that link oxygen and HIF-1α levels have recently been elucidated (24Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 25Semenza G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The importance of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex, in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIF-1α has been demonstrated, and a diversity of tumors, particularly renal carcinomas, shows loss of function of VHL and greatly enhanced angiogenesis (26Salceda S.

The VHL protein (pVHL) interacts with these hydroxylated proline residues and induces the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1α. These elegant regulatory mechanisms thus ensure that appropriate levels of cellular angiogenic responses are maintained under varying oxygen concentrations. Because both the PI3K and the hypoxic response pathways are regulated by the sensing of extracellular nutrient or oxygen levels, respectively, it seems likely that these two pathways may be connected. Previous data revealed a clear linkage between the level of activation of the PI3K pathway and hypoxia response as well as the steady-state quantities of HIF-1α (41Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K.

Inhibition of the PI3K pathway was accompanied by a clear decrease in HIF-1α protein levels and inhibition of VEGF induction. Here we demonstrate that the PI3K-regulated transcription factor FOXO4 can suppress cellular response to hypoxia at least in part by down-regulation of the steady-state levels of the HIF-1α protein. Analysis of the mechanism of this down-regulation revealed that, although mediated by the proteasome pathway, it appears to be independent of pVHL-induced ubiquitination. Our data provide not only a molecular explanation for the regulation of the angiogenic response by the PI3K pathway but also the first evidence for the involvement of forkhead transcription factor FOXO4 in the regulation of hypoxia response, suggesting alternate means to control the levels of HIF-1α and resultant angiogenesis. DNA Constructs—The full-length wild-type HIF-1α gene was PCR-amplified from human brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) and subcloned into pCDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to create an HIF-1α.V5 expression plasmid (pCDNA3.1.HIF-1α.V5). The pEGFP.N3.TM-FOXO4 (also known as pEGFP.N3.TM-AFX) DNA construct used in the transient transfection experiment and luciferase assays has been previously described (9Tang T.T. Dowbenko D. Jackson A. Toney L. Lewin D.A. Dent A.L. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14255-14265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The VEGF and EPO promoter constructs (pGL3p.VEGF and pGL3p.EPO) were made by amplifying the promoter fragments from human genomic DNA (Clontech) and inserting them upstream of the SV40 promoter in the luciferase pGL3.promoter vector (Promega). The primers for amplifying the 948-bp (–1042 to –95) VEGF promoter fragment were 5′-CGA CGC GTC AGC AGG AAC AAG GGC CTC TGT CTG CCC-3′ and 5′-CCG CTC GAG GAC AGG CGA GCC TCA GCC CCT CCA C-3′, and those used for amplifying the 327-bp portion of the EPO promoter were 5′-GCT AGC GAT GCC CCC CAG GGG AGG TGT CC-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG GGT GGC CCA GGG ACT CTG CGG C-3′. To generate the HIF-1α.P402A/P564G.V5 expression plasmid, proline residues 402 and 564 were mutated to alanine and glycine, respectively, by a two-step PCR procedure. Cell Cultures and Stable Cell Lines—The HeLa Tet-on-inducible FOXO4 stable cell line, designated 15-14, was previously reported (9Tang T.T. Dowbenko D. Jackson A. Toney L. Lewin D.A. Dent A.L.

The HeLa Tet-on cells were cultured in the same medium without hygromycin B. The renal carcinoma cell lines, RCC4-vector and RCC4-VHL-HA, previously described (28Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and G418 (1 mg/ml) for selection. TaqMan™ Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), treated with DNase I (Amplification Grade, Invitrogen), and used at 100 ng per reaction. All the samples were performed in triplicates in each TaqMan™ experiment, and the mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. Luciferase Assays—293E cells were plated in 24-well plates at subconfluent density and transiently transfected with 160 ng/well pEGFP.N3 or pEGFP.N3.TM-FOXO4, 36 ng/well pGL3p.VEGF or pGL3p.EPO promoter construct, and 4 ng/well pRLTK vector (Promega), using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). When 16 ng/well pEGFP.N3.TM-FOXO4 was transfected, empty vector was added to equalize the final DNA contents. 9 h after transfection cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm deferoxamine mesylate (DFO; Sigma) for 16 h and then assayed for luciferase activities, which were measured by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacture's protocol. The inducible firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the constitutive Renilla luciferase activity. Western Blotting Analysis—For all HIF-1α down-regulation time course experiments, HeLa Tet-on or Tet-on-inducible FOXO4 stable cells (15-14) were transfected first with pCDNA3.1.HIF-1α.V5 or pCDNA3.1.HIF-1α.P402A/P564G.V5 (2 μg/10-cm dish), using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), and then 8–9 h after transfection incubated in 2% oxygen or with deferoxamine mesylate (DFO, 100 μm, Sigma) to allow for the accumulation of the HIF-1α protein overnight. On the following day, the cells were treated with or without doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX, 2 μg/ml, Clontech) in 2% oxygen or in the presence of fresh 100 μm DFO to initiate the time course. When needed, zVAD-fmk (25 μm, Calbiochem), clastolactacystin β-lactone (20 μm, BIOMOL), MG-132 (20 μm, BIOMOL), or Me2SO was included. At the indicated times, both floating and adherent cells were harvested, and whole-cell extracts were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide-SDS gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Proteins were detected using antibodies directed against HIF-1α (1:250 dilution, Transduction Laboratories or H1α67, 1:250 dilution, Novus), V5 epitope tag (1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen), FLAG epitope tag (M5, 1:250 dilution, Sigma), β-tubulin (1:1000 dilution, BD Pharmingen), phosphorylated AKT (Phospho-AKT (Thr-308), 1:1000 dilution, and Phospho-AKT (Ser-473), 1:1000 dilution, both from Cell Signaling Technology), AKT (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), and pVHL (1:250 dilution, BD Pharmingen). The PI3K Signaling Pathway Regulates HIF-1α Levels in HeLa Cells—Studies in glioblastoma, prostate, and breast cancer cell lines have shown that activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway results in increased expression of the HIF-1α protein and consequent up-regulation of the VEGF gene transcription (41Laughner E.

Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT activity by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, as well as by overexpression of the phospholipid phosphatase PTEN, demonstrated a requirement for activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the increase of the HIF-1α protein levels. To determine whether the PI3K/AKT activity is also necessary in HeLa cells for the induction of HIF-1α-regulated genes under hypoxic condition, we treated the cells with LY294002 for 24 h in the presence or absence of a hypoxic mimic, deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), and analyzed the relative levels of VEGF mRNA by TaqMan™-quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A). DFO highly activated the expression of VEGF transcripts (∼6-fold, purple bars), and this increase was significantly inhibited by the addition of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (blue bars). The reduction in VEGF transcript levels by LY294002 was clearly associated with a decrease in the level of HIF-1α protein expression (Fig. 1B). HeLa cells transfected with a HIF-1α expression plasmid showed a decreased HIF-1α protein level in the presence of LY294002. This decline was observed even in the presence of DFO, which normally stabilizes the HIF-1α protein. Thus, the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT activity by LY294002 blocked DFO-induced up-regulation of the HIF-1α protein level. In the absence of DFO, the expression of HIF-1α was almost undetectable, and to see the change in the normoxic HIF-1α protein levels, the Western blot was subjected to longer exposure (indicated by “long”). Thus, PI3K/AKT activity is required in HeLa cells to induce the expression of the HIF-1α protein and allow for increased VEGF transcript levels in response to hypoxia. Similar results were observed when BJAB cells were treated with LY294002 for 24 h (Fig. 1A, data not shown). Nuclear FOXO4 Regulates HIF-1α Protein Levels—Because the forkhead transcription factor FOXO4 is one of the downstream targets of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, we examined if FOXO4 was involved in the regulation of the HIF-1α protein expression. To test this possibility, we used our previously reported HeLa Tet-on stable cell line, designated 15-14, which could be induced by doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) to produce a constitutively active form of FOXO4 (9Tang T.T. Dowbenko D. Jackson A. Toney L. Lewin D.A. Dent A.L. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14255-14265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All three of the AKT phosphorylation sites in this FOXO4 protein were mutated to alanines, allowing it to escape the phosphorylationinduced cytoplasmic sequestration by AKT and localize exclusively in the nucleus. This FOXO4 also contained a FLAG epitope tag at its amino terminus and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its carboxyl terminus. LY294002 treatment indicated that this inducible FOXO4 stable cell line 15-14 also required PI3K/AKT activity for hypoxia-induced increase in VEGF transcript levels (Fig. 1A). Nearly 8-fold up-regulation was seen in 15-14 cells when incubated with DFO, and addition of LY294002 suppressed not only up-regulation by DFO but also the basal level of VEGF transcript. Strikingly, induction of FOXO4 in 15-14 by DOX resulted in a dramatic down-regulation of the HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 2A). This down-regulation occurred even in the presence of DFO, indicating that the stabilizing effect of DFO on the HIF-1α protein could be overridden by FOXO4. In the absence of DOX, FOXO4 expression was not induced, and the levels of the transfected HIF-1α-V5 fusion protein remained relatively constant as long as DFO was present. The down-regulation of the HIF-1α protein was not caused by DOX treatment, because the parental HeLa Tet-on cells, which did not express the mutant FOXO4 protein, did not exhibit down-regulation of the HIF-1α protein when treated with DOX (Fig. 2B). Transient transfection of the triple mutant FOXO4-GFP fusion protein (TM-FOXO4) into HeLa cells revealed a similar effect of FOXO4 on the expression of the HIF-1α protein (Fig. 2C). Cells transfected with a plasmid that expressed the mutant FOXO4-GFP protein showed much lower production of the co-transfected HIF-1α protein than cells transfected with a control GFP expression plasmid in both the presence and absence of the DFO. Expression of nuclear FOXO4 also induced the down-regulation of the HIF-1α protein under true hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, in accordance with previous reports (reviewed in Ref. 24Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), we observed that hypoxia significantly induced the expression of HIF-1α in HeLa Tet-on cells; this up-regulation was unaffected by DOX treatment (Fig. 2E). However, when expression of nuclear FOXO4 was induced by DOX in 15-14 cells the hypoxiainduced up-regulation of HIF-1α protein level was completely inhibited (compare the change in HIF-1α levels between lanes 7 and 5 to that between lanes 8 and 5). Importantly, although PI3K/AKT activity increases the expression of the HIF-1α protein, the FOXO4 transcription factor, being negatively regulated by AKT, induces the down-regulation of the HIF-1α protein. Because no change in the HIF-1α transcript levels was observed in the mutant FOXO4-inducible 15-14 cells when treated with DOX, it is clear that nuclear FOXO4 does not modulate the transcription of the HIF-1α gene (data not shown). The most likely conclusion from these studies is that FOXO4 initiates a transcriptional program that regulates either the stability or the rate of synthesis of the HIF-1α protein. Nuclear FOXO4 Inhibits the Induction of Hypoxia Response Genes—Because FOXO4 negatively regulates HIF-1α protein expression, we examined its effect on cellular response to hypoxia. Like the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, FOXO4 strongly suppressed the DFO-induced up-regulation of HIF-1α-modulated genes (Fig. 3A). In the absence of DOX, exposure to DFO resulted in a significant increase of the endogenous VEGF and GLUT-1 transcript levels in both 15-14 and parental HeLa Tet-on cell lines (purple bars). In the presence of DOX, approximately equal amounts of VEGF and GLUT-1 transcripts were still induced by DFO in HeLa Tet-on cells (blue bars in right graph). However, when the expression of nuclear FOXO4 was activated by DOX in 15-14 cells, DFO elicited only ∼13 and ∼5% VEGF and GLUT-1 transcript levels, respectively (blue bars in left graph). We next determined whether the FOXO4-induced decrease in transcript levels of the HIF-1α-regulated genes occurred at the level of transcription. Because FOXO4 inhibited the accumulation of the HIF-1α protein even in the presence of DFO, we would expect it to prevent the DFO-induced transcriptional activation of the VEGF and EPO promoters. As Fig. 3 (B and C) demonstrates, co-transfection of 160 ng of a control GFP expression plasmid allowed for ∼2-fold activation of VEGF and EPO promoters in response to DFO treatment. Approximately 50% of this activation was inhibited with only 16 ng of the TM-FOXO4 expression plasmid. Co-transfection of 160 ng of TM-FOXO4 expression plasm"

Although a large number of proteins have been implicated in this process, it is clear that our current understanding is far from complete. Here we describe the functional characterization of a new 18-kDa protein (ERp18) related to protein-disulfide isomerase. We show that ERp18 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and that it contains a single catalytic domain with an unusual CGAC active site motif and a probable insertion between β3 and α3 of the thioredoxin fold. From circular dichroism and NMR measurements, ERp18 is well structured and undergoes only a minor conformational change upon dithioldisulfide exchange in the active site. Guanidinium chloride denaturation curves indicate that the reduced form of the protein is more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that it is involved in disulfide bond formation. Furthermore, in vitro ERp18 possesses significant peptide thiol-disulfide oxidase activity, which is dependent on the presence of both active site cysteine residues. This activity differs from that of the human PDI family in that under standard assay conditions it is limited by substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation. A putative physiological role for Erp18 in native disulfide bond formation is discussed.

This activity differs from that of the human PDI family in that under standard assay conditions it is limited by substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation. A putative physiological role for Erp18 in native disulfide bond formation is discussed. Disulfide bonds are covalent linkages formed between two cysteine residues in proteins, whose primary function is to stabilize the folded structure of the protein. A large number of secreted proteins, including many high value proteins targeted by the biotechnology industry, contain disulfide bonds. Since any two cysteine residues in a protein have the potential to form a disulfide bond, the correct formation of native disulfide bonds is not trivial. Hence, it is not surprising that native disulfide bond formation is often the rate-limiting step in the folding of proteins in vitro and in vivo (1Freedman R.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The process of native disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. is known to be catalyzed by several families of enzymes (3Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). However, whereas many of the participants in the cellular process are known, their individual roles are still largely confused. Furthermore, it is likely that not all of the participants in the process have yet been identified. This situation not only inhibits our understanding of the biogenesis of a range of important proteins but also prevents the effective manipulation of the cellular environment by the biotechnology industry for the efficient production of therapeutic proteins. Native disulfide bond formation usually occurs via multiple parallel pathways (see Ref. 4Goldenberg D.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar as an example). Each step in these pathways can be considered to be an oxidation or isomerization reaction. Oxidative reactions result in the formation of a disulfide bond from two free thiols. Isomerization reactions do not alter the overall number of disulfides, but they result in a rearrangement in their position within the substrate protein. Isomerization reactions are required due to the formation of non-native disulfide bonds in the substrate protein and may either occur directly or via a linked reduction-oxidation cycle. It is unclear to what extent, if any, reduction reactions (i.e. the formation of two free thiols from a disulfide) play a role in the formation of native disulfide bonds under physiological conditions. In vitro the rate-limiting step for native disulfide bond formation in proteins that contain multiple disulfides is late stage isomerization reactions, where disulfide bond formation is linked to conformational changes in protein substrates with substantial regular secondary structure (4Goldenberg D.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Creighton T.E. Zapun A. Darby N.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13636-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The first reported catalyst of protein folding, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), is involved in native disulfide bond formation in the ER (7Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas PDI is an excellent catalyst of isomerization reactions, it is a relatively poor catalyst of oxidative processes in vitro. Furthermore, the participation of PDI in disulfide bond formation requires the presence of a system for reoxidizing PDI. For many years, it was presumed that the primary reoxidant in the ER was oxidized glutathione. However, it has become clear that there are parallel pathways for providing the oxidizing equivalents required for native disulfide bond formation. ERo1 (8Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) from yeast and higher eukaryotes has been shown to provide oxidizing equivalents to this process either via oxidation of glutathione (10Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or via direct oxidation of protein thiols, including reoxidizing PDI in vivo (11Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and in vitro (12Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Recently, a parallel oxidizing pathway has been reported based on flavin-dependent sulfydryl oxidases (13Suh J.K. Poulsen L.L. Ziegler D.M. Robertus J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2687-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Sevier C.S. Cuozzo J.W. Vala A. Aslund F. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whereas the gene products of ERO1 and PDI1 are essential for viability in yeast (8Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 15Farquhar R. Honey N. Murant S.J. Bosier P. Schultz L. Montgomery D. Ellis R.W. Freedman R.B. Tuite M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and those of the other components including the glutathione biosynthetic pathway are not, it is still unclear to what extent the three possible oxidative pathways contribute to native disulfide bond formation under physiologically normal conditions. A further complicating factor in understanding the physiological process of native disulfide bond formation is the presence of a family of proteins related to PDI. In S. cerevisiae, there are five proteins that are related to PDI (Pdi1p, Eug1p, Mpd1p, Mpd2p, and Eps1p) (see Refs. 16Norgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsoe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and 17Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar for characterization). Whereas of these five proteins only Pdi1p can be considered to be an efficient catalyst of disulfide bond isomerization, it is clear that in higher eukaryotes this is not the case. Instead, a range of PDI homologues have been found, including ERp72, ERp57, P5, PDIp, and PDIr (see Refs. 18Ferrari D.M. Söling H-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar and 19Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, there are two PDI-related proteins that are not isomerases, ERp44 (20Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and ERp28/Erp29 (21Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Soling H.D. Eur. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17009-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the function of both of which is currently unresolved. Here we report a new addition to the ER-located PDI-related family of proteins, which we call ERp18. ERp18 contains a single catalytic domain with an unusual CGAC active site motif and a probable insertion between β3 and α3 of the thioredoxin fold. Although it is listed in several data bases as a thioredoxin-like protein, the reduced form of the protein is more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that it is involved in disulfide bond formation and not reduction. Furthermore, in vitro ERp18 possesses significant peptide thiol-disulfide oxidase activity. A putative physiological role for Erp18 in native disulfide bond formation is discussed. Generation of Expression Vectors—Plasmids encoding for full-length and mature (Ser24–Leu172) human ERp18 were generated by PCR from a liver cDNA library (Clontech) using primers that included an in frame NdeI site 5′ to the first codon of the gene and a SalI site after a TAA stop codon at the 3′-end. The inserts were cloned into pLWRP51 (23Alanen, H. I., Salo, K. E. H., Pekkala, M., Siekkinen, H. M., Pirneskoski, A., and Ruddock, L. W. (2003) Antioxid. Redox Signal., in pressGoogle Scholar), a modified version of pET23b (Novagen), which encodes for a N-terminal His tag (MHHHHHHM) prior to the first amino acid of the protein sequence. The vector encoding mature human ERp18 (pHIA128) was used as the template to PCR-amplify gene fragments encoding C-terminal truncations (Ser24–Gln146, Ser24–Gly150, Ser24–Arg157, and Ser24–Leu168), which were also cloned into NdeI/SalI-digested pLWRP51. The vector encoding full-length human ERp18 (pHIA131) was used to PCR-amplify ERp18 without a stop codon, which was cloned in frame into BglII/PinAI-digested p-EGFPN1, generating a ERp18-GFP chimera with a GPVAT linker. Since ERp18 contains a putative C-terminal ER retention signal, pHIA131 was also used to clone residues Met1-Leu168 into pHIA135 (a modified version of p-EGFPN1 in which synthetic oligonucleotides had been used to add Leu168–Leu172 of ERp18 in frame C-terminally with GFP). The resulting plasmid encoded ERp18 (Met1–Leu168)-GPVAT linker-GFP-ERp18 (Leu168–Leu172). A plasmid encoding for full-length Escherichia coli thioredoxin was generated by PCR using an XL1-blue E. coli colony as a template and primers that included an in frame NdeI site 5′ to the first codon of the gene and a BamHI site after a TAA stop codon at the 3′-end. The insert was cloned into pLWRP51, and the resulting gene product included the sequence MHHHHHHM- prior to the first amino acid of the domain sequence. All plasmids generated were sequenced to ensure that there were no errors in the cloned genes (see Table I for plasmid names).Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmid nameProtein producedpLWRP69WT PDI a-domain (Asp18—Ala156)pHIA98WT E. coli thioredoxin (Ser1—Ala108)pHIA131wt ERp18 (Met1—Leu172)pHIA128ERp18 (Ser24—Leu172)pHPJ1ERp18 (Ser24—Gly146)pHPJ2ERp18 (Ser24—Gly150)pSMR1ERp18 (Ser24—Arg157)pSMR4ERp18 (Ser24—Leu168)pHJP4ERp18 (Ser24—Leu172), C66SpSMR3ERp18 (Ser24—Leu172), C69SpHIA134ERp18 (Met1—Leu172) GFPpHIA136ERp18 (Met1—Leu168)-GFP-ERp18 (Leu168—Leu172) Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—Protein production was carried out in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. Strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and 200 rpm and induced at an A 600 of 0.3 for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (6,500 rpm for 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in one-tenth volume of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) and one-one thousandth volume of 10 mg/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing twice, and the cell debris were removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 20 min). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before being applied to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography column (chelating Sepharose fast flow; Amersham Biosciences), precharged with Ni2+ and equilibrated in buffer A. After loading, the column was washed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.3, and then in buffer A, before the His-tagged proteins were eluted using 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.3. The eluant was diluted 5× into buffer A and then applied to a Resource Q anion exchanger, from which the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from buffer A to buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl over 9 column volumes. Eluted fractions were checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fractions containing pure protein were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, using an Amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter device (10-kDa nominal molecular weight limit membrane filter). The concentration of the protein was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated absorption coefficient of 16,680 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. 15N-Labeled ERp18 was produced by growing the expressing strain in M9 medium using 15N-labeled NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotopes) with protein purification as described for unlabeled protein. To ensure full oxidation of the active site CXXC motif prior to NMR studies, 15N-labeled ERp18 was incubated with 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione for 15 min at room temperature, and then the glutathione was removed by buffer exchanging using an Amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter device (10-kDa nominal molecular weight limit membrane filter) into 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.5. The a-domain of human PDI was purified as per human ERp18 (calculated absorption coefficient of 19,720 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm). E. coli thioredoxin was purified as per human ERp18 except that elution from the chelating Sepharose column was with 25 mm EDTA, and the anion exchange column was run in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.6, instead of buffer A. Cell Transfections—COS-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown on 30-mm diameter Petri dishes with or without glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose medium supplemented with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells seeded 1 day earlier were transfected with the ERp18-GFP plasmid using 0.5–1 μg/plate and the Fugene6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as suggested by the manufacturer. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 20 min, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described earlier (24Kellokumpu S. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Kopito R. Baron R. Science. 1988; 242: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and the Golgi matrix protein, Gm130 (BD Biosciences, Lexington, KY) were used as the ER and Golgi markers, respectively, to allow localization of the expressed ERp18-GFP in transfected cells. Fixed and stained cells were examined using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) and photographed with a CCD camera. Biophysical Analysis—Far UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrophotometer. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of eight scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, scan speed 50 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 0.5 s. The maximal HT voltage was 750 V. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 spectrophotometer using a 1-ml cuvette. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of four scans, excitation at 280 nm, emission at 300–400 nm, slit widths of 5 nm, and scan speed of 200 nm/min. Fully oxidized and reduced proteins were generated immediately prior to use by preincubating the protein stock in 10 mm oxidized glutathione or 20 mm reduced glutathione for 15 min at room temperature. Protein stocks were diluted at least 200-fold into 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0–6 m guanidinium chloride and equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C before fluorescence spectra were recorded. All spectra were corrected for the blank spectra with no protein added. The fluorescence parameter examined to investigate the effects of guanidinium chloride on protein structure was the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity 2 nm to either side of the λmax for native protein (337 nm for oxidized ERp18; 336 nm for reduced ERp18; 340 nm for PDI a-domain) to the average fluorescence intensity over the range 320–400 nm. This parameter was chosen because it is independent of concentration and less dependent on the direct effects of guanidinium chloride on tryptophan fluorescence. NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer from samples of uniformly 15N-labeled ERp18 (0.3 mm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 10% (v/v) D2O. Reduced ERp18 was prepared by preincubating the oxidized protein with 3 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature. 1H/15N HSQC spectra were collected at 25 °C over 6 h with acquisition times of 148 ms in 1H and 71 ms in 15N and with water suppression using the WATERGATE sequence. Oxidase Assay—The method of Ruddock et al. (25Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using a fluorescent decapeptide was used to determine the oxidase activity of each of the purified human PDI family members. McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 3.0–7.5) to give a final assay volume of 1 ml was placed in a fluorescence cuvette. Except where noted, to this was added 10 μl of oxidized glutathione (50 mm stock solution in buffer A), 20 μl of reduced glutathione (100 mm stock solution in buffer A), and 5–10 μl of enzyme. After mixing, the cuvette was placed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 spectrophotometer for 5 min to allow thermal equilibration of the solution. 6.3 μl of substrate peptide (539 μm in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added and mixed, and the change in fluorescence intensity (excitation at 280 nm, emission at 350 nm, slit widths at 5 nm) was monitored over an appropriate time (usually 15 min) with 600–1800 data points being collected. In the absence of substrate or in the absence of oxidized glutathione, no significant change in fluorescence occurred (e.g. for ERp18 alone, the change in fluorescence over 30 min was only 0.65%, which probably represents photobleaching). Identification of a Novel Thioredoxin Superfamily Member—A data base search for novel human PDI family members identified a previously uncharacterized open reading frame (NP_056997.1; Q96H50; ENSG00000117862). The gene is located at bp 51374826–51410866 on chromosome 1 and has seven exons. The mature form (see below) of the predicted protein has a molecular mass of 17.8 kDa and is expected to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (see below), and accordingly we have named it ERp18. Serial analysis of gene expression (26Lash A.E. Tolstoshev C.M. Wagner L. Schuler G.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Altschul S.F. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) indicates that ERp18 is widely expressed in humans including in the kidney, brain, prostate, lung, liver, heart, spinal cord, mammary gland, ovary, colon, and vascular epithelium. Unigene (J. U. Pontius, L. Wagner, and G. D. Schuler; available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene) cDNA sources include liver, stomach, uterus, bone, placenta, brain, adrenal gland, ovary, prostate, lung, testis, pancreas, and kidney. The ERp18 coding region used in these studies was PCR-amplified from a liver cDNA library. Homologues of ERp18 can be found in mouse, rat, Xenopus, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Multiple alignments of these four proteins were performed using ClustalW (28Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

These alignments showed considerable consensus, varying only in the extreme N- and C-terminal regions. A consensus alignment that takes into account the probable structural alignment with the thioredoxin fold (see below) is shown in Fig. 1. Over the mature protein (see below), the human and mouse proteins show 94.6% identity, human and rat proteins show 94.0% identity, human and Xenopus proteins show 81.2% identity, and human and C. elegans proteins show 41.6% identity. Analysis of the Domain Structure of ERp18 —Analysis of the sequence of ERp18 using PSORT (available on the World Wide Web at psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) and TargetP (33Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) indicated that the protein would be targeted by a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence to the secretory pathway, with the mature protein starting at Ser24 (PSORT) or His27 (TargetP). The C-terminal amino acids are EDEL, which probably acts as an ER retrieval motif (usual consensus KDEL). If the mature protein starts at Ser24, then it is 149 amino acids long, with a molecular mass of 16.7 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.1 (ProtParam). The protein contains one CXXC thioredoxin superfamily active site motif, located at Cys66–Cys69, and no other cysteine residues. The nature of the two residues between the active site cysteines plays a key role in determining the redox potential of the thioredoxin superfamily and hence their biological activity. In the thioredoxins, which act as reductants, the motif is CGPC, whereas in the PDI family, which act as oxidants and isomerases, it is usually CGHC, and in the DsbA family, which act as oxidants, it is usually CPHC. The sequence in ERp18 is CGAC, which does not directly fit into any of these families. Multiple alignments of the catalytic domains of the human PDI family with ERp18 were performed using ClustalW (28Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar), T-COFFEE (29Notredame C. Higgins D. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5398) Google Scholar), Match-box (30Depiereux E Baudoux G Briffeuil P Reginster I De Bolle X Vinals C Feytmans E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 249-256PubMed Google Scholar), and Multialin (31Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar), and alignments of pairs of proteins were performed with a wide range of programs. These alignments showed some degree of consensus at the N terminus of the proteins, indicating that the probable residue starting a putative thioredoxin fold in human ERp18 was Ile38 (equivalent to Val26 in human PDI) but showed very significant differences for the alignment for the C-terminal part of ERp18. ERp18 is clearly longer than a single PDI family member catalytic domain, and the different alignments indicated that the additional sequence could either occur (i) at the C terminus (i.e. beyond the end of the thioredoxin domain), (ii) as an insert between secondary structure elements β3 and α3 or α3 and β4, or (iii) as a combination of these. To help to distinguish between these three possibilities, four C-terminal deletion constructs were generated that truncated the protein at a point where an alignment with the PDI catalytic domain ended. If the alignment was correct, then it would be reasonable to expect that the truncated protein might retain the ability to fold and form stable structures, since they would still encompass the entire thioredoxin-like fold. The constructs terminating with Gln146 or Gly150 were expressed insolubly in the cytoplasm of E. coli under all conditions tested, whereas a construct terminating with Arg157 generated a small percentage of soluble material, which was clearly unstable. Only constructs expressing mature human ERp18 (Ser24–Leu172) or with the putative ER retention signal deleted (Ser24–Leu168) were solubly and stably expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli (data not shown). Localization of ERp18 —ERp18 contains a putative secretory pathway signal sequence and a putative ER retention signal; hence, it is most probably an ER-resident protein. To investigate the subcellular localization of ERp18, two ERp18-GFP chimeras were constructed. The first had the whole ERp18 gene fused in frame N-terminally to GFP; the second had amino acids Met1–Leu168 of ERp18 fused in frame to the N terminus of GFP and Leu168-Leu172 of ERp18 fused in frame C-terminal to GFP. Direct microscopic examination of the transfected cells showed that the first ERp18-GFP fusion protein could not be visualized intracellularly. The second chimera localized in a fine reticular network and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2), suggesting that the fusion protein localizes mainly in the ER. This was confirmed by staining of the transfected cells with antibodies against the known ER and Golgi markers (PDI and Gm130). The chimeric protein, with ERp18 (including the signal sequence) N-terminal to GFP and the retrieval signal (EDEL) C-terminal to GFP, co-localized well with PDI but not with the Golgi marker Gm130. The chimeric protein appears also to be efficiently retained in the ER (via the EDEL), since no marked accumulation of the protein in the Golgi region was observed (Fig. 2, right, ERp18-GFP). Biophysical Analysis of ERp18 —Mature ERp18 (Ser24–Leu172), with an N-terminal hexa-His tag to aid purification, was expressed solubly in the cytoplasm of E. coli, and the construct was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of immobilized metal affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography (data not shown). Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein by MALDI mass spectrometry (mass accuracy 0.1%) gave a mass of 17,768.6, close to the calculated mass for oxidized ERp18 of 17,768.9. Purified ERp18 was then analyzed by a variety of techniques. The far UV CD spectra of purified ERp18 (Fig. 3A) indicated that the protein was well structured and contained both α-helix and β-sheet. All members of the thioredoxin superfamily including thioredoxin and the catalytic a-domain of human PDI share the same α/β fold (see Refs. 34Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar and 35Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar as examples). Since ERp18 showed considerable homology with the N-terminal region of the catalytic domains of the PDI family, the far UV CD spectra of purified ERp18 was compared with those of the a-domain of human PDI and E. coli thioredoxin. The resulting spectra are significantly different for all three proteins (see Fig. 3A). Fluorescence spectra of ERp18 under nondenaturing conditions gave a peak with a λmax of 337 nm and a shoulder at around 351 nm, indicating that one of the two tryptophans of ERp18 is in a hydrophobic environment, whereas the other is in a hydrophilic environme"

Some of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans provide high osmotic pressure and water retention, and others modulate not only cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, cell migration, cell proliferation, and morphogenesis but also some cytokine signals (1Schwartz N.B. Domowicz M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 57R-68RCrossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). A few general features of the biosynthetic assembly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are as follows: (i) the sequential synthesis of the core protein; (ii) xylosylation of specific Ser moieties of the core protein; (iii) addition of two Gal residues to the Xyl; (iv) completion of a common tetrasaccharide linkage region by addition of a GlcUA residue; (v) addition of GalNAc residue to initiate the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis; (vi) repeated addition of GlcUA residues alternating with GalNAc residues to grow to the large heteropolymer glycosaminoglycan chains; and (vii) modification of these growing glycosaminoglycan chains by O-sulfation at various places, and by epimerization of some of GlcUA residues to IdoUA residues. The assembly of the linkage region on the core protein followed by glycosaminoglycan polymerization and modification occurs in the intracellular membrane system composed of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (3Kimata K.

The sulfation of chondroitin sulfate ordinarily proceeds together with polymerization at the Golgi apparatus. Thus, in order to address control mechanisms of the sulfation, we should also study the enzymes for the chain synthesis, especially chondroitin sulfate elongation enzymes. Recent progress with the human genome project and the expansion of other data bases such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs has enabled the search for novel genes that are homologous to known genes. Kitagawa et al. (23Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) identified a human chondroitin synthase, from the HUGE (human unidentified gene-encoded large proteins) protein data base by screening with the keywords “one transmembrane domain” and “galactosyltransferase family.” This enzyme had the dual glycosyltransferase activities of glucuronyltransferase II (GlcAT-II) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (GalNAcT-II) responsible for synthesizing the repeated disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate (23Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By a similar homology search of the data bases, four enzymes including chondroitin synthase have further been cloned and characterized. Chondroitin sulfate GalNAcT-1 (CSGalNAcT-1) and chondroitin sulfate GalNAcT-2 (CSGalNAcT-2), the second and fourth chondroitin glycosyltransferases cloned, respectively, exhibit both GalNAcT-II activity for chain elongation and GalNAcT-I activity that determine and initiate the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate in the common linkage region (24Uyama T.

Therefore, more than four enzymes are likely responsible for chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, and they form a gene family, like the EXT family for heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis (29Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, a search of the data bases using the amino acid sequence of CSGlcAT revealed a novel gene whose product was characterized as the fifth enzyme to possess high homology with CSGlcAT. Interestingly, despite its homology with CSGlcAT, this enzyme, designated CSS2, shows both GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activity toward the non-reducing terminal residue of chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate with the specific linkage structure.

Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the preparation of the oligosaccharides with even numbers (4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-saccharides), each polymer (10 mg) was partially digested with 1,000 turbidity reducing units of testicular hyaluronidase in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl at 37 °C for the appropriate incubation times. For the preparation of the oligosaccharides with odd numbers (5-, 7-, 9-, 11-, and 13-saccharides), the hyaluronidase digests were boiled for 20 min and further digested with 1,000 units of β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31, from bovine liver, Sigma) at 37 °C for 24 h. After inactivation of the enzyme by boiling for 10 min and centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants of the digests were fractionated on the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column (16 × 600 mm) with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 2 ml per min, and absorbance was monitored at 225 nm. The peak fractions were pooled, and desalted on the PD10 desalting column with distilled water as an eluate. The uronic acid contents were then determined by the Bitter-Muir's method using d-glucuronic acid as a standard (30Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). The desalted solution was lyophilized and redissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 1 mm for each oligosaccharide. Glycosyltransferase Assays—The glycosyltransferase activities were investigated with radioactive forms of UDP-GlcUA, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and various acceptor saccharide substrates, including polymer chondroitin, various chondroitin sulfate isoforms, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, heparin (100 μg each), oligosaccharides of chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate isoforms, and hyaluronan (1 nmol each). The standard reaction mixture for GalNAcT-II contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads and acceptor substrate, 0.32 nmol of UDP-[3H]GalNAc (6.66 × 105 dpm), 50 mm MES, pH 6.2, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction mixture for GlcAT-II contained 10 μl of the resuspended gel and the acceptor substrate, 0.307 nmol of UDP-[14C]GlcUA (2.22 × 105 dpm), 50 mm MES, pH 6.2, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with mixing, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min, and then radiolabeled products were separated from free UDP-[3H]GalNAc or UDP-[14C]GlcUA by gel filtration using Superdex™ peptide HR10/30 column (10 × 300 mm) with 0.2 m NaCl as an eluant or HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column (16 × 600 mm) with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as an eluate (28Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The labeled products recovered were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For the acceptor substrates of oligosaccharide with an aromatic residue (methoxyphenyl- or benzyl-) at the reducing terminus, reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg; Waters, Milford, MA) (28Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cartridge was washed with 3 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and then 3 ml of water; the product was eluted with 50% methanol, and the radioactivity of all fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In repetitions of the experiments when different batches of the enzyme were used, an aliquot was first analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-FLAG BioM2 antibody with FLAG-BAP as a standard to obtain a comparable amount of enzyme. Identification of the Enzyme Reaction Products—Each product from the GlcAT-II reaction using chondroitin or CS11 and the GalNAcT-II reaction using chondroitin was isolated by gel filtration column chromatography using the Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and desalted with the Fast Desalting column HR10/10 using distilled water as an eluant and lyophilized. In order to identify the linkage, the dried sample (about 20 pmol of radiolabeled material) from GlcAT-II reactions was incubated with 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm sodium acetate at 37 °C for 1 h or 1 unit of β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C overnight. For confirmation of the linkage structure, we determined whether the product could serve as an acceptor for Escherichia coli strain K4 chondroitin polymerase, which synthesizes chondroitin, and the resultant products could be digested with chondroitinase ACII completely (31Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20 pmol of radiolabeled materials was lyophilized and served as substrate for K4 chondroitin polymerase. The reaction was performed at 30 °C overnight in a 50-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4,1 m ethylene glycol, 20 pmol of radiolabeled [14C]CS12, 30 nmol each of UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc, and 0.8 μg of the enzyme preparation. This was followed by boiling for 5 min to stop the reaction. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and desalted with the Fast Desalting column HR10/10 using distilled water as an eluant and lyophilized. The dried sample (about 20 pmol of radiolabeled material) from the E. coli strain K4 chondroitin polymerase reaction was incubated with 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm sodium acetate at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme digests were analyzed again using the same Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column as described above. In order to identify the linkage, the dried sample (about 20 pmol of radiolabeled material) from GalNAcT-II reactions was incubated with 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm sodium acetate at 37 °C for 1 h or 100 milliunits of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in a total volume of 100 μlof50mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digests were analyzed again using the same Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column as described above. Quantitative Analysis of the CSS2 Transcript in Human Tissues by Real Time PCR—For quantification of CSS2 transcripts, we employed the real time PCR method, as described in detail previously (32Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Marathon Ready cDNA derived from various human tissues was purchased from Clontech. Standard curves for the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA, were generated by serial dilution of pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) DNA containing the GAPDH gene. The primer set and the probe for CSS2 were as follows: the forward primer, 5′-GCTGAACTGGAACGCACGTA-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-CGGGATGGTGCTGGAATAC-3′, and the probe, 5′-AGATCCAGGAGTTACAGTGG-3′, with a minor groove binder. The primer sets and the probes for CSGlcAT and CSS1 were as follows: the forward primer for CSGlcAT, 5′-GTGAAATAGAACAACTGCAGGCTC-3′, and the reverse primer for CSGlcAT, 5′-GAGAAGGTGTGCTGCTCTGTGA-3′, the probe for CSGlcAT, 5′-CGGAACCTGACCGTGC-3′, with a minor groove binder; the forward primer for CSS1, 5′-AGTGTGTCTGGTCTTATGAGATGCA-3′, and the reverse primer for CSS1, 5′-AGCTGTGGAGCCTGTACTGGTAG-3′ and the probe for CSS1, 5′-ATGAGAATTACGAGCAGAAC-3′ with a minor groove binder. PCR products were continuously measured with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative amounts of their transcripts were normalized to the amount of GAPDH transcript in the same cDNA. Comparison of the C-terminal Domain Structure between CSS2 and CSGlcAT by Homology Modeling—The molecular structures of the C-terminal halves of CSS2 (C-CSS2; amino acid residues 474–775) and CSGlcAT (C-CSGlcAT; amino acid residues 455–772) were estimated from the model of the C-terminal half of CSS1 (C-CSS1; amino acid residues 500–802) because the amino acid sequences of C-CSS2 and C-CSGlcAT are far diverged from other glycosyltransferases for which the three-dimensional structures are known. From the consensus result of three threading methods, 3D-PSSM (www.sbg.bio.ic.uk/~3dpssm/), FUGUE (www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/prfsearch.html), and GenTHREADER (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psiform.html), we chose bovine β4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT-1) as a template for homology modeling of C-CSS1, because β4GalT-1 obtained the best score by 3D-PSSM and FUGUE and the second highest score by GenTHREADER. Furthermore, CSS1 has been classified into the same glycosyltransferase family (Family GT7) with β4GalT-1 by CAZy (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html), in which CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 are also the same family members. With the pairwise alignment of C-CSS1 and β4GalT-1 derived from 3D-PSSM, homology modeling of C-CSS1 was performed using FAMS (33Ogata K. Umeyama H. J. Mol. Graphics Model. 2000; 18 (305–256): 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Then the amino acid sequences of C-CSS1, C-CSS2, C-CSGlcAT, CSGalNAcT-1 (amino acid residues 228–532), and CSGalNAcT-2 (amino acid residues 237–542) were aligned using ClustalW (34Thompson J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2009420299,"Thymosin beta-4 (Tbeta-4), a small peptide originally isolated from calf thymus, modulates the formation of F-actin microfilaments by sequestering the monomeric G-actin. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of the Tbeta-4 gene occurs not only in many human carcinomas but also in the highly metastatic melanomas and fibrosarcomas. However, little is known about the specific growth advantages acquired by different tumors from this genetic abnormality. To address the above questions, Tbeta-4-overexpressing human colon carcinoma (SW480) cells were established by stable transfection and their phenotypic changes were monitored. We found that both the morphology and the cortical actin cytoskeleton of SW480 cells were altered by Tbeta-4 overexpression. Moreover, both cellular level and that distributed over the intercellular junctions of the E-cadherin were decreased in the Tbeta-4 overexpressers, which were accompanied by a twofold increase in their saturation densities. Meanwhile, these cells also exhibited an increased ability to form colonies in soft agar. Interestingly, a dramatic increase of growth rate was detected in the Tbeta-4 overexpressers, which might be attributed to an accelerated proliferation induced by c-Myc that was activated by nuclear beta-catenin. Finally, a motility increase of these cells was demonstrated by two independent migration assays, which was accompanied by an enhanced focal contact. Taken together, our data suggest that the drastic growth property and motility changes of the SW480 cells overexpressing Tbeta-4 gene are due mainly to a deregulated cell-cell adhesion arisen from the downregulation of E-cadherin, plus uncontrolled cell proliferation owing to the upregulation of beta-catenin, both resulted from a breakdown of actin microfilaments caused by the overexpression of this G-actin sequestering peptide."

We have truncated to alanine the 20 amino acid side chains per monomer that participate in intersubunit contacts at the CA dimer interface and analyzed their individual energetic contribution to protein association and stability. About half of the side chains in the contact epitope are critically involved in the energetic epitope as their truncation essentially prevented dimerization. However, dimerization affinity is kept low partly because of the presence of interfacial side chains whose individual truncation improves affinity by 2–20-fold. Many side chains at the interface are energetically important also for the folding of a monomeric intermediate and for its conformational rearrangement during dimerization. The thermodynamic description of this low affinity interface (dissociation constant of ∼10 μm) was compared with those obtained for the other protein-protein interfaces, nearly all of them of much higher affinity, that have been systematically analyzed by mutation. The results reveal differences that may have been evolutionary selected and that may be exploited for the design of an effective interfacial inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus assembly.

Assembly and stability of the complex oligomeric proteins that constitute the capsids of viruses are mediated by multiple noncovalent interactions between many protein subunits. An attractive antiviral approach involves the use of compounds able to interfere with critical intersubunit interactions in viral oligomers. Potential inhibitors include small molecules and also larger “interfacial inhibitors” that mimic a part of the interacting epitope (1Babé L.M. Pichuantes S. Craik C.S.

Rational design of antiviral agents aimed at inhibiting assembly or facilitating dissociation of a virus capsid may require not only a detailed structural knowledge of capsid subunit interfaces but also a thermodynamic understanding of the individual energetic contribution of interfacial residues and interactions to subunit association. This is particularly important if the inhibitor must met the conflicting requirements of a minimum size with maximum affinity and specificity. Alanine scanning mutagenesis (5Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) provides an excellent strategy to experimentally determine the energetic contributions of interfacial side chains to protein-protein interaction. Mutation to Ala of residues other than Gly or Pro eliminates the targeted side chain beyond Cβ and disrupts any interaction that involves that side chain, without introducing new interactions and with the lowest probability of altering the conformation of the polypeptide backbone (5Cunningham B.C.

The structural complexity of viral capsids has generally prevented the application of quantitative experimental thermodynamic approaches based on the use of mutants to dissect the energetics of capsid subunit association during assembly. Fortunately, assembly of some capsids, including that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; CA, capsid protein of HIV; CA-C, C-terminal domain of CA; CD, circular dichroism, GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride. involve a number of discrete oligomerization interfaces between protein domains that may be amenable to quantitative thermodynamic analyses in isolation.

Each subunit in the HIV-1 CA-C dimer (CA amino acid residues 147–231) is composed of a short 310 helix followed by an extended strand and four α-helices connected by short loops. The dimerization interface is essentially formed by the parallel packing of helix 2 from each subunit (Fig. 1A) (29Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H.

Folding and dimerization of CA-C of HIV-1 is a three-state reaction in which the polypeptide folds to yield a monomeric intermediate of low stability, and the intermediate dimerizes in a process that also involves a tertiary conformational reorganization of each monomeric subunit (Fig. 1B) (37Mateu M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have chosen the CA-C dimerization interface to undertake the first experimental thermodynamic dissection of a protein-protein interface critically involved in assembly of a virus capsid. The use of different equilibrium techniques allowed us to perform separate calculations on the specific free energy contributions of each interfacial side chain to each of the different processes observed during folding/association of CA-C (37Mateu M.G.

The implications for HIV capsid assembly, the design of interfacial antiviral inhibitors, and protein-protein recognition are discussed. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) on recombinant plasmid pET21b(+) containing the segment corresponding to CA-C of HIV-1 (strain BH10; CA residues 146–231). The mutations introduced were confirmed by sequencing the entire CA-C coding region. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described for wild-type CA-C (37Mateu M.G. J. Mol.

Purified CA-C mutants were run in overloaded SDS-PAGE gels and found free of contaminants. Their concentration was determined by UV-spectrophotometry as described (37Mateu M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Determination of Affinity Constants by Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—Association constants for the homodimeric mutants were determined by gel filtration using frontal (large zone) elution (38Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 15-ml aliquots of CA-C samples with a total protein (monomer) concentration (C t) usually ranging from 0.5 to 60 μm were serially applied to a recalibrated Superdex 75 HR FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been thoroughly equilibrated with the appropriate buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, unless specified otherwise) and kept at 23 °C. Samples were eluted at 1 ml/min and continuously monitored with an on-line UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. The elution volume V e at each C t was determined as the midpoint of the ascending frontal profile in the chromatogram. The weight average partition coefficient (39Darling P.J. Holt J.M. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11500-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at each C t (σω) was calculated using the expression, σω=(Ve-Vt)/(V0-Vt)(Eq. 1) where V t is the total column volume and V 0 is the void volume, which were determined as described (18Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The experimental σw values obtained at different C t were fitted to the equation (39Darling P.J. Holt J.M. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11500-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), σω=((-1+((1+8KaCt)0.5))/(4KaCt))σm+(1-((-1+((1+8KaCt)0.5))/(4KaCt)))σd(Eq. 2) where σm and σd are the partition coefficient of monomer and dimer, respectively, and K a is the equilibrium association constant. The free energy of association ΔG a was calculated by using the equation, ΔGa=-RTlnKa(Eq. 3) where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. Zonal (small zone) elution experiments were carried out in the same way, except that 200-μl aliquots were applied to the column and that the V e was defined by the peak position in the chromatogram. Gel filtration analysis using small zone elution does not normally provide good K a values (38Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and it was not used for most CA-C mutants. However, we found for nonmutated CA-C (and for another, unrelated dimeric protein) that in our conditions, the K a obtained using small zone gel filtration was coincident within error with that obtained using frontal elution gel filtration or other standard techniques (see below). Thus, for those CA-C mutants that we found essentially in the monomeric form at all but the highest protein concentrations tested, a rough estimation of the K a was obtained as follows: the frontal elution data obtained at μm concentrations were complemented by small zone elution data obtained at much higher (around 1 mm) concentrations (that were prohibitive for large zone experiments), and the combined data were fitted using Equation 2. Because of the extremely low affinity of these particular mutants, to achieve meaningful fitting values for σm and σd, we had to assume that at extremely high (unreachable) concentrations (around 1 m), the protein would be essentially in the dimeric form and that σd did not significantly change upon mutation. Use of these reasonable theoretical assumptions allowed a good fitting of the experimental data for the very low affinity mutants. Fluorescence and Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy and Dissociation/Unfolding Equilibrium Data Analyses—Dissociation/denaturation of CA-C mutants by guanidinium chloride (GdmHCl) were spectroscopically probed as described for wild-type CA-C (37Mateu M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using a Varian Cary Eclipse luminescence spectrophotometer and a Jasco 500 spectropolarimeter equipped with temperature control units. Total protein (monomer) concentration was 200 μm unless indicated otherwise. Variations in fluorescence probed dissociation of the dimer into a monomeric form, and the data were fitted to a dimer-to-monomer two-state transition. Variations in CD probed the unfolding of the monomeric intermediate, and the data were fitted to a unimolecular two-state transition. The equations used in Ref. 37Mateu M.G. J. Mol.

Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar) was used for analyses of the number, nature, and structural parameters of the interdimer contacts, solvent accessibility calculations, and modeling of the mutations introduced. Energetic Contribution of Interfacial Residues to Dimerization of CA-C Monomers—Analysis of intersubunit interactions in the crystallographic structure of the CA-C dimer revealed that 22 side chains per monomer are involved in the contact epitope (29Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sunquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 30Worthylake D.K. Wang H.

We have individually truncated all of these side chains (except Ala-177 and Pro-207) to alanine. Dissociation of nonmutated CA-C and each mutant by simple dilution was quantitated in analytical gel filtration experiments (Fig. 2 and Table I). This allowed determination of the association constant K a and the free energy difference ΔG a between dimer and monomer, and thus, the contribution of quaternary interactions to the dissociation process (37Mateu M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Neet K.E. Timm D.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The difference between ΔG a for nonmutated CA-C and ΔG a for each mutant (ΔΔG a) was taken as a measure of the relative energetic contribution of the truncated side chain (beyond Cβ) (Fig. 3, black bars, and Fig. 4A).Table IThermodynamic dissection of the CA-C dimerization interfaceCA-CGF Chromatography AssociationFluorescence Rearrangement + associationRearrangement only ΔGurCD Folding of monomerGlobal process ΔGutKaΔGa aThermodynamic parameters corresponding to dissociation of dimeric CA-C by dilution were obtained by gel filtration.

https://openalex.org/W2005444914,"RGS proteins are defined by the presence of a semiconserved RGS domain that confers the GTPase-activating activity of these proteins toward certain Gα subunits. RGS6 is a member of a subfamily of RGS proteins distinguished by the presence of DEP and GGL domains, the latter a Gβ5-interacting domain. Here we report identification of 36 distinct transcripts of human RGS6 that arise by unusually complex processing of the RGS6 gene, which spans 630 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA in human chromosome 14 and is interrupted by 19 introns. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. The role of structural diversity in the N-terminal and GGL domains of RGS6 splice variants in their interaction with Gβ5 and subcellular localization and of Gβ5 on RGS6 protein localization was examined in COS-7 cells expressing various RGS6 splice variant proteins. RGS6 splice variants with complete GGL domains interacted with Gβ5, irrespective of the type of N-terminal domain, while those lacking a complete GGL domain did not. RGS6 protein variants displayed subcellular distribution patterns ranging from an exclusive cytoplasmic to exclusive nuclear/nucleolar localization, and co-expression of Gβ5 promoted nuclear localization of RGS6 proteins. Analysis of our results show that the long N-terminal and GGL domain sequences of RGS6 proteins function as cytoplasmic retention sequences to prevent their nuclear/nucleolar accumulation. These findings provide the first evidence for Gβ5-independent functions of the GGL domain and for a role of Gβ5 in RGS protein localization. This study reveals extraordinary complexity in processing of the human RGS6 gene and provides new insights into how structural diversity in the RGS6 protein family is involved in their localization and likely function(s) in cells.

These findings raise the fascinating possibility that some members of the RGS protein family may have functions apart from, or in addition to, regulatory control of heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Five subfamilies of RGS proteins have been proposed based upon sequence identities within the RGD of these proteins (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this classification also groups proteins with similar structural domains outside of the RGD that may be involved in subcellular targeting, regulation, protein interaction(s) or specific functions of members of a given subfamily. Indeed, the R4 subfamily proteins RGS4 and RGS16 possess NESs that function to transport these proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (13Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain of RGS3 has been implicated in its recruitment to the plasma membrane (14Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RGS proteins in the RZ subfamily possess cysteine string motifs and several other protein domains have been identified that are unique to members of a given RGS protein subfamily (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to the present study is the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins that includes RGS6 as well as RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Each of these RGS proteins has an N-terminal domain that contains a DEP (disheveled, Egl-10 and pleckstrin homology) and a GGL (G-protein gamma subunit-like) domain. Although the function of the DEP domain is unknown, the GGL domain has been shown to represent a binding site for Gβ5 (17Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J.

We undertook studies to clone members of the RGS protein family to further our understanding of the structural diversity and complexity within this family. Recent evidence suggests that this complexity may arise not only from the more than 20 mammalian genes encoding RGS protein members, but also by the existence of multiple forms of a given RGS gene product. We identified two major transcripts for human RGS3 (27Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and subsequently demonstrated the existence of twelve alternatively spliced forms of human RGS12 (12Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RGS9 has also been found to exist in two splice variant forms (28Granneman J.G. Zhai Y. Zhu Z. Bannon M.J. Burchett S.A. Schmidt C.J. Andrade R. Cooper J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 687-694PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report identification of 36 splice variant forms of RGS6 that arise by use of two alternative transcription start sites within the human RGS6 gene and by complex alternative splicing of the two primary RGS6 mRNAs. Identification of these transcripts enabled us to deduce the structure of the human RGS6 gene and the splicing mechanisms that generate these novel RGS6 transcripts. Interestingly, these RGS6 transcripts encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, seven distinct C-terminal domains, and a common internal domain where the RGD is located. The existence of diversity outside of but not within the RGD of the RGS6 protein family raises complex questions in relation to a unifying hypothesis that these proteins have a single function dictated by this domain. We examined the role of structural diversity within the N-terminal and GGL domain of RGS6 splice variants in their interaction with Gβ5 and subcellular localization patterns and assessed whether Gβ5 alters the subcellular localization of RGS6 proteins. Our results demonstrate unique subcellular distribution patterns of RGS6 protein variants that can be ascribed to N-terminal and GGL domains of these proteins functioning as cytoplasmic retention sequences. The role of the GGL domain in cytoplasmic retention of RGS6 was observed in cells lacking Gβ5, providing the first evidence for a function of this domain independent of its interaction with Gβ5. Moreover, co-expression studies with Gβ5 and RGS6 proteins provide new evidence that Gβ5 interaction with RGS proteins promotes changes in their subcellular distribution. These results demonstrate extraordinary complexity in processing of the human RGS6 gene and provide new insight into how structural complexity in RGS6 proteins dictates their subcellular localization and possible functions. Materials—5′-RACE-ready cDNA, marathon-ready cDNA, Quickscreen cDNA library panel and pEGFP vector were purchased from Clontech. pCR2.1 and pCR3.1 were from Invitrogen. Elongase was from Invitrogen. Antibody to and cDNA encoding mouse Gβ5 was a generous gift of Dr. William Simonds (National Institutes of Health) and Dr. Vladen Slepak (University of Miami), respectively. Cell culture medium and serum was provided by the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (the University of Iowa). Oligonucleotide primers and other molecular biological reagents were obtained from the University of Iowa DNA Core. Polyclonal RGS6 antibodies were generated with a synthetic peptide immunogen corresponding to residues 1–19 of RGS6L by Biosynthesis Incorporated (Lewisville, TX). PCR Amplification of RGS6 cDNAs—Full-length cDNAs encoding various forms of RGS6 were amplified using a PCR-based strategy we described previously (12Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We utilized a 505-bp expressed sequence tag identified as RGS6 (GenBank™ accession number H09621) to design primers for use in 5′- and 3′-RACE to amplify overlapping segments of RGS6 cDNAs essentially as we described previously (12Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Marathon-ready human brain cDNA (adapter sequences on both cDNA ends) were used as templates for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE using adapter-specific forward or reverse primers in combination with appropriate RGS6 forward or reverse primers. This cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)containing mRNA. Resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1, and sequence analysis of multiple clones revealed successful amplification of overlapping 5′- and 3′-cDNA fragments of RGS6 from brain cDNA. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed the existence of multiple splice variant forms of RGS6. cDNAs encoding these splice variant forms of RGS6 were amplified using forward and reverse primers encompassing the translational start and stop sites, respectively. cDNAs were cloned into pCR3.1 and double-stranded sequencing was performed by automated fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Preparation of EGFP Constructs of RGS6 —Various RGS6 protein cDNAs were PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers incorporating restriction sites to facilitate their cloning into EGFP vector. First, amplified RGS6 protein cDNAs were cloned in the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Then, restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel purification of the cloned RGS6 protein cDNAs was performed. RGS6 protein cDNAs were ligated to EGFP vector in-frame with its C-terminal or N-terminal EGFP sequence. Double-stranded sequencing of all cloned RGS6 protein cDNAs was performed by automated fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) (complete DMEM) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with vectors containing various RGS6 protein cDNAs and mouse Gβ5 cDNA by electroporation using a BioRad Gene-Pulser. Typically, COS-7 cells (107/ml) were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid DNA at settings of 0.22 kV and 950 μF. Cells were diluted in complete DMEM and plated in two-chambered slides (Nunc) at a density of ∼106 cells/well. Transfected cells were used in experiments 40 h following transfection. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—Cells were rinsed three times with DPBS before fixation for immunofluorescence. For visualization of GFP-tagged RGS6 proteins in COS-7 cells, cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization, cells were treated with DPBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min at room temperature prior to staining with propidium iodide. For immunocytochemical detection of expressed Gβ5 in COS-7 cells, cells were fixed and permeabilized by treatment with 50% methanol, 50% acetone for1hat4 °C prior to treatment with RNase A and incubation with anti-Gβ5 (∼1 μg/ml) in DPBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells then were rinsed three times with DPBS and incubated in FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1 mg/ml) in DPBS for 20 min at room temperature. RNase A treatment and propidium iodide staining were performed as described above. Cells were air-dried and then mounted using Vecta Shield mounting solution. Confocal microscopy was performed as we described previously (13Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Images shown are representative of a minimum of 1000 cells derived from four or more separate transfections. Immunohistochemistry was performed by Molecular Histology (MD) with synthetic peptide immunogen affinity-purified (SulfoLink, Pierce) anti-RGS6L. Briefly, tissue slides were incubated with and without anti-RGS6L, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody and strepatavidin-horseradish peroxidase prior to incubation with substrate (DAB). Hematoxylin counterstain (stains nuclei blue) was used. Co-immunoprecipitation of Gβ5 and RGS6 —For co-immunoprecipitation studies, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with RGS6-GFP and mouse Gβ5 cDNA and grown for 48 h in 6-well culture dishes. Cells were harvested by lysis with 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Resulting supernatants were incubated with anti-GFP antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose and incubation for an additional 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in RIPA buffer, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (12Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Identification of Human RGS6 cDNAs—We used a PCR-based strategy to first amplify and clone two RGS6 cDNAs (Genbank™ AF073920, AF073921), the first identified RGS6 cDNAs, using sequence information from a 505-bp expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ H09621). The naming of these cDNAs was derived from the conceptual translation of rat brain PCR products of Koelle and Horvitz (5Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) in which degenerate primers were used to amplify a semiconserved region, now known as the RGS domain, of a family of mammalian proteins sharing sequence identify with EGL-10, the RGS protein in C. elegans. Inspection of the sequence of these two RGS6 cDNAs suggested the possibility of splicing of RGS6 transcripts at their 5′-ends; the larger form encoded a protein with an additional 139 N-terminal amino acids, and the cDNAs had different 5′-untranslated sequences. An apparent difference at the 3′-ends of these two cDNAs was subsequently resolved by identifying a 2-bp sequencing error in the longer form. Thus, the two RGS6 cDNAs appeared to represent long and short N-terminal forms of RGS6 so the short form was named an RGS6 variant to highlight this possibility. Using 5′- and 3′-RACE and sequence information from these two RGS6 cDNAs, we were able to identify the existence of 36 novel RGS6 transcripts from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from human brain. Sequence analysis of full or partial RGS6 cDNAs revealed that these variant RGS6 forms, although highly homologous, exhibit differences in their 5′-, 3′-, and internal sequences. Two different 5′-cDNA ends were identified that correspond to proteins with the long or short N-terminal sequences mentioned above. RGS6 cDNAs with each type of 5′-end existed in combination with seven different types of 3′-ends, encoding seven different C-terminal domains of the proteins. In addition, each of the RGS6 transcripts distinguished by different 5′- and 3′-ends existed in two forms that differed in the region encoding the G protein γ-subunit-like (GGL) domain that defines the subfamily of RGS proteins that includes RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Sequence differences in this region encode RGS6 proteins with complete or incomplete GGL domains. The coding sequences of the 36 different RGS6 cDNAs encode proteins ranging from 284 to 490 amino acids. Fig. 1 illustrates the structure and naming of RGS6 proteins encoded by the 36 distinct RGS6 cDNAs identified here. We devised a nomenclature based upon the differing N- and C-terminal sequences (Table I) and the presence or absence of a complete GGL domain of the encoded RGS6 proteins. Long and short N-terminal forms of RGS6 were designated as RGS6L and RGS6S, respectively, and the C-terminal forms were designated α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, η, and ζ. RGS6L proteins have a 139 N-terminal sequence not present in the otherwise homologous RGS6S proteins. Likewise the forms lacking a 37 amino acid sequence that includes the C-terminal 25 amino acids of the GGL domain, designated (-GGL), are otherwise homologous to RGS6 proteins with complete GGL domains. Moreover, α and β forms exist in two forms, with (α1, β1) or without (α2, β2) an 18 amino acid sequence located N-terminal to their common C-terminal sequence (Table I). Thus, using this nomenclature, long N-terminal forms of RGS6 with the α1 terminus with and without the GGL domain are designated RGS6Lα1 and RGS6Lα1(-GGL), respectively. Fig. 1 also illustrates that all forms of RGS6 have an RGS domain and that RGS6S forms lack the DEP domain, whose function is presently unknown, present in RGS6L proteins.Table IDifferent C-terminal ends and exon 18 variants of RGS6 proteinNamePESEQGRRTSLEKFTRSVC Terminusα1+GKSLAGKRLTGLMQSSα2-GKSLAGKRLTGLMQSSβ1+LYSNTPLAKRPβ2-LYSNTPLAKRPγ+CLQLLFδ+LLFϵ+Gη-VWLLζ-KVSKVELP Open table in a new tab Structure of the Human RGS6 Gene—The finding that the identified RGS6 transcripts encode highly homologous proteins that differ only by the presence or absence of sequence cassettes or in their C-terminal sequences suggested these transcripts might arise by alternative splicing mechanisms. Using BLAST nucleotide sequence analysis of identified RGS6 cDNAs with human gene data banks we were able to deduce the complete structure of the human RGS6 gene. The RGS6 gene spans 629,635 bp of DNA of human chromosome 14 and is interrupted by 19 introns, and the 20 RGS6 gene exons range in size from 51 to >332 bp. The intron-exon organization of the hRGS6 gene in relation to RGS6Lα1 mRNA is shown in Fig. 2. Table II shows the sizes of introns and the intron-exon splice junction sequences in RGS6 transcripts. As shown, introns vary in size from 155 bp to 387 kb, and all of the splice acceptor and donor sequences agree with the GT/AG consensus sequence (29Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RGS6 gene intron phasing is type 0 (the intron occurs between codons) for introns 2, 5, 7, 9–11, 15–19; type 1 (the intron interrupts the first and second bases of the codon) for introns 3, 4, and 6; and type 2 (the intron interrupts the second and third codon) for introns 8 and 12–14.Table IIExon/Intron organization of RGS6 geneTable IIExon/Intron organization of RGS6 gene Splicing of Human RGS6 Transcripts—We examined the relationship between exon and intron locations of the RGS6 gene to the structure of the 36 RGS6 cDNA variants we identified to gain insight into how these unique RGS6 variants arise. Fig. 3 illustrates the deduced splicing mechanisms involved in generating these 36 RGS6 transcripts. Transcripts encoding the two N-terminal forms of RGS6 arise by use of different transcriptional start sites. Exons 1–7 encode the 5′-untranslated region and unique N-terminal domain of RGS6L proteins while an alternate transcription start site within intron 7 generates RGS6S transcripts whose 5′-untranslated sequence and translation start site are encoded within intron 7 (non-coding exons A, B, C, and D) and exon 8. The translational start site for RGS6S proteins begins at nucleotide 24 of exon 8, resulting in no reading"

https://openalex.org/W2072781709,"Transgenic (TG) mice expressing the Simian virus 40 T-antigen under the control of the murine inhibin-α promoter (Inhα/Tag) develop granulosa and Leydig cell tumors at the age of 5–6 months, with 100% penetrance. When these mice are gonadectomized, they develop adrenocortical tumors. Suppression of gonadotropin secretion inhibits the tumorigenesis in the gonads of intact animals and in the adrenals after gonadectomy. To study further the role of luteinizing hormone (LH) in gonadal and adrenal tumorigenesis, a double TG mouse model was generated by crossing the Inhα/Tag mice with mice producing constitutively elevated levels of LH (bLHβ-CTP mice). Our results show that in double TG mice (bLHβ-CTP/Inhα/Tag), gonadal tumorigenesis starts earlier and progresses faster than in Inhα/Tag mice. Both ovarian and testicular tumors were histologically comparable with the tumors found in Inhα/Tag mice. In addition, adrenal tumorigenesis was found in intact double TG females, but not in Inhα/Tag females. Inhibin-α and LH receptor (LHR) were highly expressed in tumorigenic gonadal tissues, and the elevated LH levels were shown to be associated with ectopic LHR and high inhibin-α expression in the female adrenals. We conclude that in the Inhα/Tag tumor mouse model, elevated LH levels act as a tumor promoter, advancing gonadal and adrenal tumorigenesis."

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that bind a variety of ligands, including proteins of the extracellular matrix, intercellular adhesion molecules, plasma proteins, and complement factors (1Van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrins act as receptors for many pathogenic bacteria or viruses and are presently referred to as pattern recognition receptors as they recognize molecular structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK 1/2, extracellular-regulated kinases; JNKs, receptor Jun N-terminal kinases; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PI, phosphatidyl inositol; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FLSs, fibroblast-like synoviocytes; IL-6, interleukin-6; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]ethanesulfonic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. on pathogens.

In addition, several other observations have demonstrated that integrin recognition of fibronectin promotes adhesion and internalization of bacteria expressing fibronectin-binding proteins, for example, protein M1 of Streptococcus pyogenes (7Cue D.

Because integrins are known to control cellular processes as diverse as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration, it is likely that their interactions with pathogens will have an important impact on host cell responses as well as on microbial pathogenesis. There are many outside-in signaling pathways that have been identified downstream from integrins, notably, the MAPKs pathway, which converts extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals and which is central to many cellular functions. MAPKs belong to one of the major pathways transmitting signals to early genes implicated in the regulation of cytokine responses. Numerous data demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis in response to bacteria or bacterial components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, polyosides, lipoteichoic acids, and proteins), after binding to their cognate receptors on different eukaryotic cells, is controlled by the MAPKs pathway and that this synthesis may play an important role in innate immunity as well as in various inflammatory disorders (9Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 10Scherle P.A. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Daulerio A.J. Covington M.B. Nurnberg S.A. Mafolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5681-5686PubMed Google Scholar). Using protein I/II, a PAMP from oral streptococci, we reported previously that interaction of this cell wall component with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), cells that are critically involved in rheumatoid arthritis-associated joint inflammation, triggers the production and release of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-8 (11Müller-Ladner U. Gay R.E. Gay S. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2000; 12: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Gourieux B. AL-Okla S. Schöller M. Klein J.P. Sibilia J. Wachsmann D. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 1280: 1-7Google Scholar). This cytokine synthesis involves ERK 1/2 and JNKs as well as AP-1-binding activity and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (13Neff L. Zeisel M. Sibilia J. Schöller-Guinard M. Klein J.P. Wachsmann D. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which integrins initiate the MAPKs pathway are generally not fully understood. There is increasing evidence that FAK is critical in linking integrins to this pathway insofar as FAK, which colocalizes with integrins in focal adhesions, is associated with different signaling, adaptor, or structural proteins, including Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C-γ, PI 3-kinase, p130Cas, Shc, Grb2, and paxillin. Several mechanisms can be used by FAK to activate ERK 1/2. For example, autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 generates a binding site for Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (14Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-925 allows the binding of the SH2 domain of Grb2 and the formation of a Grb2·SoS complex, which activates the Ras/MAPKs cascade. In addition, interaction with Src leads to the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 and full kinase activity. The Ras/MAPKs pathway can also be activated by recruitment and phosphorylation of p130Cas, which promotes the binding of the adaptor proteins Crk, Nck, and SoS (15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1995; 372: 786-791Crossref Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 16Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol.

Many integrins use more than one mechanism to activate the ERK pathway, and some of them seem to be independent of FAK and cell-specific. One group has provided evidence that caveolin-1 and the adaptor protein Shc play a role in relaying signals from integrins to ERK in primary cells, but FAK·Src complexes might control the temporal response of ERK initiated by Shc, in B-Raf-expressing cells (20Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36532-36540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, FAK, independently of tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity, was proposed to regulate integrin-dependent activation of JNKs by a mechanism involving paxillin and the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (23Igishi T. Fukuhara S. Patel V. Katz B.Z. Yamada K. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30738-30746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another linkage was suggested, occurring through association of FAK with Src and p130Cas and the recruitment of Crk and Dock 180 (24Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Bireg R.B. Giancotti F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recent findings have also demonstrated that FAK coordinates MAPKs signaling, following costimulation of integrins and growth factors receptors for EGF or platelet-derived growth factor, through interactions mediated by FAK-C-terminal and -N-terminal domain connections to the respective transmembrane receptors (25Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 26Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.J. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it can be hypothesized that FAK may participate in various biochemical routes linking integrins to MAPKs cascades. This work was thus undertaken to examine the ability of FAK to contribute to signaling events leading to ERK 1/2- and JNKs-dependent synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, in response to protein I/II. Our results indicate that FAK is critical for IL-6 and IL-8 release by protein I/II-activated FLSs but that Tyr-397, the major site of autophosphorylation that promotes the assembly of a number of signaling complexes, is not essential for this process. Material—Cell culture media (RPMI 1640 and M199), fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, Moloney murine leukemia virus, RNase inhibitor, IL-6, and β actin primers were from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Cell culture media had an endotoxin content that never exceeded 0.04 ng/ml, as tested by the Limulus chromogenic assay.

Protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science (Meylan, France). Hexanucleotide mix was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). The enzyme immunoassay kits for human IL-8 and IL-6 detection were from Endogen (Interchim, Montluçon, France) and for mouse IL-6 detection from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). Purified α5β1 integrins were obtained from Valbiotech (Paris, France). Rabbit anti-FAK (pY397), anti-Shc (pY317) polyclonal antibodies were from BIOSOURCE (Cliniscience, Montrouge, France), rat anti-integrin β1 chain, clone 9EG7 monoclonal antibodies, and rabbit anti-FAK polyclonal antibodies were from BD Pharmingen (Cliniscience).

A universal tyrosine kinase assay kit was from Takara Biomedicals (Genevilliers, France). The FAK-related non-kinase plasmid (FRNK-YCam) has been previously described (27Giannone G. Rondé P. Guire M. Haiech J. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26364-26371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the pRk5-ShcY317F plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Filippo G. Giancotti (Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The Nucleofector™ kit was from Amaxa (Köln, Germany). Throughout this study, buffers were prepared with apyrogenic water obtained from Fandre (Ludres, France). Cell Culture and Transfections—Human FLSs were isolated from RA synovial tissues from three different patients, at the time of knee joint arthroscopic synovectomy as described previously (28Dechanet J. Taupin J.L. Chomarat M.C. Moreau J.F. Banchereau J. Miossec P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3222-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The diagnoses conformed to the revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (29Arnett F. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fires J.F. Cooper N.S. et al.Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 3: 315-324Crossref Scopus (18700) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were minced, digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 3 h at 37 °C, centrifuged (130 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in M199-RPMI 1640 (1:1) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml), and 20% heat-inactivated FCS (complete medium). After overnight culture, non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultured in complete medium. At confluence, cells were trypsinized and passaged in 75-cm2 culture flasks in complete medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Between the third and the tenth passages, during which time cultures were a homogeneous population of fibroblastic cells, negative for CD16 as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, cells (5 × 103 cells per well) were grown to confluence in 96-well plates (7–10 days). Cells were deprived of serum for 24 h, before addition of the appropriate stimuli, and diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 with antibiotics. Cell number and cell viability were examined by the MTT test (3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test) as described elsewhere (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). FAK+/+ and FAK–/– primary mouse embryo fibroblasts were a generous gift from Dr. Dusko Ilic (Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm), non-essential amino acids (1%), sodium pyruvate (1%), and 10% heat-inactivated FCS. FAK+/+ cells were transfected with FRNK-YCam (27Giannone G. Rondé P. Guire M. Haiech J. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26364-26371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, 15 μg of plasmidic DNA in 1 ml of BES-buffered saline (borate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, containing 2.5 mm of CaCl2) was added to 5 × 105 cells for 20 h at 37 °C (3% CO2). Following transfection, cells were rinsed and then cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Geneticin (1.5 mg/ml) for 2 weeks. The antibiotic-resistant cells were then pooled and used for further analysis. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to determine the transfection efficiency. Transient transfection of FLSs was performed using the Nucleofector™ kit. 2 μg of plasmidic DNA was added to 5 × 105 FLSs suspended in 100 μl of human dermal fibroblast Nucleofector™ solution. The program U-23 was selected for a high density of transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then plated in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and serum-starved for 24 h before activation experiments. Purification of Protein I/II—Recombinant protein I/II of S. mutans OMZ 175 was purified from pHBsr-1-transformed Escherichia coli cell extract by gel filtration and immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (31Chatenay-Rivauday C. Yamodo I. Sciotti M. Ogier J.A. Klein J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein I/II migrated as a single band having an apparent molecular mass of 195 kDa. Activation of Cells—FLSs were preincubated with 100 μl of various inhibitors diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 with antibiotics: for 40 min at 37 °C with cytochalasin D (0.5, 1 and 2 μm), for 1 h at 37 °C with anti-integrin β1 chain mAbs (5, 20, and 40 μg/ml), with wortmannin (50, 100, and 200 nm), and then incubated with 100 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing protein I/II (125 pm final concentration). Protein I/II (125 pm, 200 μl) was also preincubated for2hat4 °C with purified α5β1 integrins (1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) and then used to stimulate FLSs. After a 20-h incubation period, culture supernatants were harvested and used to estimate IL-6 and IL-8 release by a heterologous two-site sandwich ELISA as previously described (32Vernier A. Diab M. Soell M. Haan-Archipoff G. Beretz A. Wachsmann D. Klein J.P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3016-3022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed effects were not due to possible lipopolysaccharide contamination, all the experiments were performed in presence of polymyxin B (2 μg/ml). Detection of IL-6-mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from 106 FAK+/+ or FAK–/– cells activated with 125 pm protein I/II for 1 h, using 1 ml of Tri reagent and reverse-transcribed for 45 min at 42 °C. 100 ng of total RNA was mixed with 5 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 10 nm of dNTP, 50 pm of hexanucleotide mix, 100 nm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. PCR was performed in a volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl of the reverse transcription mixture, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 20 pm of each primer, 20 mm of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, in a 9600 PerkinElmer Life Sciences cycler set for 30 cycles. The PCR temperatures used were 94 °C for 1 min (denaturing), 60 °C for 1 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 1 min (polymerization) followed by an extension of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR fragments were then separated on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The specific primers for IL-6 and β-actin were selected based on published mouse IL-6 and β actin cDNA sequences. The oligonucleotide primers used were for IL-6: 5′-TTCCTCTCTGCAAGAGACT-3′ and 5′-TCAGGAAGTCTCTCTATGT-3′, and for β-actin: 5′-ATGGATGACGATATCGCT-3′ and 5′-TGGACTGTCTGATGGAGTA-3′. Western Blot Detection of Tyrosine Phosphorylation—106 cells were incubated for various times in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics with or without 125 pm of protein I/II, in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D (1 μm). After stimulation, cells were centrifuged (130 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellets were suspended for 20 min in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) (33Tachado S.D. Gerold P. McConvill M.J. Baldwin T. Quilici D. Schwarz R.T. Schofield L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). The Triton X-100-soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 25 °C. The blots were then incubated with various antibodies: anti-FAK (pY397), anti-Shc (pY317), anti-active ERK 1/2, and anti-active JNKs in TBS-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at 25 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (1 h at 25 °C) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the presence of equal amounts of FAK, ERK 1/2, JNK, and Shc proteins, bound antibodies were removed from the membrane by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C and probed again with either anti-FAK, anti-ERK 1/2, anti-JNKs, or anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies. FAK Tyrosine Kinase Assay—4 × 106 cells were incubated for 15 min in serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics with or without 125 pm protein I/II, in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D (1 μm). Cells activated for 15 min with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) were used as control. Cells were lysed as described above, and FAK was immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK polyclonal antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (50%, 100 μl) was then added for 90 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C), the pellet was used for a non-radioactive tyrosine kinase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. FAK kinase activity was assessed using protein-tyrosine kinase standards included in the assay kit. Exposure of FLSs to Protein I/II Causes Phosphorylation of FAK—Because previous observations from our laboratory indicated that, in endothelial cells, protein I/II interactions with α5β1 integrins increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and lead to IL-8 secretion (6Al-Okla S. Chatenay-Rivauday C. Klein J.P. Wachsmann D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we first investigated the role of α5β1 integrins in the FLSs activation process. The results show that addition of either increasing amounts of purified α5β1 integrins or anti-integrin β1 chain antibodies induced inhibition of protein I/II-stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 release (Fig. 1). An inhibition of cytokine release of about 80% was obtained with 10 μg/ml α5β1 integrins and 45% with 40 μg/ml anti-integrin β1 chain antibodies (p < 0.05). As observed in endothelial cells, this suggests that α5β1 integrins are implicated in the activation process leading to IL-6 and IL-8 release from protein I/II-activated FLSs. We next examined the capacity of protein I/II to stimulate phosphorylation of FAK in FLSs. Cell lysates were analyzed directly by blotting with specific anti-FAK (pY397) antibodies. Stimulation of FLSs with protein I/II for various times (1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min) resulted in an increased amount of phosphorylated FAK (Fig. 2), which was detectable within 5 min and remained elevated for at least 30 min. Fibronectin was used as a positive control. These results demonstrate that interaction of protein I/II with FLSs induces phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397. Protein I/II-induced Signaling to MAPKs and IL-6 and IL-8 Release Occurs via an FAK-dependent Pathway—Recently, Neff et al. (13Neff L. Zeisel M. Sibilia J. Schöller-Guinard M. Klein J.P. Wachsmann D. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) studied the eventual role of bacterial components such as protein I/II in promoting joint inflammation and reported that NF-κB and the MAPKs/AP-1 pathways are both involved in IL-6 and IL-8 release from FLSs stimulated with protein I/II. Thus, we next asked whether FAK could participate in the signaling events leading to IL-6 and IL-8 release from activated cells via the MAPKs pathway. In one set of studies and as preliminary experiments, we used FAK+/+ and FAK–/– primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. FAK+/+ and FAK–/– cells were incubated with protein I/II (125 pm) for 30 min, and then immunoblotting experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation of FAK+/+ fibroblasts with protein I/II increased FAK as well as ERK 1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation, however, protein I/II failed to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in FAK–/– cells. These results raise the possibility that FAK participates in MAPKs activation in protein I/II-stimulated cells. We thus explored the cytokine response of FAK–/– fibroblasts stimulated with protein I/II, using FAK+/+ fibroblasts as positive controls. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (B and C), protein I/II increased IL-6 mRNA production and IL-6 release from FAK+/+ fibroblasts, but protein I/II-induced IL-6 production was completely inhibited in FAK–/– fibroblasts (p < 0.01). This suggests that FAK is involved in protein I/II-induced release of IL-6. To rule out the possibility that the observed inhibition could be due to a non-specific inhibition of other cellular functions, FAK+/+ fibroblasts were transfected with FRNK, the C-terminal region of FAK, which localizes to focal adhesions but does not contain the FAK kinase domain and which is known to block activation of FAK when overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 3A, protein I/II treatment did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and ERK 1/2 in FRNK-transfected FAK+/+ fibroblasts. Moreover, overexpression of FRNK inhibited IL-6 release from activated cells as compared with wild-type cells (p < 0.01, Fig 3C). These observations correlate with the results obtained with FAK–/– fibroblasts. To further demonstrate the requirement of FAK in cytokine release from protein I/II-activated fibroblasts, the cytokine response of FLSs transiently transfected with FRNK was examined. FLSs transfected with a GFP-expressing vector were used as controls. Wild-type FLSs and transfected FLSs were then incubated with 125 pm protein I/II for 20 h at 37 °C. As seen in Fig. 4, overexpression of FRNK inhibited significantly IL-6 and IL-8 release from protein I/II-activated FLSs. In a complementary approach, we have also evaluated the contribution of the adaptor protein Shc to this pathway. It is known that a subset of integrins, including α5β1, activates the Ras/ERK pathway by a mechanism implicating the membrane protein caveolin and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by the tyrosine kinase Fyn (20Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). This last event is necessary and sufficient to activate MAPKs as demonstrated by results from dominant negative studies and from mouse embryos deficient in Shc (18Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Two tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been identified on Shc (34Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar): Tyr-239/240, which has been linked to c-Myc activation and Tyr-317, which appears to be critical for MAPKs activation in response to integrins and growth factor receptors. Western blotting analysis using specific anti-Shc (pY317) antibodies showed that two isoforms of Shc, p46 and p52, were constitutively phosphorylated in control FLSs and that protein I/II did not increase the level of Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). EGF was used as a positive control. To further demonstrate that Shc is not involved in cytokine synthesis, FLSs were transiently transfected with a dominant negative version of Shc (pRk5-Shc-Y317F), in which the tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated and binds Grb2 is replaced by a phenylalanine. FLSs transfected with a GFP-expressing vector were used to control transfection. Wild-type and transfected cells were then incubated with 125 pm protein I/II for 20 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 5B, overexpression of a dominant negative version of Shc had no effect on IL-6 and IL-8 release from protein I/II-activated FLSs, as compared with activated wild-type FLSs, indicating that IL-6 and IL-8 release from protein I/II-activated FLSs does not require integrin-mediated Shc (Y317) signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that FAK plays a predominant role in protein I/II-induced IL-6 and IL-8 release from activated FLSs. FAK Tyr-397 Phosphorylation Is Not Implicated in Either Signaling to MAPKs or Release of IL-6 and IL-8 —To further study the mechanisms by which FAK is required for protein I/II-induced IL-6 and IL-8 release, we used cytochalasin D, which has been shown to prevent FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (35Chen Q. Kinch M. Lin T. Burrid"
https://openalex.org/W2020124396,"RGS proteins comprise a large family of proteins named for their ability to negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. RGS6 is a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins possessing DEP (disheveled/Egl-10/pleckstrin) homology and GGL (G protein γ-subunit-like) domains in addition to the semiconserved RGS domain. Our previous study documented unusual complexity in splicing of the human RGS6 gene, and we demonstrated localization of various RGS6 splice forms at sites other than the plasma membrane, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where G proteins are not localized (Chatterjee, T. K., Liu, Z., and Fisher, R. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 30261–30271). Here we provide new evidence that mild heat stress, proteasome-mediated proteotoxic stress, and HSF1 expression induces dramatic relocalization of RGS6 proteins from such sites to nucleoli. This response was observed in COS-7 cells expressing various splice forms of RGS6, was not elicited by other forms of cellular stress and was observed in cells treated with various protein kinase inhibitors or co-expressing a dominant-negative kinase inactive SAPK. The RGS domain of RGS6 was identified as a primary structural module providing support for its stress-induced nucleolar trafficking and various other RGS proteins or their isolated RGS domains similarly undergo nucleolar migration in response to heat or proteotoxic stress or during co-expression of HSF1. The atypical RGS domains of axin and AKAP10 also underwent stress-induced nucleolar trafficking while structural domains outside of the RGS domain of some RGS proteins can override nucleolar trafficking in response to stress. Inhibition of rDNA transcription also promoted nucleolar migration of RGS6, a response previously observed in a subset of nucleolar proteins. The DEP domain of RGS6, but not its RGS domain, conferred structural support for its transcription-linked nucleolar migration. RGS6 exhibited trafficking from subnuclear dots to nucleoli in response to heat-, proteotoxic- or transcription-linked stress. These results provide new evidence that mammalian RGS proteins undergo unique subcellular trafficking in response to specific forms of cellular stress and implicate the RGS family of proteins in cellular stress signaling pathways. RGS proteins comprise a large family of proteins named for their ability to negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. RGS6 is a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins possessing DEP (disheveled/Egl-10/pleckstrin) homology and GGL (G protein γ-subunit-like) domains in addition to the semiconserved RGS domain. Our previous study documented unusual complexity in splicing of the human RGS6 gene, and we demonstrated localization of various RGS6 splice forms at sites other than the plasma membrane, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where G proteins are not localized (Chatterjee, T.

Here we provide new evidence that mild heat stress, proteasome-mediated proteotoxic stress, and HSF1 expression induces dramatic relocalization of RGS6 proteins from such sites to nucleoli. This response was observed in COS-7 cells expressing various splice forms of RGS6, was not elicited by other forms of cellular stress and was observed in cells treated with various protein kinase inhibitors or co-expressing a dominant-negative kinase inactive SAPK. The RGS domain of RGS6 was identified as a primary structural module providing support for its stress-induced nucleolar trafficking and various other RGS proteins or their isolated RGS domains similarly undergo nucleolar migration in response to heat or proteotoxic stress or during co-expression of HSF1. The atypical RGS domains of axin and AKAP10 also underwent stress-induced nucleolar trafficking while structural domains outside of the RGS domain of some RGS proteins can override nucleolar trafficking in response to stress. Inhibition of rDNA transcription also promoted nucleolar migration of RGS6, a response previously observed in a subset of nucleolar proteins. The DEP domain of RGS6, but not its RGS domain, conferred structural support for its transcription-linked nucleolar migration. RGS6 exhibited trafficking from subnuclear dots to nucleoli in response to heat-, proteotoxic- or transcription-linked stress. These results provide new evidence that mammalian RGS proteins undergo unique subcellular trafficking in response to specific forms of cellular stress and implicate the RGS family of proteins in cellular stress signaling pathways.

Genomics. 2002; 79: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). From initial genetic studies in yeast implicating the RGS protein Sst2p in negative regulation of pheromone signaling, much evidence suggests RGS proteins may act to facilitate termination of heterotrimeric G protein signaling initiated by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 3De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Indeed, the hallmark RGS domain, present in all RGS proteins, mediates their interaction with and enhancement of the intrinsic GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits in vitro. Because Gα subunits are active when bound to GTP, and form inactive complexes with cognate Gβγ subunits following GTP hydrolysis, such actions of RGS proteins would shut down signaling by both active Gα and Gβγ signaling proteins. This activity would explain the enhancement of G protein signaling observed in genetic mutants lacking RGS proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans (4Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the signaling and physiological role of these proteins in mammals, although genetic knockout of RGS9 in mice showed that RGS9 is essential for acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by transducin (Gt) and normal recovery of the photoresponse (6Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Yet, there are many unanswered questions regarding the structure and function of RGS proteins. Although some RGS proteins exhibit specificity toward specific Gα subunits, the number of RGS proteins that exist far exceeds that of their presumed G protein targets. RGS proteins are predicted to accumulate at the plasma membrane to function as GAPs for G proteins, yet this evidence is lacking for all but a few RGS proteins. Indeed, we demonstrated localization of RGS proteins in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and Golgi and provided evidence for extra-RGS domain sequences in subcellular targeting of these proteins (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and several other laboratories have reported localization of RGS proteins in the nucleus (8Dulin N.O.

Also, considerable structural differences exist among members of the RGS family and distinct subfamilies of these proteins have been described (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 3De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These subfamilies share similarities both within their RGS domains as well as their extra-RGS domain sequences. The precise significance of these structural differences are not yet clear, although some evidence suggests that extra-RGS domain sequences may be involved in modulating their G protein regulatory activity by regulating their localization to the plasma membrane or to specific receptors (10Heximer S.P.

Structural domains outside of the RGS domain have been implicated in interactions of RGS proteins with other proteins or in different functional activities, e.g. GGL domains, present in R7 subfamily of RGS proteins, specifically bind the atypical Gβ subunit Gβ5 (17Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we demonstrate that the subcellular localization and trafficking of RGS6 and other RGS proteins is dynamically regulated in response to mild heat stress, proteasome-mediated proteotoxic stress and during expression of HSF1. Our findings suggest the involvement of RGS proteins in new signaling pathways or in cellular functions related to specific stress signaling pathways. Our finding that the RGS domain provides structural support for stress-induced nucleolar trafficking of RGS proteins reveals a role for this signature domain of RGS proteins in functions distinct from their actions on G protein α-subunits. Evidence presented here for a role of the DEP domain in both stress-induced and rDNA transcription-linked nucleolar trafficking of RGS6 is intriguing in light of recent evidence that expression of the homologous domain of Sst2p regulates stress-related gene expression in yeast (21Burchett S.A.

Our results, together with the observed up-regulation of two members of the RGS protein family by stress stimuli (22Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J.

Cell culture medium and serum was provided by the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (University of Iowa). HSF1 transcription factor was PCR-amplified from human placental cDNA and cloned in pCMV vector (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primers and other molecular biological reagents were obtained from the University of Iowa DNA Core. RGS6 cDNAs—Full-length cDNAs encoding various forms of RGS6 were amplified and cloned into EGFP vector as detailed in the accompanying article (55Chatterjee T.K. Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30261-30271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RGS6 cDNAs were cloned also into pCMVTag2 to incorporate an N-terminal FLAG epitope, or into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to incorporate a C-terminal c-Myc epitope. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). MCF7 cells were grown in Eagle's MEM with 2 mm glutamine and Earle's balanced salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1 mm pyruvate, supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine insulin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with vectors containing various RGS protein and HSF1 cDNAs by electroporation (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus as we described previously (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were used in experiments ∼40 h following transfection. Heat Stress Treatment—COS-7 cells were subjected to heat stress by incubation at 43 °C for 30 min in a water bath (26Jolly C. Usson Y. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6769-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were fixed immediately or allowed to recover at 37 °C for 2–4 h in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analysis of EGFP-tagged RGS6 proteins was performed exactly as we described (27Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence detection of fibrillarin, nucleolin, and FLAG- or c-Myc-tagged RGS6, fixed cells were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (diluted ∼1:1000) in DPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed three times with DPBS and incubated in Texas red-conjugated anti-human (fibrillarin) or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse (FLAG and c-Myc) secondary antibody in DPBS for 1 h at room temperature. RNaseA treatment, propidium iodide staining, and confocal microscopy was performed as we described (27Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Images shown are representative of a minimum of 1000 cells derived from four or more separate transfections. Heat Stress Promotes Nucleolar Migration of RGS6 Proteins—Our previous studies demonstrated distinct subcellular distribution patterns of RGS6 proteins upon their expression in COS-7 cells (55Chatterjee T.K. Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30261-30271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RGS6L and its -GGL counterpart localized exclusively in the cytoplasm while RGS6S exhibited three distinct patterns of subcellular localization, punctate cytoplasmic/nuclear, nuclear, and nucleolar. In contrast to RGS6L, cytoplasmic localization of RGS6S required its intact GGL domain, demonstrated by the finding that RGS6S(-GGL) localized exclusively in the nucleus or nucleolus. The observed nucleolar localization of RGS6S was intriguing in light of a recent report that expression of the DEP domain of the yeast RGS protein Sst2p altered expression of numerous yeast genes, many possessing STREs (21Burchett S.A. Flanary P. Aston C. Jiang L. Young K.H. Uetz P. Fields S. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22156-22167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Observed increases in STRE reporter gene activity in deletion mutants of proteins these workers identified as Sst2p DEP binding partners could reflect the existence of a signaling pathway between Sst2p and stress responses. We considered a corollary to this possibility by investigating whether cellular stress influenced subcellular localization of RGS6 proteins, and presumably their function, despite the fact that we observed constitutive nuclear or nucleolar localization of RGS6 proteins that lack the DEP domain, shared by Sst2p. Fig. 1 shows that RGS6 proteins undergo a rapid and dramatic shift in response to mild heat stress (43 °C, 30 min) and accumulate exclusively within nucleoli. This response was observed both for RGS6L and RGS6S and their -GGL counterparts. Nucleolar localization of RGS6S and RGS6S(-GGL) occurred rapidly with essentially all cells exhibiting exclusive nucleolar localization of these proteins immediately following heat stress. Only a small fraction of cells exhibited nucleolar localization of RGS6L or RGS6L(-GGL) at this time point; however, predominant or exclusive localization of these two proteins was observed in essentially all cells within 2–4 h following the brief heat stress. A significant number of cells (5–20%) expressing RGS6L or RGS6L(-GGL) exhibited granular or dotted distribution of these proteins in the nucleus in addition to nucleolar-localized protein (not shown). This dotted subnuclear distribution was observed more frequently at earlier times following heat stress, preceding the observed nucleolar localization of the proteins in cells. Thus, RGS6L appears to undergo subnuclear trafficking, organizing first in discrete subnuclear sites or dots followed by nucleolar migration and accumulation. These results provide the first evidence for heat stress-induced trafficking of a member of the RGS protein family. Proteotoxic Stress Induces Nucleolar Migration of RGS6 Proteins—Proteasome inhibition in cells leads to accumulation of proteins normally targeted for degradation. Interestingly, treatment of cells with proteasomal inhibitors like MG132 mimics many cellular responses to mild heat stress including activation of heat shock factors and induction of heat shock and chaperone proteins (28Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 29Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7163-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine whether cellular stress induced by proteasomal inhibition, known as proteotoxic stress, had any effect on RGS6 subcellular localization. Fig. 2A shows the subcellular localization patterns of RGS6L and RGS6S and their -GGL counterparts in response to treatment of cells with MG132 (10 μm). Essentially all cells expressing RGS6S and RGS6S(-GGL) exhibited near exclusive nucleolar localization of these proteins following 2 h of MG132 treatment, although a fraction of protein was present in discrete nuclear foci or dots. RGS6L and RGS6L(-GGL) showed little nucleolar localization following 2 h of MG132 treatment (not shown), although more than 75% of cells exhibited nucleolar localization of these proteins following 4 h of MG132 treatment (Fig. 2A). Even under this longer treatment condition, cells expressing RGS6L and RGS6L-(-GGL) did not show exclusive nucleolar localization of these proteins, as some cytoplasmic-localized protein was apparent in most cells. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that a pharmacologic mimic of mild heat stress induces nucleolar localization of RGS6 proteins. Fig. 2B shows that treatment of cells with another class of proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin similarly promoted nucleolar migration of RGS6L(-GGL) while treatment with an inhibitor of calpain and other proteases (ALLN) did not produce this response. Treatment of cells with a lysosomal protease inhibitor (chloroquine, 0.1 mm, 2 h) and a serine protease inhibitor (AEBSF, 1 mm, 2 h) also did not promote nucleolar localization of RGS6L(-GGL). Thus, only proteasome-mediated proteotoxic stress induces nucleolar migration of RGS6. We performed control experiments to validate our use of GFP-tagged forms of RGS6 for these studies and to confirm the identity of nucleoli as the sites of accumulation of these proteins in response to stress. To examine whether the presence of the N-terminal GFP tag influenced stress-induced localization of RGS6S, we compared MG132-induced localization of RGS6S(-GGL) tagged with N-terminal GFP to that of the protein tagged with C-terminal c-Myc or N-terminal FLAG epitopes. Fig. 2C shows the nature and location of the tag on RGS6 did not influence its nucleolar localization in response to MG132 treatment of cells. We used the resident nucleolar marker protein fibrillarin to confirm that RGS6 proteins localize to nucleolar sites in response to MG132 treatment and mild heat stress. Fig. 2D shows that RGS6S(-GGL) colocalizes with fibrillarin in COS-7 cells treated with MG132 for 2 h and the same results were observed in response to mild heat stress. We also observed stress-induced nucleloar migration of RGS6 proteins in cells other than COS-7 cells. Fig. 2E shows that RGS6S(-GGL) undergoes MG132-induced nucleolar migration in MCF7 cells independent of the level of protein expression. As shown, cells expressing RGS6S(-GGL) at typical as well as barely detectable levels (indicated by arrows in overlay) exhibited nucleolar (labeled with nucleolin antibody) localization of RGS6S(-GGL) in response to MG132. Thus, stress-induced nucleolar migration of RGS6 is not dependent upon a particular cell type or level of protein expression. Other forms of cellular stress failed to promote nucleolar localization of RGS6 proteins. Treatment of cells with oxidative (0.5 mm sodium arsenite, 30 min) or hyperosmolar stress (1 m sorbitol, 1 h) failed to promote nucleolar localization of RGS6L, RGS6S or their -GGL counterparts. Similarly, we observed no effect on subcellular localization of these proteins during treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (20 μg/ml, 1 h), calcium ionophore A23187 (2 μm, 2 h) or PKC activator PMA (5 μg/ml, 2 h) (not shown). These results suggest that nucleolar migration of RGS6 is induced selectively in response to thermal stress or inhibition of proteosomal pathways but not other forms of cellular stress or treatments. RGS6 Nucleolar Migration Does Not Involve Stress-activated Protein Kinases—Various cellular stresses including oxidative, hyperosmolar, and heat stress activate p38 kinase and C-terminal Jun kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (32Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). Our findings that nucleolar localization of RGS6 was induced selectively by mild heat stress or MG132 treatment and not oxidative or hyperosmolar stress suggested that this process might occur by mechanisms independent of p38 and JNK/SAPK pathways. To test this possibility, we examined heat stress- and MG132-induced nucleolar localization of RGS6S(-GGL) in cells treated with the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm for 2 h) or co-transfected with dominant-negative kinase inactive SAPK (24Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These treatments had no effects on stress-induced nucleolar localization of RGS6S-(-GGL) (not shown) suggesting that this process is not mediated by these generalized stress-activated kinases. Identification of RGS Domain as a Critical Domain for Nucleolar Localization of RGS6 and Other RGS Proteins—We undertook studies to examine the structural modules that mediate nucleolar targeting of RGS6 proteins in response to heat stress and MG132 treatment. Fig. 3A shows confocal microscopic images of COS-7 cells expressing full-length RGS6LGFP (1–472) or various deletion constructs of RGS6L fused to GFP. The 9 deletion constructs represent contiguous and sometimes overlapping domains of RGS6 that were selected to evaluate systematically the structural basis for nucleolar targeting of RGS6 in response to heat stress or MG132 treatment. Fig. 3B shows the region of RGS6 being examined in each construct and the scoring of the nucleolar accumulation observed. The images shown are from MG132-treated cells although the same patterns were observed in cells treated with mild heat stress. GFP alone failed to show nucleolar localization in response to either MG132 or mild heat stress treatment (not shown). We began by evaluating nucleolar localization of constructs encompassing all or portions of the N-terminal domain unique to RGS6L. Constructs 1–182, 1–121, and 40–121 (DEP domain alone) all showed nucleolar localization while construct 70–121 did not. This result suggests the presence of structural modules mediating nucleolar migration in a region mapping to the DEP domain of RGS6L in response to MG132. Construct 70–182, but not construct 70–121, was localized to nucleoli suggesting another targeting module in the region between amino acids 121 and 182 of RGS6L. Two additional constructs mapped the sequences C-terminal to this region and up to the RGS domain of RGS6L. Both of these constructs, 172–231 and 232–332, the latter encompassing the GGL domain of RGS6 proteins, failed to exhibit nucleolar localization in response to MG132. Of particular interest was the finding that construct 232–472, but not 232–332, exhibited nucleolar localization in response to MG132, implicating sequence modules in the RGS domain or C terminus of RGS6L in nucleolar migration. Clear evidence for support of the RGS domain in this activity was provided by the observed nucleolar localization of construct 333–452, which represents the RGS domain of RGS6. Together these results demonstrate that RGS6L possesses three structural modules that are capable of nucleolar localization in response to MG132 treatment, mapped by these studies to the DEP domain, the RGS domain and the region between amino acids 122 and 182 of RGS6L. We observed some differences in the sensitivity of various constructs to heat stress or MG132-induced nucleolar migration. While constructs encompassing the RGS domain of RGS6S proteins exhibited nucleolar migration immediately following mild heat stress or 2 h of MG132 treatment, nucleolar localization of N-te"

AhpD also has an alkylhydroperoxidase activity of its own. The AhpC/AhpD system provides critical antioxidant protection, particularly in the absence of the catalase-peroxidase KatG, which is suppressed in most isoniazid-resistant strains. Based on the crystal structure, we proposed recently a catalytic mechanism for AhpD involving a proton relay in which the Glu118 carboxylate group, via His137 and a water molecule, deprotonates the catalytic residue Cys133 (Nunn, C. M., Djordjevic, S., Hillas, P. J., Nishida, C., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 20033–20040). A possible role for His132 in subsequent formation of the Cys133-Cys130 disulfide bond was also noted. To test this proposed mechanism, we have expressed the H137F, H137Q, H132F, H132Q, E118F, E118Q, C133S, and C130S mutants of AhpD, determined the crystal structures of the H137F and H132Q mutants, estimated the pK a values of the cysteine residues, and defined the kinetic properties of the mutant proteins. The collective results strongly support the proposed catalytic mechanism for AhpD. AhpD, a protein with two cysteine residues, is required for physiological reduction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis alkylhydroperoxidase AhpC. AhpD also has an alkylhydroperoxidase activity of its own. The AhpC/AhpD system provides critical antioxidant protection, particularly in the absence of the catalase-peroxidase KatG, which is suppressed in most isoniazid-resistant strains. Based on the crystal structure, we proposed recently a catalytic mechanism for AhpD involving a proton relay in which the Glu118 carboxylate group, via His137 and a water molecule, deprotonates the catalytic residue Cys133 (Nunn, C. M., Djordjevic, S., Hillas, P. J., Nishida, C., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 20033–20040). A possible role for His132 in subsequent formation of the Cys133-Cys130 disulfide bond was also noted. To test this proposed mechanism, we have expressed the H137F, H137Q, H132F, H132Q, E118F, E118Q, C133S, and C130S mutants of AhpD, determined the crystal structures of the H137F and H132Q mutants, estimated the pK a values of the cysteine residues, and defined the kinetic properties of the mutant proteins. The collective results strongly support the proposed catalytic mechanism for AhpD. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects an estimated 8 million per year and kills 2–3 million people in the same time span (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). It is estimated that ∼2 billion people have been exposed to this lethal pathogenic organism and thus are at risk of developing the active disease. The majority of infected individuals reside in the third world, but the rates of infection in other areas that are undergoing rapid social change, such as the Soviet Union, are increasing at an alarming rate (2Keshavjee S. Becerra M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1201Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, partially as a result of the symbiotic relationship between human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is rapidly increasing (3Pablos-Méndez A. Rafiglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Labregts-Van Weezenbeek C.S.B. Kim S.J. Chaulet P. Nunn P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The resurgence of tuberculosis as a world-wide phenomenon, in conjunction with the recent determination of the M. tuberculosis genome, has fuelled a renewed search for agents that are active against drug-resistant strains, completely sterilize the infection, and/or shorten the duration of drug therapy and thus promote drug compliance. Mutations in the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase KatG result in resistance to the prodrug isoniazid, because KatG is required to oxidize this drug to its biologically active form (4Zhang Y.

Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, mutations in the flavoprotein monooxygenase EtaA result in resistance to ethionamide, because it is also a prodrug that must be oxidized by EtaA to its active form (10DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Baulard A.R. Betts J.C. Engohang-Ndong J. Quan S.

Interestingly, even though the activating enzymes differ, the mutations of KatG and EtaA that cause resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide, respectively, result in elevated expression of AhpC (4Zhang Y.

A. 1999; 96: 12833-12838Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). AhpC is thought to provide protection against the oxidative stress associated with both of these mutations, particularly against loss of the KatG peroxidase activity (12Sherman D.R. Mdlui K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). AhpC is a member of the ubiquitous peroxiredoxin family. In the peroxiredoxins, a cysteine residue reacts with a peroxide or other oxidant to give a sulfenic acid (-SOH) intermediate (19Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Hoffman B. Hecht H.-J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364PubMed Google Scholar). This sulfenic acid is then converted to a disulfide bond by intramolecular or intermolecular reaction with a second sulfhydryl group. Finally, the disulfide bond is reduced to regenerate the cysteine thiol groups. The disulfide bond is reduced by different mechanisms in different organisms; in yeast, the reduction is mediated by thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase (21Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in Salmonella typhimurium by a flavoprotein known as AphF (22Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13357-13364Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The M. tuberculosis thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, however, do not reduce the corresponding AhpC (23Zhang Z. Hillas P.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and no homologue of AhpF is detected in the genome of this organism by BLAST searches. However, a gene (Rv2429) coding for AhpD, a protein with no sequence identity to AhpC or AhpF, is located immediately adjacent to the AhpC gene. Recent work has shown that AhpD functions as the reducing partner for AhpC. AhpD itself is reduced by a novel system consisting of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (SucB), a lipoamide-containing protein, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). SucB can be replaced in this system by dihydrolipoamide itself. Interestingly, AhpD, in addition to being the reducing partner for AhpC, has independent alkylhydroperoxidase activity of its own when AhpF from S. typhimurium is used as a surrogate reducing partner (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of AhpD was independently determined by two laboratories (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Nunn C.M. Djordjevic S. Hillas P.J. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20033-20040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AhpD is a homotrimeric protein in which the individual subunits consist of 177 amino acids with a molecular mass of 18,781 Da (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Nunn C.M. Djordjevic S. Hillas P.J. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20033-20040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two cysteines, Cys130 and Cys133, are present in the AhpD sequence (numbering based on inclusion of the initial methionine) in a Cys-His-Ser-Cys motif within a novel protein fold. Site-specific mutagenesis of the cysteines has shown that both cysteines, but particularly Cys133, are critical for the alkylhydroperoxidase activity supported by the S. typhimurium AhpF (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of structural homology to other proteins, analysis of the detailed structure of AhpD identified several residues that could be involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (26Nunn C.M. Djordjevic S. Hillas P.J. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20033-20040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) based on local structural analogy to the active site of a functional analogue, thioredoxin. Specifically, the carboxylate anion of Glu118 is 2.6 Å from the nitrogen of His137 and is hydrogen-bonded to it (Fig. 1). His137 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule 2.5 Å away that, in turn, interacts with Cys133 at a distance of 3.3 Å. These hydrogen bonding interactions provide a reasonable mechanism for deprotonation of Cys133, the residue thought to react with the O–O bond of peroxides or the disulfide bond present in the oxidized form of AhpC. The location of His132 4.8 Å from Cys130 and 3.7 Å from Cys133 in the reduced enzyme suggested that it might also play a role in the catalytic mechanism. These mechanistic proposals have been tested in the present study by mutating the residues, determining the crystal structures of two of the mutants, and determining the effects of the mutations on the catalytic activities in both the AhpF and AhpD/AhpC/lipoamide/dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase assay systems. Materials—All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was from Novagen, and strain DH5α was from Invitrogen. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and polyethyleneimine was from Research Biotechnologies, Inc. (Natick, MA). LB medium was obtained from Invitrogen. Chloramphenicol, NaCl, NaOH, SDS, and MOPS 1The abbreviation used is: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. were from Fisher. Protein molecular weight standards were from Invitrogen. Purified proteins were concentrated using Millipore YM10 regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Promega (Madison, WI), and polyethyleneimine (10% solution) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Lipoamide, D,L-6,8-thioctic acid amide, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4) from bovine intestinal mucosa, 100 units/mg protein were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California, San Francisco, CA. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 DNA thermal cycler was used for PCR experiments. An Amersham Biosciences Sephadex 200 column, connected to an Amersham Biosciences PCC-500 fast performance liquid chromatography system, was used for the final stage of protein purification. A Hewlett-Packard HP-8452 UV-visible spectrophotometer was used for all spectroscopic measurements. S. typhimurium AhpF was generously provided by Patrick Hillas, as were the C130S and C133S constructs (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All expression plasmids were introduced into competent BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. AhpD Mutagenesis—The single mutants of AhpD were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) as described previously (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers used for the mutagenesis were as follows: AhpDE118F (forward primer, 5′-AAA GCC AAC TTC TTT CTC TGG TCC TTC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GAA GGA CCA GAG AAA GAA GTT GGC TTT-3′), AhpDE118Q (forward primer, 5′-AAA GCC AAC TTC CAG CTC TGG TCC TTC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GAA GGA CCA GAG CTG GAA GTT GGC TTT-3′), AhpDH137Q (forward primer, 5′-TGC CTC GTC GCC CAA GAG CAC ACG CTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CAG CGT GTG CTC TTG GGC GAC GAG GCA-3′), AhpDH137F (forward primer, 5′-TGC CTC GTC GCC TTC GAG CAC ACG CTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CAG CGT GTG CTC GAA GGC GAC GAG GCA-3′), AhpDH132Q (forward primer, 5′-AAC GGG TGC TCG CAA TGC CTC GTC GCC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GGC GAC GAG GCA TTG CGA GCA CCC GTT-3′), AhpDH132F (forward primer, 5′-AAC GGG TGC TCG TTT TGC CTC GTC GCC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GGC GAC GAG GCA AAA CGA GCA CCC GTT-3′). The underlined codons represent the mutation. Bacterial Cell Growth—Bacterial growth was carried out at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. One colony was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing the antibiotic, and the culture was incubated for 12 h. The culture was used to inoculate a 1-liter culture of LB containing the antibiotic at a ratio of 10 ml/liter. When the A 600 value of the culture reached 0.7–0.8, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Incubation was continued for 12 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C overnight. Protein Purification—M. tuberculosis AhpD and mutants were expressed heterologously in E. coli and purified according to the protocol of Hillas et al. (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were suspended in a 6-fold excess (with respect to the initial weight of cells) of lysis buffer. The solution was stirred for 60 min at 4 °C. A polyethyleneimine supernatant was prepared and loaded onto the Q-Sepharose column. After loading, the resin was washed with the same buffer for 20 column volumes. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.75 m KCl in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The protein eluted at ∼0.2 m KCl. Fractions containing maximum amount of protein, as assessed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels using the PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences), were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml or greater using a Millipore concentrator equipped with a YM10 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membrane. Enzyme concentrations were determined from the molar absorption coefficients using the method of Pace et al. (27Pace C.N. Vadjos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) and a molar extinction coefficient of 15,720 m–1 cm–1. In contrast to AhpD a single ion-exchange chromatographic protocol was insufficient to purify the AhpD E118Q and H137Q mutants. Further purification by gel filtration on Superdex 200 using 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA was therefore carried out with all proteins. The proteins were judged to be >95% pure by denaturing SDS-PAGE. The proteins were finally aliquoted into 25- or 100-μl volumes, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C until used. AhpF-dependent Activity Assays—Rates of hydroperoxide reduction were determined anaerobically in a coupled assay with AhpF, monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm because of NADH oxidation as reported previously (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The assays typically contained 2 mm hydroperoxide substrate in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NADH, 20 μm AhpD or mutant, and 10 μm AhpF. Background NADH oxidation caused by AhpF was monitored, the hydroperoxide substrate was added, and the enzymatic rate was observed. AhpD-dependent Peroxidase Activity AhpC Assays—The rate of NADH oxidation catalyzed by AhpC in the presence of AhpD, lipoamide, and bovine lipoamide dehydrogenase was measured as described by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Typical conditions for the assays were as follows: 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADH, 2.5 μm AhpC, 2.5 μm AhpD, 0.2 units of bovine dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, and 50 μm lipoamide. This assay can be used to evaluate the activity of AhpD and AhpD mutants, because the AhpD-supported activity of AhpC directly depends on the activity of AhpD. For steady-state kinetic assays, the substrate concentration was varied, and data were fit to the equation v = V max [S]/(K m + [S]). Measurement of Thiol pK a Values by UV Absorption—The pH-dependent ionization of the cysteine thiols was monitored by the absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm as described (28Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Reckenfelderbäumer N. Krauth-Siegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17548-17555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All of the measurements were carried out at 25 °C, with 10 μm AhpD or AhpD mutant in 1 mm each of argon-purged citrate, borate, and phosphate buffer containing 0.2 mm KCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The solution was titrated with 0.2 m KOH. Crystallization—Crystallization of the AhpD H137F and H132Q mutants was carried out by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method reported previously (26Nunn C.M. Djordjevic S. Hillas P.J. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20033-20040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hanging drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (4.5 mg/ml in 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm KCL, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5.0 mm dithiothreitol) with a reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.6 containing 200 mm ammonium acetate and 26% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals grew as rhombohedral prisms over a period of days. The crystals belong to space group C2 for both mutant structures with cell dimensions a = 96.60 Å, b = 62.18 Å, c = 89.48 Å, β = 121.81° for H137F and a = 100.12 Å, b = 58.65 Å, c = 88.91 Å, β = 120.47° for the H132Q mutant. A Matthews coefficient of 1.96 corresponds to 37% (v/v) solvent for the crystallographic asymmetric unit of H137F, and a value of 1.93 corresponds to 34% (v/v) solvent in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of H132Q (30Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7926) Google Scholar). Data Collection and Processing—Data collection parameters are shown in Table I. All data processing, integration, and scaling was carried out using HKL (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

All refinement was carried out using the program CNS v.1.1 (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

AFMB-IFRC1, Marseille, France2000Google Scholar). A protein trimer exists within the crystallographic asymmetric unit. One AhpD trimer from the native crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1GU9) was used as a model for molecular replacement. Cross-rotation and translation functions were calculated using data from 15 to 4 Å resolution, and a clear solution was obtained for both mutant structures. Following molecular replacement rigid body refinement was carried out prior to full positional refinement using simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics, anisotropic scaling, energy minimization, individual isotropic B-factor refinement, and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood target. Refinement progressed well with further rounds of positional and individual B factor refinement. Toward the end of the structure refinement electron density maps were used to locate and include solvent water within the refinement.

Catalytic Activities of AhpD Mutant Proteins—The recently determined crystal structure of AhpD suggests important roles for Glu118, Cys130, Cys133, His132, and His137 in the catalytic mechanism of AhpD (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Nunn C.M. Djordjevic S. Hillas P.J. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

To ascertain the roles of these residues, single mutants were constructed in which each of the cysteines was mutated to a serine, and each of the two histidines and the glutamic acid was mutated to either a phenylalanine or a glutamine. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified by minor modifications of the protocol reported earlier for purification of wild-type AhpD (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A.

The two AhpD Cys → Ser mutants and the two His → Phe mutants were expressed in yields comparable with those of the wild-type protein (∼25 mg/L), but the AhpD H137Q, E118F, and E118Q mutants were expressed at significantly lower levels (∼20% of wild-type). The glutamine mutants do not appear to bind to Q-Sepharose as strongly as native AhpD or the other mutants and tend to unfold and degrade relatively easily. The glutamine substitution may destabilize the protein fold or may force the protein into a conformation that exposes proteolytically sensitive sites. The catalytic activities of the mutants were evaluated in two assay systems. In the first system, the ability of the AhpD mutants to reduce cumene hydroperoxide in the presence of the S. typhimurium AhpF and NADH was evaluated (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This assay system tests the ability of AhpD to directly reduce a hydroperoxide in a reaction supported by a surrogate electron donor partner. The AhpF-supported catalytic activities of wild-type AhpD and its mutants are shown in Fig. 2. As reported previously (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the two cysteine mutations impair the alkyl peroxidase activity of AhpD, with mutation of Cys133 completely suppressing the activity and mutation of Cys130 decreasing it to less than 5% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 2). Likewise, the two His to Phe mutations decrease the catalytic activity, but mutation of His137 causes a greater decrease than mutation of His132. Mutation of the two His residues to glutamines also decreases the level of activity but to a lower extent than mutation to phenylalanines. As found for the phenylalanine mutants, the H137Q mutation decreased the activity more severely than the H132Q mutation. Replacement of Glu118 by a glutamine only modestly lowered the catalytic activity, whereas replacement by a phenylalanine decreased the activity to a much higher extent. In the second assay system, reduction of cumene hydroperoxide was measured in the fully reconstituted system consisting of AhpC, the AhpD mutant, lipoamide, bovine dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, and NADH (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The lipoamide-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-AhpC assay (Fig. 3) gives higher absolute alkylhydroperoxidase activities than the AhpF-dependent assay (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 3, the impairment of the catalytic activities caused by the mutations follows the same trends as seen for direct reduction of the peroxide by AhpD/AhpF. The ratios among the activities of the different mutants are similar to those found in the AhpF assay. Thus, the two cysteine mutants are completely inactive in this assay, in agreement with an earlier report (25Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the H137F mutation causes a great"

We have compared the sequences of mitochondrial DNA extracted from museum skins of white-footed mice caught in the Chicago area since 1855 and from modern mice trapped alive in the same locations.

The genotype most common 100 years ago is now extremely rare, indicating that the mammalian mitochondrial genome can undergo rapid evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1991739587,"Glucocorticoids are effective inhibitors of epidermal proliferation and skin tumorigenesis. Glucocorticoids affect cellular functions via glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a well-known transcription factor. Recently, we generated skin-targeted transgenic mice overexpressing GR under control of the keratin5 promoter (K5-GR mice). To test the hypothesis that GR plays a role as a tumor suppressor in skin, we bred K5-GR transgenic mice with Tg.AC transgenic mice, which express v-Ha-ras oncogene in the skin, and compared the susceptibility of F1 offspring to TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis. GR overexpression in the epidermis dramatically inhibited skin tumor development. In K5-GR/ras+ double transgenic mice papillomas developed later and the average number of tumors per animal was 15% (in males) and 40% (in females) of the number seen in wild type (w.t./ras+) littermates. In addition, the papillomas in w.t./ras+ animals were eight to nine times larger. GR overexpression resulted in a decrease in keratinocyte proliferation combined with a modest increase in apoptosis and differentiation of keratinocytes in K5-GR/ras+ papillomas. Our data clearly indicate that interference of GR transgenic protein with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor had resulted in NF-kappaB blockage in K5-GR/ras+ tumors. We discuss the role of NF-kappaB blockage in tumor-suppressor effect of GR."

It has been shown that the two-chain kinin-free kininogen has the properties of anti-adhesion, anti-platelet aggregation, and anti-thrombosis, whereas bradykinin is a potent vasodilator and mediator of inflammation. In this study we show that the human kininogen gene is strongly up-regulated by agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor for bile acids. In primary human hepatocytes, both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate and synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 increased kininogen mRNA with a maximum induction of 8–10-fold. A more robust induction of kininogen expression was observed in HepG2 cells, where kininogen mRNA was increased by chenodeoxycholate or GW4064 up to 130–140-fold as shown by real time PCR. Northern blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of kininogen expression by FXR agonists. To determine whether kininogen is a direct target of FXR, we examined the sequence of the kininogen promoter and identified a highly conserved FXR response element (inverted repeat, IR-1) in the proximity of the kininogen promoter (–66/–54). FXR/RXRα heterodimers specifically bind to this IR-1. A construct of a minimal promoter with the luciferase reporter containing this IR-1 was transactivated by FXR. Deletion or mutation of this IR-1 abolished FXR-mediated promoter activation, indicating that this IR-1 element is responsible for the promoter transactivation by FXR.

To determine whether the kininogen gene is a direct target of FXR, we first cloned the kininogen promoter and then identified an IR-1 element in the promoter. We further demonstrate that the FXR/RXRα heterodimer binds to the IR-1 in the kininogen promoter, and this binding is essential for FXR-mediated promoter activation. Mutation of this IR-1 abolished its binding to FXR/RXRα heterodimer and also abolished FXR mediated promoter activation. We conclude that the human kininogen gene is directly transactivated by FXR via the IR-1 element in the kininogen promoter. Results from this study suggest that FXR and bile acids may play an important role in regulation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—cDNA encoding human FXR or RXRα was transcribed and translated using the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for the EMSAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The EMSA was performed as previously described (18Grober J.

Briefly, 2 μl of the in vitro translated FXR or RXR protein alone or together were added to 20 μl of reaction containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Cold competitor oligonucleotides including the wild type kininogen FXRE (5′-CAAATGAGCAGGTTAACAACCCCAGTG-3′), mutated kininogen FXRE (5′-ATGCAAATGAGCAaaTTAACAAttCCAGTGTTGC-3′) or idealized IR-1 containing an IR-1 consensus (5′-GATGGGCCAAGGTCAATGACCTCGGGG-3′) were added in 50×, 100×, and 200× excess. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 10 fmol of the 5′ end-labeled kininogen FXRE probes were added and continuously incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE (0.89 m Tris, 0.89 m boric acid, 0.02 m disodium EDTA for 10× TBE). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. FXR Transactivation—HepG2 cells were transfected in 96-well plates using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as previously described (17Cui J. Heard T.S.

Transfection mixes for each well contained 0.405 μl of FuGENE 6, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hFXR, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα, 10.4 ng of pGL3 enhancer-kininogen-Promoter-Luc, and 103.8 ng of pCMV-lacZ. The treatment of transfected cells with various FXR ligands, assays for luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were performed following the same protocols as previously described (17Cui J.

This assay was performed at Merck Sharp & Dohme de España in Spain. Treatment of HepG2 Cells for Gene Expression—HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mm HEPES. For determination of gene specific expression by TaqMan analysis, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 25 mm HEPES. 24 h after seeding, the cells were treated with various concentrations of compounds in DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 mm HEPES. Unless specified, the cells were treated for 24 h. RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using the TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions and TaqMan PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of carboxyfluorescein (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S RNA. Levels of human kininogen mRNA were expressed as fold difference of compound-treated cells against Me2SO-treated cells. Northern Blot Analysis—Protocols for treatment of HepG2 cells and isolation of total RNA were similar to that used in real time quantitative PCR. Total RNA (8 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel with 1× formaldehyde/MOPS (Ambion) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran SuPerCharge; Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe of the human kininogen gene (GenBank™ accession number K02566, bases 717–1274) and then reprobed with a radiolabeled cDNA probe of the β-actin gene (Ambion). TaqMan Primers and Probes—Oligonucleotide primers and probe for human kininogen were designed using Primer Express program and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. These sequences (5′ to 3′) are as follows: forward primer, AGACACGGCATTCAGTACTTTAACA; probe, 6-carboxyfluorescein-CAACACTCAACATTCCTCCCTCTTCATGC-N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine; and reverse primer, TGGGCCCGTTTTACTTCATT. Primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. Sequence Analysis of the Genomic Region of Kininogen—BLAST searches were performed to identify mRNAs and expressed sequence tags of kininogen and to identify genomic regions encoding human and mouse kininogen (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59437) Google Scholar). The genomic sequences of human and mouse kininogen were compared using GLASS (20Batzoglou S. Pachter L. Mesirov J.P. Berger B. Lander E.S. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for transcription factors were identified by searching against the TRANS-FAC data base (21Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and the position weight matrices constructed internally. Previous studies have identified multiple transcription start sites for human kininogen (4Kitamura N. Kitagawa H. Fukushima D. Takagaki Y. Miyata T. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8610-8617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Takagaki Y. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8601-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better define the transcription start sites of kininogen, we blasted the known human kininogen mRNA, NM_000893, against human mRNA and expressed sequence tag data bases. More than 40 transcripts were identified. Mapping those transcripts to human genome indicated about 10 putative transcription start sites, among which the most upstream transcription start site was located 185 bp upstream from the translation start site. In our study, we refer to this site as the transcription start site of human kininogen. Endogenous Expression of Kininogen Is Increased by FXR Agonists in Primary Human Hepatocytes—Microarray analysis revealed that expression of kininogen is up-regulated by FXR agonists.2 To confirm this observation, primary human hepatocytes were treated with various concentrations of CDCA, the most potent bile acid agonist of FXR, and the endogenous expression of kininogen was determined by real time PCR (TaqMan). Consistent with the microarray result, kininogen mRNA was increased by CDCA in a dose-dependent manner with a half maximum (EC50) around 25 μm and a maximum induction of 8–10-fold (Fig. 1A). This EC50 value correlates with the EC50 of CDCA in the FXR transactivation assay (23Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GW4064 is a potent and selective synthetic agonist of FXR (24Willson T.M. Jones S.A. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To confirm that kininogen up-regulation by CDCA was mediated through FXR, primary human hepatocytes were treated with GW4064 and assayed for kininogen expression. Similar to the results of CDCA treatment, GW4064 also effectively increased kininogen mRNA in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 about 0.1 μm (Fig. 1B). Again, this value correlates well with the potency in FXR transactivation (23Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that kininogen up-regulation is mediated by FXR. Primary human hepatocytes were treated with 60 μm CDCA and 5 μm GW4064 for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h to define the time kinetics for FXR-mediated kininogen gene regulation. Up-regulation was readily detectable within 3 h with a maximum induction of 1.5–1.8-fold, which increased to 3-fold at 6 h and 3.8-fold at 12 h (Fig. 1C). 24-h treatment yielded a 4–5-fold induction, which increased slightly at 48 h (Fig. 1C). The fact that kininogen up-regulation by FXR agonists was readily detectable at as early as 3 h suggests kininogen as a direct target of FXR. Endogenous Expression of Kininogen Is Increased by FXR Agonists in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 is a human hepatoma cell line that has been used to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. In HepG2, kininogen was expressed at a moderate level with an average threshold cycle of 24 in untreated cells (data not shown). This level of expression was comparable with that in primary hepatocytes (data not shown). Despite the relatively high basal expression in HepG2 cells, kininogen mRNA was robustly up-regulated by the FXR agonist CDCA or GW4064 in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum induction of 130–140-fold (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis was also carried out to confirm the results obtained from the real time PCR. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 50 μm CDCA or 1 μm GW4064 resulted in an over 100-fold increase of two RNA bands at 3.6 and 1.5 kb, respectively, when probed with the radiolabeled human kininogen cDNA probe (Fig. 3). The size of these two bands are consistent with those previously reported for high molecular weight and low molecular weight kininogen mRNA (22Takagaki Y. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8601-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One minor band at 2.6 kb was also slightly induced by FXR agonists (Fig. 3). This RNA species is presumably the result of an alternative splicing of the kininogen gene. Northern blot analyses confirm that endogenous expression of kininogen is induced by FXR agonists. The Kininogen Promoter Contains an IR-1 That Binds Specifically to the FXR/RXRα Heterodimer—The FXR/RXRα heterodimer binds to specific DNA sequences in promoters of target genes to regulate gene transcription. The DNA sequences recognized by the heterodimer comprise of an inverted repeat separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). A data base search using the IR-1 consensus sequence identified a highly conserved IR-1 element in the proximal promoter of kininogen (–66 to –54). To examine whether the FXR/RXRα heterodimer binds to this IR-1 element, an EMSA was performed using the 32P-labeled IR-1 from the human kininogen promoter in the presence of in vitro translated human FXR and/or human RXRα proteins. The results of EMSAs are shown in Fig. 4A. Neither FXR nor RXRα alone bound to the probe (lanes 1 and 2). However, when both FXR and RXRα proteins were present, a complex was formed, indicating that it is the FXR/RXRα heterodimer that is bound by the IR-1 element (lane 3). Competition analysis showed that an unlabeled IR-1 oligonucleotide from kininogen promoter (Fig. 4B, WT) at a 50-, 100-, or 200-fold molar excess was able to compete for binding in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6), whereas the same molar excess of a mutated oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, Mut) failed to compete for binding (lanes 7–9). Moreover, an ideal IR-1 sequence (Fig. 4B, IR-1) efficiently competed for binding at a 50-, 100-, or 200-fold molar excess (lanes 10–12). These results indicate that the IR-1 element in the kininogen promoter is an authentic FXR/RXRα binding cis-element. The IR-1 Element in Human Kininogen Promoter Is Necessary for FXR/RXRα-mediated Promoter Activation—To determine whether the IR-1 element is necessary for FXR/RXRα-mediated kininogen promoter activation, an 1104-bp fragment of the kininogen promoter (–962 to +142) was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5A). This construct (Kin962-Luc) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with FXR and RXRα expression vectors in the presence or absence of 60 μm CDCA (Fig. 5B) or 1 μm GW4064 (Fig. 5C). Luciferase activity was markedly induced by 60 μm CDCA (12–13-fold) and 1 μm GW4064 (15–17-fold) compared with the Me2SO control. To further define the importance of IR-1 element in kininogen promoter activation, two other reporter constructs, Kin106-Luc and Kin52-Luc, were also generated (Fig. 5A). Kin106-Luc is a minimal promoter that contained the IR-1 element, whereas Kin52-Luc contained the deletion of IR-1 and upstream sequences (Fig. 5A). HepG2 cells were transfected with each of the constructs along with FXR and RXRα expression vectors. Luciferase activity was significantly induced by 60 μm CDCA (10–11-fold) or 1 μm GW4064 (15–17-fold) for the Kin106-Luc construct, whereas only minimal induction was observed for Kin52-Luc, which was similar to that of the pGL3 vector control (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicate that the IR-1 element is necessary for FXR ligand-induced kininogen promoter activation. Mutation of Kininogen IR-1 Abolishes Promoter Transactivation by FXR/RXRα—To demonstrate further that the IR-1 element at –66 to –54 is responsible for the transactivation of the kininogen promoter, mutations in both halves of the IR-1 element (AGGTTAACAACCC to AaaTTAACAAttC; mutated bases in lowercase type) were created in the Kin106-Luc construct using site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant construct (Kinmut-Luc) was transfected into HepG2 cells together with FXR and RXRα expression vectors. Compared with Kin106-Luc, Kinmut-Luc only showed a modest residual induction by 60 μm CDCA (Fig. 5B) and 1 μm GW4064 (Fig. 5C). This induction was indistinguishable from that of the construct lacking the IR-1 element (Kin52-Luc) and the pGL3 vector control (Figs. 5, B and C). This result indicates that the integrity of the IR-1 element in the kininogen promoter is essential for the promoter transactivation by FXR/RXRα. The FXR and RXRα Ligands Additively Activate the Kininogen Promoter—It has been previously shown that several FXR targets are regulated by both bile acids and the RXR ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) (18Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol.

To determine whether the kininogen promoter is also regulated by the RXRα ligand, the Kin106-Luc construct (a minimal promoter containing the IR-1 element) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with the FXR and RXRα expression vectors. As expected, 9-cis-RA alone efficaciously increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 296 nm and a maximum induction of 20-fold (Fig. 6). In the presence of 50 nm GW4064, this induction was further increased by 2–3-fold compared with that induced by 9-cis-RA alone (Fig. 6), indicating that FXR and RXRα ligands work additively on activation of kininogen promoter. These results confirm that FXR is a permissive receptor and that it is the FXR/RXRα heterodimer that transactivates the kininogen promoter.

Microarray analysis indicated that expression of the kininogen gene was significantly increased by FXR agonists.2 Consistent with the microarray results, we have demonstrated here that the endogenous kininogen mRNA was effectively increased by FXR agonists in primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. We further demonstrate that the kininogen promoter is transactivated by FXR and that the IR-1 element in the kininogen promoter is necessary and essential for this gene regulation. One potential physiological role for FXR mediated up-regulation of the kininogen expression may be to increase bradykinin, resulting in modulation of renal excretory function. It has been previously documented that bradykinin stimulates water transport in feline gallbladder (45German D. Barcia J. Brems J. Merenda G. Kaminski D.L. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1989; 34: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible that when hepatic bile acid concentration is high, activated FXR on the one hand shuts down bile acid synthesis by down-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, whereas on the other hand increases bile acid secretion via up-regulation of bile salt export pump and increases fluid transport by up-regulation of kininogen mRNA to increase production of bradykinin. In addition to the role of bradykinin in the gallbladder, the increased production of HKa upon FXR activation may be beneficial for anti-adhesion and anti-thrombosis. More studies are needed to elucidate this aspect of FXR function. Taken together, the findings described in this study increase the understanding of the physiological consequences of FXR activation and implicate a coordinated regulation in bile acid/cholesterol metabolism, fluid transport, inflammation, and thrombosis.

https://openalex.org/W2066537890,"4-Chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC) is a potent and specific activator of the intracellular Ca2+ release channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR). We have previously shown that RyR1 expressed in dyspedic 1B5 myotubes is activated by 4-CmC, whereas RyR3 is not (Fessenden, J. D., Wang, Y., Moore, R. A., Chen, S. R. W., Allen, P. D., and Pessah, I. N. (2000) Biophys. J. 79, 2509–2525). To identify region(s) on RyR1 that are responsible for mediating activation by 4-CmC, we expressed RyR1-RyR3 chimeric proteins in dyspedic 1B5 myotubes and then measured 4-CmC-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. Substitution of the C-terminal third of RyR1 into RyR3 imparted 4-CmC sensitivity to the resulting chimera, thus suggesting that determinants required for activation by 4-CmC are located in this region. We subdivided the C-terminal third of RyR1 into smaller segments and identified two overlapping regions of RyR1 (amino acids 3769–4180 and 4007–4382) that each imparted 4-CmC sensitivity to RyR3. Substitution of the 173 amino acids of RyR1 common to these two chimeras (amino acids 4007–4180) also weakly restored 4-CmC sensitivity in the resulting chimera. To confirm these findings, we created a complementary set of chimeras containing RyR3 substitutions in RyR1. Substitution of the RyR3 C terminus into RyR1 disrupted 4-CmC sensitivity in the resulting chimera. In addition, substitution of the corresponding RyR3 sequence into positions 4007–4180 of RyR1 disrupted 4-CmC sensitivity. Taken together, these results suggest that essential determinants required for activation of RyR1 by 4-CmC reside within a 173-amino acid region between residues 4007 and 4180."
https://openalex.org/W1976967760,"By a number of measures, alanine is poised at the threshold between those amino acids that promote the membrane integration of transmembrane α-helices and those that do not. We have measured the preference of alanine to partition into the lipid-water interface region over the central acyl chain region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane both by its ability to promote the formation of so-called helical hairpins, i.e. a pair of transmembrane helices separated by a tight turn, and by mapping the position relative to the membrane of the lumenal end of a transmembrane α-helix that ends with a block of 10 alanines. Both measures show that Ala has a weak but distinct preference for the interface region, which is in agreement with recent biophysical measurements on pentaeptide partitioning in simple water-lipid or water-octanol systems (Jayasinghe, S., Hristova, K., and White, S. H. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 312, 927–934). Considering the complexity of the translocon-mediated insertion of membrane proteins into the ER, the agreement between the biochemical and biophysical measurements is striking and suggests that protein-lipid interactions are already important during the very early steps of membrane protein assembly in the ER.

Most integral membrane proteins are composed of tightly packed bundles of transmembrane α-helices (1von Heijne G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 32: 285-307Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

Using in vitro translation in the presence of rough microsomes (RMs) 1The abbreviations used are: RM, rough microsome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MGD, minimal glycosylation distance. of model membrane proteins containing engineered poly-Leu segments of various lengths, we have shown previously that the balance between forming a long, continuous transmembrane helix and a helical hairpin can be a delicate one; in constructs with 35–40-residue-long poly-Leu stretches, a single Leu → Pro mutation near the middle of the poly-Leu stretch is sufficient to convert a long transmembrane helix into a helical hairpin (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Monné M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Other polar and charged residues also promote helical hairpin formation in this context (9Monné M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Monné M. Hermansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol.

As an example of a similar effect in a wild type protein, an Asn-Pro → Leu-Leu mutation between two tightly spaced transmembrane helices in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste14p protein has been shown to convert the helical hairpin into a single, long transmembrane helix (12Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In our previous studies (9Monné M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Monné M. Hermansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Ala has not shown any tendency to promote the formation of helical hairpins. The question of whether Ala should be considered a “membrane-seeking” or a “water-seeking” residue is not an easy one, however, as Ala balances close to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic threshold in many well known hydrophobicity scales (13von Heijne G. Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology: Treasure Trove or Trivial Pursuit? Academic Press, San Diego, CA1987: 98-103Google Scholar). Poly-Ala segments of ∼20 residues or more can insert as transmembrane helices during membrane protein assembly into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (14Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but segments of a very similar composition do not form transmembrane helices during protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli (15Chen H.F. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, poly-Ala segments appear to be very close to the threshold for membrane integration. Here, we have explored the ability of a block of Ala residues to induce a helical hairpin when placed near the middle of a long poly-Leu stretch. Using in vitro translation of model proteins in the presence of RMs, we show that a run of 3–4 Ala residues placed centrally in the poly-Leu stretch efficiently induces helical hairpin formation, thus suggesting that Ala, at least in this context, has a slight preference for the lipid-water interface region over the central acyl chain region. As additional support for this contention, we show that a transmembrane segment composed of 13 Leu followed by 10 Ala and one Val is partly cleaved by signal peptidase near its C terminus, that cleavage is prevented by the addition of a Leu residue to the C-terminal end of the Ala-stretch, and that a part of the Ala-stretch appears to extend well into the lipid-water interface region as determined by the glycosylation mapping technique (16Monné M. Nilsson I. Johansson M. Elmhed N. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results agree surprisingly well with recent biophysical studies on simple peptide-lipid systems (17White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), suggesting that the nascent polypeptide chain can interact with membrane lipids at a very early stage of the translocon-mediated insertion of membrane proteins into the ER.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) or by using the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. Glycosylation acceptor sites were designed as described previously (23Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), i.e. by replacing three appropriately positioned codons with codons for the acceptor tripeptide Asn-Ser-Thr. The naturally occurring acceptor site Asn215-Glu-Thr in the P2 domain was mutated to Gln215-Glu-Thr in all constructs. Mutants were confirmed by the sequencing of plasmid DNA using T7 DNA polymerase. All cloning steps were done according to standard procedures. Transcription templates encoding constructs with deletions in the N-terminal H1-H2 region were prepared using PCR to amplify DNA fragments from the relevant pGEM1 plasmids. The 5′-primers all had the common sequence 5′-GATTTAGGTTGACACTATAGAGGAAACAGCCACCATG-(unique sequence)-3′ containing the SP6 promoter, a ribosome binding site, and an initiator codon (underlined). The unique sequence at the 3′-end was designed to hybridize at the position of the first residue after the intended deletion to make constructs encoding the sequence MVQQQP-P2 and MAAAAAVQQQP-P2. The 3′ primer was chosen to anneal downstream of the stop-codon in lep. Expression in Vitro—The DNA template for in vitro transcription of full-length Lep mRNA was prepared by transcription of the LeppGEM1 plasmid with SP6 RNA polymerase for 1 h at 37 °C. The transcription mixture was as follows: 1–5 μg of DNA template, 5 μl of 10× SP6 buffer (400 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 60 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm spermidine HCl), 5 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl), 5 μl of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (10 mm), 5 μl of dithiothreitol (50 mm), 5 μl of rNTP mix (10 mm ATP, 10 mm CTP, 10 mm UTP, and 5 mm GTP), 18.5 μl of H2O, 1.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), and 2 μl of SP6 RNA polymerase (20 units/μl) in a total volume of 50 μl. Translation of 1 μl of Lep mRNA in 9 μl of nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), 1 μl of [35S]Met (10 μCi/μl), 1 μl of amino acid mix (1 mm each amino acid except Met), and 1 μl of RM (4 eq) was performed as described (24Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 h. To demonstrate cleavage by signal peptidase and N-linked glycosylation by oligosaccharyl transferase, translation reactions were performed with the addition of signal peptidase inhibitor (final concentration, 1.4 mm) or competitive glycosylation inhibitor peptide (final concentration, 0.2 mm) at 30 °C in a total volume of 14 μl. For protease treatment of rough microsomes, proteinase K was used at a final concentration of 150 μg/ml, and samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were visualized on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX using the Quantity One Quantitation software. Model Proteins—As in our previous studies (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Monné M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J.

Biol. 2001; 313: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we have used the well characterized E. coli inner membrane protein Lep as a model protein. Lep contains two transmembrane helices (H1 and H2) and a large globular C-terminal domain (P2). When expressed in vitro in the presence of RM, Lep has been shown to insert into the microsomal membrane with both the N and C terminus on the lumenal side (25Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. in the same orientation as it normally inserts into the inner membrane of E. coli (26Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of the P2 domain to the lumenal side of the RM membrane is conveniently assayed by the glycosylation of a unique acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-Ser-Thr) situated 20 residues downstream of H2 and by protease treatment of RM-integrated Lep (see Fig. 1). For the studies reported here, H2 was replaced by various poly-Leu based segments flanked by four lysines at the N-terminal end and a Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro stretch at the C-terminal end. The P2 domain is glycosylated in constructs where the poly-Leu segment forms a single transmembrane helix (Fig. 1, left) and is not glycosylated in constructs where it forms a helical hairpin (Fig. 1, right) (27Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In previous studies (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Monné M. Hermansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we have shown that the poly-Leu segment in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated constructs is properly inserted into the RM membrane as assayed by alkaline extraction. Helical Hairpin Formation and Processing by Signal Peptidase in L 13 A 10 L n V and L 15 A 10 L n V segments—As a first test of the effect of Ala residues on helical hairpin formation, we made two series of constructs wherein the H2 segment had the composition L13A10LnV or L15A10LnV (Fig. 2A). When translated in the presence of microsomes, the longer versions of both series gave rise to a single product (band A). For shorter constructs, a new product with lower mobility also appeared (band B). Finally, for the shortest construct, L13A10V, a third product with higher mobility than the unmodified full-length protein was also seen (band C). When the L13A10V construct was translated in the absence of microsomes only, band A (Fig. 2B) was seen. Band A thus represents unglycosylated products, and band B (Fig. 2B) represents molecules that have been glycosylated on the acceptor site in the P2 domain. The addition of a peptide inhibitor of the signal peptidase enzyme (SP-I in Fig. 2B) largely prevented the formation of band C (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this band represents molecules in which signal peptidase has cleaved in or near the H2 segment. Addition of an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (AP in Fig. 2B) led to the disappearance of bands B and C, while band A and a new band D appeared (Fig. 2B). Band C thus represents glycosylated molecules cleaved by signal peptidase, and band D represents the unglycosylated, cleaved species (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the glycosylation results, proteinase K treatment of intact microsomes carrying constructs L13A10L4V, L15A10L4V, L13A10L8V, and L15A10L8V gave rise to a protected H2-P2 fragment in the two former but not the two latter cases (data not shown). A comparison of the gel mobilities of a L13A10V construct lacking a glycosylation acceptor site (L13A10V–), a construct wherein the entire N-terminal H1-P1-H2 domain up to and including the L13A10V segment has been deleted (MVQ3P-P2; cf. Fig. 1), and the same construct but with an additional N-terminal A5V-segment (MA5VQ3P-P2) shows that the size of the signal-peptidase cleaved form of L13A10V– (band D) is close to that of MVQ3P-P2 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the signal peptidase cleaves close to the C-terminal end of the A10 stretch in L13A10V. From the quantification of gel data shown in Fig. 2D, we conclude that a stretch of 10 Ala residues promotes the formation of a helical hairpin (as shown by the absence of glycosylation of the P2 domain) in the L13A10LnV and L15A10LnV constructs when n ≥ 7 and ≥ 6, respectively. The overall length of the hydrophobic stretch must thus be ≥31 residues for efficient helical hairpin formation, exactly the same minimal length as found previously for the formation of a Pro-induced helical hairpin (9Monné M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, we find that the L13A10V segment can be cleaved by signal peptidase near the C-terminal end of the A10 stretch. Very little cleavage is seen when the L13A10V segment is extended by an additional Leu residue after the Ala stretch (construct L13A10LV; Fig. 2A), and virtually no cleavage is seen when two Leu residues are added (construct L13A10L2V). A Run of 3–4 Ala Residues Induces Helical Hairpin Formation in Poly-Leu Segments of Varying Lengths—To determine the minimum number of Ala residues required to induce a helical hairpin in a long poly-Leu segment, we made three further series of constructs with H2 segments of the general composition LnAmLkV. In the first series, n + m + k = 39 and n ≈ k, i.e. the Ala residues were placed centrally in a poly-Leu segment of a constant overall length. The composition of second and third series was L15AmL16V and L15AmL15V, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3, constructs with a run of four or more centrally placed Ala residues were poorly glycosylated and, hence, form helical hairpins in all three series. Thus, Ala can induce helical hairpin formation even when the overall length of the hydrophobic segment is only 34 residues (construct L15A3L15V). Ala Residues Extend Outside the Membrane in L 13 A 10 L n V Segments—Finally, we used the glycosylation mapping technique (16Monné M. Nilsson I. Johansson M. Elmhed N. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to determine the location of the Ala10 stretch in the L13A10LnV constructs relative to the surface of the ER membrane. In this approach, an Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor site is placed at different separations (d) from the lumenal end of the H2 transmembrane segment, and the minimum number of residues between the end of the hydrophobic stretch and the Asn residue required for efficient glycosylation is determined (Fig. 4A). For an H2 segment with the composition L23V that was studied previously, this minimal glycosylation distance (MGD) is 9.5 residues (27Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, however, the MGD for the L13A10V segment is only 5.6 residues (counting from the first Gln after the hydrophobic segment), strongly suggesting that a part of the A10 stretch extends well into the lipid-water interface region at the time when glycosylation takes place. If we assume that these residues are in an extended conformation, the location in the membrane of the C-terminal end of the L23V segment would correspond roughly to the location of Ala7 in the L13A10V segment. The addition of one or three Leu residues to the C-terminal end of the Ala10 stretch gives rise to a further decrease in the MGD (down to 3.2 for construct L13A10L3V), which is as expected if these extra residues also protrude outside the membrane and adopt a mostly extended conformation. Strikingly, the MGD increases to 5.6 when three more Leu residues are added (construct L13A10L6V). A possible interpretation is that the C-terminal end of the L13A10L6V segment is now sufficiently hydrophobic to be at least partially pulled back into the membrane, thereby increasing the MGD. Indeed, the L13A10L6V construct is right at the threshold of being able to form a helical hairpin (Fig. 2D), and it may thus be expected that its C-terminal end should interact strongly with the membrane. Parenthetically, it is interesting to note in Fig. 4B that the signal peptidase cleavage product (band C) is glycosylated even in constructs where the glycosylation site is too close to the L13A10V segment to be glycosylated in the full-length protein (d ≤ 5). Thus, the mammalian oligosaccharyl transferase can modify glycosylation sites near the N terminus of the P2 domain after signal peptidase cleavage, as was demonstrated previously for S. cerevisiae (28Chen X. Van Valkenburgh C. Liang H. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2411-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the ability of Ala residues to partition between the acyl chain and lipid-water interface regions of the ER membrane during translocon-mediated assembly of membrane proteins into dog pancreas microsomes. Ala is found with roughly equal frequency in transmembrane helices and non-membrane-embedded parts of integral membrane proteins (29Arkin I.T. Brünger A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and is poised on the threshold between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in most hydrophobicity scales (13von Heijne G. Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology: Treasure Trove or Trivial Pursuit? Academic Press, San Diego, CA1987: 98-103Google Scholar). In vivo, poly-Ala segments are right at the border between segments that can and cannot integrate as transmembrane helices during membrane protein assembly (14Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen H.F. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether Ala has a higher preference for the acyl chain or the interface region, we have placed runs of Ala residues in two different contexts, i.e. near the middle of 30–40-residue-long poly-Leu transmembrane segments and at the C-terminal end of L13 and L15 transmembrane segments. In all three cases, the poly-Leu segments were placed in the position of the H2 transmembrane helix in the model protein Lep (Fig. 1). Using in vitro transcription/translation of the different constructs in the presence of RM and an engineered acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation in the C-terminal P2 domain as a topological reporter, we find that Ala has a slight tendency to prefer the lipid-water interface region over the central part of the membrane. Thus, a run of four or more Ala residues placed centrally in a long poly-Leu stretch is sufficient to promote the formation of a helical hairpin (Figs. 2 and 3). Given the lengths of the two helices in these hairpins (15–20 residues each), at least some of the Ala residues must be located in or close to the lumenal lipid-water interface region. These results should be compared with earlier results showing that a similar degree of helical hairpin formation as found for four Ala is induced by single Pro, Asn, Arg, Asp, Gln, His, Lys, and Glu residues (10Monné M. Hermansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and by pairs of Gly, Trp, Ser, Tyr, and Thr residues (30Monné M. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As expected, Ala is thus a considerably less strong promoter of helical hairpin formation than the more polar and/or helix-breaking residues. Similarly, using the glycosylation mapping technique (16Monné M. Nilsson I. Johansson M. Elmhed N. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we find that the C-terminal Ala stretch in a transmembrane segment of the composition L13A10V is not fully embedded in the membrane but extends into or even through the lipid-water interface region (Fig. 4). Moreover, signal peptidase cleaves the L13A10V segment (albeit inefficiently) near the C-terminal end of the A10 stretch in this construct (Fig. 2). Because signal peptidase is thought to have its active site located in the lipid-water interface region, this further confirms the notion that the A10 stretch extends outside the core of the membrane. The hydrophobic L13A10V segment is a rather poor substrate for signal peptidase, possibly because it may be too long (23Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and/or because the A10V part may have a tendency to from an α-helix rather than the extended conformation that is recognized by the enzyme (31Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Kajava A.V. Zolov S.N. Pyatkov K.I. Kalinin A.E. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50396-50402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The addition of a single Leu residue after the L13A10 stretch (construct L13A10LV) almost completely abrogates signal peptide cleavage, and the addition of six Leu residues appears to make the C-terminal end of the stretch sufficiently hydrophobic to be pulled back into the membrane as seen by a shift in the minimal glycosylation distance (Fig. 4). To minimize the sequence complexity, we have used model transmembrane poly-Leu segments in this study; however, given that helical hairpins can also be induced in natural transmembrane segments (12Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we assume that our results should be at least qualitatively correct for transmembrane segments in general. Taken together, our results show that Ala has a slight preference for the lipid-water interface region over the central acyl chain part of the ER membrane and that this preference can have important consequences for membrane protein topology and signal peptidase cleavage. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding of pentaeptides to model lipid bilayers and the partition of tripeptides between water and octanol also indicates that Ala has a slight preference for the lipid-water interface region over the acyl chain region (17White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR studies of peptide-bilayer interactions point in the same direction (33Bechinger B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the interactions between a nascent polypeptide chain and the ER translocon that determine membrane protein topology in vivo are remarkably similar to peptide-lipid interactions in highly simplified in vitro systems.

https://openalex.org/W2129823340,"The SOCS family of genes are negative regulators of cytokine signalling with SOCS-1 displaying tumor suppressor activity. SOCS-1, CIS and SOCS-3 have been implicated in the regulation of red blood cell production. In this study, a detailed examination was conducted on the expression patterns of these three SOCS family members in normal erythroid progenitors and a panel of erythroleukemic cell lines. Unexpectedly, differences in SOCS gene expression were observed during maturation of normal red cell progenitors, viz changes to CIS were inversely related to the alterations of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. Similarly, these SOCS genes were differentially expressed in transformed erythoid cells - erythroleukemic cells immortalized at an immature stage of differentiation expressed SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA constitutively, whereas in more mature cell lines SOCS-1 and CIS were induced only after exposure to erythropoietin (Epo). Significantly, when ectopic expression of the tyrosine kinase Lyn was used to promote differentiation of immature cell lines, constitutive expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 was completely suppressed. Modulation of intracellular signalling via mutated Epo receptors in mature erythroleukemic lines also highlighted different responses by the three SOCS family members. Close scrutiny of SOCS-1 revealed that, despite large increases in mRNA levels, the activity of the promoter did not alter after erythropoietin stimulation; in addition, erythroid cells from SOCS-1-/- mice displayed increased sensitivity to Epo. These observations indicate complex, stage-specific regulation of SOCS genes during normal erythroid maturation and in erythroleukemic cells."

Following colonization of the skin, spirochetes can disseminate throughout the body, resulting in complications that can include ocular, cardiac, neural, and skeletal disease.

Furthermore, three Lys residues in DbpA appear to be critical for the binding of DbpA to decorin. We have now characterized the interaction of DbpA and decorin further by using a synthetic peptide approach. We synthesized a panel of peptides that spanned the DbpA sequence and examined their ability to inhibit the binding of intact DbpA to decorin. From these studies, we identified a decorin-binding peptide that lost this activity if the sequence was either scrambled or if a critical Lys residue was chemically modified. A minimal decorin-binding peptide was identified by examining a set of truncated peptides. One peptide is proposed to contain the primary decorin-binding site in DbpA. By comparing the amino acid sequences of 29 different DbpA homologs from different B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates, we discovered that the identified decorin-binding sequence was quite variable. Therefore, we synthesized a new panel of peptides containing the putative decorin-binding sequence of the different DbpA homologs.

These surface-exposed ∼20 kDa lipoproteins have amino acid sequences of ∼40% identity and 51% similarity to each other in B. burgdorferi strain N40. Both Dbps bind decorin but with somewhat different affinity and/or specificity (14Guo B.P. Norris S.J. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of sequences from ∼40 different B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains revealed that DbpB is a highly conserved protein (96–100% amino acid sequence identity) compared with the DbpA sequence that had between a 58 and 100% sequence identity among the strains analyzed (18Roberts W.C. Mullikin B.A. Lathigra R. Hanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin, a molecule belonging to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, is found in the extracellular matrices of many tissues including the dermis and cartilage and is believed to play a role in regulating collagen fibril formation (19Hocking A.M.

It consists of a 38-kDa core protein substituted with an ∼40-kDa glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain as well as up to three N-linked oligosaccharides. The GAG chain, which is preferentially a dermatan sulfate chain in the skin, and a chondrotin sulfate chain in cartilage constitutes a highly negatively charged part of the molecule (22Cheng F.

Decorin together with biglycan, a structurally closely related proteoglycan substituted with two GAG chains and the recently discovered glycoprotein asporin, constitute the Class I subfamily of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene products (23Iozzo R.V.

Although the DbpA- and DbpB-binding sites within decorin have not been well characterized, previous results indicated that both the decorin core protein and the GAG chain participate in this interaction (14Guo B.P. Norris S.J. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously identified three conserved lysine residues (Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170) in DbpA critical for the decorin binding activity of DbpA in a variety of assays (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P.

The current report describes a synthetic peptide approach to further characterize the binding site(s) in DbpA for decorin. We tentatively identify a short amino acid sequence spanning the Lys-82 region of DbpA as the decorin-binding site. Labeling of Decorin and Recombinant Proteins—Decorin from bovine fetal skin provided by Dr. Lawrence Rosenberg (Montefiore Medical Center, New York, NY) was purified as described previously (27Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L.C. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stored in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride at –80 °C, and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use. Decorin, DbpA, or DbpB were labeled with either NHS-LS-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate) or with digoxigenin (digoxigenin-3-O-methyl-carbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproicacid-N-hydroxy-succinimide ester) as described previously (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and stored at –20 °C. Synthesis of DbpA Peptides—Peptides (Fig. 1) were synthesized by a solid phase method on a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol resin using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry and a model 396 Multiple Peptide Synthesizer from Advanced Chem Tech Inc. (Louisville, KY) as described previously (28Patti J.M. House-Pompeo K. Boles J.O. Garza N. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol.

Peptides were purified using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Waters 625 liquid chromatography system using a C18 analytical column. The purity of the peptides was greater than 98%. Peptides were solubilized in PBS, pH 7.4, with up to 10% Me2SO prior to use. Modification of lysine residues on DbpA-peptides was performed as described previously (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P. O'Neal P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26272-26278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—(His)6-tagged recombinant forms of DbpA (DbpA 549, amino acids 11–187) and DbpB (DbpB 500, amino acids 21–187) from B. burgdorferi strain 297 were cloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and expressed in Escherichia coli JM101 (DbpA) or M15[pREP4] (DbpB) (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Additional DbpA isoforms from B. burgdorferi strain HB19 (amino acids 10–189), Borrelia garinii strain Ip90 (amino acids 7–184), and Borrelia afzelii strain ACA-1 (amino acids 10–167) were cloned into pQE-30 and expressed in E. coli BL21 (HB19 and Ip90) or JM101 (ACA-1). Oligonucleotide primers used for PCR were as follows: 5′-CGCGGATCCATCTTTAATTTTAAAAATTTACTT-3′(forward), 5′-GCGCTGCAGTTTTTCATCAGTAAAAGTAGAATTTTC-3′ (reverse) for HB19; 5′-CGCGGATCCAATTTACTTAAACTAAGTTTAATTG-3′ (forward), 5′-AACTGCAGTTATTTAGGAGTTTTGGCTTC-3′ (reverse) for Ip90; and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTTACACTAACTTTACTTGCTAGC-3′ (forward), 5′-GCGCTGCAGTTTAGTTTGTTTTTCTTTAATGTTTTC-3′ (reverse) for ACA-1. E. coli was grown in Lennox Broth with the appropriate antibiotics, and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm, final concentration) (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P. O'Neal P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26272-26278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The (His)6-tagged proteins were applied to a Hi-trap Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with an imidazole gradient, dialyzed against PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, and then dialyzed against PBS and stored at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Inhibition Assay—Immulon-1 microtiter plate wells (Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with either 0.4 μg of DbpA or DbpB or 1.0 μg of decorin in 50 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed and then blocked for 1 h with 200 μl of Super Block (Pierce). During the blocking step, 0.06 μg/ml biotin-conjugated decorin was pre-incubated at 37 °C with each DbpA-derived peptide, DbpA or DbpB, for the decorin inhibition assays. For the DbpA inhibition assay, 50 μl of antiserum raised against DbpA, p4/5, or p8/9 was incubated with 50 μl of digoxigenin-labeled DbpA (0.5 μg) for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of the biotin-conjugated decorin/inhibitor mixture or 100 μlofthe conjugated DbpA-antiserum mixture was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed and incubated with 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:3000 dilution) (Cooper Biomedical, Inc., Malvern, PA) for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of a 1 mg/ml Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (Sigma) dissolved in 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, was added. Plates were washed four times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 in between all of the steps. All of the incubations were done at 37 °C, and all of the dilutions were made using Super Block. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples minus the substrate control. Generation of Antiserum—BALB/c mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were immunized with 20 μg of p4/5, p8/9, or recombinant DbpA emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant as described previously (29Brown E.L. Wooten R.M. Johnson B.J. Iozzo R.V. Smith A. Dolan M.C. Guo B.P. Weis J.J. Höök M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 4 weeks later, mice were boosted with the corresponding peptide/protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant and serum was collected 1 week later (29Brown E.L. Wooten R.M. Johnson B.J. Iozzo R.V. Smith A. Dolan M.C. Guo B.P. Weis J.J. Höök M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of the animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas A&M University Health Science Center Institute of Biosciences and Technology. SDS-PAGE and Western Ligand Blot—DbpA proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Sigma) or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Additional protein-binding sites in the membrane were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The membrane was washed in TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with digoxigenin-labeled decorin and alkaline phophatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin F(ab′)2 fragments (Roche Applied Science), and developed as described previously (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Peptide Inhibition of Decorin Binding to DbpA—We previously reported that three lysine residues within the DbpA sequence (Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170) were critical for the ability of DbpA to bind decorin (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P. O'Neal P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26272-26278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, we do not know whether these Lys residues can potentially make contact with decorin and form part of the decorin-binding site in DbpA or whether they are required in DbpA for the MSCRAMM to adopt a decorin-binding conformation but are not contacting the ligand. To further define the decorin-binding site in DbpA, we now have used a synthetic peptide approach. Initially, nine (p1-p9) overlapping 25 amino acid-long peptides spanning the entire sequence of DbpA (Fig. 1) from B. burgdorferi strain 297 were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of biotin-labeled decorin to immobilized DbpA (Fig. 2A). In this assay, both peptides 4 and 5 (both containing Lys-82) had reproducible inhibitory effects on decorin binding to DbpA, although unlabeled DbpA was more potent and almost completely inhibited decorin binding (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, peptide 8 (containing Lys-163) and peptide 9 (containing both Lys-163 and Lys-170) had only moderate inhibitory effects (Fig. 2, A and B). Peptide 1 was not included in this analysis because this region of DbpA contains a signal peptidase II recognition site and is therefore cleaved prior to lipid substitution (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Because the cysteine residue in peptide 2 is used during lipid attachment and not normally exposed to the in vivo milieu during bacterial infection, this peptide also was not tested in depth, although preliminary data demonstrated that peptide 2 had no inhibitory activity (data not shown). Two additional peptides, p4/5 and p8/9, containing Lys-82 and Lys-163/Lys-170 in central positions, respectively, (Fig. 1) were also synthesized and tested in the inhibition assay (Fig. 2B). Both p4/5 and p8/9 inhibited decorin binding more efficiently than peptides containing the critical lysine residues at either the C or N terminus as in peptides 4, 5, 8, and 9, respectively (Fig. 2B). The importance of the lysine residues in peptides 4/5 and 8/9 for decorin binding was verified by chemical modification of the side chain amino groups in these residues (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P. O'Neal P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26272-26278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Native and chemically modified peptides 4/5 and 8/9 were examined for their ability to inhibit the binding of biotin-labeled DbpA to decorin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated that peptides subjected to chemical modification of lysine residues lost inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the concentration needed for 50% inhibition was less for p4/5 (ID50 <2.5 μm) than for p8/9 (ID50 ∼20 μm), and p4/5 but not p8/9 caused complete inhibition of DbpA binding at the highest concentration of peptide used. These results demonstrated that p4/5 is a more potent inhibitor of DbpA-decorin binding than p8/9 (Fig. 3). DbpA and DbpB Share Binding Site(s) in Decorin—Since DbpA and DbpB bind decorin with a different affinity or specificity, we examined whether peptides 4/5 and 8/9 were equally efficient in inhibiting the binding of decorin to microtiter wells coated with either DbpA or DbpB (Fig. 4). DbpA peptides, DbpA or DbpB, at concentrations of 20 μm were preincubated with biotinylated decorin prior to addition to either DbpA- or DbpB-coated wells. In the absence of inhibitor, decorin bound significantly better to DbpA than to DbpB, supporting the observation that decorin has a higher affinity for the former adhesin (Fig. 4). However, both p4/5 and p8/9 reduced decorin binding to either of the Dbps to a similar degree. Peptide 4/5 at 20 μm reduced decorin binding by 83 and 84% to DbpA and DbpB, respectively. In the presence of p8/9 at the same concentration, decorin binding was reduced by 35 and 42% to DbpA and DbpB, respectively. Thus, peptides 4/5 and 8/9 are potent inhibitors of decorin binding to both DbpA and DbpB. The 4/5 Sequence Contains a Decorin-binding Site—We scrambled the sequence of the p8/9 and a version of the 4/5 peptide (p4/5A, see below). The resulting peptides (Fig. 1, p4/5A scr and p8/9 scr) were tested in inhibition assays to determine whether the activity of the parent peptides were sequence-dependent (Fig. 5). Peptide 8/9 scrambled had a similar inhibitory activity compared with native p8/9, suggesting that interactions between p8/9 and decorin may be charge-dependent and a function of the relatively high number (six) of positively charged lysine residues in this peptide rather than the result of the specific amino acid sequence of p8/9. Peptide 4/5 scrambled, in contrast, had essentially no inhibitory activity compared with native p4/5A. Since this peptide contains only a single lysine residue, we propose that the p4/5 inhibitory activity was dependent on a specific peptide sequence and that a decorin-binding site in DbpA is contained within the 4/5 sequence. If p4/5 contained a decorin-binding site, an antibody raised against this peptide should inhibit decorin binding to DbpA. Therefore, we generated and tested anti-p4/5 and anti-p8/9 sera for the ability to interfere with the binding of biotin-labeled DbpA to decorin. The anti-p4/5 serum reduced the binding of DbpA to decorin by 50% compared with an antiserum raised against recombinant intact DbpA completely inhibited DbpA binding to decorin at the concentrations tested. Anti-p8/9 serum showed no significant inhibition at the concentrations tested (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the decorin-binding site is contained within the p4/5 sequence.Fig. 7Reactivity of peptide antiserum against recombinant DpbA. Digoxygenin-labeled DbpA was preincubated with antiserum raised against recombinant DbpA, p4/5, or p8/9 for 1 h before adding to decorin-coated microtiter wells. DbpA binding was quantified by ELISA, and the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the mean of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Minimal Binding Peptide Contains Lys-82—We further examined the segment covered by the 4/5 peptide to define the minimal decorin-binding domain. This was done by synthesizing and testing five additional peptides (p4/5A-p4/5E) in inhibition assays (Fig. 1). Inhibition experiments revealed that p4/5A and p4/5C but not p4/5B, p4/5D, nor p4/5E inhibited decorin binding to immobilized DbpA (Fig. 6). The difference between the inhibition of decorin to DbpA by p4/5A (19 amino acids) and p4/5C (15 amino acids) (ID50 ∼2.5 μm and ID50 ∼10 μm, respectively) was 4-fold, but p4/5C had appreciable inhibitory activity, suggesting that the peptide 4/5C sequence (PFILEAKVRATTVAE) contains a full decorin-binding site. Peptides 4/5D and 4/5E, which were truncated by five or four residues at the C and N termini compared with p4/5C, respectively, were without activity, suggesting that the minimal decorin-binding sequence in the 4/5 region is represented by a central EAKVRA core sequence plus 1–5 flanking residues at both the N and C termini. DbpA Isoforms—DbpA sequences from 29 B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains are between 58.3 and 100% identical to the DbpA amino acid sequence from strain 297 (18Roberts W.C. Mullikin B.A. Lathigra R. Hanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of these sequence variations, we decided to examine the decorin binding activity of a selection of homologous DbpA proteins from different Borrelia strains. We expressed recombinant DbpA from one additional B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain (HB19) (with an amino acid sequence that is 76.3% identical to DbpA from strain 297), one B. garinii strain (Ip90; 69.9% identity) and one B. afzelii strain (ACA-1; 62.7% identity). The generated recombinant DbpA proteins contained an N-terminal His tag and were purified by Ni+-chelating chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western ligand blot (Fig. 8). Monomers (∼20 kDa) of all of the isoforms were visible on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 8A). In the Western ligand blot, decorin was able to bind to both monomers and dimers (∼40 kDa) of the 297, HB19, and ACA-1 isoforms (Fig. 8B). No decorin binding to the recombinant Ip90 isoform could be detected (data not shown). Alignment of peptide 4/5C amino acid sequences from 29 different B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains showed most B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains to have identical or very similar amino acid sequences in this area, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii strains were more variable (Fig. 9). Also, DbpB consensus sequences showed some similarity to the 297 DbpA sequence in this region (Fig. 9). In addition to the lysine residue corresponding to Lys-82 in DbpA from B. burgdorferi strain 297, the adjacent alanine residue (Ala-81) was conserved throughout all of the DbpA and DbpB sequences examined (Fig. 9). To further examine the role of the 4/5C region in decorin binding, we synthesized a panel of additional DbpA 4/5C homologous peptides corresponding to the 4/5C sequences of DbpA from B. burgdorferi HB19, group 25015, B. garinii Ip90, B. afzelii Pgau, and B. afzelii ACA-1. 4/5C peptides from these Borrelia strains are representative of the variability we observe among different p4/5C isoforms (Fig. 9). All of the p4/5C isoforms examined inhibited decorin binding to DbpA more effectively than either p4/5 or p4/5C from B. burgdorferi 297 (Fig. 10). One of the most potent inhibitory peptides was derived from strain Ip90 whose corresponding recombinant DbpA did not bind decorin in the Western ligand blot assay described above. Taken together, we concluded that all of the 4/5 regions in the DbpA proteins from different strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato have the capacity to bind decorin and that this region forms a decorin-binding site in these proteins. As B. burgdorferi is transmitted from an infected tick to a mammalian host, the spirochete must adapt to the new environment. This process cannot take place without a significant change in the protein-expression profile of the bacteria that will enable invading bacteria to colonize and disseminate in the mammalian host. Borrelia can turn on a group of genes encoding putative lipoproteins during the early stages of infection. This group includes the genes encoding the surface-exposed decorin-binding proteins, DbpA and DbpB (30Weis J.J. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Revel A.T. Talaat A.M. Norgard M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The observed transcriptional regulation of the dpb-genes suggested that these MSCRAMMS play a role in the infection process. The importance of the DbpA-decorin interaction in vivo has been tested in mice deficient in decorin (Dcn–/–) (29Brown E.L. Wooten R.M. Johnson B.J. Iozzo R.V. Smith A. Dolan M.C. Guo B.P. Weis J.J. Höök M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type controls, Dcn–/– mice had fewer Borrelia positive tissues. Furthermore, arthritis incidence and severity were also reduced in Dcn–/– mice compared with Dcn+/+ controls (29Brown E.L. Wooten R.M. Johnson B.J. Iozzo R.V. Smith A. Dolan M.C. Guo B.P. Weis J.J. Höök M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This work describes a detailed analysis of the interactions between DbpA and decorin by examining the ability of synthetic DbpA-derived peptides to inhibit DbpA-decorin binding in vitro. The most effective inhibitors of decorin binding (p4/5 and p8/9) contained the lysine residues (Lys-82 or Lys-163/Lys-170 for p4/5 and p8/9, respectively) previously found to be critical for decorin binding (26Brown E.L. Guo B.P. O'Neal P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26272-26278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chemical modification of the lysine residues within these peptides abolished their inhibitory activity, confirming the importance of these residues in DbpA-decorin interactions. Peptides containing Lys-82 (p4/5 region) were significantly better inhibitors than Lys163/Lys170-containing peptides (p8, p9, and p8/9). Furthermore, a peptide composed of a scrambled 4/5A sequence had no inhibitory activity, whereas a scrambled 8/9 sequence retained almost all of the inhibitory activity. Also, an antibody to the 4/5 peptide partially inhibited DbpA binding to decorin, whereas anti-8/9 serum had no significant inhibitory effects. Taken together, these observations suggested that the 4/5 sequence represents a decorin-binding site in DbpA, whereas the 8/9 sequence and the Lys-163 and Lys-170 residues are important in maintaining the ligand binding activity in DbpA, perhaps by maintaining the appropriate decorin-binding conformation. The shortest peptide from the 4/5 region with inhibitory properties was a 15 amino acid-long peptide (peptide 4/5C) with the sequence PFILEAKVRATTVAE. Further truncations of this peptide (4–5 amino acids) resulted in inactive peptides. Previously, CD spectroscopy of the decorin-binding proteins revealed that they had a high content (∼50–60%) of α-helices (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy of peptides p4/5, p4/5A, p4/5C, p4/5D, and p8/9 was also performed, and deconvolution of the spectra revealed that the peptides under the conditions used (1% PBS) contained both coiled and β-sheet structural elements (data not shown). DbpA peptides from five distinct Borrelia strains, ranging from 27 to 93% in identity with peptide 4/5C from strain 297, all showed significant decorin inhibitory activity, indicating that this is the major decorin-binding site of DbpA regardless of the origin of the MSCRAMM. These peptides represent all of the three subspecies of Borrelia known to cause Lyme disease in humans, including the Euro-Asian variants B. garinii and B. afzelii, which give rise to somewhat different clinical symptoms than infections caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains (34Ornstein K. Berglund J. Bergstrom S. Norrby R. Barbour A.G. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 34: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Ishii N. Isogai E. Isogai H. Kimura K. Nishikawa T. Fujii N. Nakajima H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 36Hubalek Z. Halouzka J. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1997; 13: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Comparison of DbpA and DbpB amino acid sequences from different Borrelia subspecies spanning the p4/5C region showed that while some sequences were identical, others varied (Fig. 9). Phylogenetic analysis of these p4/5C sequences indicated that all of the DbpA sequences from the different subspecies were more closely related to each other than to the DbpB sequences. Sequences within the DbpA group clustered according to the subspecies with only a few exceptions (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was performed using the entire DbpA sequences. This suggested that Borrelia acquired these genes in the relatively early stage of evolution so that significant divergence appeared in sequences from different subspecies, whereas the sequences within the subspecies were relatively conserved. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that residues A and K were conserved in all of the sequences including the DbpB sequences, indicating that these residues are critical for decorin binding. Based on the multiple sequence alignment of the different p4/5C sequences of both DbpA and DbpB in Fig. 9, a consensus sequence was built using a threshold of 80% identical: h-I-h-c-A-K-l-p-u-h-p-l-s-t (h, hydrophobic; c, charged; l, (I, L, or V); u, (A, G, or S); p, polar; s, small; and t, turn-like). A more defined consensus was built using a threshold of 50% identical: F-I-l-X-A-K-l-R-A-s-s-V-A-E. Based on this, the sequence FILXAKIRAXXVAE (X, any amino acid residue) was used to blast-search the databases of the human, mouse, and microbial genomes at NCBI. Sequences that contained the conserved Ala and Lys residues and fit the profile of the first consensus were found in a number of microorganisms as well as in human and mouse. Some of the blast hits revealed proteins of known functions or of intracellular proteins, suggesting these hits could be random. However, several hits of potential interest were found. Two hypothetical proteins from Bacillus anthracis and Chlamydia trachomatis, respectively, contained portions of the decorin binding motif and were of similar length to DbpA. The B. anthracis protein had 172 amino acid residues, and the motif was present from residues 139 to 154 (FILDMTAKIRAMGLTA) with two extra residues (Asp and Met) inserted between Leu and Thr. The C. trachomatis protein contained 153 amino acid residues, and a part of the motif was found from residues 98 to 105 (FIIDAKIR). The primary amino acid sequences of these two proteins were not significantly similar to those of DbpA or DbpB. The finding of a putative decorin binding motif in these sequences may suggest a biological function for these proteins. A similar motif was also identified in human tuftelin 1 sequence from residues 245 to 258 (ALLAKVREGEVALE). Tuftelin was proposed to play a role in tooth development and the mineralization of enamel; however, the expression of tuftelin genes was not limited to mineralizing tissues, suggesting that the protein may have other functions (37Deutsch D. Leiser Y. Shay B. Fermon E. Taylor A. Rosenfeld E. Dafni L. Charuvi K. Cohen Y. Haze A. Fuks A. Mao Z. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to see whether any of these proteins can in fact bind decorin and if so what the biological consequences are. It is also likely that DbpB has a decorin-binding site that includes the conserved Lys-82 residue considering the similarity between DbpA and DbpB in this region and the fact that DbpA and DbpB share binding sites in decorin. Although no three-dimensional structures of the Dbps are yet available, circular dichroism spectra of recombinant DbpA, DbpB, and the outer surface protein C are very similar (17Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), indicating similar secondary structures. Outer surface protein C was shown by x-ray crystallography to be a largely α-helical protein with two short β-sheets (38Eicken C. Sharma V. Klabunde T. Owens R.T. Pikas D.S. Höök M. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10010-10015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Information on the three-dimensional structure of DbpA or DbpB, in combination with our data, would more clearly define the decorin-binding site of these adhesins."

The uPA binding site spans all three domains (D1 to D3) of uPAR. However, the nature of the Vn binding site within uPAR is still not clear. In this study, we conducted homolog-scanning mutagenesis on uPAR by switching 14 individual segments of 4–8 residues to their counterpart sequences of a uPAR homolog CD59.

Memarzedeh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), by virtue of its interactions with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), vitronectin (Vn), and several different integrins (4Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As Vn accumulates predominantly in extracellular matrices that are associated with acute injury and tissue repair, simultaneous binding of uPA and Vn to uPAR therefore concentrates the proteolytic activity of uPA and its activation product, plasmin, on the cell surface as well as close to the provisional matrix (6Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). uPAR/Vn interaction can be enhanced by uPA and attenuated by the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which binds to the somatomedin B domain of Vn (7Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition, uPAR is capable of modulating cell adhesion by activating cells directly via a G-protein-coupled receptor (8Liu D. Aguirre G.J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), by sequestering caveolin (9Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J.

Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In support of these in vitro studies, uPAR-deficient mice were found to respond poorly to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, because of impaired neutrophil infiltration and reduced monocyte adhesion (11Gyetko M.R. Sud S. Kendall T. Fuller J.A. Newstead M.W. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Clinically, up-regulation of uPAR expression within tumor cells was found to correlate inversely with the survival rate of breast cancer patients (3Memarzadeh S. Kozak K.R. Chang L. Natarajan S. Shintaku P. Reddy S.T. Farias-Eisner R. Memarzedeh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In mice, blocking uPAR functions by a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody was found to markedly decrease tumor growth and metastases (12Rabbani S.A. Gladu J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data attest to the importance of uPAR in a variety of physiologic and pathogenic processes. uPAR belongs to the Ly-6 protein family, and contains three domains (D1 to D3) that are homologous to CD59, Ly6E, and α-neurotoxins (13Ploug M. Kjalke M. Ronne E. Weidle U. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These domains fold into a central 3-stranded β-sheet and a globular, disulfide-rich core (14Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The uPA binding site within uPAR has been studied extensively using a number of different approaches, including site-directed photoaffinity labeling, chemical cross-linking, alanine scanning, as well as synthetic peptides, and the functional residues have been located within the α-helix and the three connecting loops, especially the second and third loops of all three domains (13Ploug M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized uPA binding site, the Vn binding site within uPAR remains elusive. Recently, it was reported that deletion of D1 destroys uPAR binding to Vn (19Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this domain in Vn recognition. However, such interpretation is complicated by the fact that truncation of the entire D1 domain also abrogates uPA binding, which could lead to defective Vn binding as well. To better understand the molecular basis governing Vn binding to uPAR, we have employed the homolog-scanning mutagenesis strategy (20Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) in this study and identified a region within uPAR that is involved differentially in its recognition of uPA and Vn. Our results demonstrate that two novel sequences (172NTTK and 183ELEN) within the uPAR D2 domain are critical for Vn binding but dispensable for uPA binding. In addition, we have identified two synthetic peptides (153CPGSNGFHNNDTFHFLKC and 171CNTTKCNEGPILELENLPQ) that recapitulate the two identified ligand binding sites within the uPAR D2 domain: the former peptide bound uPA but not Vn, whereas the latter peptide interacted specifically with Vn but not uPA. Our study has for the first time unequivocally identified a Vn binding site within uPAR. Such information will be beneficial to our understanding of the complex roles of uPAR in various processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tumor metastasis. Materials—Human kidney 293 cells were obtained from Dr. F. J. Castellino (Notre Dame, IN). The cDNA of human uPAR (16Bdeir K. Kuo A. Mazar A. Sachais B.S. Xiao W. Gawlak S. Harris S. Higazi A.A. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28532-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Doug Cines (Philadelphia, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human uPAR was obtained from Dr. Dudley Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD), and a similar antibody against uPAR (399R) was also obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Human native vitronectin was from the Enzyme Research Lab (South Bend, IN). mAbs 3931, 3932, 3936, 3937, 3471, and the high molecular weight form of uPA (HMW uPA) were from American Diagnostica; mAbs 10G7 and LM609 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); mAb VIM5 was from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and mAb 7E3 was from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines— The detailed procedures for homolog-scanning mutagenesis and establishment of stable cell lines have been published elsewhere (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, selected sequences of uPAR were switched individually to their counterpart sequences of CD59 (a uPAR homolog) using overlapping PCR. The presence of the mutation and the correctness of the remaining sequence were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant uPAR cDNA was inserted in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and then transfected into human 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were established by selection with G418 (800 μg/ml). To obtain cell lines that express receptor numbers equivalent to wild-type uPAR, each mutant cell line was immuno-panned using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human uPAR. Equivalent receptor expression for the wild-type and all 14 mutants was confirmed by FACS analysis. FACS Analysis—A total of 106 cells expressing wild-type or mutant uPAR in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) were incubated with 1 μg of mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. A subtype-matched mouse IgG served as a control. After washing with PBS, cells were mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:20 dilution) (Zymed Laboratory), and kept at 4 °C for another 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). The FACS analysis was performed using FACScan (BD Biosciences), counting 10,000 events. Mean fluorescence intensities were quantified using the FACScan program. Ligand Binding Assays for uPAR—Binding activity of uPAR toward its two ligands uPA and Vn was assessed based on the published procedures (22Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Binding of soluble HMW uPA was performed by FACS analysis. Briefly, a total of 106 cells expressing wild-type or mutant uPAR in HBSS were incubated with different concentrations of uPA (0 to 100 nm) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with DPBS, cells were mixed with a rabbit anti-human uPA antibody (number 389), and incubated for 30 min. Bound uPA was then detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:1000 dilution) (Zymed) by FACS analysis. Mean fluorescence intensities were quantified using the FACScan program, and the titration curve was fitted to a single binding site model using Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). For cell adhesion, native Vn (10 μg/ml) was used to coat the center of each well in a 24-well non-tissue culture polystyrene plate. After blocking with 300 μl of 1% BSA in DPBS, a total of 2 × 106 cells in HBSS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of synthetic peptides or 20 μg/ml mAb VIM5 (against uPAR) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The unbound cells were removed by three washes with DPBS and the adherent cells were quantified by staining with crystal violet. To exclude potential binding by endogenous integrins (αVβ3, αVβ1, or α5β1), all cell adhesion experiments were conducted in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. In addition, we have added the RGD peptide (1 mm), an αV-specific mAb LM609 (20 μg/ml), or a β3-specific mAb 7E3 (20 μg/ml) in some of our cell adhesion experiments and similar results were obtained. Biotinylation of Synthetic Peptides—Synthetic peptides were biotinylated via their free sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, using the EZ-link PEO-maleimide-activated biotin kit (Pierce), based on the product instructions. The efficiency of biotinylation was determined by immobilizing 0.2 nmol of the biotinylated peptides on a maleic anhydride-activated polystyrene strip plate (also from Pierce) overnight, which reacts with the free NH2 group in the peptides. This procedure resulted in more than 99% of the peptides being captured on the plate. After washing with PBS and blocking with BSA, the amount of biotin group was determined using an alkaline phosphatase-avidin conjugate, measuring the absorption at 405 nm. Similar biotinylation efficiencies were obtained for all peptides. Solid Phase Binding Assays—To test the interaction between the identified sequences of uPAR and its two ligands (uPA and Vn), wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Immulon 4BX, Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with the different synthetic peptides at 2 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C and postcoated with 3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. uPA (10 μg/ml) or Vn (10 μg/ml) in DPBS containing 0.1% BSA was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing with DPBS, bound ligands were detected with a rabbit anti-human uPA antibody (number 389), or a sheep anti-human Vn antibody, followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugates of a goat anti-rabbit or a donkey anti-sheep IgG, respectively. Bound conjugates were measured by reaction with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Reciprocally, the plate was coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml HMW uPA, blocked with 3% BSA, and incubated with different concentrations (0 to 500 μm) of biotinylated peptides. After washing, bound peptides was detected with a alkaline phosphatase-avidin conjugate, measuring absorption at 405 nm. Homolog-scanning Mutagenesis of uPAR—To identify the functional sequences within uPAR for Vn binding, we employed the homolog-scanning mutagenesis strategy (20Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which has been used successfully by us in the past to determine the ligand binding sites within several receptors (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this work, we substituted the corresponding segments (between 4 and 8 residues) of uPAR with their counterpart sequences of CD59, based on the premise that uPAR and CD59 are homologous but recognize completely different ligands. Given the dependence of the uPAR/Vn interaction on uPA, we speculated that the binding sites for uPA and Vn might reside close to each other. Because the functional residues for uPA binding have been mapped to loops 2 and 3, as well as the α-helical region within each domain (15Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Bdeir K. Kuo A. Mazar A. Sachais B.S. Xiao W. Gawlak S. Harris S. Higazi A.A. Cines D.B. J. Biol.

Guided by the three-dimensional structure of CD59 (14Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we constructed nine mutants that would cover the targeted regions within all three domains (Table I and Fig. 1A). Upon completion of site-directed mutagenesis, the presence of the expected mutations and the correctness of the rest of the uPAR sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Stable cell lines were then established for wild-type and mutant uPAR by G418 selection, and similar surface expression levels of uPAR were verified by FACS analyses using a rabbit anti-human uPAR antibody (data not shown). In addition, Western blot analyses using mAb VIM5 showed that eight of the nine mutant receptors migrated as 46-kDa proteins on SDS-PAGE, similar to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that segment replacements did not affect protein processing of these mutant receptors. One mutant, uPAR(Glu37–Leu40), was not included in Fig. 1B, as its VIM5 epitope was disrupted by mutation (see below).Table IMutagenic primers used in the homolog-scanning mutagenesis of uPARPositionFromToMutagenic primers (5′ to 3′)137-40ELELAGLQgcttttctccacctgcagtccggcttctccttcttccca253-60RTLSYRTGFNDVTTRgctggtgatcttcaatcttgtggtcacgtcgttaaagttggtcttctctga361-66LKITSLLRENELacacacaacctcggtaagctcgttctcgcgcaagccagtccgatagct4139-142KDDRAGLQacagcctcggaggtgttggagccctgctggacgcccttcttc5155-161GSNGFHNFNDVTTRgtgaaaggtgtcgttcctggtggtcacgtcgttgaatgggcagccgggaag6162-167NDTFHFLRENELgttgcagcatttcagcagctcgttctcccgcaagttgtggaaaccatt7233-236NQSYAGLQactcacgaacctaaagctggactgcagatggtaagaggctgt8249-255HAHLGDAFNDVTTRgcctcaatgtgccaattcaacgacgtgaccaccagatttagcatgaaccac9256-261FSMNHILRENELcaccttggtgatgctctgagggaaaacgaactcgatgtctcctgctgt Open table in a new tab Ligand Binding by the Homolog-scanning Mutants—To see if substitution of these nine segments had any effect on uPAR binding to uPA and Vn, we conducted binding assays as described under “Experimental Procedures,” based on modifications of the published procedures (22Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type uPAR bound uPA in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. The uPA titration data could be fit to a single binding site model using non-linear regression analysis. The calculated K d for uPA binding to wild-type uPAR is 1.6 nm, which is very close to the published value of 2.1 nm (24Miles L.A. Levin E.G. Plescia J. Collen D. Plow E.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verifying specificity, mock transfected 293 cells did not show any detectable uPA binding (Fig. 2). In addition, uPA binding to the uPAR-expressing cells could be blocked by addition of mAb VIM5 (data not shown). Next, we carried out similar uPA binding experiments for the nine homolog-scanning mutants, and the K d values were calculated from the titration curves for each mutant. The uPA binding affinity (1/K d) toward each mutant was then compared with that of wild-type uPAR and expressed as percentage of the wild-type binding activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, of the nine mutants, two mutants (Asn233–Tyr236 and Phe256–Ile261) had normal uPA binding and two mutants (Glu37–Leu40 and His249–Ala255) had a modest loss of uPA binding (∼50% of WT). The most dramatic loss of uPA binding was observed for five mutants, all of which exhibited less than 0.5% uPA binding activity of the wild-type receptor. These mutants are: Arg53–Gly60, Leu61–Leu66, Lys139–Arg142, Gly155–Asn161, and Asn162–Phe167. The first two mutants (Arg53–Gly60 and Leu61-Leu66) are located within D1, and the last three are located within D2. These data suggested that these five segments contributed significantly to the formation of the uPA binding site.Fig. 3Ligand binding by the homolog-scanning mutants of uPAR. A, uPA binding. uPA binding to the different uPAR mutants was conducted as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The uPA binding affinity (1/K d) of the mutants was compared with that of wild-type uPAR and expressed as percentages of the wild-type. Verifying specificity, mock transfected cells did not bind uPA, and for all functional receptors, uPA binding could be blocked by addition of a uPAR-specific mAb VIM5 (data not shown). *, indicates less than 0.5%. Data are the mean ± S.D. of two to three independent experiments performed in duplicate. B, adhesion to Vn. A total of 2 × 106 uPAR-expressing cells in HBSS were added to 24-well non-tissue culture plates, which were pre-coated with native Vn (10 μg/ml) and subsequently blocked with 1% BSA in DPBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, unbound cells were removed by three washes with DPBS and the adherent cells were quantified by staining with Crystal violet. The specificity of the adhesion assay is confirmed by lack of cell adhesion of the mock transfected cells, and by the ability of mAb VIM5 to block cell adhesion of all functional uPAR receptors (data not shown). Data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that all nine uPAR mutants had correct conformation, we conducted FACS analysis using a panel of different uPAR-specific mAbs, including VIM5, 3931, 3932, 3936, and 3937. All nine mutants reacted well with these mAbs, except for those where their epitopes reside within the switched segments (data not shown). For example, the functional mutant uPAR (Glu37–Leu40), which was active in both uPA and Vn binding (Fig. 3, A and B), was not recognized by mAb VIM5, indicating that segment 37ELEL within D1 represents part of the epitope for this mAb. Taking these data together, we concluded that loss of uPA binding by these five uPAR mutants resulted from direct alterations of the uPA binding site, rather than from gross structural changes within these mutants. Such a conclusion was supported further by our observation that a synthetic peptide (P1), corresponding to the identified residues (Gly155–Asn161 and Asn162–Phe167) within D2, bound uPA directly (see below). Next, we evaluated the effects of the nine uPAR mutations on Vn binding, using cell adhesion assays (22Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used native Vn to coat non-tissue culture 24-well plates. After blocking with BSA, the uPAR-expressing 293 cells were added to each well in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (to block integrin-mediated cell adhesion; see “Experimental Procedures”), and the number of adherent cells were determined. As shown in Fig. 3B, the five mutants that were defective in uPA binding were also defective in Vn binding. These mutants include Arg53–Gly60 and Leu61–Leu66 within D1, and Lys139–Arg142, Gly155–Asn161, and Asn162–Phe167 within D2. Their Vn binding activities were reduced by 11-, 9-, 6-, 6-, and 11-fold, respectively. Specificity of the Vn binding was confirmed by the ability of mAb VIM5 to block cell addition by the wild-type and all functional uPAR mutants (data not shown). Taking these data together, we found that two of three mutations in D1 and three of three mutations within D2 had dramatic effects on ligand binding by uPAR. These data underscored the critical roles of D2 in uPAR recognition of both ligands. Differential Ligand Recognition by the uPAR D2 Domain— Given the importance of the D2 domain in both uPA and Vn binding, we chose to focus our subsequent study on this domain alone. To probe the entire hydrated surface of the D2 domain, we constructed an additional five mutants (Ser90–Glu94, Ser101–Ser104, Arg116–Glu120, Asn172–Lys175, and Glu183–Asn186), in addition to the three D2 mutants described in Fig. 3. Of these five new mutants, residues Ser90-Glu94 are located within the NH2 terminus of D2, Ser101–Ser104 are located within the loop 1 region, Arg116–Glu120 are located in the middle, and finally, Asn172–Lys175 and Glu183–Asn186 are located within the COOH terminus of D2. Upon establishing these five stable cell lines, the effect of these mutations on Vn and uPA binding was determined as described above. As shown in Fig. 4A, all five additional mutants bound uPA well, exhibiting ∼70 to 120% wild-type uPA binding activities. In contrast, differential effects of these five mutations were observed on Vn binding (Fig. 4B): three mutants, uPAR(Ser90–Glu94), uPAR(Ser101–Ser104), and uPAR(Arg116–Glu120), exhibited normal Vn binding, whereas two mutants (uPAR(Asn172–Lys175) and uPAR(Glu183–Asn186)) failed to recognize Vn. These latter two mutants possessed intact conformations, as evidenced by their high affinity uPA binding with K d values of 1.9 and 1.6 nm, respectively, which are essentially identical to the K d of 1.6 nm for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). Thus, loss of Vn binding by uPAR(Asn172–Lys175) and uPAR(Glu183–Asn186) is likely because of a direct perturbation of the Vn binding site within D2. Synthetic Peptides of the D2 Domain Blocked Vn Binding to uPAR—To understand the underlying mechanism for the differential involvement of the two novel sequences (Asn172–Lys175 and Glu183–Asn186) in Vn and uPA binding, we constructed a three-dimensional model of D2, based on its homology to CD59 (14Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, residues that were critical to Vn binding (Asn172–Lys175 and Glu183–Asn186) cluster on the opposite site of those that were critical to uPA binding (Lys139–Arg142, Gly155–Asn161, and Asn162–Phe167), suggesting a possibility that the uPAR D2 domain may contain two separate ligand binding sites for uPA and Vn. To test this hypothesis, we prepared two synthetic peptides, P1 (153CPGSNGFHNNDTFHFLKC) and P2 (171CNTTKCNEGPILELENLPQ), representing the predicted ligand binding sites for uPA and Vn, respectively. The P1 peptide corresponds to mutants uPAR(Gly155–Asn161) and uPAR(Asn162–Phe167), which were defective in both uPA and Vn binding, and the P2 peptide corresponds to mutants uPAR(Asn172–Lys175) and uPAR(Gly180–Asn183), which were defective only in Vn binding. In addition, we prepared scrambled P1 and P2 peptides, sP1 (GHGNFPCSTKFNCNHLDF) and sP2 (NQLCNEEIPGLCKTTENPL). To see if these peptides could inhibit Vn binding by wild-type uPAR, we performed cell adhesion experiments in the presence or absence of these peptides. As shown in Fig. 6, the P2 peptide inhibited cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 0.1 and 0.5 mm P2 blocked 55 and 75% uPAR-mediated cell adhesion to Vn, respectively. The P1 peptide and the two scrambled peptides (sP1 and sP2) had no significant effect on Vn binding by uPAR, verifying the specificity of these assays.Fig. 6Inhibition of the uPAR/Vn interaction by synthetic peptides derived from the D2 domain. uPAR-mediated cell adhesion to Vn was conducted similarly as in Fig. 3B, except that different peptides were added in the assay mixture. The number of adherent cells in the absence of the peptides was taken as 100%. Verifying specificity of the assay, scrambled peptides (sP1 and sP2) did not significantly inhibit uPAR-mediated cell adhesion to Vn. Data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

In these experiments, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with different concentrations of peptides P1, P2, and their scrambled controls. After blocking with BSA, binding of Vn and the HMW uPA to the peptides was assessed using antibodies specific for these two proteins. As shown in Fig. 7A, peptide P2 bound Vn strongly, whereas its scrambled control sP2 did not show significant binding. In contrast, neither peptide P1 nor its scrambled control sP1 showed any significant Vn binding. To see if these peptides could interact with HMW uPA directly, similar ELISA experiments were performed (Fig. 7B). Only one peptide (P1) bound uPA significantly above background, having a calculated K d of ∼6 μm. None of the other three peptides had specific uPA binding activity. In fact, the P2 peptide displayed less uPA binding activity than the scrambled P1 peptide (sP1), suggesting that P2 did not interact with uPA. However, because of the large nonspecific binding seen with uPA binding to peptide-coated plates, a second assay was conducted to confirm the P1/uPA interaction. In these experiments, we coated the microtiter plate with 10 μg/ml uPA. After washing, the plate was blocked with BSA and then incubated with biotinylated peptides. The amount of bound peptides were determined using an alkaline phosphatase-avidin conjugate. As shown in Fig. 7C, only peptide P1 bound uPA with high affinity, whereas peptide P2 and the two scrambled peptides sP1 and sP2 did not have significant binding. The binding data could be fitted to a single binding site model with a K d of 1.6 μm. We have verified that all four peptides had similar efficiency of biotinylation. Moreover, P1 binding to uPA could be completely blocked by addition of a mAb against the amino-terminal fragment of uPA (number 3471), demonstrating the specificity of the binding assay. Given the importance of uPAR and Vn in a number of physiological and pathological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tumor metastasis, we have studied the molecular basis underlying uPAR recognition of Vn, using the homolog-scanning mutagenesis approach (20Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In particular, we have successfully separated Vn binding from uPA binding by uPAR, and identified a novel sequence (172NTTKCNEGPILELENLPQ) within the COOH terminus of the D2 domain that is critically involved in Vn but not uPA binding. Our conclusion that this sequence represents a novel Vn binding site in uPAR is supported by the following observations: 1) mutations of the above sequence completely destroyed Vn binding but did not effect uPA binding; 2) its corresponding synthetic peptide (P2) blocked uPAR/Vn interaction; and 3) the P2 peptide bound specifically to purified Vn but not HMW uPA. Previously, we employed the homolog-scanning mutagenesis approach in our studies of several cell surface receptors and successfully identified a number of different ligand binding sites (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Plow E.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For the current study, similar approaches were used to delineate the ligand binding sites of uPAR, based on sequence similarity but functional disparity between uPAR and its homolog CD59 (13Ploug M. Kjalke M. Ronne E. Weidle U. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To preserve maximally the gross structure of uPAR, none of the mutations in this study involved the conserved residues that likely play essential roles in protein folding. As established from our earlier studies, the homolog-scanning mutations, including those that destroyed ligand binding, did not significantly change the overall structure of the mutated receptor, and therefore loss of function was attributed to perturbations of the ligand recognition site (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Plow E.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this work, a total of 9 homolog mutants were constructed initially, which covered loops 2 and 3, as well as the helical regions within all three domains of uPAR. An additional 5 mutants were subsequently constructed that covered the remaining hydrated surface of the D2 domain. These 14 homolog-scanning mutants were correctly processed as evidenced by their correct molecular weights, expressed on the cell surface, and reacted well with a number of uPAR-specific mAbs, suggesting that all 14 uPAR mutants, including the seven defective receptors, possessed correct conformations. Therefore, we concluded that loss of ligand binding by these seven mutants was caused by direct perturbations of the binding pockets for Vn and uPA. Indeed, we found that two synthetic peptides (P1 and P2), corresponding to the two ligand binding sites identified in this study, behaved like bona fide ligand binding sites, and displayed proper selectivity for their respective ligands. That is, the P1 peptide, corresponding to the sequences (Gly155–Asn161 and Asn162–Phe167) that are critical for uPA binding, interacted with uPA but not Vn; whereas the P2 peptide, corresponding to the sequences (Asn172–Lys175 and Glu180–Asn183) that are critical for Vn binding, bound Vn but not uPA (Fig. 7). The uPA binding site within uPAR has been studied extensively in the past several years, using a number of different approaches (15Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Bdeir K. Kuo A. Mazar A. Sachais B.S. Xiao W. Gawlak S. Harris S. Higazi A.A. Cines D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In good agreement with the published data, we found that the uPA binding site occupies a broad region that encompasses all three domains, with the most critical residues located in D1 and D2. These include residues 53 to 66 within D1 and 139–142 and 155–167 within D2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, little is known about the Vn binding site within uPAR. In this regard, our current study has provided very strong evidence for a direct role of D2 in Vn binding. This conclusion is based on our novel observation that a unique sequence (172NTTKCNEGPILELENLPQ) located at the COOH terminus of D2 is critical to Vn binding but dispensable to uPA binding. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide (P2) derived from this sequence inhibited uPAR-mediated adhesion to Vn (Fig. 6), and when coated on microtiter wells, bound Vn directly but did not interact with uPA. In addition, we found another peptide (P1), derived from our identified sequences of the adjacent uPA binding site, bound uPA but not Vn (Fig. 7). Taking these data together, we concluded that the D2 domain of uPAR possesses two separate ligand binding sites with specificity for uPA and Vn, respectively. In a three-dimensional model, constructed from the crystal structure of CD59 (14Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the uPA and Vn binding sites reside on opposite sides of the D2 domain (Fig. 5). The uPA binding site is composed of resides Lys139–Arg142, Gly155–Asn161, and Asn162–Phe167, whereas the Vn binding site is composed of amino acids Asn172–Lys175 and Glu183–Asn186. These two ligand binding sites are linked intimately via a 2-amino acid residue linker (Leu168–Lys159). Therefore, it is possible that ligand binding to one site could affect the conformation of the other site. Consistent with this notion, we found that: 1) although uPA was not required, it did promote Vn binding to uPAR (∼1.5-fold) (data not shown); and 2) all mutants defective in uPA binding also failed in Vn binding (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it must be stressed that uPA could augment Vn binding by other mechanisms. For example, uPA could promote Vn binding by inducing oligomerization of soluble uPAR (26Sidenius N. Andolfo A. Fesce R. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additional experiments will be required to differentiate these mechanisms. In summary, using the homolog-scanning mutagenesis approach, we have successfully separated Vn binding from uPA binding by uPAR, and identified a novel sequence (172NTTKCNEGPILELENLPQ) within the COOH terminus of its D2 domain, which is critically involved in Vn but not uPA binding. In addition, we have located two distinct ligand binding sites within D2. A synthetic peptide (P1), corresponding to the identified uPA binding site, bound uPA but not Vn. Another synthetic peptide (P2), corresponding to the Vn binding site, bound Vn directly and blocked uPAR-mediated cell adhesion, but did not interact with uPA. Protein modeling showed that these two ligand binding sites reside in separate regions of the D2 domain but are connected with a short linker, suggesting a possibility that uPA binding to the uPAR D2 domain could induce conformational changes within the Vn binding site, leading to optimal Vn binding. Given the critical role of uPAR in a number of physiological and pathological processes, the results from this study could help us better understand how uPAR recognizes its different ligands, and most importantly, how these interactions contribute to cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and tumor metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2128472785,"The EWS-FLI1 transcription factor is consistently expressed in 85% of Ewing tumors (EFT). In heterologous cells, EWS-FLI1 induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. It has been speculated that the p53 tumor suppressor pathway may be generally compromised in EFT despite only rare p53 mutations. In order to test for functional integrity of this pathway, we have investigated a series of EFT cell lines that differ from each other with respect to their endogenous p53 and INK4A gene status for their response to ectopic p53 expression and to stimulation of endogenous p53 activity by X-ray treatment. Significant interindividual and intratumoral variations in the apoptotic propensity of EFT cell lines to transient expression of ectopic p53 were observed, which was independent of the level of p53 expression. In cell lines with a low apoptotic incidence, apoptosis was delayed and the surviving fraction showed a prolonged growth arrest. Complete resistance to p53-induced apoptosis in two cell lines established from the same patient was associated with a high BCL2/BAX ratio and low levels of APAF1. Sensitivity to X-rays showed a trend towards a higher apoptotic rate in wild-type (wt) p53 expressing than in p53 mutant cells. However, one wt p53-expressing EFT cell line was completely refractory to irradiation-stimulated cell death despite high apoptotic responsiveness to ectopic p53. No difference in Ser15 phosphorylation and the transcriptional activation of p53 targets was observed in wt p53 EFT cell lines irrespective of the induction of cell death or growth arrest. All together, our results demonstrate that despite significant variability in the outcome, cell death or cell cycle arrest, the p53 downstream pathway and the DNA damage signaling pathway are functionally intact in EFT."

PLCβ2 can be activated by Gβγ subunits, whereas PLCδ1 can be activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). For both proteins, the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain appears to mediate activation. Here, we have constructed a chimera in which we placed the N-terminal PH domain of PLCδ1 into remaining C-terminal regions of PLCβ2. The PHδPLCβ chimera showed PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane binding similar to PLCδ1 and a Gβγ interaction energy close to that of PLCδ1. Like PLCδ1, the chimera was activated by PI(4,5)P2 through the PH domain but not by Gβγ. Because these and previous results indicate a common site of contact between the PH and catalytic domains in these two enzymes, we computationally docked the known structures of the PH and catalytic domains of PLCδ1. A synthetic peptide whose sequence matches a potential interaction site between the two domains inhibited the basal activity of PLCβ2, PLCδ1, and a Gβγ-activable PHβ2-PLCδ1 chimera.

There are four known families of mammalian PLCs that are regulated differently. The PLCβs are regulated by G protein subunits, and each of the four members of the PLCβ family has varying sensitivities to Gα and Gβγ subunits. PLCβ2 is a 134-kDa protein that can be independently activated by both Gα and Gβγ subunits, but simultaneous activation by both subunits does not appear to occur (3Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mammalian PLCs are modular proteins that contain several structural domains (see Fig. 1). PLCβ are distinguished by a long, 400-residue tail on their C termini, and deletion of this tail abolishes activation by Gα but not Gβγ (4Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Wang T. Dowal L. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The association of the N terminus to Gβγ subunits does not appear to be highly specific because the pleckstrin homology domain of a related protein, PLCδ, that is not activated by G proteins binds to Gβγ with only a 4-fold weaker affinity than that of PLCβ2. These relatively close interaction energies between the two types of PLC can be compared with specific binding of the PLCβ2 C2 domain to activated Gαq, where a similar association to PLCδ1 C2 cannot be detected (7Wang T. Pentyala S. Elliott J. Dowal L. Gupta E. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7843-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because PLCs attach to membranes to access their substrate, characterization of their membrane binding properties has been carried out. It has been found that unlike PLCδ1, which only binds strongly to membranes if its substrate PI(4,5)P2 is present (10Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cifuentes M.E. Delaney T. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1945-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PLCβ2 binds strongly and fairly nonspecifically to lipid membranes (12Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Jenco J.M. Becker K.P. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, membrane binding of both types of proteins appears to be mediated by the N-terminal PH domain (10Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9859-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Measurements of the membrane association of the isolated PH domains of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 show that this region is responsible for both the affinity and specificity of membrane interaction (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of the N-terminal PH domains, we have previously constructed a chimera in which the PH domain of PLCβ2 was swapped into the catalytic portion of PLCδ1 to yield the chimeric protein, PHβ2-PLCδ1 (9Wang T. Dowal L. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although this protein had the same membrane and Gβγ interaction properties as wild type PLCβ2, it was also activated by Gβγ, showing that the insertion of the PH of PLCβ2 into PLCδ1 confers G protein activation. Thus, the PH domain of PLCβ2 directly confers Gβγ activation to the catalytic core. Analogously, it has been shown that the specific binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the PH domain of PLCδ1 resulted in activation of the catalytic core (17Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies imply that the PH domain of PLCβ2 or PLCδ1 contacts a common site in the catalytic region that transmits activation when Gβγ or PI(4,5)P2 binds, respectively. One possible site may be a highly conserved site in the catalytic region that has been implicated in mediating Gβγ activation of PLCβ2 (19Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed a chimeric protein consisting of the PH domain of PLCδ1 and the remaining regions of PLCβ2, called PHδPLCβ. We also constructed a chimera that includes the PH of PLCδ1, a short (∼20 residue) linker sequence, and the first helix on the neighboring EF hand (PHL δPLCβ). The purpose of this latter construct was to test whether altering this linker and EF hand would affect the interaction between the PH domain and the catalytic core. We find that both proteins have the same basal activity as wild type PLCβ2 and displayed PI(4,5)P2-specific binding and activation as PLCδ1. As expected, the chimeric proteins are activated by PI(4,5)P2 but not Gβγ, suggesting that activation of the catalytic cores of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 are mediated by a common site in their PH domains. By using a peptide that we predicted should inhibit the interaction between the PH and catalytic domains based on theoretical models, we found that we could inhibit both the basal activity of both enzymes and eliminate both PI(4,5)P2 and Gβγ activation of the PLC catalytic cores in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results thus give a molecular basis for the common activation of these two enzymes. Protein Preparation—Synthetic peptides were prepared and purchased from the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA) and used as received. PLCβ2 and Gβγ subunits were expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system and purified as previously described (see Ref. 12Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PLCδ1 was expressed in bacteria as before (11Cifuentes M.E. Delaney T. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1945-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Chimeras—Human PLC δ1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and recombinant human PLCβ2 in Sf9 cells. Two chimeras were prepared. The first, PHδPLCβ, replaced residues 1–134 of PLCβ2 with residues 1–117 of PLC δ1. The second, PHL δPLCβ, included a 20-residue linker region and the first EF hand of PLCδ1. The coding sequence of PH and PH-L domain of PLC δ1 was amplified by PCR using corresponding PLCδ1 cDNA. (The primers were 5′-ATGGACTCGGGCCGGGAC 3′ and 3′-GCCTGAGTGGTGGACTAGTTTGTGCAGCCCCAGC-5′ or 3′-GCAGCTCCTGAA GCTGCTAGCTTGTCCTTGTTTTTGTCAGC-5′.) The chimeras were constructed by introducing SpeI and NheI restriction enzyme sites into a pVL1392 vector containing the PLCβ2 insert. These were used along with NotI to remove the PH domain (NotI-NheI) and the PH-linker-EF portion (NotI-SpeI) of PLC-β2. The corresponding PH domain and PH-linker-EF region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using PLCδ1 as a template. These were then ligated into the PLCβ2 vector within the NotI and NheI/SpeI sites to give the corresponding chimeric proteins. The chimera enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using the protocol for PLCβ2. The purified proteins were identified by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of PLCδ1 and a monoclonal antibody to the C-terminal region of PLCβ2. Hydrolysis of PI or PI(4,5)P 2 in Phospholipid Vesicles—Hydrolysis of [3H]PI was carried out using small, unilamellar vesicles composed of PI:PC:PS (1:5:5) with increasing amounts of PI(4,5)P2 as described in the text. We note that the total amount of PI in each assay (100 μm) greatly exceeded the highest PI(4,5)P2 concentration used for activation (5 μm). To assay the PI-PLC activity, purified enzymes (0.45–15 nm) were incubated in an assay volume of 60 μl containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 160 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm CaCl2. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C using [3H]PI and 3 min using [3H]PI(4,5)P2. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 0.1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and 0.3 ml of the upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. Using [3H]PI as a substrate, we found that the specific activity of PLCδ1 is 51 times higher than PLCβ2 and 17 times higher than the chimeras. Activation of PLC by G Protein Subunits—15 nm PLCβ2 or chimera was incubated with increasing concentration of Gβγ in 60 μl of buffer that contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 160 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.83 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm CaCl2 at 30 °°C for 5 min. The extent of [3H]PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis was then assessed as described above. Fluorescent Probes—All of the probes were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Concentrated stocks of the probes were made in N,N-dimethylformamide and stored at –20 °C under nitrogen in bottles wrapped with aluminum foil. The proteins were labeled with the amine-reactive probe coumarin succinyl ester by initially raising the pH of the protein solution to 8.0 and adding a small aliquot of probe dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a 4:1 probe:protein molar ratio. Unreacted probe was removed by extensive dialysis in 20 mm Hepes, 0.16 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, for either PLC proteins or Gβγ. Gαq subunits labeled in the presence of GTP were dialyzed against 150 mm Hepes, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 150 mm MgSO4, and 100 mm EDTA. 100 μm GTPγS was added immediately after dialysis. This labeling procedure consistent gives a protein:probe labeling ratio of ∼1:1. Fluorescence Measurements and Analysis—Fluorescence measurements were performed on an ISS spectrofluorometer (Champaign, IL) using 3-mm cuvettes. Coumarin-labeled proteins were excited at 340 nm and scanned from 380 to 500 nm. The emission intensity was taken from the integrated area of the spectrum. In the lipid titration curves, the background spectra of lipid alone was subtracted from each spectra along the titration curve. All of the spectra were corrected for the 10–12% dilution that occurred during the titration. Membrane binding was determined by following the change in fluorescence of a dilute solution (50–100 nm) of labeled protein as freshly extruded large, unilamellar vesicles were added. The results were fit to a binding isotherm after correcting for dilution and background scattering. The reported partition coefficient refers to the lipid concentration at which amount of bound versus unbound protein (K p = [Pb]/[Pun]) is identical. We found that the emission intensity of coumarin-labeled Gβγ showed a substantial and reproducible increase upon the addition of unlabeled PLCβ2 and gave values of apparent K d identical to those previously obtained using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (3Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the titration curves showed the appropriate shift in midpoint when the initial concentration of coumarin-labeled Gβγ was changed, showing that the changes in coumarin fluorescence reflect protein-protein associations. Therefore, in these studies we determined lateral association by the change in coumarin intensity rather than fluorescence resonance energy transfer so as to minimize the handling of these proteins. We analyzed the titration curves assuming that all proteins can form 1:1 complexes. Because the protein association curves are conducted on membrane surfaces, the resulting bimolecular association curves yield apparent K d values that are dependent on the total available membrane surface area. We have previously translated these apparent values of K d to the dissociation constant that would be observed if the proteins were not membrane-bound (20Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, because all of the studies here were done at an identical lipid concentration, this analysis is not required. We have only reported the experimental values of the apparent K d to be used for comparative purposes. Molecular Modeling of the PH and Catalytic Domains of PLCβ2 — Models of PH domain-XY domain and complexes of rat PLCδ1 were constructed using a protein docking program, Global Range Molecular Matching or GRAMM (21Vakser I. Matar O. Lam C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8477-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We also docked models (obtained from 3D Jigsaw) of PLCβ2 PH domain to its catalytic region using high and low resolution methods. The following parameters were used for high resolution docking of PLCδ1 PH domain to ΔPH-PLCδ1: matching mode (generic/helix) = generic; grid step = 2.1; repulsion (attraction is always –1) = 11.0; attraction double range (fraction of single range) – fraction = 0; potential range type (atom_radius, grid_step) = grid_step; projection (black-white, gray) = gray; representation (all, hydrophobic) = all; number of matches to output = 1000; angle for rotations, deg (10, 12, 15, 18, 20, and 30; 0 indicates no rotation) = 10. Membrane Binding Properties of the PHδPLCβ Chimera— Although the isolated PH domain of PLCβ2 binds strongly to lipid membranes (12Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Jenco J.M. Becker K.P. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the contribution of other enzyme domains in membrane association is not clear (see Ref. 6Park D. Hhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so the chimeras in Fig. 1 may allow us to determine the contribution of these other PLCβ2 domains in membrane association. The PH domains of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 have different binding characteristics. The PH domain of PLCδ1 binds strongly (i.e. K p = ∼50–200 μm) to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 because of specific interactions, and also to highly negatively charged lipids because of electrostatic attraction by the positive lobe of the protein (14Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PH domain of PLCβ2 binds strongly to membranes with little specificity for charge or chemical structure (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, if the PH domain solely directs membrane association of the whole enzyme, we would expect the PHδ-PLCβ chimeras to show identical characteristics to PLCδ1. We have previously found that the emission intensity of coumarin-labeled PLCβ2 and the isolated PH domains of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 increase upon membrane binding (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We thus measured the binding of the proteins to large, unilamellar vesicles of varying membrane compositions by the increase in fluorescence of the probe coumarin covalently attached to the proteins (see methods). In Fig. 2a we show the association of PLCβ2, PLCδ1, and the PHδPLCβ chimera to POPC bilayers. In accord with previous studies using both spectroscopic and sedimentation techniques, PLCδ1 does not bind to POPC bilayers in this concentration range, whereas PLCβ2 binds strongly (12Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Jenco J.M. Becker K.P. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar,22Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike PLCδ1, the PHδPLCβ chimera bound to POPC bilayers with an affinity strong enough to be measured by fluorescence, but 20-fold weaker than PLCβ2. These results support the idea that regions other than the PH domain of PLCβ2 contribute to membrane binding (see Ref. 6Park D. Hhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 5% PI(4,5)P2 is incorporated into POPC bilayers, the membrane binding affinities of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 become comparable in accord with previous work (12Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2b we show that the presence of PI(4,5)P2 increases the binding affinity of the PHδPLCβ chimera 20-fold, bringing its value (K p = 20.6 ± 2.8 μm) close to that of PLCβ2 (K p = 28.4 ± 11.8 μm) and PLCδ1 (K p = 19.6 ± 10 μm). Thus, the characteristic PI(4,5)P2 binding specificity of the PLCδ1 PH domain remains intact in the chimera. This increase in membrane binding affinity of PLCδ1 is not entirely because of electrostatic effects because the chimera and PLCδ1 bound much more weakly to membranes containing 30% negatively charged lipids (i.e. PC:PS (2:1)) (data not shown). Binding of PLC Enzymes to G Protein Subunits—We have previously characterized the lateral association between PLCβ2 and G protein subunits (3Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and between the isolated PH domains of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 to Gβγ subunits on membrane surfaces (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have found that even though PLCδ1 is not activated by Gβγ subunits, it will bind to these subunits with a 4-fold weaker affinity than the Gβγ-activable PLCβ2. The comparable Gβγ affinities between the PH domain of PLCβ2 and the whole enzyme, and similarly between the PH domain of PLCδ1 and the whole enzyme, suggest that Gβγ association is mediated entirely through the PH domain (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then the Gβγ binding affinity of the PHδPLCβ chimera should be closer to PLCδ1 than to PLCβ2. We measured the lateral association of the PLC proteins to Gβγ subunits on membrane surfaces by labeling Gβγ subunits with coumarin, reconstituting C-Gβγ into lipid bilayers and adding the PLC proteins under conditions where the proteins would be entirely membrane-bound. Control studies substituted buffer for the titrating protein solution. Under our labeling conditions, the fluorescence intensity of the coumarin probe attached to Gβγ is sensitive to PLC association, giving association constants identical to previous values obtained using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (3Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, the midpoint of the titration curves shift appropriately over an 8-fold initial amount of Gβγ to give identical values of K d, which is a key indicator of a protein-protein association process. The observation that the coumarin label changes upon association with PLCβ2 implies that the labeling site may be close to the protein-protein interaction site, although the apparent K d does not appear to be affected (see Ref. 3Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because our studies compare the affinities between the PLC enzymes and G protein subunits, perturbation of the absolute affinities because of the probe is not critical. We reconstituted C-Gβγ subunits onto PC:PS (1:2) lipid membranes because this high concentration of negatively charged lipids ensures complete membrane binding of both PLCβ2 and the PH-PLCδ1 chimeras in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 (data not shown). The studies were carried out at identical lipid concentrations so that apparent affinities can be directly compared. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the Gβγ affinity of the chimera is closer to PLCδ1 than to PLCβ2. We find that the ratio of the apparent Gβγ dissociation constant of the PHδPLCβ to wild type PLCβ2 is similar to the ratio of the PH domains of PLCδ1 and PLCβ2 and also to corresponding ratios of the whole enzymes (8Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If other sites in PLCβ2 contributed to its association with Gβγ subunits, we would expect these ratios to differ. Thus, these results are in accord with the idea that the PH domain is the main docking site for Gβγ subunits and that other domains, if they play a role, do not significantly contribute to the binding energy. Response of the Chimera to Activators—When the PH domain of PLCβ2 was swapped into PLCδ1, the specific activity of this chimera was much lower than PLCδ1 and comparable with PLCβ2. This result raised the question of whether the PH domain modulates the activity of the catalytic core. One factor that may contribute to the higher enzymatic activity of PLCδ1 as compared with PLCβ2 is idea that the specific binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the PLCδ1-PH domain induces activation of the catalytic core (see Ref. 17Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). If the PH domain of PLCδ1 interacted with the catalytic region PLCβ2 in a manner similar to that of wild type PLCδ1, then we would expect the PHδ-PLCβ2 chimera to be activated by PI(4,5)P2 and not by Gβγ subunits. To determine the relative activity of the PLC enzymes, we compared the specific activities of PLCδ1, PLCβ2, and PHδPLCβ by measuring the hydrolysis of [3H]PI in small, unilamellar vesicles composed of PI:PC:PS (1:5:5) with increasing amounts of cold PI(4,5)P2. This substrate concentration has been previously used to show that PI(4,5)P2 produces an 8–9-fold increase in PLCδ1 activity (17Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the absence of PI(4,5)P2 activator, we find that the specific activity of PHδPLCβ lies between that of PLCδ1 and PLCβ2, giving a value only 17-fold less than PLCδ1 for the chimera as opposed to a 51-fold less value obtained for PLCβ2 relative to PLCδ1 (data not shown). Because the chimera contains the catalytic region of PLCβ2, its higher activity toward [3H]PI indicates that the PHδ1 has a different interaction with the PLCβ2 catalytic core than the wild type PH domain. This observation supports the idea that the PH domain serves to inhibit the core in the basal state in the absence of activators (9Wang T. Dowal L. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We then tested whether PI(4,5)P2 could activate the enzymes. These studies were carried out by measuring [3H]PI hydrolysis with increasing amounts cold PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane substrate (see Ref. 17Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The results, presented in Fig. 4, show that PI(4,5)P2 activation is c"
