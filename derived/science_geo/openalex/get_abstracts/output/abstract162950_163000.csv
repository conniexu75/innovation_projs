Among the different groups of enzymes known to catalyze the covalent modification, the most recent additions are the histone methyltransferases (HMTases), whose functions are now being characterized. Here we show that a SET domain-containing protein, G9a, is a novel mammalian lysine-preferring HMTase. Like Suv39 h1, the first identified lysine-preferring mammalian HMTase, G9a transfers methyl groups to the lysine residues of histone H3, but with a 10–20-fold higher activity. It was reported that lysines 4, 9, and 27 in H3 are methylated in mammalian cells. G9a was able to add methyl groups to lysine 27 as well as 9 in H3, compared with Suv39 h1, which was only able to methylate lysine 9. Our data clearly demonstrated that G9a has an enzymatic nature distinct from Suv39 h1 and its homologue h2. Finally, fluorescent protein-labeled G9a was shown to be localized in the nucleus but not in the repressive chromatin domains of centromeric loci, in which Suv39 h1 family proteins were localized. This finding indicates that G9a may contribute to the organization of the higher order chromatin structure of non-centromeric loci.

Targeted covalent modification of the amino-terminal tails of the core histones in nucleosomes has emerged as one of the important mechanisms in this process. Posttranslational acetylation and phosphorylation of histone tails are intensively studied among these modifications. Transcriptionally active euchromatic regions of the chromosome are often associated with hyperacetylated histones, and silent heterochromatic regions are often associated with hypoacetylated forms (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of histone acetylation in vivo are maintained by the opposing activities of histone acetyl transferase and histone deacetylase (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 3Grunstein M. Cell. 1998; 93: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Besides acetylation, the histone H3 amino terminus is also phosphorylated in association with different cellular processes. Phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 correlated closely with chromosomal condensation and was shown to be required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation (4Wei Y. Mizzen C.A.

Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of serine 10 also correlated with transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes in a rapid and transient manner upon mitogen stimulation (6Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 7Thomson S. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, several kinases have been identified as the enzymes that contribute to the mitogen-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation (8Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 9Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In addition to acetylation and phosphorylation, it has also been reported that core histones, especially H3 and H4, are methylated (10von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.D. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,11Duerre J.A. DiMaria P. Kim S. Paik W.K. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian HeLa cells, lysines 4, 9, and 27 in H3 and lysine 20 in H4 were shown to be methylated (12Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although the biological significance of histone methylation remains unclear, several histone methyltransferases (HMTases)1have recently been identified (12Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 13Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 14Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, Suv39 h1 and its homologue, h2, are the first known mammalian lysine-preferring HMTases and SET domain-containing proteins. Both enzymes preferentially methylate H3 in a mixture of histones in vitro, and their catalytic activities are dependent on the SET domain. By using a peptide encoding the first 20 residues of the H3 amino terminus, it was shown that the Suv39 h protein could transfer methyl groups to lysine 9. The enzymes that catalyze methylation of the other residues, lysines 4 and 27 in H3 and lysine 20 in H4, remain to be identified. The SET domains in Suv39 h1 and h2 are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and are found in many nuclear proteins called “chromatin modulators” (13Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Therefore, SET domain-containing proteins have diverse functions. For example, some members of theDrosophila polycomb and trithorax group (Pc-G and trx-G) protein families, which have been shown to act as repressors and activators, respectively, of the homeotic selector genes, contain the SET domain in their carboxyl termini (14Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Among several SET domain-containing protein families, Suv39 h family proteins are characterized as a group possessing a chromo-domain, which is also considered as a chromatin regulator motif. Members of this family were identified as CLR4 in yeast (15Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), Su(VAR)3–9 in fruit fly (16Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), Suv39 h1 and h2 in mouse, and SUV39H1 in human (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 18O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Haynes A.R. Laible G. Rea S. Schmid M. Lebersorger A. Jerratsch M. Sattler L. Mattei M.G. Denny P. Brown S.D. Schweizer D. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9423-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The Suv39 h family proteins have been considered to contribute to the organization of repressive chromatin regions such as the centromere (13Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this study, a SET domain-containing protein, G9a, was identified as a novel mammalian lysine-preferring HMTase. Compared with Suv39 h1, G9a possesses an apparently unique molecular nature. It is much more efficient at transferring methyl groups to histone H3 in vitro. In addition, not only lysine 9, but also lysine 27 in H3, is a target for methylation by G9a. Finally, the nuclear localization of ectopically expressed G9a differs significantly from that of Suv39 h1, suggesting that G9a may not be involved in the organization of repressive chromatin domains but may contribute to the regulation of chromatin structure in other loci. Full-length human G9a (hG9a) cDNA (19Milner C.M. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was obtained by ligation of a 1.2-kb BamHI/ApaI cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–399 to aBamHI/ApaI-digested partial hG9a cDNA (encoding amino acids 350 to termination), which was previously cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The former was PCR-amplified from a Jurkat leukemia cDNA library using specific primers 5′-GCATGAGTGATGATGTCCACTCAC and 5′-TCACGGACAGGTACAACTGCC. For protein expression in mammalian cells, the resulting 3.0-kbHindIII/NotI-digested cDNA fragment containing the entire hG9a open reading frame was inserted into the respective site of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) to generate an Aequorea Victoria green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (20Yang T.T. Cheng L. Kain S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4592-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) fusion protein. Full-length mouse Suv39 h1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from a mouse B cell leukemia cDNA library using specific primers 5′-ATAGAATTCGATGGCGGAAAATTTAAAAG and 5′-ATAGAATTCCTAGAAGAGGTATTTTCGGCA. The obtained cDNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 and pDsRed1-C1 vectors (CLONTECH) in an in-frame fashion. Expression plasmids for EGFP and Discosoma striata red (DsRed) (21Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar)-human heterochromatic protein 1 α-isoform (HP1HSα) (22Sugimoto K. Yamada T. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) fusion molecules were constructed by similar procedures. For protein expression in Escherichia coli, mouse G9a (mG9a) cDNA was isolated from a uni-ZAP murine testis cDNA library (Stratagene) using the 1.2-kb hG9a cDNA described above as a probe. A 1.4-kb EcoRI/XhoI cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 621–1000 of mG9a was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain an amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mG9a fusion molecule. A 1.0-kb cDNA encoding amino acids 82–412 of Suv39 h1 was PCR-amplified and inserted into theEcoRI site of pGEX4T-3. Mouse histone H3 cDNA (H3.1, GenBankTM accession number 193861) was PCR-amplified from a mouse embryonic stem cell line, TT2 cDNA library using specific primers 5′-TAAGAATTCGGCTCGTACTAAGCAGACCGC and 5′-TATACTCGAGTTAAGCCCTCTCCCCGCGGAA. The obtained PCR product was digested with EcoRI/XhoI and subcloned into the respective sites of pZErO 2–1 (Invitrogen). A 180-base pairEcoRI/SalI fragment of the histone H3 cDNA encoding amino acids 1–57 was introduced into pGEX-4T-3. All PCR-amplified cDNA products were confirmed by sequencing. Point mutations within the SET domain of mG9a and Suv39 h1 and the amino terminus of histone H3 were engineered by the standard double PCR mutagenesis method. The amino terminus (residues 1–52) of human centromere protein-A (CENP-A) and a full-length HP1HSα cDNA were cloned into pGEX vectors as previously described in Refs.23Muro Y. Azuma N. Onouchi H.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, respectively. cDNAs encoding mouse telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and TRF2 were isolated from a λgt11 mouse thymus cDNA library and subcloned into the pGEX-4T vectors. Recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 codon-plus RIL strain (Stratagene) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the recently reported method (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Concentrations of recombinant proteins used were determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. All native histones (a mixture of H1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4; and single H1, H2A, and H3) were purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Methyltransferase assays were performed as reported (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of reaction mixture containing substrates, enzymes, and 250 nCi ofS-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]-l-methionine in methylase activity buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 250 mm sucrose) was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Gels were dried, and detection of methyl-14C was performed using a BAS-5000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). 293 human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. To generate 293 cells stably expressing both EGFP- and DsRed-fusion molecules, individual protein expression vectors were sequentially introduced into 293 cells in concert with different drug-resistant gene-expressing vectors such as the PGK promoter-driven puromycin- or hygromysin-resistant gene expression vectors. Transfections were performed by using a lipofection reagent, LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293 cells were cultured in 6-cm diameter dishes under the condition described above. Cells about 50% confluent conditions were transfected with EGFP-hG9a or its SET domain deletion mutant, EGFP-ΔSET (see Fig. 5) by the method described above. After 3 days of culture, cells were harvested and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication and centrifugation (16,000 ×g, 15 min), supernatants were incubated with anti-EGFP specific antibodies (CLONTECH). The immune complexes were collected with protein-A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used in the Western blotting and in vitro HMTase assays. Aliquots of cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) for 5 min, cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse E600, Nikon) equipped with a PlanApo 60 x (NA 1.40) and a MicroMAX 1300Y cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). Images were acquired by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) by collecting a Z-series of 0.5-μm optical sections. Among SET domain-containing proteins, HMTase activity has so far been observed only in Suv39 h family proteins including yeast CLR4 and mammalian Suv39 h1 and h2. Because only Suv39 h family proteins possess two cysteine-rich regions adjacent to the SET domain, Rea et al. (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar) suggested that to exert HMTase activity, the SET domain requires combination with these adjacent cysteine-rich regions. Taking this viewpoint, we focused on G9a, a ubiquitously expressed SET domain-containing protein that was originally characterized as a molecule encoded by a gene mapped in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex locus (19Milner C.M. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). G9a resembles CLR4 and Suv39 h, because it contains a SET domain flanked by two cysteine-rich regions in its carboxyl terminus, but other regions are quite different (illustrated in Fig.1A). Amino acid sequence alignment of the two cysteine-rich regions flanking the SET domain from hG9a and mouse Suv39 h1 revealed that they are highly related, and the positions of their cysteine residues are highly conserved (Fig. 1B, top panel). Within the SET domain, the H(R)φφNHSC motif (where φ indicates a hydrophobic residue) was previously shown to be a possible catalytic core motif responsible for the enzymatic activity (shown boxed in Fig.1B, bottom panel), because amino acid replacement of histidine 324 and cysteine 326 in Suv39 h1 abolished enzymatic activity. Replacement of histidine 320 of Suv39 h1 with arginine (SuvH320R) results in a 20-fold increase in enzymatic activities. Yeast CLR4, which possesses arginine at this position of the putative catalytic core motif, exhibits hyperenzymatic activities similar to the SuvH320R mutant, supporting the importance of this position in determination of the strength of activity (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). HG9a possesses the yeast CLR4-type catalytic core motif in the SET domain (900R φφNHLC906), with arginine in the first position of the core motif. To investigate whether mG9a carboxyl terminus has HMTase activity, we performed an in vitro methylation assay using native histones as substrates. Recombinant GST-mG9a (residues 621–1000) and GST-Suv39 h1 (residues 82–412) were incubated with native histones (a mixture of H1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4) andS-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]-l-methionine as a methyl donor. Reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, andmethyl-14C-transferred proteins were visualized by an imaging analyzer. We observed that GST-mG9a, as well as GST-Suv39 h1, showed HMTase activity and preferentially methylated H3. Furthermore, GST-mG9a exhibited higher HMTase activity, and 1 μg of GST-mG9a was capable of transferring methyl groups to histone H3 more efficiently than was 10 μg of GST-Suv39 h1 (Fig.2). Serial dilution analysis revealed that GST-mG9a possessed about 20-fold higher HMTase activity than Suv39 h1 (data not shown). However, addition of excess amounts of the GST-mG9a amino terminus molecule (residues 138–698) did not result in any detectable HMTase activities, indicating that G9a catalyzes histone H3 methylation in a carboxyl-terminal SET domain-dependent manner. To confirm that the HMTase activity is an intrinsic property of G9a, we repeated the in vitro HMTase assay using hG9a that was ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. EGFP fused with full-length hG9a (residues 1–1001) was expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293, harvested by using anti-EGFP specific antibodies, and introduced into the HMTase assay. As shown in Fig. 4,D and E, EGFP-hG9a fusion molecules also exerted HMTase activity and preferentially methylated H3 in the mixture of native histones.Figure 4G9a can transfer methyl groups to lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3.A, recombinant GST fusion histone H3 amino terminus (residues 1–57), H3N, and the mutants used as substrates for in vitro methylation assays. The amino acid sequence of the mouse H3 amino terminus is shown on the top. The H3 amino terminus region (residues 1–57) fused to GST is shaded. All the lysine (K) to arginine (R) replacements at position 4, 9, and/or 27 in each of the mutants are boxed. Band C, in vitro HMTase assays using 20 μg of H3N mutants as substrates. GST-mG9a-(621–1000) (B) and GST-Suv39 h1-(82–412) (C) were used for the enzyme assay. In cases employing the single lysine mutants 4R, 9R, and 27R as substrates, both enzymes could methylate 4R and 27R dominantly as substrates, indicating that lysine 9 is the dominant methylation residue. Apparent HMTase activity against 9R was also detected by GST-mG9a but not Suv39 h1, suggesting the existence of an additional target site for G9a. Among the double lysine mutants N4, N9, and N27, N9 was found to be a suitable substrate (S) for both enzymes (E); however, N27 could also serve as the substrate for G9a methylation, indicating the ability of GST-mG9a to methylate lysine 27.D and E, methylation of lysine 27 was an intrinsic property of G9a. Transiently expressed EGFP-hG9a-(1–1000) and its SET domain deletion mutant, EGFP-ΔSET-(1–755) in 293 cells were harvested with anti-EGFP antibodies. Western blot analysis confirmed that nearly the same amounts of fusion molecules were precipitated (arrows in D). The immunoprecipitated molecules were then introduced into in vitro HMT assays using native histones or H3N mutants as substrates, and the relative methylation efficiencies (%) were determined (E). The relative methylation efficiency (%) was calculated as (14C counts of mutant H3N −14C counts of GST)/(14C counts of H3N −14C counts of GST) × 100. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also performed the HMTase assay for G9a by using single native histone as a substrate. It was shown that not only H3 but also H1 can be efficiently methylated by Suv39 h1 if H1 was used alone. When purified native H1, H2A, and H3 were applied to the assay as single substrates, G9a also significantly methylated not only native H3 but also H1. Slightly methylated proteins were detected in the lane of H2A (Fig. 3, lane 2), possibly due to incomplete elimination of H1 and H3 during the purification processes. The physiological significance of the H1 methylation is currently unknown but poses an interesting issue for future studies. We further investigated the substrate specificity of G9a as a methyltransferase using several other nuclear proteins, which were shown to be covalently modified by other enzymes such as kinases or are possible substrate candidates of these enzymes. We introduced several recombinant GST-fused nuclear proteins, which were human CENP-A amino terminus (residues 1–52) (23Muro Y. Azuma N. Onouchi H. Kunimatsu M. Tomita Y. Sasaki M. Sugimoto K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and full-length constructs of human CENP-B (24Sugimoto K. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), human CENP-C (25Sugimoto K. Yata H. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), human HP1HSα (22Sugimoto K. Yamada T. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), mouse TRF1 (26Smith S. de Lange T. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), mouse TRF2 (27van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), and human p53 (28Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar), into the in vitro methyltransferase assays. Among these substrates, only the GST-fused histone H3 amino-terminal (residues 1–57) molecule (H3N, see Fig. 4A) was actively methylated by GST-mG9a, whereas methylation of the other GST fusion molecules was almost undetectable (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In addition, H3N was a more efficient substrate of G9a than was the native purified histone H3, presumably due to the pre-existence of methyl groups on the targeted residue(s) of native H3. Because methylation of H3 occurs dominantly at lysines 4, 9, and 27 in HeLa cells (12Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and Suv39 h1 and h2 proteins were shown to methylate only lysine 9 of H3 (18O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Haynes A.R. Laible G. Rea S. Schmid M. Lebersorger A. Jerratsch M. Sattler L. Mattei M.G. Denny P. Brown S.D. Schweizer D. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9423-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the enzymes involved in the reactions at lysines 4 and 27 in H3 remained to be identified. We next examined the residues of H3 targeted by G9a, focusing on these lysines. Because recombinant H3N was found to be a more suitable substrate than the native histone H3, we introduced several lysine-to-arginine replacements into H3N, as summarized in Fig. 4A. When we used NT as a substrate in which all three lysine residues were replaced with arginine, no methyl groups were introduced by GST-mG9a (Figs. 4B and 6A), suggesting that the G9a target site(s) in H3 is also lysine. When single residue-replaced mutants 4R, 9R, and 27R were used for the assay, Suv39 h1 only methylated mutants in which lysine 4 or 27 was replaced with arginine (4R or 27R) but not 9R (lysine 9 to arginine replacement), consistent with previous results (4Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7480-7484Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, all the single lysine-replaced mutants including 9R were clearly methylated by GST-mG9a, although the methylation efficiency of 9R was only 20% of N3H (Fig. 6A). This result suggested that G9a could methylate two or more lysine sites. Further methylation assays using double lysine to arginine-replaced H3N mutants demonstrated this clearly. Not only N9 (lysines 4 and 27 were changed to arginine), but also N27 (lysines 4 and 9 were changed to arginine) was substantially methylated by GST-mG9a (Figs. 4B and5A). Methylation efficiencies of N9 and N27 by GST-mG9a were about 50 and 20% of H3N, respectively. In contrast, N4 (lysines 9 and 27 were replaced with arginine) was no longer targeted by GST-mG9a. GST-Suv39 h1 again showed its target specificity for lysine 9 and only methylated N9 among the double lysine-replaced mutants (Figs.4C and 6B). Therefore, we concluded that G9a is a lysine-preferring H3 HMTase and speculated that G9a may be the responsible methyltransferase of lysines 9 and 27 in histone H3in vivo. To address whether these enzymatic properties of G9a are intrinsic, transiently expressed EGFP-fused hG9a in 293 cells was again introduced into the above in vitro HMTase assays. As shown in Fig.4E, EGFP-hG9a expressed in mammalian cells clearly methylated both N9 and N27. Furthermore, relative methylation efficiencies among the substrates used were comparable between EGFP-hG9a produced in mammalian cells and GST-hG9a produced in E. coli. (values shown at the bottom of Figs. 4E and6A). Because the first position of the catalytic core motif in the mG9a SET domain (899R φφNHLC905) is arginine, which also exists in the core motif of the active HMTase CLR4 (406R φφNHSC412), we speculated that arginine 899 might be responsible for the strong HMTase activity of G9a. A previous observation that a single amino acid replacement of histidine 320 in the stringent HMTase Suv39 h1 (carrying 320H φφNHSC326) with arginine produced a hyperactive enzyme that possessed more than 20 times higher activity than the original (17Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar) supported this possibility. In addition to the higher enzymatic activity, we found that G9a could catalyze the methylation of lysines 9 and 27 in H3Nin vitro, whereas Suv39 h1 was limited to lysine 9. Therefore, we also investigated the possibility that the first amino acid residue of the catalytic core motif of G9a, called the “hyperactive position” (shown shaded in gray in Fig.1B, bottom panel), might also contribute to the target specificity of G9a, especially with regard to lysine 27 of H3. To address these issues, we constructed two recombinant enzymes, in which the amino acid at the hyperactive position was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis. G9aR899H protein was produced by amino acid substitution of arginine 899 in mG9a with histidine, and SuvH320R was produced by replacement of histidine 320 in Suv39 h1 with arginine."

In this study we have investigated whether these properties are dependent on similar or different structural determinants of the molecule. To this purpose, resveratrol derivatives, in which all or each single hydroxylic function were selectively substituted with methyl groups, were synthesized. Analogues with the stilbenic double bond reduced or with the stereoisomery modified were also investigated. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of citronellal thermo-oxidation, or the reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. In addition, the protection against lipid peroxidation was determined in rat liver microsomes, and in human primary cell cultures. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated by a clonogenic assay, and by analysis of cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis. The results showed that the hydroxyl group in 4′ position is not the sole determinant for antioxidant activity. In contrast, the presence of 4′-OH together with stereoisomery in the trans-conformation (4′-hydroxystyryl moiety) was absolutely required for inhibition of cell proliferation.

In the case of resveratrol, such a mechanism is still controversial (26Della Ragione F. Cucciola V. Borriello A. Della Pietra V. Racioppi L. Soldati G. Manna C. Galletti P. Zappia V. Biochem.

The effects on cell cycle progression may be also explained by the direct inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (37Fontecave M. Lepoivre M. Elleingand E. Gerez C. Guittet O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 412: 277-279Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and DNA polymerase (38Sun N.J. Woo S.H. Cassady J.M. Snapka R.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1998; 61: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The structural determinants of these diverse properties of the resveratrol molecule are obscure, but the number and position of the hydroxylic groups have been suggested to play an important role in the antioxidant activity (14Fauconneau B.

The aim of this study was to extend these studies on the structural determinants of the activity of resveratrol, and in particular to establish whether the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities are dependent on (i) the stereoisomery, (ii) the position of the different phenolic hydroxyl groups, and (iii) the stilbenic double bond of the molecule. For this purpose, thecis form (II) was obtained by UV irradiation oftrans-resveratrol; three different derivatives were synthesized in which the hydroxylic functions were selectively protected by methyl groups: 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene (III), 3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxystilbene (IV), and 3,4′,5-trimethoxystilbene (V). Finally, the α,β-dihydro-3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene (VI) was obtained by reduction of the stilbenic double bond. The biological properties of trans-resveratrol were compared with those of the above derivatives. In particular, the antioxidant activity was investigated in vitro by measuring the inhibition of citronellal thermo-oxidation or the radical scavenging ability using the free radical DPPH.1 The protection against lipid peroxidation induced by Fe/ascorbate andtert-butylhydroperoxide TBHP was also assessed in rat liver microsomes, or in cultured human fibroblasts, respectively. The effects on cell proliferation were studied by analyzing the cell clonogenic efficiency and cell cycle progression. In addition, the recruitment of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) to the DNA replication sites were investigated. These proteins are required for the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication, respectively. Finally, the ability of resveratrol and its derivatives to inhibit replicative DNA polymerases was also assessed with in vitro assays. The results have shown that the hydroxyl group at the 4′ position is not the sole determinant for the antioxidant activity. Similarly, the 4′-hydroxyl group is necessary for the antiproliferative activity and the DNA polymerase inhibition, but the trans conformation is absolutely required for these effects. trans-Resveratrol (99% purity) and DPPH were obtained from Sigma; aphidicolin was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibodies anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd clone BU20) and anti-PCNA (clone PC10) were obtained from Dako, while the anti-RPA (32 kDa subunit) 9H8 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by M.

Poly(dA)/oligo(dT)12–18 primer-template was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, poly(dA) template oligonucleotide was mixed with the complementary oligo(dT)12–18 oligonucleotide in a 10:1 molar ratio (w/w, nucleotides) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 20 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA, heated at 90 °C for 5 min then incubated at 65 °C for 2 h and slowly cooled at room temperature.

Pol α was 250 units/ml (0.2 mg/ml). 1 unit of polymerase activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of total dTMP into acid-precipitable material in 60 min at 37 °C in a standard assay containing 0.5 μg (nucleotides) of poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 and 20 μm dTTP.

The cis form (II) was obtained by photoisomerization. The trans-isomer (95 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of acetonitrile, flushed with nitrogen for 20 min, capped, and irradiated by means of 4 external 15 W phosphor-coated lamps until the photostationary state (about 1 to 1) was reached (40 min). Repeated separation by column chromatography eluting with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) gave a sample (20% yield) of 98% pure (HPLC)cis derivative. 1H NMR (CD3CN, 300 MHz): δ 6.15 (dd, 1H, J4,2 =J4,6 = 2.0 Hz, H-4); 6.25 (d, 2H,J2,4 = J6,4 = 2.0 Hz, H-2 and H-6); 6.38 and 6.50 (AB system, 2H, J = 12.0 Hz, CH=CH); 6.62 (d, 2H, J3′,2′ =J5′,6′ = 8.5 Hz, H-3′ and H-5′); 6.75 (bs, 2H, 2xOH); 6.90 (bs, 1H, OH); 7.13 (d, 2H, J2′,3′ =J6′,5′ = 8.5 Hz, H-2′ and H-6′). trans-3,5-Dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene (4′-O-methylresveratrol) (compound III) was obtained as previously described (44Orsini F. Pelizzoni F. Bellini B. Miglierini G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 301: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) by Wittig reaction between the phosphonium salt of the commercially available 4-methoxybenzyl chloride and 3,5-bis-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)benzaldehyde. Butyllithium (2.3 ml, 1.6 m in hexane, 3.6 mmol) was added dropwise to a suspension of (4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (3.6 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) at −15 °C. The resulting reddish solution was allowed to warm at room temperature and stirred for 30 min. 3,5-Bis-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)benzaldehyde (3.6 mmol) was then added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h, diluted with ice-cold water (2 × 25 ml), and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 ml). The organic extracts were washed with water and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to obtain a mixture of trans- andcis-3,5-di-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-4′-methoxystilbene, which were desilylated in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature with tetrabutylammonium fluoride. After addition of ethyl ether the solution was washed with water and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was filtered over silica gel to obtain 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene as a 2:1 mixture of the (trans/cis)-isomers in 75% yield. After crystallization from CHCl3/pentane, the pure trans-isomer (III) was obtained (33% yield). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 200 MHz): δ 3.78 (s, 3H, OCH3); 6.14 (dd, 1H, J4,2 =J4, 6 = 2.05 Hz, H-4); 6.42 (d, 2H,J2,4 = J6,4 = 2.05 Hz, H-2 and H-6); 6.90 and 7.00 (AB system, 2H, J = 16.28 Hz, CH=CH); 6.94 (d, 2H, J3′,2′ =J5′,6′ = 8.77 Hz, H-3′ and H-5′); 7.53 (d, 2H,J2′,3′ = J6′, 5′ = 8.77 Hz, H-2′ and H-6′); 9.23 (s, 2H, 2 × OH). trans-3,5-Dimethoxy-4′-hydroxystilbene (IV) was obtained by Perkin condensation between 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3,5-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (Aldrich), as reported by Pezet and Pont (45Pezet R. Pont V. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 26: 603-607Google Scholar). An alternative synthetic procedure was attempted, consisting in the Wittig reaction between the phosphonium salt of 3,5-dimethoxybenzylbromide (synthesized from the commercially available 3, 5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol) and 4-acetoxybenzaldehyde on 3.6 mmol scale, as reported for the compound III. In this case, a 1:1 mixture of the trans/cis-isomers was obtained in 48% yield. The 4′-hydroxyl function was deprotected by treatment with K2CO3 in methanol at room temperature. After addition of ethyl acetate, the solution was washed with water and the solvent removed under reduced pressure: the residue was then chromatographed over silica gel using petroleum ether/diethyl ether gradient, giving trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxystilbene in 20% yield. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 200 MHz): δ 3.78 (s, 6H, 2 × OCH3); 6.38 (dd, 1H,J4,2 = J4,6 = 2.22 Hz, H-4); 6.73 (d, 2H, J2,4 =J6,4 = 2.22 Hz, H-2 and H-6); 6.78 (d, 2H,J3′,2′ = J5′,6′ = 8.61 Hz, H-3′ and H-5′); 6.94 and 7.17 (AB system, 2H, J = 16.42 Hz, CH=CH); 7.43 (d, 2H, J2′,3′ =J6′,5′ = 8.61 Hz, H-2′ and H-6′); 9.56 (s, 1H, OH). 3,4′,5-trans-Trimethoxystilbene (derivative V) was synthesized by direct methylation, refluxing a mixture oftrans-resveratrol (0.44 mmol) and CH3I (9.24 mmol) in acetone (15 ml) in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate (6.6 mmol). After addition of ethyl ether, the solution was washed with water and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure: the residue was then chromatographed over silica gel using petroleum ether/diethyl ether gradient, givingtrans-3,4′,5-trimethoxystilbene in quantitative yield.1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz): δ 3.87 (s, 9H, 3 × OCH3); 6.42 (dd, 1H, J4,2= J4,6 = 2.26 Hz, H-4); 6.69 (d, 2H,J2,4 = J6,4 = 2.26 Hz, H-2 and H-6); 6.93 and 7.08 (AB system, 2H, J = 16.26 Hz, CH=CH); 6.934 (d, 2H, J3′,2′ =J5′,6′ = 8.71 Hz, H-3′ and H-5′); 7.48 (d, 2H,J2′,3′ = J6′,5′ = 8.71 Hz, H-2′ and H-6′). α,β-Dihydro-3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene (α,β-dihydroresveratrol) (derivative VI) was obtained by catalytic hydrogenation oftrans-resveratrol (0.15 mmol) with 10% Pd/C catalyst in methanol (5 ml) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was filtered off through Celite and washed with methanol; the solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the residue chromatographed over silica gel (7:3, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain α,β-dihydro-3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene (87% yield). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 200 MHz): δ 2.55–2.77 (m, 4H, CH2CH2); 6.03 (dd, 1H,J4,2 = J4,6 = 2.11 Hz, H-4); 6.07(d, 2H, J2,4 =J6,4 = 2.11 Hz, H-2 and H-6); 6.66 (d, 2H,J3′,2′ = J5′, 6′ = 8.52 Hz, H-3′ and H-5′); 7.00 (d, 2H, J2′,3′ =J6′,5′ = 8.52 Hz, H-2′ and H-6′); 8.99 (s, 2H, 2 × OH); 9.08 (s, 1H, OH). The products synthesized were further purified by crystallization to reach a final purity > 98%, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Stock solutions of each substance were prepared inN,N-dimethylformamide and final dilution was performed in chlorobenzene for the in vitro oxidation test. For cell culture experiments, stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO and diluted directly in cell culture medium. Normal human embryonic fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (Istituto Zooprofilattico, Brescia, Italy) were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Normal fibroblasts were used between the 5th and 20th passages. Cell treatments were performed by adding trans-resveratrol or its derivatives in culture medium at final concentrations ranging from 7 to 100 μm. For resveratrol, these concentrations are comparable with doses found in red wine and grapes (39Fremont L. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Untreated cultures received the same amount of the solvent alone (Me2SO < 0.1%). Aphidicolin (60 nm) was used as positive control for cell cycle arrest in S phase. For the antioxidant activity determination, normal fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min with 60 μm trans-resveratrol or its derivatives, before the oxidative treatment. For cell cycle analysis, normal fibroblasts and HT1080 cells were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h withtrans-resveratrol at the concentration of 15, 30, and 90 μm, then cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and detached with a standard trypsinization procedure. The antioxidant activity of trans-resveratrol and its derivatives was evaluated in vitro both by the citronellal thermo-oxidation inhibition test (46Bocco A. Cuvelier M.E. Richard H. Berset C. Sciences Des Aliments. 1999; 18: 13-23Google Scholar), and the DPPH method (47Kurechi T. Kikugawa K. Kato T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1980; 28: 2089-2093Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Brand-Williams W. Cuvelier M.E. Berset C. Lebensm. Wiss. & Technol. 1995; 28: 25-30Crossref Scopus (16337) Google Scholar). In addition, antioxidant activity was assessed in rat liver microsomes by measuring lipid peroxidation inhibition after Fe2+/ascorbate treatment, and in human fibroblast cultures after TBHP treatment. In this test, the aldehyde (−)-citronellal is used as the oxidation substrate: it is subjected to heating and intensive oxygenation in chlorobenzene, and its disappearance with the consequent formation of its degradation products are monitored by gas chromatography. Chlorobenzene was selected as the reaction solvent because of (i) its stability to oxidation; (ii) the ability to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds, better than dimethylformamide; and (iii) the boiling point is higher then 80 °C (temperature test). Fifteen ml of a chlorobenzene solution, containing 150 μl of dodecane (Aldrich) and 150 μl of tridecane (Aldrich) as internal standards, were poured into a two-necked flask equipped with a condenser to prevent evaporation. Resveratrol, or its derivatives, dissolved in dimethylformamide, were added to the chlorobenzene solution to reach final concentrations ranging from 60 to 120 μm. The mixture was then heated at 80 °C and intensively oxygenated by bubbling in O2 at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. At time 0, 300 μl of (−)-citronellal (Fluka) were added to the reaction medium. Immediately and at periodic intervals, 0.1-μl samples were withdrawn and analyzed by gas chromatography. The antioxidant power of resveratrol and the derivatives was measured by determining the efficient quantity (EQ), i.e. the concentration required for each compound to double the half-life with respect to control reaction (citronellal without antioxidant). Antioxidant solution in methanol (0.1 ml) was added to 3.9 ml of a 6 × 10−5m DPPH solution in methanol (48Brand-Williams W. Cuvelier M.E. Berset C. Lebensm. Wiss. & Technol. 1995; 28: 25-30Crossref Scopus (16337) Google Scholar). The exact initial DPPH concentration in the reaction medium was calculated from a calibration curve. The decrease in absorbance was determined at 515 nm at 0 min, every 5 min for 1 h, and every 60 min until the reaction reached a plateau (about 6 h). Antiradical activity was expressed as the EC50, i.e. the antioxidant concentration necessary to decrease the initial amount of DPPH by 50%. Rat liver microsomes were prepared from Wistar rats by tissue homogenization with 5 volumes of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5). Briefly, microsomal fractions were isolated by removal of the nuclear fraction at 8,000 × g for 10 min, removal of mitochondrial fraction at 18,000 × g for 10 min, and sedimentation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. Microsomal fractions were diluted in phosphate buffer, 0.1 m (pH 7.5), at the final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The microsomes were preincubated in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 10 min with varying concentrations (0.01–100 μm) of each compound before starting lipid peroxidation with 100 μmFe2+, 500 μm ascorbate. After 60 min incubation, the inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) by the method of Yagi et al. (49Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of microsomal fraction were added to 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid to stop the lipid peroxidation reaction, and then 500 μl of 0.74% thiobarbituric acid was added. The mixture was then heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After centrifugation, 200 μl of supernatant was transferred to the microtiter plate, the absorbance was measured at 535 nm and compared with standards prepared from the acid hydrolysis of malonaldehyde tetraethylacetyl (Sigma). Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was expressed as percentage, and the effective concentration giving 50% inhibition (EC50) was calculated from the inhibition curve. Lipid peroxidation was induced in cultured normal human fibroblasts by TBHP (Sigma). Cells were preincubated for 30 min with 60 μm trans-resveratrol or its analogues in PBS, and then 250 μm TBHP was added for 60 min. The production of TBARS was assessed, as above described. In both experimental models, microsomes and cells, TBHP-treated and untreated control samples received the same amount of the solvent (Me2SO < 0.02%). The clonogenic efficiency was determined after incubation of cells in culture medium containing trans-resveratrol or its derivatives. Briefly, the cells were diluted in complete Earle's minimal essential medium to ∼4000 cells/ml, and volumes of this suspension containing 200 cells were transferred to 30-mm dishes. After 24 h of treatment with trans-resveratrol and the different derivatives, the cells were washed twice and 5 ml of fresh medium was added. After 10 days, the colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted, and the clonogenic efficiency was calculated as the mean percentage with respect to control cells. Clonogenic efficiency of untreated control cultures was about 35%. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by determining BrdUrd incorporation versus DNA content. Normal fibroblasts and HT1080 cells were incubated with 30 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) during the last hour of culture, harvested, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 2 nHCl for 30 min at room temperature, pelletted, and then resuspended in 0.1 n sodium tetraborate for 15 min. The samples were then washed in PBS, incubated for 15 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20 (PBT)"

The recombinant protein was able to cleave a variety of carotenoids at the 9–10 and 9′-10′ positions. In most instances, the enzyme cleaves the substrate symmetrically to produce a C14 dialdehyde and two C13 products, which vary depending on the carotenoid substrate. Based upon sequence similarity, orthologs of this gene are present throughout the plant kingdom. A similar protein in beans catalyzes the same reaction in vitro. The characterization of these activities offers the potential to synthesize a variety of interesting, natural products and is the first step in determining the function of this gene family in plants.

Eklund A. Britton G. Liaaen-Jensen S. Pfander H. Carotenoids. 3. Birkhäuser Verlag, Boston1998: 195-216Google Scholar). This is a structurally diverse class of compounds that are widely distributed in nature. The assortment of apocarotenoids results from the large number of carotenoid precursors (more than 600 carotenoids have been identified), variations in the site of cleavage, and modifications subsequent to cleavage. Abscisic acid (ABA)1, which is derived from the oxidative cleavage of a 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid, is necessary for seed development and adaptation to environmental stresses in plants (2Zeevaart J.A.D. Creelman R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 439-473Crossref Google Scholar). Although historically referred to as retinoids, vitamin A and related compounds are derived from the cleavage of β-carotene (3Olson J. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Plants produce a number of volatile apocarotenoids. These compounds probably serve a function as insect attractants and are valued as flavor/aroma compounds. Apocarotenoid pigments also have some economic value. For example, bixin (annatto) is commonly used as a natural food coloring, and crocin is the major pigment in saffron (4Winterhalter P. Straubinger M. Food Rev. Int. 2000; 16: 39-59Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The formation of apocarotenoids may result from nonspecific mechanisms, such as lipoxygenase cooxidation or photooxidation. Enzymes capable of cleaving carotenoids at specific sites are believed to be involved in the synthesis of a number of apocarotenoids. The Vp14 gene, which encodes an ABA biosynthetic enzyme in maize (5Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 6Tan B.C. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), was the first carotenoid cleavage enzyme to be cloned from any organism. Since the characterization of VP14, ABA biosynthetic enzymes have been identified in several plants (7Qin X. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15354-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 8Burbidge A. Grieve T.M. Jackson A. Thompson A. McCarty D.R. Taylor I.B.

Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based upon sequence similarity, an enzyme necessary for vitamin A biosynthesis has been identified inDrosophila (11von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and vertebrates (12Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T., Yu, S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Another carotenoid cleavage enzyme in animals that reacts with the 9–10 double bond has also been identified (13Kiefer C. Hessel S. Lampert J.M. Vogt K. Lederer M.O. Breithaupt D.E. von Lintig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14110-14116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The definitive demonstration of both symmetric and asymmetric cleavage pathways appears to resolve a long standing debate concerning vitamin A biosynthesis (14Olson J.A. Krinsky N.I. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A number of hypothetical proteins that are similar to these carotenoid cleavage enzymes have also been identified in the sequence data bases, but their biochemical functions have not yet been demonstrated. In theArabidopsis genome sequence, nine potential carotenoid cleavage enzymes have been identified. Most of these genes have been annotated as neoxanthin cleavage enzymes ornine-cis-epoxy-carotenoiddioxygenases (NCEDs). Both terms imply an involvement in ABA biosynthesis. Although it is likely that two or more genes encode nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases, it is doubtful that all nine genes are involved in ABA biosynthesis. Some of these proteins may catalyze carotenoid cleavage reactions not involved in ABA biosynthesis. Others might catalyze a double bond cleavage reaction of substrates other than carotenoids, such as the lignostilbene dioxygenases from prokaryotes (15Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this paper, a putative carotenoid cleavage enzyme from Arabidopsis was expressed inEscherichia coli. It is shown that recombinant protein catalyzes a carotenoid cleavage reaction different from the one in ABA biosynthesis. The gene symbol CCD, CarotenoidCleavage Dioxygenase, was adopted in this paper to distinguish this gene family from genes that encode ABA biosynthetic enzymes. A truncated cDNA for theAtCCD1 gene was obtained from the Arabidopsisexpressed sequence tag collection (N95924). The full-length cDNA sequence (19Neill S.J. Burnett E.C. Desikan R. Hancock J.T. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1893-1894Google Scholar) (AJ005813) and the genomic sequence (AL163818; gene identification MAA211̶50) have also become available. A full-length clone was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using RNA from light-grown seedlings. The polymerase chain reaction product was amplified withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primer sequences: 5′-CATGGCGGAGAAACTCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TTATATAAGAGTTTGTTCCTGG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript SK (Stratagene) and pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce pCZY1 and pCZY2, respectively. A fragment of the PvCCD1 gene in beans, previously called PvNCED2, was amplified with degenerate primers as previously described (7Qin X. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15354-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The flanking sequences were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from a bean cDNA library with one primer annealing to the initial polymerase chain reaction product and either a T7 or T3 primer annealing to the vector. Once the 5′ and 3′ sequences were determined, a full-length clone (AY029525) was amplified from the bean library with the following primer sequences: 5′ TGGATCCATGGGGGATGATGG 3′and 5′-TGGATCCTCACAGTTTTGCTTG-3′. TheBamHI restriction sites added on to the primer were used to clone into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create pXQ1. A 5-ml culture of pCZY2 or pXQ1 was used to inoculate a 100-ml culture in 2× YT medium (per liter: 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl). Cultures were grown at 37 °C until anA 600 of 0.7 was reached. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown at 28 °C for an additional 3–5 h. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Tris-buffered saline, and lysed in a French press. The recombinant protein was purified with glutathione S-transferase-agarose (Sigma) and then released by cleavage with thrombin for 7 h at 4 °C. The carotenoid substrates were extracted and purified as previously described (17Rock C. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7496-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Assays contained 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm FeSO4, 5 mm ascorbate, and the appropriate carotenoid substrate in 100 mm Bis Tris, pH 7.0. The assay products were partitioned into ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC or thin-layer chromatography as previously described (5Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The mass spectra for C27 compounds were obtained by direct inlet as previously described (5Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). For gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the C13 compounds, a DB5-MS column (30 m, 0.32 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film, J & W Scientific) was used. The temperature program was 100 °C for 1 min, 100–230 °C at 40 °C/min, 230–280 °C at 8 °C/min, and 280–300 °C at 20 °C/min. Plasmids containing the carotenoid biosynthetic genes from Erwinia herbicola (18Sun Z.R. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24349-24352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were cotransformed into E. coli strain JM109 with the pCZY1 or pCZY2 constructs described above. An overnight culture of 2 ml was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and 0.1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h. The E. coli culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of formaldehyde. An equal volume of methanol was then added, followed by two volumes of ethyl acetate. The phases were separated by the addition of water, and the ethyl acetate phase was retained for HPLC analysis. Following centrifugation, the medium from the cultures was partitioned twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was evaporated under vacuum, and the extracts were saponified prior to HPLC analysis. The HPLC fractions were dried, resuspended in the appropriate solvent, and used for UV-visible or fluorescence spectroscopy. A rosafluene standard was prepared by the reduction of the C14 dialdehyde with NaBH4. The AtCCD1gene, originally called AtNCED1 (19Neill S.J. Burnett E.C. Desikan R. Hancock J.T. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1893-1894Google Scholar) inArabidopsis, encodes a protein with limited sequence similarity to the carotenoid cleavage enzymes in ABA biosynthesis (31% identical and 42% similar to VP14). Although it was suggested that the gene is involved in ABA biosynthesis (19Neill S.J. Burnett E.C. Desikan R. Hancock J.T. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1893-1894Google Scholar), the biochemical function of the protein has not yet been reported. Hypothetical proteins that share much higher similarity to known ABA biosynthetic enzymes have since been identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence. A comparison of the AtCCD1 protein with hypothetical proteins from other plant species indicates that it is a member of a highly conserved subfamily of carotenoid cleavage-related proteins (Fig.1). The AtCCD1 protein is 67% identical and 74% similar to a protein from avocados, PaNCED2 (9Chernys J.T. Zeevaart J.A.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A protein from beans, PvCCD1 (this paper), is 78% identical and 86% similar to AtCCD1. In addition, the expressed sequence tags from a variety of plants share a high degree of similarity to AtCCD1 at the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid level. Based upon limited sequence data, genes with greater than 80% nucleotide identity are present in the expressed sequence tags of numerous plant species. A hypothetical protein from Anabaena PCC 7120, AnaCCD1, also shares some sequence similarity with AtCCD1 (38% identity and 48% similarity). To determine the potential function of AtCCD1, the gene was cloned into a glutathione S-transferase fusion vector for expression in E. coli, and the recombinant protein was assayed for cleavage activity with a variety of carotenoid substrates. The assay products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and sprayed with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to visualize aldehyde and ketone products (Fig. 2). To generate the reaction scheme (Fig. 3), the assay products were also characterized by a combination of HPLC, UV-visible spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. A variety of C13 products, resulting from cleavage at the 9–10 and the 9′-10′ positions, were identified (e.g. II,V, and VI). In assays containing lutein, zeaxanthin, and all-trans-violaxanthin (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively), the products did not separate from the carotenoid substrates by TLC. It was, however, possible to isolate these products by HPLC for further characterization. The red spot (I) in Fig. 2, lanes 1–6 was the C14 dialdehyde resulting from symmetrical cleavage at the 9–10 and 9′-10′ positions (Fig. 3). This C14 dialdehyde was a major product when β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, or all-trans-violaxanthin was used as a substrate. The enzyme did not cleave as well adjacent to a 9-cis double bond or an allenic bond found in some carotenoids. In assays containing the 9-cis isomer of violaxanthin (Fig. 2, lane 5), the major product was the C27 epoxy-apocarotenal (III) that results from a single cleavage distal to the cis double bond. When 9′-cis-neoxanthin was used as a substrate (Fig. 2,lane 6), both a C27 epoxy-apocarotenal (III) and a C27 allenic-apocarotenal (IV) were produced.Figure 3Scheme for the reactions catalyzed by the recombinant AtCCD1 protein. The roman numeralscorrespond to compounds labeled in Fig. 2. I, 4,9-dimethyldodeca-2,4,6,8,10-pentaene-1,12-dial (C14 dialdehyde). The absorption spectrum was identical with published data (20Märki-Fischer E. Eugster C.H. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1988; 71: 1491-1497Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

In these studies, β-carotene did not accumulate, and the bacteria failed to develop color. In the first study, four different products were identified, but less than one-third of the lost β-carotene could be accounted for in E. colicells (11von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the second study only the presence of all-trans retinal was reported (12Redmond T.M. Gentleman S.

Expression ofAtCCD1 in carotenoid-accumulating strains of E. coli also resulted in colorless colonies (Fig.4). Analysis of the apocarotenoids produced by these strains is consistent with the reaction scheme for the in vitro assays. A very low level of the C14dialdehyde was present in the E. coli cells (data not shown), but additional apocarotenoid products were detected in the medium (Fig. 5A). Analysis of these compounds by UV-visible (Fig. 5B) and fluorescence spectroscopy indicates that peak 1 on the chromatogram is rosafluene, a natural product of roses, which would be produced by the reduction of the C14 dialdehyde to the corresponding dialcohol (20Märki-Fischer E. Eugster C.H. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1988; 71: 1491-1497Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reduction of the C14 dialdehyde with NaBH4 did produce a compound with the same retention time and absorption spectrum (data not shown). Peak 2, which has a spectrum shifted to a slightly lower wavelength, is probably a cis isomer.Figure 5HPLC analysis of the culture medium from anE. coli strain coexpressing carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes for zeaxanthin and AtCCD1.A, absorption was measured at 360 nm, and the most abundant peaks are labeled in order of elution from the column.

Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15354-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The PvCCD1 protein was also expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4) and shown to catalyze the symmetric cleavage of zeaxanthin to form the C14dialdehyde. The recombinant AtCCD1 protein cleaves a variety of carotenoids at the 9–10 and 9′-10′ double bonds. With most substrates tested, the carotenoid is symmetrically cleaved to produce a C14dialdehyde. The prevalence of the C14 product (symmetric cleavage) relative to the C27 product (single cleavage) may indicate that the enzyme functions as a dimer, simultaneously cleaving at both ends. The lignostilbene dioxygenases from prokaryotes, which share sequence similarity to the carotenoid cleavage enzymes, are known to function as dimers (16Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of 9-cis-violaxanthin and 9′-cis-neoxanthin, the C27 apocarotenals are major products. Cleavage adjacent to a cis double bond or the allenic bond of neoxanthin appears to be impaired. The structural variations in carotenoids exist mainly in the rings. Because AtCCD1 is able to cleave a variety of carotenoids, a number of interesting C13 ring products are generated in the in vitro assays. The grasshopper ketone (V), derived from the cleavage of neoxanthin, is regurgitated by some species of grasshoppers (21Eisner T. Meinwald J. Science. 1966; 153: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Meinwald J. Erickson K. Hartshorn M. Meinwald Y.C. Eisner T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1968; 25: 2959-2962Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The unpalatable taste of this compound may deter ants and other predators. Other C13compounds are valued as flavor and aroma constituents of a variety of foods (23Winterhalter P. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1992; 490: 98-115Google Scholar). Some C13 cleavage products are effective insect lures (24Donaldson J.M.I. McGovern T.P. Ladd T.L. J. Econ. Entomol. 1990; 83: 1298-1305Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Williams R.N. Fickle D.S. McGovern T.P. Klein M.G. J. Econ. Entomol. 2000; 93: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may serve as insect attractants when produced by plants. Probable orthologs of the AtCCD1 gene are present in a wide range of plants. An ortholog in beans is able to catalyze the same reaction. The substrate of these enzymes in planta and the function of the apocarotenoid products are not yet known. However, a number of apocarotenoids have been identified in plants that are derived by an AtCCD1-like activity. The C14 dialdehyde is the probable precursor of rosafluene, a highly fluorescent compound found in some varieties of roses (26Eugster C.H. Märki-Fischer E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 654-672Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The C14 product is also the expected precursor of mycorradicin, a yellow pigment that accumulates in the roots of plants inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (27Walter M.H. Fester T. Strack D. Plant J. 2000; 21: 571-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several C13 cleavage products are also abundant in the roots of infected plants. AlthoughArabidopsis does not appear to form mycorrhizal associations, an AtCCD1-like protein probably catalyzes the synthesis of these apocarotenoids in other plant species. A C13 product of zeaxanthin or lutein cleavage, 3-hydroxy-β-ionone, accumulates in etiolated bean seedlings on exposure to light, and it has been suggested that this compound may have a function in the light-induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation (28Kato-Noguchi H. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 86: 583-586Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Kato-Noguchi H. Kosemura S. Yamamura S. Hasegawa K. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 553-555Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The AtCCD1 gene is also induced by light in etiolated seedlings. 2S. H. Schwartz and J. A. D. Zeevaart, unpublished data. With the characterization of the AtCCD1 activity in vitro, it is now possible to speculate on the possible function of this gene in plants. By altering the expression of this gene in transgenic plants, it should be possible to characterize the apocarotenoid products and determine their biological role(s)."

W., Xuereb, J., Taaman, J. W., Cooper, J. M., and Schapira, A. H. (1999)Ann. Neurol. 45, 25–32). However, how polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin promotes glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity remains a mystery. In this study we provide evidence that (i) normal huntingtin is associated withN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors via postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), (ii) the SH3 domain of PSD-95 mediates its binding to huntingtin, and (iii) polyglutamine expansion interferes with the ability of huntingtin to interact with PSD-95. The expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin causes sensitization of NMDA receptors and promotes neuronal apoptosis induced by glutamate. The addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist significantly attenuates neuronal toxicity induced by glutamate and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. The overexpression of normal huntingtin significantly inhibits neuronal toxicity mediated by NMDA or kainate receptors. Our results demonstrate that polyglutamine expansion impairs the ability of huntingtin to bind PSD-95 and inhibits glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. These changes may be essential for the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.

Gusella J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The HD gene encodes a 350-kDa protein designated as huntingtin (3The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, Cell, 72, 1993, 971, 983.Google Scholar), which is richly expressed in dendrites and nerve terminals, where huntingtin is associated with synaptic vesicles and microtubule complexes (4Trottier Y.

The defect of the HD gene is the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding polyglutamine at its 5′ end, and the length of the repeat is correlated with the age of onset and the severity of the disease (6Stine O.C. Pleasant N. Franz M.L. Abbott M.H. Folstein S.E. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1547-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although the HD gene has been identified for many years, how polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin causes neurons to die remains unclear. Increased glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in HD has been a very popular hypothesis for the last 25 years (1Tabrizi S.J. Cleeter M.W. Xuereb J. Taaman J.W. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is generated from findings that the intrastriatal injection of glutamate or kainic acid in rat causes selective loss of medium spiny neurons that are also selectively affected in HD (7Coyle J.T. Schwarcz R. Nature. 1976; 16: 244-246Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 8Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported further by the findings that NMDA receptors are hyperactive, and excitotoxicity mediated by these receptors is enhanced significantly in HD transgenic mice (9Hodgson J.G. Agopyan N. Gutekunst C.-A. Leavitt B.R. LaPiane F. Singaraja N. Smith D.J. Bissada N. McCutcheon K. Nasir J. Jamot L. Li X.-J. Roder J.C. Phillips A.G. Rubin E.M. Hersch S.M. Hayden M.R.

These results suggest that overactivation of glutamate receptors may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of HD. However, over 95% of normal or polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin is located in the cytoplasm (6Stine O.C. Pleasant N. Franz M.L. Abbott M.H. Folstein S.E. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1547-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Coyle J.T. Schwarcz R. Nature. 1976; 16: 244-246Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), whereas glutamate receptors are cell surface receptors. How a cytoplasmic protein alters glutamate receptors on the cell surface membrane is an intriguing question. PSD-95 is a scaffold protein that contains an SH3 domain, a GK domain, and three PDZ domains that bind to the NMDA receptor NR2 subunits and kainate receptor GluR6 subunit (11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The binding of PSD-95 to NMDA or kainate receptors causes the clustering of the receptors in the postsynaptic membrane and regulates NMDA-dependent long term potentiation and long term depression (12Garcia E.P.

PSD-95 also binds to cytoplasmic signaling proteins and links the receptors to cellular signaling cascades (13Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F.

In transgenic mice lacking PSD-95, the frequency function of NMDA-dependent long term potentiation and long term depression is shifted, and spatial learning is impaired severely (15Migaud M.

These studies suggest that PSD-95 regulates glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and plays an important role in spatial learning, which is severely impaired in HD patients and HD transgenic mice (17Harper P.S. 2nd Ed.

Transfection was performed in serum- and Mg2+-free medium using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Between 10 and 50 μg of plasmids with 10–20 μl of Lipofectin/10-cm plate were used in transfection experiments. 48–72 h after transfection, 293T cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted as described previously (23Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human cortex tissues were obtained from Dr. J.-P. Vonsattel or the Human Brain Bank at McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) with institutional review board approval. Post-mortem time was between 16 and 24 h. The diagnosis of HD was confirmed with neuropathological and genetic phenotype analysis. Human cortex tissues from normal subjects or HD patients were homogenized in detergent-free lysis buffer, and SDS was added to the final concentration of 2%. The mixture was diluted 1:5 with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After removal of the insoluble fractions by centrifugation, brain lysates were co-immunoprecipitated with 437, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the first 17 amino acids of huntingtin that has been previously characterized (23Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or other antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. The construction of various PSD-95 and the N terminus GST fusion proteins of huntingtin has been described previously (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol.

GST fusion proteins were recovered by glutathione-Sepharose beads. About 1–2 μg of these GST fusion proteins were used for in vitro binding studies. 24 or 48 h after transfection, HN33 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and TUNEL staining was performed as described previously (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most apoptotic HN33 cells were detached from the slides, and TUNEL staining was performed on the remaining attached cells. TUNEL stain-negative cells (living cells) were counted in the ×20 power field in four different locations on the slides and ∼600–800 cells were counted in the control (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Initially, we studied the interaction of normal huntingtin with PSD-95 in 293T cells, which are rich in huntingtin (23Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Full-length PSD-95 expressing vector was transiently transfected in 293T cells. 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and co-immunoprecipitation was conducted using 437, an anti-huntingtin antibody (23Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody specific for PSD-95. The resulting blot was then probed with the anti-PSD-95 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PSD-95 was detected in both 437 or PSD-95 (positive control) immunoprecipitates of 293T cell lysates transfected with PSD-95 but not in 437 immunoprecipitates of wild-type or vector-transfected 293T cell lysates. We then explored the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 in human cortex tissues. Brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with 437 or negative control, protein A-Sepharose beads alone, 437 pre-immune serum, or 437 pre-absorbed with its peptide antigen. The blot was analyzed with an anti-PSD-95 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PSD-95 was only detected in 437 immunoprecipitates but not in any of the negative controls. Conversely, huntingtin was also present in PSD-95 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C). The data suggest that huntingtin is associated with PSD-95 in human cortex. PSD-95 is known to bind to the C terminus of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit and the kainate receptor GluR6 subunit (11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). If huntingtin is associated with PSD-95, it may also assemble complexes with NMDA and GluR6 receptors. Thus, we investigated whether huntingtin is associated with NMDA and kainate receptors. Human cortex lysates were incubated with anti-NR1, -NR2A, -NR2B, -GluR6, or -dopamine D4 receptor or with 437 or 437 pre-immune serum. The blot was probed with 437. As shown in Fig. 1 C, huntingtin was found in the anti-NR1, -NR2A, -NR2B, -GluR6, and 437 immunoprecipitates but not in the anti-D4 receptor and 437 pre-immune serum precipitates. The data suggest that huntingtin assembles complexes with NMDA and GluR6 receptors in human cortex. Because PSD-95 has a type II SH3 domain, we examined whether normal huntingtin can bind to the SH3 domain of PSD-95. GST alone or various PSD-95-GST fusion proteins were prepared; 1–2 μg of these PSD-95-GST fusion proteins were incubated with wild-type 293T cell lysates rich in normal huntingtin. As shown in Fig. 2, huntingtin only binds to the SH3 or SH3-GK domain, but it does not bind to GST alone, the GK domain, or any of the three PDZ domains of PSD-95. The data suggest that the SH3 domain of PSD-95 mediates its binding to huntingtin. We next determined whether expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin would alter its interaction with PSD-95. The N-terminal proline-rich region adjacent to the polyglutamine repeat has been reported to bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To determine whether expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin would alter its interaction with PSD-95, we examined the binding of PSD-95 to the huntingtin N terminus containing either a normal or expanded polyglutamine stretch. The huntingtin N terminus GST fusion proteins containing 16 or 56 polyglutamine repeats were generated and purified as described previously (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These GST fusion proteins were incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing full-length PSD-95. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PSD-95 binds to the huntingtin N terminus containing 16 polyglutamine repeats. Because the proline region is the only SH3 domain-binding site in this small N-terminal segment of huntingtin, these data suggest that the N-terminal proline region of huntingtin mediates its interaction with PSD-95. The amount of PSD-95 bound to the huntingtin N terminus with 56 polyglutamine repeats was significantly reduced, ∼70% less than that associated with normal huntingtin (Fig. 3 A). This finding suggests that polyglutamine expansion inhibits the ability of huntingtin to bind to the SH3 domain of PSD-95. Next, we explored the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 in the brains of HD patients. Lysates of human cortex tissues from two normal subjects and two HD patients with mid-age onset were prepared. These lysates were incubated with 437, and the resulting blots were analyzed with an anti-PSD-95 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, huntingtin was associated with PSD-95 in the cortex tissues of both normal subjects and HD patients. However, the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 in HD patients is significantly weaker than that in normal subjects. Although it might be expected that the heterozygous nature of the huntingtin in HD patients would result in a PSD-95 associated with huntingtin of 50% compared with normal subjects; the amount of PSD-95 associated with huntingtin in the HD patients is much less, ∼80% less than that in normal subjects (not 50% lower as one would expect, given the heterozygous nature of these HD patients). The brain lysates were precipitated with anti-PSD-95, and the blot was probed with 437. Normal huntingtin in the brains of HD patients remained to interact with PSD-95; however, the amount of huntingtin proteins associated with PSD-95 was below 50% (Fig. 3 C). We also found that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin is not present in the anti-PSD-95 immunoprecipitates in the brains of HD patients (Fig. 3 C). The data suggest that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin fails to bind to PSD-95 and that the normal huntingtin in the brains of these patients may be re-distributed. Similar results were obtained with three other normal subjects, and HD patients with different post-mortem times obtained similar results (data not shown). We conclude that the difference in the extent of the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 between normal subjects and HD patients is not because of the difference of post-mortem time but reflects a genuine change in the ability of huntingtin to bind to PSD-95 in HD patients. The physiological relevance of the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 was examined because PSD-95 is known to regulate NMDA receptor- or GluR6-operated channels by clustering these receptors at post-synaptic membranes (11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that normal huntingtin modulates these receptor-operated channels by binding and sequestering PSD-95 and thereby regulates the clustering of these receptors. Because the ability of huntingtin to bind to PSD-95 is impaired severely upon its polyglutamine expansion, more PSD-95 proteins may be available to cluster NMDA receptors, leading to overactivation or sensitization of these receptors and excitotoxicity. If our hypothesis is correct, the expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may enhance, and overexpression of normal huntingtin may inhibit, neuronal toxicity mediated by NMDA or GluR6 receptors. In our previous studies, we observed that the overexpression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells (which expresses both NR1 and NR2A receptors (data not shown)) induces apoptotic cell death (20Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we examined whether expression of the mutated huntingtin may promote activation of NMDA receptors in HN33 cells. Full-length huntingtin containing 16 or 48 polyglutamine repeats (pFL16HD or pFL48HD) was transiently expressed in HN33 cells; 1 mm glutamate, 10 μmd-AP5 (a selective NMDA antagonist), or glutamate + d-AP5 was included in the transfection medium. 24 or 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed, TUNEL stain-detecting was conducted on apoptotic cells, and TUNEL-negative cells (living cells) were counted. Consistent with our previous reports, HN33 cells transfected with pFL48HD began to undergo apoptosis at ∼24 h post-transfection (Fig.4 A). At 48 h, ∼60% of HN33 cells were apoptotic (Fig. 4 A). However, the treatment of wild-type HN33 cells or cells transfected with pFL16HD with glutamate did not alter cell viability (Fig. 4 A). Also, treatment of HN33 cells transfected with pFL48HD with glutamate significantly promoted neuronal toxicity. At 24 h post-transfection, ∼35–40% of HN33 cells were apoptotic when glutamate was included in the transfection medium, compared with 10–15% that were apoptotic when glutamate was not included in the transfection medium without glutamate (Fig. 4 A). At 48 h, 85% of HN33 cells were apoptotic when treated with glutamate as compared with ∼60% of apoptotic cells in the glutamate-free transfection medium (Fig. 4 A). The addition ofd-AP5 significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity mediated by both glutamate and the mutated huntingtin. At 48 h, the number of apoptotic cells induced by the mutated huntingtin alone was reduced to 30% and in the presence of d-AP5, the number of apoptotic cells induced by both mutated huntingtin and glutamate was reduced to 36% (Fig. 4 B). The data suggest that the expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may sensitize and activate NMDA receptors, leading to neuronal toxicity. Our hypothesis predicts that overexpression of the normal huntingtin N terminus (which binds and sequesters PSD-95) may inhibit neuronal toxicity induced by both mutated huntingtin and NMDA receptors. To test this possibility, pFL48HD was co-transfected with pN16HD (truncated huntingtin encoded by the first three exons with 16 polyglutamine repeats) into HN33 cells, and 1 mm glutamate was added to the transfection medium. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the number of apoptotic cells induced by glutamate and mutated huntingtin was significantly reduced when pN16HD was co-expressed. This neuroprotective action mediated by normal huntingtin was abolished when full-length PSD-95 was co-introduced (Fig. 4 C). The data support the view that normal huntingtin sequesters PSD-95 and thereby inhibits neuronal toxicity mediated by glutamate receptors. Striatal medium spiny neurons are the first population of neurons affected in HD. It seems that the activation of NMDA or kainate receptors in the striatum also selectively induces the death of the same population despite the fact that these receptors are widely distributed in other types of striatal neurons (25Chen Q. Reiner A. Brain Res. 1996; 743: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mice transgenic for the HD gene exhibit hyperactive NMDA receptors in the brain and are deficient in long term depression and spatial learning (9Hodgson J.G. Agopyan N. Gutekunst C.-A. Leavitt B.R.

Res. 1999; 58: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting that expression of the mutated huntingtin can cause sensitization and activation of membrane NMDA receptors. However, full-length polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin displays perinuclear localization (26Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W.

Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). PSD-95 is known to bind and regulate the activity of glutamate receptors (11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of huntingtin with PSD-95 clearly provides a crucial link between glutamate receptors and the mutated huntingtin. Our current study indicates that normal huntingtin binds to PSD-95 and sequesters the scaffold protein, resulting in the inhibition of NMDA receptor activity. Overexpression of the normal huntingtin N terminus significantly attenuates neuronal toxicity induced by both NMDA receptors and the mutated huntingtin, and co-expression of wild-type PSD-95 inhibits the neuroprotective action of normal huntingtin. This suggests that PSD-95 is a mediator of neuronal toxicity induced by NMDA receptors and mutated huntingtin. The data are consistent with our recent report (23Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as well as studies from other groups (16Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.-Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Gain of function has been a popular hypothesis in the HD field in the last 20 years (28Leavitt B.R. Guttman J.A. Hodgson J.G. Kimel G.H. Singaraja R. Vogal A.W. Hayden M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 313-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our previous and current studies show that loss of function may play an important role in the induction of neuronal death in HD (21Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, other groups have also shown that the expression of normal huntingtin in HD transgenic mice attenuates neuronal toxicity induced by the mutated huntingtin (29Wexler N.S. Young A.B. Tanzi R.E. Travers H. Starosta-Rubinstein S. Penney J.B. Snodgrass S.R. Shoulson I. Gomez F. Ramos Arroyo M.A. Nature. 1987; 326: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, the competitive loss of function of normal huntingtin may initiate the pathogenesis of HD. An interesting question is why heterozygous patients exhibit a similar HD phenotype with homozygous patients. We found that the ability of normal huntingtin to bind to PSD-95 in HD patients is also impaired and that the amount of huntingtin associated with the scaffold protein is well below 50%. In other words, the mutated huntingtin not only fails to bind to PSD-95 but also inhibits the binding of normal huntingtin to the scaffold protein in the human post-mortem brains. These observations reflect the dominant nature of the huntingtin mutation and may explain the clinical similarity between homozygous and heterozygous HD patients (29Wexler N.S. Young A.B. Tanzi R.E. Travers H. Starosta-Rubinstein S. Penney J.B. Snodgrass S.R. Shoulson I. Gomez F. Ramos Arroyo M.A. Nature. 1987; 326: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Clinically, HD is characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbance (4Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Mandel J.L.

If a protein were essential for the pathogenesis of HD, one would assume that disruption of the biological function of this protein might lead to these clinical symptoms. PSD-95 fits the role of such a protein because PSD-95 is known to be involved in excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate receptors (16Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.-Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for both innate immune responses and initiation of acquired immunity. Here we focus on the potential involvement of TLR ligand interaction in DC maturation.

All stimuli induced maturation of murine bone marrow-derived DCs in control mice. TLR2−/− mice lacked maturation upon stimulation with PGN, as assessed by expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD86, cytokine, and chemokine production, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran uptake, and mixed lymphocyte reactions, while being completely responsive to LPS. A similar lack of maturation was observed in C3H/HeJ mice upon stimulation with LPS. DC maturation induced by LTAs from two different types of bacteria was severely impaired in TLR2−/−, whereas C3H/HeJ mice responded to LTAs in a manner similar to wild-type mice. We demonstrate that DC maturation is induced by stimuli from Gram-positive microorganisms, such as PGN and LTA, with similar efficiency as by LPS.

DCs that encounter invading microbes capture bacterial antigens and migrate to lymphoid organs, where they home to the T cell areas. While migrating to the lymph nodes, they shift from an endocytic/phagocytic immature stage to a mature stage of efficient T cell stimulation (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12348) Google Scholar). This activation stage is named maturation and is accompanied by drastic morphological and functional changes. Only mature DCs have high levels of surface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules that are essential for efficient T cell stimulation (2Banchereau J. Briere F. Caux C. Davoust J. Lebecque S. Liu Y.J. Pulendran B. Palucka K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 767-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (5664) Google Scholar). Besides inducing adaptive immune responses, maturing DCs, as part of the innate immune system, secrete cytokines and chemokines to recruit immune cells to the site of infection (2Banchereau J.

Maturation of DCs can be induced by microbial antigens, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α), and non-microbial stimuli such as CD40 ligand (3Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M.

The characterization of TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice demonstrated that TLR4 is involved in the recognition of LPS and LTA (14Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). TLR2 is involved in the response to PGN of Gram-positive bacteria and to lipopeptides from several microorganisms including spirochetes, mycobacteria, mycoplasma, whole bacteria, and yeast (reviewed in Ref. 15Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that human DCs express TLR1–5 (16Muzio M. Bosisio D. Polentarutti N. D'Amico G.

The expression pattern of TLRs on murine DCs has not been described yet; however, it is likely that murine DCs exhibit the same expression pattern as human DCs. We focused on the role of TLR2 and -4 for maturation of DCs. We examined DCs derived from TLR2-deficient and TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice for their ability to mature after stimulation with Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell wall components. Our results indicate that interaction with the corresponding ligands of TLRs during bacteria-induced maturation is required for both the up-regulation of cell surface MHC class II and costimulatory molecules on mature DCs. Cytokine secretion of DCs also depends on TLR integrity, because it is severely impaired in TLR2-deficient mice upon stimulation with PGN and highly purified LTA and in C3H/HeJ mice upon stimulation with LPS and lipid A.

Briefly, bone marrow cells were flushed from femurs and tibias of mice by complete medium (RPMI 1640, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin). After 24 h of incubation of the obtained cells with mGM-CSF-containing (30 ng/ml) complete medium, non-adherent cells were discarded, and the remaining cells were fed with mGM-CSF-containing complete medium. This step was repeated on day 3 of incubation. On day 5 of culture, cells were fed with mGM-CSF-containing medium, and non-adherent cells were used for experiments on day 6 when they were positive for CD11c. Bone marrow-derived DCs were washed with PBS and resuspended in medium plus 5% fetal calf serum. Stimulations were performed with 200,000 cells/ml or as indicated with PGN (0.1–10 µg/ml), LPS (0.1–100 ng/ml), LTA(10 µg/ml), and synthetic lipid A (0.4–4 ng/ml) for 24 h as indicated. After 4 and 24 h of stimulation supernatants were harvested for cytokine analysis, and cells were processed for flow cytometry. Cells were pre-blocked using rat anti-mouse CD32 F(ab′)2 antibody (PharMingen) at 5 µg/ml in PBS plus 2% rat serum at room temperature for 30 min. Next, cells were washed once in PBS and incubated with rat anti-mouse I-Ab-FITC or I-Ek-FITC, CD86-FITC, and CD11c-FITC. Finally, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). To assess endocytosis of the DC preparations, FITC-dextran was used according to the method described previously (20Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in complete medium with FITC-dextran at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 30 min. Background staining at 4 °C was used as reference. After washing the cells four times with ice-cold PBS, we analyzed DCs by FACScan, measuring FITC-dextran uptake of immature DCs. ELISA plates were coated with anti-murine TNF-α antibody (PharMingen). Samples and recombinant murine TNF-α (R & D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) were detected using a biotin-labeled monoclonal anti-murine TNF-α antibody (PharMingen). For quantification of IL-6, plates were coated with anti-murine IL-6 antibody (PharMingen). Samples and recombinant murine IL-6 (BioConcept) were detected using a biotin-labeled monoclonal anti-murine IL-6 antibody (PharMingen). The detection limits for TNF-α and IL-6 were 31 and 16 pg/ml, respectively. MIP-2, IL-2, and IL-12p40 were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems for MIP-2 and PharMingen for IL-2 and IL-12p40). Spleens from BALB/c mice were homogenized to obtain single cell suspensions, and Ficoll was overlaid with this suspension (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Mononuclear cells obtained from the interphase were washed twice with PBS. Allogeneic CD4+ T cells were isolated employing CD4 microbeads (Milteny Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) and an Auto-Macs separation system (Milteny Biotech). Purity of the CD4+ T cells was greater than 80% as assessed by flow cytometric staining for CD3. Bone marrow-derived DCs from C3H/HeJ and TLR2−/− and corresponding wild-type mice were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS and 5 µg/ml PGN for 24 h. DCs were mixed with 5 × 104 CD4+ T cells at a ratio of 1:50 to assess their T cell stimulatory capacity. After 3 days of coculture, supernatants were taken and immediately examined for IL-2 secretion. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical differences were determined by the Mann-Whitney-U test.p < 0.05 is considered significant and is indicated by asterisks. We investigated whether PGN of Gram-positive bacteria is able to induce the maturation of bone marrow-derived murine DCs. Stimulation of murine DCs with 0.1, 1, and 10 µg/ml PGN for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent up-regulation of the costimulatory molecule CD86 and MHC class II molecules and thereby maturation of DCs (TableI).Table IPGN induces the up-regulation of CD86 and MHC class II in a dose-dependent manner during DC maturationPGNMean fluorescence intensityCD86MHC IIµg/mlControl6.425.40.19.054.11.010.457.21022.563.0DCs were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentration of PGN for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab DCs were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentration of PGN for 24 h. MHC class II (I-Ab) and CD86 expression was analyzed by FACScan. Shown is the mean fluorescence intensity. Data represent one experiment out of three with similar results. To assess whether PGN-induced maturation of DCs is initiated via TLR2, we examined the responsiveness of DCs from TLR2-deficient mice to PGN and, as control, to LPS. First, we examined the expression of MHC class II molecules and CD86 on DCs from TLR2-deficient and control mice by flow cytometry. PGN induced an increase in the expression of MHC class II molecules on wild-type DCs (Fig.1 A). In contrast, induction of MHC class II and CD86 by PGN was impaired in TLR2−/− DCs. TLR2 heterozygous littermates exhibited an intermediate response (data not shown). Expression of CD86 and MHC class II in response to LPS was up-regulated in TLR2-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 1 B). Next, the production of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and MIP-2 by DCs upon stimulation with increasing concentrations of PGN was determined (Fig.2). Whereas stimulation of wild-type DCs with PGN resulted in a dose-dependent response for all cytokines, stimulation of TLR2-deficient mice led to an impaired response for IL-6, IL-12, and MIP-2 and no response at all for TNF-α. Production of IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-2, and IL-12p40 in response to stimulation with LPS, in contrast, was strongly induced in DCs from TLR2-deficient mice, as expected (data not shown). To confirm the observed lack of DC maturation in TLR2−/− mice stimulated with PGN by a functional assay, we tested the capacity of antigen capture by DCs as measured by FITC-dextran uptake. For this purpose DCs were incubated with FITC-dextran at 4 and 37 °C (Fig.3). Unstimulated immature DCs derived from TLR2−/− mice displayed an uptake of FITC-dextran at 37 °C, which was completely lost upon maturation induced by LPS. TLR2−/− DCs stimulated with PGN displayed an FITC-dextran uptake similar to that of the control DCs, indicating that these cells are functionally still immature. To further examine the functional consequences of TLR2 deficiency, we investigated the capacity of DCs derived from TLR2−/−mice stimulated with PGN and LPS to stimulate T cells in an allogeneic MLR (Fig. 4). Unstimulated DCs and PGN- and LPS-stimulated DCs derived from TLR2−/− and TLR2+/+ mice were cocultured with allogeneic T cells at a DC:T cell ratio of 1:50 for 3 days. T cell activation was assessed by IL-2 release. Because IL-2 is not produced by DCs, activated T cells in the cocultures are the only source of IL-2.DCs derived from TLR2−/− mice stimulated with PGN were not able to induce IL-2 secretion from T cells similar to untreated cells (Fig. 4 A), whereas DCs from TLR2+/+ mice stimulated with PGN induced substantial IL-2 secretion of T cells (Fig.4 B). In contrast, DCs from TLR2−/−and TLR2+/+ mice were both found to be effective inducers of IL-2 secretion when stimulated with LPS, as expected. To determine the role of TLR4 in DC maturation, we examined the maturation of DCs from C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice upon stimulation with LPS. Stimulation of DCs of C3H/HeN mice with LPS resulted in an up-regulation of MHC class II molecules. In contrast, LPS stimulation of DCs derived from C3H/HeJ mice led to an impaired up-regulation of MHC class II molecules (Fig.5 A). Similar results were obtained using a synthetic lipid A preparation (Fig. 5 B). Additionally, FITC-dextran uptake in C3H/HeJ mice stimulated with LPS confirmed the lack of maturation of DCs in C3H/HeJ mice (data not shown). We next examined the cytokine secretion of DCs during maturation upon stimulation with lipid A, the bioactive component of LPS. Whereas stimulation with lipid A resulted in a response in DCs from C3H/HeN mice, in C3H/HeJ mice no IL-6 (Fig.6 A), IL-12 (Fig.6 B), and MIP-2 (Fig. 6 C) response upon lipid A stimulation could be observed. Additional experiments with LPS led to a similar lack of cytokine and chemokine response in DCs from C3H/HeJ mice (data not shown). We also investigated the capacity of C3H/HeJ- and C3H/HeN-derived DCs stimulated with PGN and LPS to induce IL-2 production of allogeneic T cells (Fig.7). LPS-stimulated DCs derived from C3H/HeJ mice were unable to increase IL-2 release from T cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7 A). DCs from C3H/HeN mice, in contrast, enhanced the IL-2 production of T cells after stimulation with LPS (Fig. 7 B). DCs from both mice strains were effective in inducing IL-2 secretion when stimulated with the TLR2 ligand PGN, as expected. To assess LTA-induced maturation of DCs, we examined the responsiveness of DCs from TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice to LTA fromS. aureus and B. subtilis. Stimulation of DCs derived from C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice with highly purified LTA fromS. aureus and B. subtilis resulted in the up-regulation of CD86 in both strains (Fig.8, A and B,left panels). Furthermore, no differences in secretion of IL-6 (Fig. 9 A) in LTA-induced DC maturation could be observed in either mouse strain. In contrast, up-regulation of CD86 in DCs from TLR2-deficient mice was severely impaired upon LTA stimulation compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 8,A and B, right panels). Additionally, production of IL-6 (Fig. 9 B) was not detectable in DCs from TLR2-deficient mice in response to LTA from S. aureus andB. subtilis. Similar results have been obtained for the production of IL-12 upon LTA stimulation (data not shown).Figure 9Expression of IL-6 in TLR2−/− and C3H/HeJ DCs upon stimulation with LTA. DCs (4 × 105 cells/ml) from TLR2−/−, TLR2+/+, C3H/HeJ, and C3H/HeN mice were cultured in the presence of 10 µg/ml S. aureus or B. subtilis LTA, 100 ng/ml S. minnesota Re 595 LPS (A), or 10 µg/ml PGN (B) for 24 h.

Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12348) Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells have been the focus of intensive investigations in biomedical research, i.e. in the area of cancer research for developing DC-based cancer vaccines as a novel immunotherapy. DCs activate both naı̈ve and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and seem to meet all requirements as a strong vaccine for antitumor immunity or immunity against microbial infection (21Dhodapkar M.V. Steinman R.M. Sapp M. Desai H. Fossella C. Krasovsky J. Donahoe S.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Nixon D.F. Bhardwaj N. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Located in most host tissues, DCs function as mobile sentinels for infectious agents and inflammatory products of bacteria. In contrast to macrophages, the phagocytosis of bacteria by DCs is limited (3Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 200-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After challenge with bacteria, DCs enter the process of maturation and migrate to lymphoid organs. During this process DCs not only lose the ability of phagocytosis, but they also produce large amounts of cytokines and chemokines (3Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 200-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, MHC class II molecules are translocated to the membrane, and costimulatory molecules such as CD86 and CD40 are up-regulated (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12348) Google Scholar, 22Winzler C. Rovere P. Rescigno M. Granucci F. Penna G. Adorini L. Zimmermann V.S. Davoust J. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Because of the important role of DCs as a mediator between innate and adaptive immunity, it is of great importance to elucidate the regulation of their maturation and to analyze the molecules involved. Here we show the involvement of TLR2 and TLR4 in the maturation of DCs. Both TLR2 and TLR4 have been implicated in the recognition of bacterial cell wall products of Gram-positive (14Takeuchi O.

Although certain bacterial stimuli are well known as inducers of DC maturation, the receptor mechanism involved in this induction of maturation has not yet been elucidated. Besides induction by bacterial stimuli, DC maturation can also be induced by proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) and CD40 cross-linking by CD40 ligand on activated T cells. A very recent report, however, notes that for CD40-induced IL-12 production of murine DCs additional microbial stimuli are required for obtaining an optimal response (28Schulz O. Edwards A.D. Schito M. Aliberti J. Manickasingham S. Sher A. Reis e Sousa C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Our findings of the involvement of TLRs in bacteria-induced DC maturation complement theories on bridging innate and acquired immunity by pattern recognition receptors such as the TLRs (29Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Common understanding defines DCs as cells lacking mCD14. By employing blocking CD14 antibodies, it was demonstrated that LPS-induced responses of human DCs are dependent on soluble CD14 (30Verhasselt V. Buelens C. Willems F. De Groote D. Haeffner-Cavaillon N. Goldman M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2919-2925PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing murine CD14 antibodies a down-regulation of the LPS-induced response of DCs was also detected (31Mahnke K. Becher E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Grabbe S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 417: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our present study provides substantial evidence that bacteria-induced maturation of DCs depends on TLR interaction; PGN-induced maturation of DCs is severely impaired in TLR2−/− mice. LPS- and lipid A-induced DC maturation is initiated via TLR4 occupation, because DCs from C3H/HeJ mice were unable to undergo maturation. Lack of TLR2 or -4 abolished up-regulation of MHC class II and CD86 and led to an impaired secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and TH1 cytokines upon stimulation with the appropriate ligand. To address the biological relevance of these findings we employed two different functional assays for DC maturation. Antigen presentation was found to be severely impaired in TLR2−/− and C3H/HeJ DCs when stimulated with the appropriate ligand, as measured by IL-2 secretion of cocultured T cells. In addition, FITC-dextran antigen uptake, a characteristic function of immature DCs, could not be down-regulated by the maturation-inducing ligands PGN or LPS in DCs derived from TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice. These findings led us to conclude that DCs deficient in TLR2 or TLR4 do not undergo maturation upon stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PGN and the TLR4 ligands LPS and lipid A, respectively. The question whether LTA signals via TLR2 or -4 has been controversial (14Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S.

This HEK293 system has been questioned recently in the context of LPS-induced signal transduction due to a lack of expression of MD-2, a molecule associated with TLR4 and absolutely required for LPS signaling via TLR4 (34Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In the context of TLR2-mediated signal transduction, however, this system still may be valuable. 2Opitz, B., Schröder, N. W. J., Spreitzer, I., Michelsen, K. S., Kirschning, C. J., Hallatschek, W., Zähringer, U., Hartung, T. Göbel, U. B., and Schumann, R. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,22041–22047. In contrast, it was recently reported that TLR4−/−macrophages, but not wild-type or TLR2−/−macrophages, failed to respond to LTA from S. aureus (14Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Our results presented here clearly demonstrate that DCs derived from C3H/HeJ mice respond to LTA from B. subtilis and S. aureus to a similar extent as DCs from C3H/HeN mice regarding their secretion of cytokines as well as up-regulation of CD86. The results obtained with DCs from TLR2−/− mice furthermore support the view that TLR2 is the signal transducer for LTA. These discrepancies between our data and the report mentioned above may be due to differences in the cell type employed (DCsversus macrophages) or to differences in the purification procedure applied for the LTA used. We observed a slightly higher expression of IL-6 (Fig. 9 A) and IL-12 (data not shown) in DCs derived from C3H/HeJ mice compared with C3H/HeN mice when stimulated with highly purified LTA from S. aureus as well as B. subtilis. An up-regulation of TLR2 or other TLRs to compensate for the loss of TLR4 may be an explanation for this phenomenon. In summary, our results demonstrate that recognition of cell wall compounds of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by TLRs on the surface of DCs is essential for bacteria-induced DC maturation and thus for initiation of innate and acquired immune responses. Gaining further insight into DC maturation may increase understanding of DC biology and of how to utilize these cells in clinical applications.

In order to determine whether the subcellular locations differed for each of the three ACSs present in liver and whether these isoforms were regulated independently, non-cross-reacting peptide antibodies were raised against ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5. ACS1 was identified in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and cytosol, but not in mitochondria. ACS4 was present primarily in MAM, and the 76-kDa ACS5 protein was located in mitochondrial membrane. Consistent with these locations, N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of ACS4, inhibited ACS activity 47% in MAM and 28% in endoplasmic reticulum. Troglitazone, a second ACS4 inhibitor, inhibited ACS activity <10% in microsomes and mitochondria and 45% in MAM. Triacsin C, a competitive inhibitor of both ACS1 and ACS4, inhibited ACS activity similarly in endoplasmic reticulum, MAM, and mitochondria, suggesting that a hitherto unidentified triacsin-sensitive ACS is present in mitochondria. ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 were regulated independently by fasting and re-feeding. Fasting rats for 48 h resulted in a decrease in ACS4 protein, and an increase in ACS5. Re-feeding normal chow or a high sucrose diet for 24 h after a 48-h fast increased both ACS1 and ACS4 protein expression 1.5–2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies. These results suggest that ACS1 and ACS4 may be linked to triacylglycerol synthesis. Taken together, the data suggest that acyl-CoAs may be functionally channeled to specific metabolic pathways through different ACS isoforms in unique subcellular locations.

This reaction, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS,1 EC 6.2.1.3), produces acyl-CoAs, which are primary substrates for energy use via β-oxidation and for the synthesis of triacylglycerol, phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and sphingomyelin, and are the source of signaling molecules like ceramide, diacylglycerol, and arachidonic acid (1Faergman N.J.

Acyl-CoAs up-regulate uncoupling protein in brown fat and key enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and β-oxidation; are essential for vesicle trafficking; and play a critical role in the transport of fatty acids into cells by making transport unidirectional.

Thus, acyl-CoAs participate in a large number of cellular reactions that involve lipid synthesis, energy metabolism, and regulation, but how acyl-CoAs are partitioned or directed toward these diverse synthetic, degradative, and signaling pathways is not understood.

ACS1, ACS2, and ACS5 make up one subfamily with about 60% homology to one another, and ACS3 and ACS4 make up a second subfamily with about 70% homology to each other and 30% similarity to ACS1. Within each subfamily, the ACS isoforms differ in their mRNA size, tissue distribution, and transcriptional regulation. ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 are all expressed in liver. Studies with the ACS inhibitors triacsin and troglitazone suggested that long chain acyl-CoAs are functionally channeled toward specific metabolic fates. In most of these studies, de novoglycerolipid synthesis was severely inhibited, whereas phospholipid reacylation and ketone bodies formation was less impaired. Inhibition of fatty acid incorporation into cholesterol esters varied with cell type, being completely blocked in human fibroblasts and only moderately decreased in hepatocytes. For example, in hepatocytes, triacsin C did not alter oxidation of pre-labeled intracellular lipid, but did inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis 40% and 70% in hepatocytes isolated from starved and fed rats, respectively (9Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Weidmar P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats, troglitazone blocked incorporation of oleate into triacylglycerol, but not into phospholipid (10Fulgencio J.P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, troglitazone inhibited ketone body production. In human fibroblasts, triacsin C blocked the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into phospholipid by 80% and the incorporation into triacylglycerol by 99%, indicating severely impaired acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol via the de novosynthetic pathway from glycerol 3-phosphate (11Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [14C]oleate into triacylglycerol was also blocked 95%, consistent with impaired acylation via the de novo pathway; however, incorporation into phospholipids was not impaired, suggesting that separate pools of acyl-CoAs exist and that the reacylation pathway is functionally separate from de novo glycerolipid synthesis. Taken as a whole, these studies suggest that there are functionally independent acyl-CoA pools within cells, and that acyl-CoAs might be channeled toward specific fates rather than being freely available for all possible enzymatic reactions. Yeast provide clear evidence for functionally different ACS-linked pathways. In Candida lipolytica, studies using ACS mutants indicate that ACS I activates exogenous fatty acids for glycerolipid synthesis and ACS II activates them for β-oxidation (12Kamiryo T. Nishkawa Y. Mishina M. Terao M. Numa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4390-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the ACS proteins Faa1p and Faa4p account for 99% of yeast C14-CoA and C16-CoA activity (13Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and activate exogenously derived fatty acids destined for phospholipid synthesis (14Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Faa4p is specifically needed for myristoylation of protein substrates (15Ashrafi K. Farazi T.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25864-25874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and Faa2p is required for peroxisomal β-oxidation (16Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W.T.

Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Yeast ACS isoforms are also differentially inhibited by triacsin C (18Knoll L.J. Schall O.F. Suzuki I. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20090-20097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). From these data, Gordon's group (17Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) concluded that there are differences in location or accessibility of those acyl-CoAs that are derived from endogenous synthesis and those acyl-CoAs formed from exogenously provided fatty acids. Thus, genetic studies in yeast link specific ACS isoforms to different pathways that use acyl-CoAs. We examined ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 in rat liver, which contains a variety of pathways that use acyl-CoAs, in order to determine whether the subcellular locations, inhibition by specific inhibitors, and nutritional regulation might link the different ACS isoforms with different metabolic pathways. Our data indicate that ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 are present in different subcellular membranes; that ACS activity is inhibited by triacsin C, troglitazone, and NEM to varying degrees in these subcellular fractions; and that nutritional changes regulate each ACS isoform independently. [2-3H]Glycerol and [9,10-3H]palmitate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Glycerol, palmitoyl-CoA, ATP, and bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free) were from Sigma. Triacsin C (>95% pure) was from Biomol. Troglitazone was the gift of Dr. Steven Jacobs, GlaxoSmithKline. A polyclonal antibody to rat ACS1 was the gift of Dr. Paul Watkins, Kennedy Krieger Institute. Animal protocols were approved by the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill, NC and University of Alberta Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Male and female (150 g) Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were housed on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water. Control animals had free access to Purina rat chow. Fasted animals were sacrificed after being without food for 48 h. Refed rats were sacrificed after being fed Purina rat chow or a high sucrose diet (69.5% sucrose, Dyets, Inc.) for 24 h after a 48-h fast. For subcellular localization experiments, liver cytosol, microsomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and mitochondria were isolated from male rats by a method (19Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) modified by Vance (20Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver total membrane fraction, microsomes, and mitochondria were isolated from female rats by differential centrifugation (21Fleischer S. McIntyre J.O. Vidal J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for subcellular localization and nutritional regulation experiments. Fractions were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Peptides corresponding to regions of rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 that show poor amino acid conservation (ACS1, MEVHELFRYFRMPELIDIR; ACS4, EIHSMQSVEELGSKPENSSI; ACS5, KCGIEMLSLHDAENL) were synthesized, purified, and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the UNC/PMBB Micro Protein Chemistry Facility. Rabbit antibodies to these peptides and to purified mitochondrial GPAT were raised commercially in New Zealand White rabbits (ImmunoDynamics, La Jolla, CA). Antibodies to PEMT2 were made as described previously (22Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on an 8% (or 12% for PEMT2) polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For chemiluminescent detection, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and PicoWest reagents (Pierce). For quantitation, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with 0.5 μ Ci of 125I-Protein A (ICN), exposed to a phosphor screen, and quantified with the Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 and ImageQuant software. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase was assayed at 23 °C with 200 μm sn-1,2-diolein and 25 μm [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (23Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7681-7687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acyl-CoA synthetase was assayed at 37 °C with 5 mm ATP, 250 μm CoA, and 50 μm[3H]palmitate (24Banis R.J. Tove S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) was assayed at 23 °C with 300 μm [3H]glycerol-3-P and 112.5 μm palmitoyl-CoA in the presence or absence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit the microsomal isoform (25Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal GPAT was estimated by subtracting theN-ethylmaleimide-resistant activity (mitochondrial GPAT) from the total. All assays measured initial rates. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA (26Merrill A.H.J. Gidwitz S. Bell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1368-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate (27Chang Y.-Y. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 447-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized enzymatically. The relative distribution of ACS activity in rat liver is 7% in peroxisomes, 20% in mitochondria, and 73% in microsomes (28Krisans S.K. Mortensen R.M. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9599-9607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since measurements of ACS activity do not distinguish among the different ACS isoforms, we localized each isoform in order to determine whether it is evenly distributed or, instead, located in a specific subcellular membrane. We raised isoform-specific rabbit antibodies against unique peptides present in ACS1, ACS4, or ACS5 because an antibody raised against purified ACS1 not only recognized purified recombinant ACS1, but also recognized purified recombinant ACS4 and ACS5 (Fig.1 A). The cross-reactivity is most likely due to the high degree of sequence similarity found among ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5. The specificity of each of our peptide antibodies was verified by immunoblot analysis of each isoform specific antibody against purified recombinant rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, each with a C-terminal Flag epitope (29Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Peptide antibodies for ACS4 and ACS5 each recognized only the correct ACS isoform (Fig. 1, C andD). The ACS1 peptide antibody failed to recognize recombinant ACS1-Flag (Fig. 1 B) because the initial two amino acids of the N-terminal sequence had been altered to clone the recombinant protein. However, the recombinant ACS1-Flag protein detected by the Flag antibody and the major band in rat liver microsomes detected by the ACS1 peptide antibody migrate to the same position, showing that the ACS1 peptide antibody recognizes native ACS1 (Fig. 1 E). Rat liver was fractionated by two different methods. One method used a sucrose gradient to further purify microsomes into ER1 and ER2 fractions that are enriched in rough and smooth ER, respectively (19Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,20Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Percoll gradient separated crude mitochondria into MAM and purified mitochondria (19Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second method used only differential centrifugation (21Fleischer S. McIntyre J.O. Vidal J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and produced mitochondria that had very little microsomal contamination and microsomes that primarily contained ER membranes, as well as the MAM fraction. The purity of each fraction was ascertained by enzymatic assays for the ER enzymes DGAT and NEM-sensitive GPAT, and for the mitochondrial enzyme NEM-resistant GPAT and an by immunoblots for mitochondrial GPAT and for PEMT, the MAM marker. These markers showed that the microsome fraction was free of mitochondrial contamination because little NEM-resistant GPAT activity was present (Table I) and no mitochondrial GPAT protein was detected by immunoblotting (Fig.2 B). In the ER and MAM fractions purified using gradients, 11–28% of the GPAT activity was resistant to NEM (Table I), indicating that these fractions were somewhat contaminated with mitochondria. No PEMT was detected in the ER and purified mitochondria by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 B), indicating that these fractions were not contaminated with the MAM fraction. Very low DGAT and NEM-sensitive GPAT activities were measured in the purified mitochondria (Table I), indicating little contamination with ER. DGAT activity was enriched in the MAM fraction compared with ER, consistent with previous results (40Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsome fraction (100,000 × g pellet) also has high DGAT activity, and it contains the MAM fraction, as evidenced by the presence of the MAM-specific marker, PEMT (Fig. 2 B).Table IDGAT and GPAT activity in liver subcellular fractionsSpecific activity nmol/min/mg(n = 3)DGATGPAT1-aGPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.Mitochondrial GPAT1-bRemaining GPAT activity following treatment of sample with 2 mm NEM.Microsomes1-c100,000 × g pellet from supernatant fraction after isolation of crude mitochondria.1.72 ± 0.221.27 ± 0.160.06 ± 0.01 (4.7%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.ER11-eFraction isolated from sucrose gradient.0.31 ± 0.152.35 ± 0.230.51 ± 0.19 (22%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.ER21-eFraction isolated from sucrose gradient.0.59 ± 0.191.41 ± 0.090.29 ± 0.02 (20%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.MAM1-fFraction isolated from Percoll gradient.0.94 ± 0.072.05 ± 0.350.61 ± 0.32 (30%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.Crude mitochondria1-g10,000 × gpellet.0.38 ± 0.091.20 ± 0.070.64 ± 0.05 (54%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.Pure mitochondria1-fFraction isolated from Percoll gradient.0.19 ± 0.131.10 ± 0.351.00 ± 0.22 (91%)1-dPercent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.1-a GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.1-b Remaining GPAT activity following treatment of sample with 2 mm NEM.1-c 100,000 × g pellet from supernatant fraction after isolation of crude mitochondria.1-d Percent of GPAT specific activity assayed in the absence of NEM.1-e Fraction isolated from sucrose gradient.1-f Fraction isolated from Percoll gradient.1-g 10,000 × gpellet. Open table in a new tab The location of ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 in rat liver was determined by Western blot analysis of various subcellular fractions. ACS1 (68 kDa) was strongly detected in the microsomal fraction, which comprises rough ER, smooth ER, and MAM (Fig. 2 A). The molecular mass is smaller than that predicted by the cDNA sequence (78 kDa), but in agreement with the size of the recombinant ACS1 run in the same manner (Fig. 1). A prominent ACS1 band was also detected in the cytosol, but cytosolic ACS specific activity was only 2.6% that of microsomal ACS specific activity (3.5 versus 132 nmol/min/mg of protein). Although ACS1 was present in crude mitochondria, which contain the MAM fraction, no ACS1 band was observed in purified mitochondria (Fig.2 A), as we reported previously (9Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Weidmar P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACS4 (74 kDa) was enriched in the MAM fractions from rat liver (Fig. 2 A) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown), and was only very weakly detected in microsomal and mitochondrial fractions. In some preparations, ACS4 was detected as a doublet with a larger 75-kDa protein (data not shown), consistent with alternative start sites as described for the human ACS4 homologue (30Cao Y. Murphy K.J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ACS5-specific antiserum detected a protein of 76 kDa in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2 A), 73- and 74.5-kDa proteins in ER, and a 74.5-kDa protein in cytosol and MAM fractions (Fig. 2 A). The 76-kDa protein agrees with the size predicted by the cDNA sequence and migrates to the same position as recombinant ACS5. Taken together, these data indicate that ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 each have unique distributions in liver subcellular membranes. Since ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 were present in different subcellular membranes and the recombinant proteins expressed inEscherichia coli were inhibited to different extents by triacsin C, thiazolidinediones, and NEM (29Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these inhibitors would affect ACS activity differently in each fraction. Triacsin C (10 μm), which inhibits purified recombinant ACS1 and ACS4 by 60%, and does not inhibit ACS5 (29Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), decreased ACS activity in microsomes, mitochondria, and MAM by 60% (Fig. 3). This result is surprising because the only ACS we identified in mitochondria was ACS5, which is resistant to inhibition by triacsin C (29Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mitochondria we assayed were free of contamination by the MAM fraction as determined by the absence of PEMT on an immunoblot (data not shown). Therefore, the observed inhibition suggests that mitochondria contain a hitherto undescribed triacsin-sensitive ACS. Troglitazone and NEM, two specific ACS4 inhibitors, were more selective inhibitors of ACS activity in liver subcellular fractions. Troglitazone at 10 μm decreased ACS activity 25% in MAM, but had no effect on activity in the microsomal or mitochondrial fractions (Fig.4). With 50 μmtroglitazone, ACS activity was inhibited 45% in MAM, again with little effect on microsomal or mitochondrial ACS activity. NEM, a second ACS4 inhibitor, decreased ACS activity 50% in MAM and only 27% in the smooth ER fraction (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the immunolocalization of ACS4 preferentially to the MAM fraction.Figure 5N-Ethylmaleimide inhibits ACS activity in mitochondria-associated membrane. ER1 (enriched in rough ER) and MAM fractions (0.5–1.5 μg of protein) were pre-incubated in the absence or presence of 5 mm NEM for 10 min on ice prior to ACS assay. Control specific activities (100%): ER1 = 181 nmol/min/mg; MAM = 397 nmol/min/mg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 are linked to different metabolic pathways, one might expect that each isoform would be regulated differently under conditions of fasting and re-feeding. ACS activity and protein expression were measured in liver microsomes and mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation from control rats, from rats fasted for 48 h, and from rats fasted for 48 h and then refed either Purina rat chow or a high sucrose diet for 24 h. The microsomes contained MAM, and the mitochondria were free of contamination by MAM as determined by immunoblot with antibody against PEMT, the MAM-specific marker (data not shown). ACS activity, assayed with palmitate as the fatty acid substrate, was similar in microsomes and in mitochondria isolated from control rats (18.5 ±3.5 and 14.3 ± 2.9, respectively), 48-h fasted rats (21.8 ± 0.9 and 11.9 ± 2.9, respectively), and rats fed Purina rat chow for 24 h after a 48-h fast (15.1 ± 4.5 and 14.2 ± 2.4, respectively). Although total ACS activity was unchanged by nutritional status, ACS1 protein expression increased 1.8- and 2-fold with Purina chow and high sucrose re-feeding, respectively (Fig.6). ACS4 protein expression also increased with re-feeding (50% with Purina chow diet and 64% with sucrose diet). ACS5 protein expression in mitochondria did not appear to be altered by re-feeding. After a 48-h fast, ACS1 protein expression decreased 14%, ACS4 protein decreased 47%, whereas ACS5 protein expression increased 82% in mitochondria (Fig. 6). Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the initial step required for oxidation, elongation, and desaturation of fatty acids; for the synthesis of complex lipids and acylated proteins; and for a variety of signals that regulate cellular metabolism (1Faergman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 2Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It had been thought that the ACSs synthesize a common pool of acyl-CoAs, which move freely within cell membrane monolayers and have equal access to the numerous metabolic pathways in which they participate. However, genetic studies in yeast link specific ACS isoforms to different pathways that use acyl-CoAs (12Kamiryo T. Nishkawa Y. Mishina M. Terao M. Numa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apparent steady-stateKm and kcat values for insertion of 2′,3′-dideoxy-TTP (ddTTP), 3′-azido-TTP (AZT-TP), 2′,3′-dideoxy-CTP (ddCTP), 2′,3′-didehydro-TTP (D4T-TP), (-)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC-TP), and carbocyclic 2′,3′-didehydro-ddGTP (CBV-TP) indicated incorporation of all six analogs, albeit with varying efficiencies. Dideoxynucleotides and D4T-TP were utilized by pol γ in vitro as efficiently as natural deoxynucleotides, whereas AZT-TP, 3TC-TP, and CBV-TP were only moderate inhibitors of DNA chain elongation. Inefficient excision of dideoxynucleotides, D4T, AZT, and CBV from DNA predicts persistencein vivo following successful incorporation. In contrast, removal of 3′-terminal 3TC residues was 50% as efficient as natural 3′ termini. Finally, we observed inhibition of exonuclease activity by concentrations of AZT-monophosphate known to occur in cells.

Nucleoside analogs utilized in antiviral therapy are readily incorporated into DNA by the HIV-11 reverse transcriptase. Although viral replication is effectively inhibited by DNA chain terminators, cellular side effects also result. The continuous antiviral therapy required to keep the HIV infection under control has increased the chance for severe antiviral analog induced toxicity. Current antiviral nucleoside analog therapy against HIV clearly results in compromised mitochondrial function due to inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (2Kakuda T.N. Clin. Ther. 2000; 22: 685-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infection (2001)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-infected Adults and Adolescents, http://www.hivatis.org/trtgdlns.html#AdultAdolescent.Google Scholar). AZT was the first analog to be approved for anti-HIV therapy in 1985. In 1990, Dalakas et al. (4Dalakas M.C. Illa I. Pezeshkpour G.H. Laukaitis J.P. Cohen B. Griffin J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) were the first to report mitochondrial myopathies in HIV-infected individuals undergoing AZT treatment. Control studies thereafter demonstrated that these induced myopathies, most notably visualized histologically as ragged red fibers, were indeed caused by AZT treatment and were not a consequence of the HIV infection (5Arnaudo E. Dalakas M. Shanske S. Moraes C.T. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Lancet. 1991; 337: 508-510Abstract PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This study revealed reduced amounts of mitochondrial DNA in AZT-treated skeletal muscle (5Arnaudo E. Dalakas M. Shanske S. Moraes C.T. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Lancet. 1991; 337: 508-510Abstract PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Further clinical evidence has demonstrated that mitochondrial myopathy slowly and cumulatively develops during AZT treatment (6Peters B.S. Winer J. Landon D.N. Stotter A. Pinching A.J. Q. J. Med. 1993; 86: 5-15PubMed Google Scholar). The second class of antiviral nucleoside analogs approved for HIV therapy are the dideoxynucleoside analogs ddI and ddC. These chain terminators also cause toxic side effects by inhibiting mitochondrial function. The use of 2′-3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC) causes a reversible peripheral neuropathy in many patients (7Yarchoan R. Perno C.F. Thomas R.V. Klecker R.W. Allain J.P. Wills R.J. McAtee N. Fischl M.A. Dubinsky R. McNeely M.C. Pluda M.C. Leuther M. Collins J.M. Broder S. Lancet. 1988; 1: 76-81Abstract PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Treatment of human Molt-4 cells with ddC results in delayed cytotoxicity with a concomitant loss of mitochondrial DNA (8Chen C.H. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11934-11937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the cellular target is likely mitochondrial DNA replication. Treatment of human CEM cells with ddC, D4T, and ddI results in a significant decrease of mtDNA and ultrastructural changes of the mitochondria (9Medina D.J. Tsai C.H. Hsiung G.D. Cheng Y.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both AZT and ddC treatment result in depletion of mitochondrial DNA, and both drugs have been shown to cause an increase in mtDNA deletions (10Wang H. Lemire B.D. Cass C.E. Weiner J.H. Michalak M. Penn A.M. Fliegel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA is replicated by an assembly of proteins and enzymes including DNA polymerase γ, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, DNA helicase, multiple transcription factors, and a number of accessory proteins (11Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis from several laboratories has demonstrated that among the cellular replicative DNA polymerases, the mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ is the enzyme most sensitive to the antiviral nucleotide analogs currently approved to control HIV-1 infection (12Kaguni L.S.

Simpson J.F. Meyer R.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Partially purified human DNA pol γ is strongly inhibited by dideoxynucleotide triphosphates and D4T-TP, whereas AZT-TP, 3TC-TP, and CBV-TP inhibit pol γ to a lesser but significant degree (13Martin J.L. Brown C.E. Matthews-Davis N. Reardon J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2743-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant yeast pol γ can readily incorporate dideoxynucleotides and didehydroCTP, but this enzyme is less efficient in the incorporation of AZT (18Eriksson S. Xu B. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18929-18934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 3TC-TP has also been shown to be a substrate for human DNA pol γ as well as for HIV-RT (22Gray N.M. Marr C.L. Penn C.R. Cameron J.M. Bethell R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that pol γ is a primary cellular target for analog-induced mitochondrial toxicity. This acquired mitochondrial toxicity may be caused by 1) direct inhibition of DNA pol γ without incorporation, 2) chain termination by incorporation of these analogs into mitochondrial DNA by DNA pol γ, 3) alteration of the fidelity of DNA synthesis by pol γ, 4) the persistence of these analogs in mtDNA due to inefficient excision, or 5) any combination thereof. To understand the mechanism of this acquired mitochondrial toxicity, a thorough understanding of the interaction of nucleotides and analogs with pol γ is needed. Such information may help in the design of nucleotide analogs that selectively inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase without inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. We and others have cloned and overproduced the catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase γ in insect cells via a recombinant baculovirus (23Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this report, we have determined the insertion efficiency of the currently approved anti-HIV analogs into DNA by purified recombinant human DNA polymerase γ, and we have investigated the efficiency of removing these analogs from DNA by the intrinsic 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of pol γ. Poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18, dideoxynucleoside triphosphates, dNTPs, and radioisotopes ([α-32P]dTTP, [α-32P]dGTP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [γ-32P]ATP) were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. or Life Technologies, Inc. dTMP and dTDP were purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. AZT-MP, AZT-DP, and AZT-TP were purchased from Moravek. CBV-TP and the minus enantiomer of 3TC-TP were generous gifts from GlaxoWellcome. D4T-TP was a gift from Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The recombinant wild type histidine-tagged human DNA polymerase γ (wild type pol γ) was purified from baculoviral-infected insect cells as described (24Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To make the histidine-tagged exonuclease-deficient DNA pol γ (Exo−pol γ), the wild typeBamH-NotI fragment of pHuγpQE9 (24Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was replaced with BamHI-NotI fragment of Exo−100/103huγpVL. The EcoRI-NotI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 and resulting recombinant baculovirus, Exo−pQVSL11.4, selected. The Exo−pol γ was purified from Exo−pQVSL11.4 baculoviral infected cells like the wild type pol γ. Reverse transcriptase activity of pol γ was determined using poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 in reactions (50 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 8.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 25 μm[α-32P]TTP (2000 cpm/pmol), 75 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18, and 2.5 ng of pol γ as described previously (24Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One unit is the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the incorporation of 1 pmol of dTMP into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable DNA in 1 h at 37 °C using poly(rA)/oligo(dT). Inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity of pol γ by antiviral nucleotides was determined in this standard assay in the presence of 0.2–1000 nm ddTTP or D4T-TP, or 0.2–438 μmAZT-TP. Exonuclease activity was determined by incubating 0.5 pmol of 5′-32P-end-labeled 18-mer with 0, 10, 40, or 120 ng of wild type pol γ or Exo−pol γ in 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction was terminated at 90 °C for 3 min in 10 μl of formamide loading dye (95% deionized formamide, 0.01 mEDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and products were visualized and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager Storm860 and NIH Image 1.61 software. The kinetics of antiviral nucleotide analog insertion into DNA by Exo−pol γ was measured using the gel-based oligonucleotide extension assay (26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer-template sets used for each type of analog follow.

The gel-purified 18-mer was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed in a 1:1.4 ratio to the respective templates in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by heating to 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. One pmol of primer:template (32P-end-labeled primer) was incubated with 1.4 ng of Exo−pol γ (10 fmol of enzyme) in a 10-μl reaction containing 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and variable dNTP concentrations (3 nm to 1.0 mm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped on ice by the addition of 10 μl of formamide loading dye. The products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel and visualized as described above. The inhibition of a single nucleotide incorporation was performed with the primer-template sets described above in the same buffer conditions but with 100 nm [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dTTP, or [α-32P]dGTP. Antiviral nucleotide analog triphosphate was added to these reactions as indicated. The products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel and visualized as described above. Ten fmol of32P-end-labeled 38-mer was added to all reactions and used to normalize the products from gel loading error. To produce single-stranded substrates for exonuclease assay with various antiviral analogs at the 3′ terminus, the 18-mer primer was 32P-end-labeled on the 5′ termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase and then extended at the 3′ terminus with the different analogs using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) in one-Phor-all buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The products of the reaction were desalted and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column followed by centrifugation in a Microcon-3 microconcentrator. Purified HIV-RT was used to label the 3′ termini of the 18-mer in the 18/36-mer duplex with analog by incubating with 1 mm of the indicated analog triphosphate for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were heat-inactivated and duplex DNA purified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column and washed in a Microcon-3 microconcentrator with six volumes of distilled H2O. To examine pol γ exonuclease activity with these analog-containing primer-templates, 0.2 pmol of32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing the designated analog at the 3′ end was incubated with 70–840 fmol of wild type pol γ, as indicated. The exonuclease activity was carried out in 33 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.5, 13 mm KCl, 1.3 mm DTT, and 3.3 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The products were separated by denaturing PAGE and visualized as described above. To determine the inhibition of pol γ exonuclease activity by AZT mono- and di- phosphate, 21 fmol of wild type pol γ was incubated with 0.5 pmol of 32P-labeled 18-mer primer in a reaction containing 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of nucleotide mono- or diphosphate, as indicated. The reaction was stopped by heat denaturation and separated on a gel as described above. We sought to identify the mechanisms by which AZT-TP, ddCTP, 3TC-TP, D4T-TP, and carbovir-TP inhibit the human DNA polymerase γ. All of these analogs lack the 3′ hydroxyl group and consequently act as chain terminators once incorporated into DNA. For comparison and reference the structures of these analogs are shown in Fig.1. We used the purified recombinant human DNA polymerase γ overproduced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. This recombinant DNA polymerase γ and an exonuclease-deficient catalytic subunit has been characterized previously in our laboratory and shown to possess polymerase properties identical to the native catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ (24Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To simplify the analysis of analog incorporation into DNA without the complication of proofreading, we generated a histidine-tagged exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase. The specific polymerase activity of both the wild type and exonuclease-deficient histidine-tagged pol γ was 32 units/ng in the poly(rA)/oligo(dT) assay (data not shown). We first addressed the inhibition and incorporation of these antiviral nucleotide analogs into DNA, and then we tested the efficiency of excising analogs from DNA by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. As a first approximation, the IC50 values for inhibiting DNA synthesis were determined with two different assays. We designed these assays to specifically measure the ability of analogs to inhibit the incorporation of the cognitive nucleotide. First, the incorporation of a single normal α-32P-labeled dNMP into an 18/36-mer primer-template was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of competing antiviral nucleotide analog. Inhibition was monitored by gel electrophoresis and quantified to determined the IC50 concentrations. Graphical results for all five analogs are shown in Fig. 2 A. These results demonstrated that both dideoxycytidine and D4T-TP had strong inhibition profiles, whereas AZT-TP, 3TC-TP, and CBV-TP showed modest inhibition. The IC50 for ddNTP and D4T-TP was 8 and 20 μm, respectively, while 3TC-TP and CBV-TP had an IC50 of 80 μm. The analog AZT-TP had an IC50 of 130 μm. The severity of inhibition is better demonstrated in the second assay, which measures multiple incorporation events. Inhibition by the thymidine analogs was determined here in our standard poly(rA)·oligo(dT) assay using 25 μm dTTP. On this substrate pol γ has a Km for ddTTP of 4.5 μm (28Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Results are shown in Fig. 2 B and demonstrate that ddTTP and D4T-TP are potent inhibitors in vitro while AZT-TP required higher levels to inhibit pol γ. Addition of AZT-TP resulted in an IC50 of ∼25 μm, which was also the concentration of normal dTTP in this assay. Dideoxythymidine triphosphate and D4T-TP showed IC50 at ∼15 and 150 nm, respectively, more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than AZT-TP. Given this relative ranking as inhibitors, we wanted to determine the mode of inhibition for each analog. We specifically wanted to determine whether chain termination was the primary mechanism of inhibition or whether inhibition of polymerase activity could occur prior to incorporation of the analog into DNA. Additionally, once incorporated into DNA how efficiently could the analogs be removed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of pol γ? To determine relative efficiencies with which these analogs could be incorporated into DNA, we performed primer extension reactions and analyzed the products by gel electrophoresis. We used the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase γ in this assay to avoid degradation of the primer by the proofreading function and to simplify interpretation of results. This strategy became imperative due to the relatively high amount of enzyme and the longer incubation times required to detect incorporation with some of these analogs. Fig.3 depicts the incorporation of dTMP, ddTMP, AZT-MP, and D4T-MP into DNA. Rate was determined as the fraction of primer extended by one nucleotide per unit time, and Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants were determined by plotting the rate as a function of nucleotide analog concentration (26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human pol γ displayed high affinity (low apparent Km) for normal nucleotides (TablesTable I, Table II, Table III), which is in agreement with other kinetic studies of pol γ (13Martin J.L. Brown C.E. Matthews-Davis N. Reardon J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2743-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Hart G.J. Orr D.C. Penn C.R. Figueiredo H.T. Gray N.M. Boehme R.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18929-18934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All the analogs could be incorporated into our DNA substrate, but different concentrations of the analog were required. The dideoxynucleotide analogs ddCTP and ddTTP were the easiest to incorporate and had kcat values similar to their normal nucleotide counterpart (Tables Table I, Table II). The apparentKm was 2–5-fold higher than the normal nucleotide. The effect of these analogs on competitive incorporation can be assessed by taking the ratio of the kinetic constants, (fin). This value is equivalent theoretically to measurements made using competing substrates. Thus, ddTTP would get incorporated one in four incorporation events if the concentration of TTP and ddTTP were equal (Table I). The apparent Kmfor D4T-TP incorporation was similar to dideoxynucleotides but had a slightly decreased kcat (Table I). These results predict D4T to be as inhibitory as the dideoxynucleotides. Thefin values for these analogs determined with pol γ followed the general trend of inhibition observed in Fig. 2. Pol γ exerted most of its discrimination through Kmeffects, whereas the kcat was only modestly reduced for most of these analogs. Incorporation of AZT-TP, 3TC-TP, and CBV-TP required much higher concentrations than ddNTP or D4T-TP. However, apparent Km values were still in the micromolar range (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III), indicating AZT, 3TC, and CBV are only moderately incorporated as compared with dideoxynucleotides and D4T. The dCTP analog, 3TC-TP, had the lowest kcat as well as a high apparent Km (Table II).Table IApparent kinetic parameters of recombinant DNA polymerase γ with thymidine analogs in 18-mer/36-mer single nucleotide extension assayNucleoside triphosphateKmkcatkcat/Kmfin1-afin = (kcat/Km(TTP))/(kcat/Km(analog)).μmmin−1min−1μm−1TTP0.0382.976ddTTP0.0601.1184AZT-TP940.560.00612,700D4T-TP0.050.651361-a fin = (kcat/Km(TTP))/(kcat/Km(analog)).

Open table in a new tab The inhibitory effect of a chain terminator is limited by its ability to persist in DNA once incorporated. The persistence of all of these analogs in DNA has largely been ignored in the literature. This concept is critical to the understanding the toxicity because, even though many of these analogs are only moderate inhibitors in vitro and are not readily incorporated, their resistance to exonucleolytic removal increases their ability to thwart DNA replication and presumably cause cytotoxicity. Since DNA polymerase γ has an intrinsic 3′-5′ exonuclease function, we investigated whether human DNA polymerase γ could remove these antiviral nucleotide analogs from DNA termini. Single-stranded DNA substrates bearing the analog at the 3′ terminus were constructed with TdT. Since TdT did not effectively add AZT-MP to the ends of DNA we used HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to insert AZT-MP onto the 3′ end of the 18/36-mer substrate. The exonuclease activity by pol γ on this dsDNA substrate was compared with the degradation of the normal 18/36-mer substrate, as well as a 19/36-mer dsDNA bearing either D4T-MP or ddTMP. At an equal molar ratio of wild type pol γ and either ssDNA or dsDNA, we observed efficient exonucleolytic removal of normal nucleotides, but very little detectable removal of the analogs with the exception of 3TC. At this stoichiometric level of polymerase and substrate, 10–20% of the 3TC was removed from the 3′ termini as compared with the control. Pol γ did not remove detectable amounts of the other analogs at these enzyme concentrations (data not shown). However, when enzyme concentrations exceeded substrate concentrations, we detected removal of the analogs from the 3′ terminus (Fig.4 A). A 1.3-fold molar excess of enzyme was only able to remove 10% or the terminally incorporated analogs for single or double-stranded substrate. The exception was 3TC, where >50% of the analog was removed in 30 min (Fig. 4 B). The remaining terminally incorporated analogs required a 3–4-fold molar excess of pol γ to remove >50% in 30 min.

In order to test this hypothesis, we cloned and purified rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, the isoforms present in liver and fat cells, expressed the isoforms as ACS-Flag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified them by Flag affinity chromatography. The Flag epitope at the C terminus did not alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Purified ACS1-, 4-, and 5-Flag isoforms differed in their apparent K m values for ATP, thermolability, pH optima, requirement for Triton X-100, and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal. The ACS inhibitor triacsin C strongly inhibited ACS1 and ACS4, but not ACS5. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin-sensitizing drugs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, strongly and specifically inhibited only ACS4, with an IC50 of less than 1.5 μm. Troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of ACS4. α-Tocopherol, whose ring structure forms the non-TZD portion of troglitazone, did not inhibit ACS4, indicating that the thiazolidine-2,4-dione moiety is the critical component for inhibition. A non-TZD PPARγ ligand, GW1929, which is 7-fold more potent than rosiglitazone, inhibited ACS1 and ACS4 poorly with an IC50 of greater than 50 μm, more than 100-fold higher than was required for rosiglitazone, thereby demonstrating the specificity of TZD inhibition. Further, the PPARα ligands, clofibrate and GW4647, and various xenobiotic carboxylic acids known to be incorporated into complex lipids had no effect on ACS1, -4, or -5. These results, together with previous data showing that triacsin C and troglitazone strongly inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis compared with other metabolic pathways, suggest that ACS1 and ACS4 catalyze the synthesis of acyl-CoAs used for triacylglycerol synthesis and that lack of inhibition of a metabolic pathway by triacsin C does not prove lack of acyl-CoA involvement. The results further suggest the possibility that the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinedione drugs might be achieved, in part, through direct interaction with ACS4 in a PPARγ-independent manner.

Pricer W.E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 204: 329-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting acyl-CoAs can be further metabolized in pathways of β-oxidation, glycerolipid synthesis, cholesteryl ester (CE) synthesis, desaturation, elongation, and protein acylation and can serve as signaling molecules (2Faergman N.J.

Later, four additional rat ACS isoforms from different genes were cloned that differed in tissue distribution of their mRNA expression and in substrate preference (11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T.

Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Fujino T. Kang M.-J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The mRNAs of ACS4 and ACS5 are highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues and in intestine, respectively, and are also present in liver (11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N.

ACS1 and ACS5 have a broad substrate specificity for saturated fatty acids of 12–18 carbon atoms and unsaturated fatty acids of 16–20 carbon atoms. In contrast, ACS4 has a marked preference for arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. The presence of three ACS isoforms in liver suggests that liver ACS activity does not change with physiological alterations (5Aas M. Daae L.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 239: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Christiansen E.N. Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 1972; 280: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) because the different ACS isoenzymes compensate for each other. All ACS isoenzymes are members of the luciferase superfamily and have a common structure that consists of an N terminus, two luciferase-like regions, a linker connecting the two luciferase-like regions, and a C terminus. A highly conserved AMP-binding site and a predicted fatty acid binding site are located in the first and the second luciferase-like regions, respectively (10Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). ACS1, ACS2, and ACS5 are structurally similar, with more than 60% amino acid identity (11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ACS3 and ACS4 form a second subgroup with ∼30% homology to ACS1 and 68% identity to each other (12Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Despite their high degree of homology, the expression of ACS1 and ACS5 mRNA is regulated independently. In liver, both ACS1 and ACS5 mRNAs are increased by high sucrose refeeding whereas high fat refeeding increases only ACS1 mRNA. ACS5 is the sole member of the ACS family whose mRNA decreases with fasting (11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells, ACS1 mRNA is detected only after adipocyte differentiation, whereas ACS5 mRNA is consistently expressed independent of differentiation status (10Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the adrenal, ACS4 expression increases with exposure to adrenocorticotropic hormone and to arachidonate (15Cho Y.-Y. Kang M.-J. Ogawa S. Yamashita Y. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These differences in regulation, tissue distribution, and substrate preference suggest that each ACS isoform might function independently in various tissues for different metabolic purposes. Use of two inhibitors of ACS has suggested the presence of different acyl-CoA pools within cells, because these inhibitors are effective in blocking only some of the metabolic pathways that require long chain acyl-CoAs. For example, in human fibroblasts, the fungal metabolite triacsin C almost completely inhibits de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol and phospholipid from glycerol, but does not prevent phospholipid synthesis via reacylation of lysophospholipids with oleate or arachidonate (16Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar results are observed in rat hepatocytes in which triacsin C blocks de novo synthesis of TAG 73%, but inhibits [14C]oleate incorporation into phospholipid and CE, or metabolism via β-oxidation only 30–40% (17Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Weidmar P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, triacsin D inhibits oleate-induced TAG synthesis 80% without affecting CE synthesis (18Wu X. Shang A. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1198-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in rat primary hepatocytes, troglitazone at 100 μm inhibits [14C]oleate incorporation into TAG and oxidation products 50% and 20%, respectively, whereas incorporation into phospholipid remains unaffected (19Fulgencio J.P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfo-conjugate of troglitazone appeared to be the likely inhibitory metabolite (19Fulgencio J.P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differing effects of ACS inhibitors on metabolic end products of acyl-CoA-dependent pathways suggest the presence of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant ACSs that are linked to specific pathways. If so, ACS isoforms might play a critical role in partitioning acyl-CoAs toward lipid synthesis versusoxidation. In order to determine whether this hypothesis was correct, we needed to examine the effects of the ACS inhibitors on each of the three ACS isoforms expressed in liver and fat cells. To do this, we expressed ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 as recombinant ACS-Flag fusion proteins, and purified each ACS by Flag antibody column chromatography. RT-for-PCR kit and Advantage 2 PCR kit were purchased from CLONTECH. Bacterial Flag expression kit including pFlag-CTC vector, Flag M2 affinity column, and Flag peptides, aminophenylboronate, phenylglyoxal,N-ethylmaleimide, coenzyme A, ATP, palmitate, xenobiotic carboxylic acids, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. HMS174(DE3) and pET21a(+) expression vector were from Novagen. [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Triacsin C was from Biomol. The thiazolidinediones, GW1929 and GW4647 were a gift from Dr. Steven Jacobs, GlaxoSmithKline. cDNA was synthesized from rat liver total RNA and used as a template for amplification of the ACS open reading frames (CLONTECH, RT-for-PCR kit). The primers for amplification of ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 were designed to include the entire open reading frames based on nucleotide sequences obtained from the GenBank™ data base (accession nos. D90109, D85189, and AB012933for ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, respectively) and specific restriction sites. The upper primer for ACS1 was 5′-ACAGACTCGAGGAGGTCCATGAATTGTTCCGTA-3′ (recognition site indicated in boldface type) and the lower primer was 5′-CCTCGGTACCAATCTTGATGGTGGAGTACAG-3′. The upper and lower primers for ACS4 were 5′-AAAAGCTTGCAAAGAGAATAAAGGCTAAGC-3′ and 5′-TTGCGTCGACTTTGCCCCCATACATC-3′. The upper and lower primers for ACS5 were 5′-TATTCCTCGAGCTTTTTATTTTTAACTTCTTGTTTTC-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTACCCTCTTCGATGCTCATAGAG-3′. ACS amplification was performed by PCR with the designed primers and Advantage®2 PCR kit (CLONTECH). The amplified ACS1 PCR product was digested with XhoI and Acc65I and ligated into pFlag-CTC vector (Sigma) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ACS4 PCR product and the pFlag-CTC vector were digested with HindIII and SalI and then ligated. To obtain ACS4 without the Flag sequence, a primer was designed by adding a stop codon in the position just before the Flag sequence. The upper primer used was the same as for ACS4-Flag fusion protein, and the newly designed lower primer was 5′-ACAGTGTCGACTTATTTGCCCCCATACAT-3′ (stop codon is underlined). The pFlag-ACS plasmid constructs contain a tacpromoter, a ribosome binding site, the entire coding region of each ACS isoforms, and C-terminal Flag sequences with pBR322 origin. For ACS5, the pET-Flag vector was used. The plasmid pET-Flag was constructed by cloning the SphI (Klenow-filled)-NheI fragment from pET-21a(+) (Novagen) into pFlag-CTC (Sigma) digested withBamHI, treated with Klenow, and then digested withNheI. In the pET-Flag vector, the tac promoter region in pFlag-CTC was replaced with the T7 promoter region from pET21a(+) (Novagen). ACS5 PCR products and pET-Flag vector were digested with XhoI and Acc65I and then ligated. The sequences of ACS-Flag fusion constructs were verified by the University of North Carolina Automated Sequencing Facility. Recombinant ACS1-Flag, ACS4-Flag, and ACS4 were expressed in E. coli JM109 after induction with 1 mm IPTG at an A 600 of 1.0. JM109 was grown in Terrific Broth (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with ampicillin (60 μg/ml) at 30 °C and shaken at 250 rpm. After a 12-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall HS-4 rotor. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA (TE) buffer. The resuspended cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice and then sonicated with six 10-s bursts, each followed by a 10-s rest on ice. Cellular debris was removed from the cell lysates by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. Part of the supernatant was saved (cell extract), and the remainder was layered over a 2-ml cushion of 55% (w/w) sucrose topped with 0.5 ml of 5% (w/w) sucrose in TE buffer. After centrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 3 h, the supernatant was removed (soluble fraction). The membrane band at the interface was collected with a 19-gauge needle and syringe. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. ACS1-Flag and ACS4-Flag were purified by Flag M2 column chromatography. The Flag M2 antibody affinity matrix (1 ml) (Sigma) was activated with 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.5), 50 mmTris (pH 7.4), and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) buffer. JM109 membrane fractions containing overexpressed ACS1-Flag or ACS4-Flag were solubilized in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and passed over the column four times. The column was washed three times with 12 ml of TBS (pH 7.4), and then eluted with five 1-ml aliquots of 100 μg/ml Flag peptide (Sigma) dissolved in TBS buffer (pH 7.4). Eluates were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS and stained with Gel Code® blue stain reagent (Pierce). ACS4 and ACS1 were purified to near homogeneity and migrated as single bands. Compared with the cell extracts the activities of purified proteins increased 19-fold for ACS1 and 10-fold for ACS4. Unlike ACS1- or ACS4-Flag, ACS5-Flag protein could not be expressed under the tac promoter in JM109 or DH5α. To express ACS5-Flag, we used the pET-Flag vector because the T7 promoter regulates the expression of foreign proteins more tightly than does thetac promoter. Overexpressed ACS5-Flag was present in the membrane fraction of HMS174(DE3). ACS5-Flag was maximally expressed at 30 °C after a 12-h induction with 1 mm IPTG beginning at an A 600 of 0.4 in HMS174(DE3), which provides the T7 polymerase. Purification of active ACS5-Flag was similar to that described for ACS1 and ACS4, except that 0.1% Triton X-100 was required in the elution buffer that contained 100 μg/ml Flag peptide. When Triton X-100 was omitted, only inactive ACS was eluted. ACS5-Flag migrated as a single band on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS and stained with Gel Code® blue stain reagent. Compared with the cell extracts, the activities of purified proteins increased 29-fold for ACS5. The purification yield was relatively low because excess protein applied to the column was eluted in the flow-through fraction and during the washing procedure. The ACS assay contained 50 μm [3H]palmitate in Triton X-100, 1 μm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, 250 μm CoA, 175 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in a total of 200 μl (20Banis R.J. Roberts C.S. Stokes G.B. Tove S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1161-1171Google Scholar). The maximum concentration of Triton X-100 in the assay was 0.03% (0.5 mm). All comparisons of the recombinant ACS isoenzymes employed identical concentrations of substrates and Triton X-100. The reaction was initiated with 0.1 μg of protein for ACS1 and ACS4, and 0.5–1.0 μg of protein for ACS5. ACS activity was measured after a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, except for the inhibition kinetic studies, which were only incubated for 1 min (20Banis R.J. Roberts C.S. Stokes G.B. Tove S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations and time allowed measurement of initial rates. The specific activities of recombinant ACS1-, ACS4-, and ACS5-Flag proteins from different preparations were in the ranges of 939–1472, 1670–2200, and 98–166 nmol/min/mg, respectively. All the experiments were repeated three times, and virtually identical results were obtained from each experiment. Recombinant rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 had previously been purified by column chromatography (10Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To obtain purified ACS isoenzymes more efficiently, we designed plasmid constructs to produce ACS proteins with Flag epitopes at their C termini. After induction with IPTG, 10% of the ACS activity was found in the soluble fraction. This soluble activity is surprising because ACS4 is an integral membrane protein, which remains associated with rat liver microsomes after washing with 0.5 m KCl (data not shown). Nevertheless, soluble ACS4 (21%) was also obtained when ACS4 was overexpressed in DH5α (12Kang M.-J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ACS1- and ACS5-Flag were also overexpressed and identified in the membrane fraction. Recombinant ACSs were purified to near homogeneity by one-step Flag-antibody affinity chromatography. To ensure that the Flag epitope did not alter ACS function, we compared ACS activity in membrane fractions from JM109 that overexpressed ACS4 or ACS4-Flag. The kinetic constants for palmitic acid, CoA, and ATP were virtually identical, and the sensitivity to heating at 43 °C was similar, indicating that the Flag epitope at the C terminus does not alter the catalytic properties of ACS and supports the use of ACS-Flag recombinant proteins for comparative study (data not shown). To compare the purified ACS isoenzymes, we studied the kinetics of the three substrates required for ACS catalysis. The three ACS isoenzymes had similar apparent K m values for CoA between 2.4 and 6.4 μm and for palmitic acid between 5.0 and 8.6 μm (Table I). ACS4, on the other hand, had an apparent K m value for ATP that was almost 20-fold lower than that of ACS1 or ACS5 (34 μm versus 649 and 666 μm). To test sensitivity to heating, ACS isoenzyme activities were measured after heating at 43 °C for various times (Fig. 1). ACS1 was most stable to heat with a half-life of about 10 min whereas ACS4 had a t ½ shorter than 2 min, and ACS5 had a t ½ of ∼4 min. To find the optimum pH for each ACS isoenzyme, MES was used as a buffer for ACS reaction in the range of pH 6–7, Tris for pH 7–9, and glycine for pH 9 and 9.5. ACS1 and ACS4 had broad pH optima between pH 7.4 and 9.0, but the optima for ACS5 was more narrow (pH 7.4–8.0) (data not shown). The three purified ACS isoenzymes were differently affected by Triton X-100 (Fig. 2). ACS4 gradually lost activity at Triton X-100 concentrations above 0.5 mm, the concentration normally used for assay, whereas ACS1 maintained maximal activity up to 1.5 mm Triton X-100. In contrast, ACS5 activity dramatically increased at Triton X-100 concentrations above 0.5 mm, and maintained maximal activity at 3 mm. ACS5 remained highly active even at 10 mmTriton X-100 (data not shown).Table IKinetic constants for ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5SubstrateACS1ACS4ACS5ATPK m (μm)64934666V max (nmol/min/mg protein)10121050287CoAK m (μm)6.44.12.4V max(nmol/min/mg protein)1072209275PalmitateK m (μm)5.05.48.6V max (nmol/min/mg protein)16952800130Recombinant, purified enzymes were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Substrate concentrations for these studies were held to between 0.3 and 2.0 times theK m value (30Segel I.H.

Triacsin C, an alkenyl-N-hydroxytriazene fungal metabolite, was reported to be a potent competitive inhibitor of ACS (22Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Cyong J.C. Omura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4214-4219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, and rat hepatocytes, however, suggest that triacsin C does not equally inhibit all the pathways in which acyl-CoAs are used. To test the effects of triacsin C on the purified ACS isoenzymes, triacsin C was added directly to the reaction mixture (Fig. 3). Triacsin C selectively and strongly inhibited ACS1 and ACS4 in a dose-dependent manner, but had little effect on ACS5. The IC50 for ACS1 and ACS4 was 4–6 μm. Thiazolidinediones are oral antidiabetic drugs, generally believed to act as insulin sensitizers through activation of PPARγ (24Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M.

Because the sulfo-conjugate of troglitazone was reported to directly inhibit ACS activity in both microsomes and mitochondria from rat liver (19Fulgencio J.P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested purified recombinant ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 to determine which isoform was inhibited by thiazolidinediones. Troglitazone at 1 μm decreased ACS4 activity 50%; with 10 μm troglitazone, the activity was almost completely blocked (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, ACS1 and ACS5 activities were unaffected by troglitazone at 10 μm. Because troglitazone contains the ring structure of α-tocopherol linked to the thiazolidinedione moiety, we determined which part of the molecule was critical for inhibition by testing the effect of α-tocopherol itself and of other thiazolidinediones on each of the purified ACS isoenzymes. α-Tocopherol had little effect on three ACS isoforms (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, which contain the common thiazolidinedione group but lack the α-tocopherol moiety, showed virtually the same effect as troglitazone on the thr"

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/microtubule-associated protein kinase, which promotes cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation is found in the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm. Recently, it has been shown that nuclear translocation of ERK is required for transcriptional changes and cell proliferation. However, the cellular consequences, of cytoplasmic signaling have not been defined. We explored whether cytoplasmic, specifically membrane-proximal, ERK signaling is involved in growth factor-induced cell motility. We previously have demonstrated that increased M-calpain activity downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated ERK activation is necessary for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced motility. Calpain isoforms also have been found in nuclear, cytosolic, and plasma membrane-associated compartments in a variety of cell types. We now employ cell engineering approaches to control localization of the upstream EGFR and ERK activities to examine the spatial effect of upstream signal locale on downstream calpain activity. With differential ligand-induced internalization and trafficking-restricted receptor variants, we find that calpain activity is triggered only by plasma membrane-restricted activated EGFR, not by internalized (although still active) EGFR. Cells transfected with membrane-targeted ERK1 and ERK2, which sequester endogenous ERKs, exhibited normal EGF-induced calpain activity. Transfection of an inactive ERK phosphatase (MKP-3/Pyst1) that sequesters ERK in the cytoplasm prevented calpain activation as well as de-adhesion. These data strongly suggest that EGF-induced calpain activity can be enhanced near sites of membrane-proximal EGFR-mediated ERK signaling, providing insights about how calpain activity might be regulated and targeted to enhance its effects on adhesion-related substrates.

Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). A change in cell motility is just one of the many pleiotropic effects of signaling mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),1 and it has been suggested that such specific cellular responses are determined by the spatial targeting of downstream signaling events. This simple concept is complicated by the fact that EGFR-mediated cell motility requires signaling through the ubiquitous intracellular effector, ERK (4Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Science. 1998; 111: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar), which is present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Furthermore, our previous studies have demonstrated that ERK activates the ubiquitously distributed intracellular neutral protease calpain to affect de-adhesion during epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell motility (5Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Shiraha H. Gupta K. Glading A. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 146: 243-253Crossref Google Scholar). This alteration in adhesiveness is coincident with EGFR-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (4Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Science. 1998; 111: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the target of calpain is a component of the adhesion plaque. In support of this, calpain has been shown to cleave many adhesion plaque proteins, such as talin, ezrin, pp125FAK, and the cytoplasmic tail of β1 and β3integrins (7Cooray P. Yuan Y.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13223-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and is involved in other responses such as proliferation and apoptosis (15Santella L. Kyozuka K. Riso L.D. Carafoli E.

This is best documented in erythrocytes, in which calpain translocates to the membrane from the cytosol and complexes with a number of cytoskeletal proteins when activated by ionophore or thrombin (20Ariyoshi H. Shiba E. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Yoshida K. Kawashima S. Mori T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar, 21Michetti M. Salamino F. Tedesco I. Averna M. Minafra R. Melloni E.

Commun. 1985; 128: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these studies investigated a nonmotile cell type and focused on the predominant isoform in erythrocytes, μ-calpain (calpain-I). In nucleated, adherent cells, this isoform has been reported to translocate to the membrane upon injury, whereas the isoform critical for EGF-induced motility (5Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), M-calpain (calpain-II), remains cytoplasmic (24Zhao X. Posmantur R. Kampfl A. Liu S. Wang K. Newcomb J. Pike B. Clifton G. Hayes R. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Direct action on adhesion sites is supported by findings in BS-C-1 epithelial cells that M-calpain co-localized with talin in the periplasma membrane space as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence (25Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, these findings have been disputed in recent publications, which have not found either calpain isoform in focal adhesions, even in the face of μ-calpain overexpression (26Kulkarni S. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21265-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,27Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S. Du X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These diverse findings may result from the fact that calpain can perform diverse functions and that most studies of calpain localization are directed solely to identify the distribution of the protein and not the distribution of its activity. However, for an enzyme distributed at high levels throughout the cellular space, one mode of determining selective cellular outcome might be to activate only preresident calpain in a spatially restricted locale. Recent advances in cell and molecular engineering now enable us to localize the upstream activators of M-calpain and thus begin to define the active subcellular compartments. Thus, localizing the subcellular locale of calpain activation by ERK would provide insight into how a cell selects from among multiple possible responses to a pleiotropic signal and suggest physiological targets to probe. Binding of ligand to the EGFR leads to activation of M-calpain subsequent to ERK/MAP kinase signaling (5Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This allows us to exploit the ability to produce differential EGFR signaling between internalized and cell surface EGFR. Upon ligand binding, EGFR is internalized into an early endosomal compartment before being either degraded or recycled to the cell surface. Two EGFR ligands differentially segregate in the acidic pH of the endosome; EGF remains bound to the receptor, whereas transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) dissociates. Consequently, EGFR retains activity in the early endosome when bound by EGF but not by TGF-α (28Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This has profound effects on downstream signaling, since from the endosome, EGFR is able to activate Ras (29Haugh J.M. Huang A.C. Wiley H.S. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34350-34360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but not phospholipase C-γ (28Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both signaling pathways are triggered by cell surface-localized EGFR. However, since M-calpain is activated by ERK signaling, which is three steps downstream from Ras, it is quite possible for actual localization to be different between the EGFR signal, ERK activation, and subsequent calpain functioning. Furthermore, while Ras is membrane-localized due to farnesylation and thus one might favor a membrane location of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling complex, Ras can be fully activated both from plasma membrane EGFR and endosomal EGFR (29Haugh J.M. Huang A.C. Wiley H.S. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34350-34360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Obviously, the accessibility of focal adhesion components would differ greatly from these two sites. Two recent molecular constructs can localize ERK signaling to permit a cell engineering approach to control localization. ERK chimeras that express the Ras farnesylation sequence at their C terminus (ERK1-CAAX and ERK2-CAAX) and are membrane-bound sequester endogenous ERK at the plasma membrane (1Hochholdinger F. Baier G. Nogalo A. Bauer B. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8052-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and provide for plasma membrane-localized signaling. A catalytically inactive cytoplasmic MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP-3/Pyst1, which binds and sequesters ERK in the cytoplasm, but does not affect its activity (2Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 30Groom L. Sneddon A. Alessi D. Dowd S. Keyse S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), provides for cytosolic ERK signaling. Using a combination of these cell and molecular engineering approaches, we have found the site of ERK-mediated calpain activation to be localized at the plasma membrane, and this localization is required for EGF-induced de-adhesion. This constraint supports a model that emphasizes calpain activity targeting focal adhesion components during cell motility and provides insight into how ERK signaling might differentially induce specific cellular responses.

Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), were cultured using minimum essential medium (MEM)-α, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin, streptomycin, and G418 (350 μg/ml) as the growth medium. Cells were quiesced at subconfluence using restricted serum conditions without G418 (MEM-α, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin) for 18–24 h prior to experiments. Briefly, MAP2 was labeled with DTAF by incubation of MAP2 and DTAF in pH 8.5 PIPES buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled MAP2 was then isolated by size exclusion column chromatography and dialyzed against pH 7.5 HEPES buffer overnight. Cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plates and quiesced for 24 h. After 1 min of treatment with EGF (10 nm), cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 nm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). After removing the cell debris by centrifugation, 0.9 μg of DTAF-labeled MAP2 was added to the samples with either 0 or 0.1 mm free Ca2+ concentration. Fluorescence was immediately measured by an Aminco-Bowman Series II spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY), at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm respectively, for 3 min at room temperature (5Glading A.

Internalization of the EGFR can be induced by treatment with ligand, with a maximum level of internalized receptor peaking at 20 min of treatment. Since we have found that calpain activity peaks at 5 min treatment with EGF and declines below base line by 30 min (Fig.1 B), the MEK inhibitor PD098059 was used during the first 20 min incubation to prevent a loss of calpain activity during the internalization process. PD098059 prevents calpain activation by ERK but does not have any direct effect on calpain. NR6 fibroblasts containing high levels of wild type EGFR were treated with 20 nm EGF or TGF-α in the presence of 2 μm PD098059 for 20 min. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold WHIPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidine, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 2 min in an ice-cold acid wash (50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidine, pH 3.0). This stripped any remaining ligand from the EGFR on the cell surface (34Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed again with ice cold WHIPS buffer and then reincubated with or without 20 nm TGF-α in binding buffer for 5 min. The cells were then either lysed for Western blotting of active ERK or loaded with 10 μm Boc-LM-CMAC and used for the following calpain activity assay. NR6 WT cells plated on glass coverslips were loaded for 20 min at 37 °C with 10 μmBoc-LM-CMAC, a synthetic calpain substrate (5Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). After loading, the cells were treated with growth factor for 5 min and then mounted on glass slides, and images of the Boc-LM-CMAC fluorescence were obtained. The substrate is designed so that fluorescent quenching is removed upon calpain cleavage, resulting in an increase in fluorescence. Images were then false colored to grayscale; increased lightness correlates with increased calpain activity. Cells were electroporated to express the various ERK and MKP-3/Pyst1 constructs in the presence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to mark expressing cells following standard protocols. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in electroporation cuvettes, and the appropriate plasmid DNA was added to a total of 20–40 μg. pEGFP plasmid was co-transfected at a 0.1 molar ratio. The cells were electroporated at 0.220 V and 960 microfarads for 5 s. The cells were then replated and allowed to grow for 48 h before use in experiments, with one change of medium. To ensure that the constructs functioned as previously demonstrated (1Hochholdinger F. Baier G. Nogalo A. Bauer B. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8052-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,30Groom L. Sneddon A. Alessi D. Dowd S. Keyse S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), indirect immunofluorescence was utilized to identify the distribution of active ERK (phosphorylated ERK) in transfected cells. Cells were transfected as above and plated on glass coverslips. The cells were treated 48 h after transfection in the presence and absence of 10 nm EGF for 10 min. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. at room temperature and then washed with PBS four times. To remove cell cytosolic contents but retain membrane and cytoskeleton associated molecules, some of the coverslips were exposed to 8 μm digitonin plus 100 μm MgCl and 200 μm ATP for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Control coverslips were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, which enables antibody access to intracellular targets without removal of cytosolic macromolecules. To visualize the activated ERK, primary antibody (anti-phospho-ERK, clone E10) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (1:400) was applied to the coverslips, which were then incubated in a humidified chamber for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and secondary antibody (Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse) diluted in 1% BSA (1:1000) was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were observed for Alexa 594 fluorescence using an Olympus BX40 microscope (× 40 magnification), and images were captured using a SPOT CCD camera. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression. Indirect immunofluorescence of phospho-p90RSK was performed on mock (GFP only)- and MKP-3/Pyst1-transfected cells. Cells were fixed and treated as above, using Triton X-100 to permeabilize the cells for staining. Primary antibody (anti-phospho-p90RSK, Thr360/Ser364) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (1:1000) was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice, and secondary antibody (Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit, 1:1000) was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were observed for fluorescence as above. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression. Cell-substratum adhesiveness was quantitated using an inverted centrifugation detachment assay. Transfected cells were plated on 16-well glass slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated with and without 10 nm EGF in the culture medium for 10 min. The plastic well walls were then removed, and the remaining well divisions were filled with PBS. Coverslips were then applied and sealed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sealing tape (Corning, Cambridge, MA). The slides were then centrifuged inverted for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 37 °C using a Beckman CS6R plate centrifuge; 3000 rpm (1643 ×g) was chosen empirically as the force required to detach approximately half of the EGF-treated cells. Before and after the centrifugation, the number of GFP-expressing cells in each well was counted by fluorescent microscopy. NR6 fibroblasts expressing both WT and internalization-deficient (c′973) EGFR were used in the Boc-LM-CMAC calpain activity assay. c′973 NR6 cells exhibited calpain activity equivalent to that seen in WT cells (Fig.2). This indicated that internalization of the EGFR was not required for EGFR-mediated calpain activity. Previous studies had shown that both internalized and cell surface EGFR signaled Ras activation (29Haugh J.M. Huang A.C. Wiley H.S. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34350-34360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the activation of downstream molecules, such as ERK, was not shown. That elements downstream from Ras would be activated was not assumed, since EGFR phosphorylates phospholipase C-γ from the endosome but this fails to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (28Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To address this, we determined whether ERK was activated under conditions that produced differential external and internal signaling (Fig.1 A). ERK was phosphorylated by both internal and external active EGFR (Fig. 3). Thus, there are a number of ways in which ERK activation can be linked to the activation of calpain. First, ERK may activate calpain globally within the cell. Second, ERK may translocate to a specific location within the cell to target calpain activation. Third, upstream components of the MAP kinase pathways such as Raf or MEK may translocate to the site of ERK/calpain activation. Finally, only one site of ERK activation may be relevant for activation of M-calpain. We applied cellular engineering first to sort through the possibilities. If we spatially isolated EGFR activation, we could determine the likelihood of various translocations of ERK or its upstream mediators to sites of calpain action. Therefore, we asked whether internal EGFR could activate calpain. NR6 WT cells were treated with either TGF-α or EGF (20 nm) for 20 min to drive internalization of the receptor. Under normal experimental conditions, EGFR-mediated calpain activity peaks at 5 min of stimulation with EGF and is greatly reduced at 20 min (Fig. 1 B) probably due to autoproteolysis. In order to observe calpain activity after internalization of the EGFR, the MEK inhibitor PD098059 was added during the first 20 min of incubation. After internalization, any remaining ligand was removed by a mild acid strip (34Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were then treated with or without TGF-α for an additional 5 min. Control experiments demonstrated that the washing procedure removed the PD098059 and allowed full EGFR activation of ERK as determined by phospho-ERK detection (data not shown). Under these conditions, calpain activity using the Boc-LM-CMAC substrate was assessed (Fig. 4). The presence of external signaling only (TGF-α, strip, TGF-α) induced calpain activity as robustly as internal and external signaling. Internal signaling only did not result in calpain activity, although ERK was phosphorylated equivalently to external only (Fig. 3) and Ras is strongly activated under these conditions (29Haugh J.M. Huang A.C. Wiley H.S. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34350-34360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of ERK following internal signaling does not lead to activation of calpain. This strongly suggests that the subcellular localization of ERK may be a critical determinant in regulating the activity of calpain. Having rapidly determined that ERK localized to the plasma membrane is probably responsible for calpain activation, molecularly engineered ERK chimeras expressing the Ha-Ras farnesylation sequence were transfected into NR6 WT cells. Control nonlocalizing chimeras that have a nonfunctional farnesylation sequence (SAAX) were also transfected. Both ERK1-CAAX and ERK2-CAAX chimeras sequester endogenous ERK at the plasma membrane (1Hochholdinger F. Baier G. Nogalo A. Bauer B. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8052-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrate that transfection of both ERK chimeras induces localization of active ERK at the plasma membrane, which is retained even in the face of digitonin treatment, which causes loss of cytoplasmic contents. Nonlocalizing chimeras did not have the ability to localize active ERK to the membrane or retain it upon digitonin treatment (Fig. 5 A). Cells expressing the CAAX chimeras exhibited EGF-induced calpain activity at the same level as mock-transfected cells (Fig.6). In addition, expression of both ERK1 and ERK2 chimeras together to localize all ERK signaling to the plasma membrane did not diminish EGF-induced calpain activity. These findings strongly supported the contention that membrane-localized ERK can activate calpain.Figure 6Membrane-anchored ERKs activate calpain in response to EGF stimulation. Cells were both singly and doubly transfected with ERK-CAAX chimeras (membrane-bound) and loaded with the calpain substrate Boc-LM-CMAC. The cells were then treated with or without EGF for 5 min, and images were taken. The arrowsindicate transfected cells as observed by co-transfection of GFP. Farnesylation-negative ERK-SAAX chimeras were also transfected into cells and also exhibited EGF-induced calpain activity (data not shown). Shown is a representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The counterpoint to the foregoing is whether non-plasma membrane-associated ERK also can activate calpain, providing for a model of global calpain activation. An inactive form of MAPK phosphatase, MKP-3/Pyst1, binds endogenous ERK and retains it in its cytosolic location (30Groom L. Sneddon A. Alessi D. Dowd S. Keyse S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Control experiments show that, in cells expressing MKP-3/Pyst1, phosphorylated ERK is localized in the cytosol and that phosphorylated ERK is lost with the cytosolic contents upon digitonin treatment (Fig. 5 A). Importantly, MKP-3/Pyst1 does not interfere with the ability of ERK to phosphorylate its cytoplasmic targets. To verify that MKP-3/Pyst1-bound ERK was still functional in our system, we used immunofluorescence to stain for phosphorylated p90RSK, a cytoplasmic target of ERK phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation (2Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Phospho-p90RSKwas observed in mock-transfected cells as well as MKP-3/Pyst1-transfected cells, treated with EGF (Fig. 5 B). Expression of MKP-3/Pyst1 in NR6 WT cells inhibited EGF-induced calpain activity compared with mock-transfected cells, using the Boc-LM-CMAC assay (Fig. 7). A conundrum is presented by the clear inhibition of calpain activation by the inactive MKP-3/Pyst1 construct. The construct has been reported to be capable of phosphorylating a membrane-anchored target (2Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and thus one might expect membrane-associated M-calpain to be accessible. While lacking a demonstrated explanation, numerous possibilities render this deficit less than disconcerting; threshold considerations, steric accessibility, and inability to attain a protein-protein interaction in addition to merely phosphorylating all have precedents. Despite these limitations, these results, combined with our observation that ERK activation mediated by internal signaling does not lead to calpain activation strongly suggest that a plasma membrane-associated signaling complex that includes activated ERK is required. Previously, we demonstrated that calpain is required for EGF-induced de-adhesion during active motility (5Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Shiraha H. Gupta K. Glading A. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 146: 243-253Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, we queried EGF-induced de-adhesion in cells expressing either both ERK1 and ERK2 chimeras or the MKP-3/Pyst1 construct. Cells expressing either the CAAX (membrane-localizing) ERK chimeras or the control (nonlocalizing) SAAX chimeras displayed EGF-induced de-adhesion indistinguishable from mock-transfected cells (GFP only). Therefore, localization of ERK to the plasma membrane was permissive for normal EGF-induced de-adhesion. However, MKP-3/Pyst1 transfected cells displayed reduced de-adhesion in the presence of EGF (Fig.8). This indicates that cytoplasmic active ERK is not sufficient for EGF-induced de-adhesion. These data provide a clearer picture of EGF-mediated calpain activation through ERK, in that ERK and EGF activities are required at the plasma membrane for calpain activity and for EGF-induced de-adhesion. This strongly suggests that calpain's role in EGF-induced motility is to facilitate adhesion turnover, and its action occurs at the plasma membrane. Herein we provide evidence that EGF-induced calpain activity begins at the plasma membrane. Both EGFR and ERK must be present and active at the plasma membrane in order for EGF-induced calpain activity to be stimulated. Plasma membrane-localized EGFR drove calpain activity, whereas internalized EGFR, although able to activate ERK, did not activate calpain, suggesting that ERK needed to be at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, active ERK confined to the cytoplasm was not able to activate calpain, but membrane-tethered ERK was. Finally, EGF-induced de-adhesion, which is required for induced cell migration (36Wells A. Gupta K. Chang P. Swindle S. Glading A. Shiraha H. Microsc. Res. Technique. 1998; 43: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was inhibited by restricting ERK to the cytoplasm but not by restricting ERK to the plasma membrane. This suggests a model whereby EGF signaling at the plasma membrane drives the activation of M-calpain, which in turn cleaves focal adhesion proteins and mediates de-adhesion. One caveat in this model is that we were unable to directly visualize M-calpain activation. Using immunofluorescence and GFP-tagged constructs, we found that M-calpain has a pancellular distribution as previously reported (37Hamakubo T. Kannagi R. Murachi T. Matus A. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kitahara A. Ohtsuki H. Kirahata Y. Yamagata Y. Takano E. Kanagi R. Murachi T.

Metab. 1986; 63: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 40Yoshimura N. Hatanaka M. Kitahara A. Kawaguchi N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9847-9852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which does not change appreciably with EGF exposure (data not shown). We did see some punctate aggregates of GFP-tagged calpain in the overlay of a pancellular distribution that may reflect the reported localization of calpain with focal adhesions (25Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Visualization of calpain activity using the Boc-LM-CMAC fluorescent substrate has also proved challenging even with rapid analyses that allow for detection of calcium transients, since the substrate appears to not be restricted spatially before or after cleavage. Despite these limitations, the data provide a model in which ERK activation of calpain is segregated by subcytoplasmic locale to dictate a specific outcome of cell signaling. The ability to spatially localize specific signals broadens the range of cell responses from any one pleiotropic signaling element. ERK has two isoforms that are present throughout the cytoplasm and shuttle into the nucleus when activated. While it has been experimentally demonstrated only recently that nuclear localization of ERK is required for transcriptional changes and proliferation as predicted (1Hochholdinger F. Baier G. Nogalo A. Bauer B. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8052-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), the role of ERK in other cellular locales has not been elucidated. Herein, we have shown that ERK attains a plasma membrane-proximal locale to activate calpain and contribute to growth factor-induced de-adhesion and cell motility. Since both ERK and calpain have been implicated in the competing cell responses of locomotion and proliferation (1Hochholdinger F. Baier G. Nogalo A. Bauer B. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8052-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), the spatial segregation allows EGFR signaling to discriminate between these biological outcomes. Furthermore, the requirement for ERK to be active at the inner face of the plasma membrane, the locale of many putative targets, suggests that ERK and calpain may co-localize. This would suggest that ERK may directly activate M-calpain; in support of this, we have early preliminary data that suggest that direct phosphorylation of M-calpain by active ERK increases proteolytic activity. Thus, the operative element of EGFR-mediated de-adhesion may occur through a tightly spatially segregated multimeric complex. Calpain also is involved in multiple cellular responses; the presence of two ubiquitous calpain isoforms suggests in itself that there may be many different roles for these proteins. Our studies have found that M-calpain (calpain-II) is preferentially activated by EGF stimulation and that it serves to regulate de-adhesive processes during motility. μ-Calpain (calpain-I) has been suggested to be active in integrin-mediated motility and also in cell spreading and lammelipodial formation (10Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 42Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P.

Our current findings do not exclude this role for μ-calpain but suggest that M- and μ-calpain may play complementary roles in the motile cell. Differential activation and localization of not only protein, but activity, would therefore serve to regulate the adhesive and de-adhesive properties of the cell. μ-Calpain, which has a much lower calcium requirement in vitro, could be activated by integrin receptors forming adhesions at the leading edge or by stretch-activated calcium receptors (43Lee J. Ishihara A. Oxford G. Johnson B. Jacobson K. Nature. 1999; 400: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which can provide adequate local increases in calcium concentration. M-calpain, on the other hand, which has a millimolar requirement for calcium in vitro, would then be activated by ERK at sites of focal adhesion. The concerted action of these two proteases would present a mechanism by which the highly regulated motility machinery could be fine tuned during haptokinesis and chemokinesis.

Although not lethal, deletion ofisa1 and isa2 results in retarded growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, accumulation of iron in mitochondria, and a drastic decrease in the activities of both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S enzymes. The same phenotypes were observed with mutatedisa genes in which each of the 3 cysteines, conserved among IscA-like proteins from bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals, has been changed to serine residues. These results have suggested that these cysteines constitute an iron binding motif and that IscA proteins participate in Fe-S cluster assembly through the binding of an intermediate Fe-S cluster that is subsequently transferred to target polypeptides.The experiments reported here indeed show that recombinant IscA isolated from E. coli is able to assemble unstable iron-sulfur centers that lose iron and sulfide during prolonged exposure to air. Although the protein did not contain any iron or sulfide after purification it is able to bind iron and sulfide under anaerobic conditions in vitro. Light absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that IscA could assemble a [2Fe-2S] cluster per protein, consistent with the observation that the IscA polypeptide could not bind more than two iron and two sulfur equivalents. The resonance Raman spectrum of holoIscA is indicative of a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster. The observed frequencies of the Agt and B3ut modes of the cluster at 287 and 333 cm−1, respectively, predominantly Fe-S(Cys) stretching modes, all fall within the range of those observed for naturally occurring clusters with complete cysteine ligation (280–290 and 325–340 cm−1, respectively) (27Spiro T.G. Czernuszewicz R.S. Han S. Spiro T.G. Resonance Raman Spectra of Heme and Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 523-554Google Scholar, 28Spiro T.G. Czernuszewicz R.S. Que Jr., L.

Commun. 1984; 119: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the IscA sequence displays only 3 cysteines that are all fully conserved within the IscA family and are thus likely to be ligands to the cluster. Ligation by only 3 cysteines and one non-cysteinyl ligand is not inconsistent with the resonance Raman spectrum and might be the cause of the lability of the cluster. More experiments are needed to characterize the iron coordination chemistry in IscA. Nevertheless, the observed instability of the Fe-S cluster bound to IscA is consistent with IscA serving as a site for synthesis of intermediate Fe-S species, which would then be transferred to acceptor polypeptides as previously suggested (see above).This hypothesis is supported by the finding that holoIscA specifically forms a tight 1:1 complex with ferredoxin, the product of thefdx gene present in the isc operon, as shown by the ability of an IscA column to extract Fdx exclusively from E. coli extracts expressing the whole operon. Several observations suggest that the IscA-Fdx complex has a functional relevance. First, formation of the complex absolutely depends on the presence of an Fe-S cluster in IscA raising the question of the contribution of the cluster itself to the IscA-Fdx association. Second, holoFdx can be formedin vitro by transfer of iron and sulfide from holoIscA to the apoFdx polypeptide. The fact that apoIscA and holoFdx, the products of the transfer reaction, do not form a complex anymore opens the interesting possibility that one molecule of IscA might contribute to the formation of several molecules of holoFdx. The catalytic role of IscA in formation of holoFdx is striking because almost no reaction occurs when apoFdx is incubated with free iron and sulfide in the absence of IscA. More experiments are required to understand this fascinating cluster transfer at the molecular and structural level. In particular, whether the transfer concerns the Fe2S2 core or instead involves degradation and reassembling of the binuclear entity into the apopolypeptide target is an interesting question that remains to be studied. The fact that no holoFdx could be formed in the presence of IscA undergoing an air-dependent loss of its clusters would be in favor of the first hypothesis. There are a number of other intriguing questions that deserve detailed studies: (i) which species directly supply iron and sulfur to IscA?, and (ii) is cluster transfer from IscA to apoFdx accelerated by other proteins?From these results we propose that the specific IscA-mediated delivery of the Fe-S cluster to Fdx could be a key step in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins in the cell. As a matter of fact, several recent studies have shown that Fdx is absolutely required for proper cellular function. In A. vinelandii, disruption of the corresponding gene is lethal (31Jung Y.-S.

In yeast, the corresponding protein, named Yah1p, is also essential, and depletion of Yah1p resulted in accumulation of iron within mitochondria and defects in the incorporation of Fe-S clusters in both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S enzymes (15Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The same phenotype was observed with yeast cells depleted in the essential Fdx reductase, named Arh1p (32Li J. Saxena S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the complex process of biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters absolutely depends on a functional Fdx reductase-Fdx system, which probably participates in an essential electron transfer step. Whether holoFdx is functional alone or in association with holoIscA is an interesting question. Consequently, if the function of IscA is indeed to specifically control Fdx integrity and activity, as suggested by the present study, then IscA plays an important physiological role in particular for maturation of Fe-S proteins. Iron-sulfur proteins are present in all living organisms and exhibit diverse functions, which include electron transport, redox and non-redox catalysis, stabilization of proteins, and sensing for regulatory processes (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 2Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). They contain clusters of iron and sulfur atoms with variable nuclearity and complexity, the most extensively studied versions being the [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters. Still very little is known about the in vivosynthesis of these clusters, which is believed to require a complex machinery encoded in prokaryotes by the isc (iron-sulfur cluster) operon (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In addition to several open reading frames of unknown function, this operon contains genes for molecular chaperones (hscA and hscB), an electron transferring [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (fdx), and three isc genes,iscS, iscU, and iscA, which have been the targets of recent investigations (3Zheng L.

IscS and IscU exhibit strong homology to proteins NifS and NifU, which are encoded by genes present in the nif operon and are responsible for nitrogenase Fe-S cluster biosynthesis in the nitrogen-fixing bacteriumAzotobacter vinelandii (9Dean D.R.

In eukaryotes, mitochondrial proteins, which are highly homologous to the bacterial iscoperon gene products, have been shown to be involved in Fe-S cluster assembly on the basis of biochemical and genetic evidence (11Lill R.

The process of Fe-S cluster assembly into polypeptides needs to be studied at the molecular level to understand how all these proteins cooperate. The first step is the isolation and characterization of each member of the isc operon. Two gene products, IscS and IscU, which are essential for cluster assembly, have been previously purified and extensively characterized (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H Dean D.R. Johnson M.K.

The function of IscS resides in the production of sulfide from cysteine, resulting from a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase activity (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 20Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The function of IscU is less clear. However, it has been proposed that IscU provides a scaffold for assembly of Fe-S clusters that can be subsequently used for maturation of apo Fe-S proteins (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,6Agar J.N. Zheng L. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2136-2137Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is known on IscA. Here we report the first purification and characterization of IscA from Escherichia coli and show that IscA has a specific relationship with ferredoxin (Fdx),1 another member of the isc operon. DISCUSSIONIt has been recently shown that E. coliIscA greatly improves the efficiency of the maturation of overexpressed ferredoxins within E. coli cells (7Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in yeast, mitochondrial proteins Isa1p and Isa2p, exhibiting strong homology to IscA, were shown to be important for normal mitochondrial and cytosolic iron metabolism and to play a crucial role in the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins (17Jensen L.T.

Parkinson's disease amyloid-β Alzheimer's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Aβ precursor protein 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate cerebrospinal fluid Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase glial cytoplasmic inclusion c-Jun N-terminal kinase Lewy body multiple system atrophy 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide non Aβ component phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is pathologically characterized by progressive degeneration and death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. With poorly understood molecular pathogenesis, accumulating evidence points to the central role of α-synuclein aggregates in this disease. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs) and associated Lewy neurites (LNs), pathological hallmarks of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (1Braak H. Sandmann-Keil D. Gai W. Braak E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 265: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,2Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar). Two missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene have been identified in some families with early-onset inherited PD (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiaclae A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iono G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6734) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein has also been found in other neuronal and glial inclusions, such as Lewy body-like glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) of multiple system atrophy (MSA) (4Mezey E.

In addition, α-synuclein is found in the astrocytes and Schwann cells in the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (4Mezey E. Dehejia A.M. Harta G. Tresser N. Suchy S.F. Nussbaum R.L. Brownstein M.J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Many recent findings also suggest that the extracellular aggregation of non-Aβ component of senile plaque, the fibrillogenic fragment of α-synuclein, in the brain may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (6Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 7Iwai A.

Saitoh T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional roles of α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases are unknown. Endocytosis enables cells to modify and degrade molecules within a continuum of morphologically and biochemically distinct vacuolar compartments. These compartments include early endosome, late endosomes, and lysosomes, which have different capabilities for processing substrates by proteolysis (9Berg T. Gjoen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The neuronal endocytic pathway is a finely controlled and efficient intracellular trafficking system for internalizing and processing extracellular nutrients and trophic factors, for recycling or catabolizing receptors and other integral membrane proteins after neurotransmitter release, and for directing information to intracellular biosynthetic pathways. The early endosome is the first vacuolar compartment along the endocytic pathway. Enhanced endocytic activity, coupled with increased trafficking to endosomes of proteases, was proposed to be a potential mechanism by which β-amyloidogenesis may become accelerated in sporadic AD (10Cataldo A.M.

Rab5, a small GTPase, has been localized to the early endosome and is involved in the regulation of the endocytosis in association with Rabaptin-5 (11Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 12Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Rab5 and Rabaptin-5 have been shown to play a crucial role in neuronal endocytosis (14De Hoop M.J. Huber L.A. Stenmark H.

Murphy C.J. Lynn S.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7757-7767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human brain, Rab5 have been recently identified in neurons (10Cataldo A.M. Peterhoff C.M. Troncoso J.C.

Recent findings that α-synuclein is secreted into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and freshly prepared or aggregates of α-synuclein induce cell death in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (17El-Agnaf O.M. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 18Borghi R. Marchese R. Negro A. Marinelli L. Forloni G. Zaccheo D. Abbruzzese G. Tabaton M. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 287: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) suggest that α-synuclein secreted into or present in extracellular space may exert its cytotoxic effect to neighboring neuronal cells (17El-Agnaf O.M. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Likewise, when the excessive amounts of α-synuclein accumulates inside neurons, which eventually die, it could be possible that its aggregates leak out of the dead neurons and spread its cytotoxic effect to the neighboring cells (17El-Agnaf O.M. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). On this basis here we investigated the neurotoxicity triggered by exogenous α-synuclein and its pathogenic mechanism. The present study indicated that Rab5-dependent endocytosis of α-synuclein causes LB-like intracytoplasmic inclusions subsequently leading to cell death in neuronal hippocampal cells. These findings may give deeper insights into the pathogenic mechanism of some neurodegenerative diseases caused by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Plasmid to express wild type α-synuclein was provided by R. Jakes (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). α-Synuclein was overexpressed inEscherichia coli, and recombinant proteins were purified as previously described (19Kim J. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar, 20Paik S.R. Lee J.H. Kim D.H. Chang C.S. Kim J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Plasmids to express wild type (pEF-BOS-Rab5A) and GTPase-deficient mutant Rab5A (pEF-BOS-Rab5A/S34N and pEF-BOS-Rab5A/Q79L) were provided by K. Iwata (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Rat neuronal hippocampal progenitor H19-7 cells were generated by transduction with retroviral vectors containing the temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen, which is functionally active at 33 °C and inactive at 39 °C (21Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The H19-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 33 °C under 200 µg/ml G418 selection. Prior to treatment with reagent, cells were shifted to 39 °C in N2 medium for 2 days. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A plasmid pCMV-EGFP (CLONTECH), which contains the jellyfish green fluorescence protein gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as an internal control to assess transfection efficiency. Quantitation of cell survival was done using the tetrazolium salt-extraction method (22Chung K.C. Park J.H. Kim C.H. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 62.5 µl of the 5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each well containing 250 µl of medium in a 24-well plate. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 250 µl of extraction buffer containing 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50% N,N-dimethyl formamide, pH 7.4, was added. After incubating reagents overnight at 37 °C, the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a Spectra MAX 340 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), with extraction buffer used as a blank. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-ERK and -phosphoERK, anti-JNK and -phosphoJNK, or anti-p38 and -phosphop38 antibody, as described previously (23Chung K.C. Shin S.W. Yoo M. Lee M.Y. Lee H.W. Choe B.K. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The endogenous and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing with PBS twice, the cells were incubated for 10 min in 2% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with an approximate dilution of primary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS twice, secondary antibody conjugated to FITC or rhodamine was added to the samples at 37 °C, and incubated for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed several times with PBS, and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Immunostained cells were observed using confocal microscopy. Intracellular ROS production was measured as described elsewhere (24Ohba M. Shibanuma H. Kuroki K. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). After stimulation, cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and incubated in the dark for 5 min in HBS containing 5 mm of 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes). CM-H2DCFDA is hydrolyzed to DCFH in the cell, and DCFH is oxidized to form highly fluorescent DCF in the presence of the correct oxidant. ROS generation was detected as a result of DCFH oxidation. Cells were then examined using confocal microscopy (Leica, TCS NT system). The effect of DCFH photo-oxidation was minimized by collecting the fluorescent image with a single scan (total scan time was 5 s). After stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, lysed via the addition of hypotonic buffer (40 mm HEPES, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were sonicated twice for 10 s with a W-385 sonic oscillator (50% duty cycle, 2-s pulse cycle time, 3-output level) (Heat Systems Ultrasonic Inc). Membrane fractions were prepared by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) in an Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was washed with PBS. The final pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and membrane fractions were collected as supernatant following centrifugation (130,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). The protein concentration of each fraction was quantitated using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cells were incubated in prewarmed methionine-free DMEM for 3 h, and labeled with [35S]Met (5 µCi/ml, ICN) for 1 h before stimulation. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in TLB. Primary antibody was added to cell lysates, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 10% of Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling samples for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye, soaked in EN3HANCE solution for 60 min (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and analyzed by autoradiography. Ca2+ ions were measured using fura-2 loading and fluorescence analysis as described previously (25Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with a HEPES-buffered solution A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and loaded with fura-2 by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in solution A containing 5 µm AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After loading, the coverslip was washed once with solution A and assembled to form the bottom of the perfusion chamber. The chamber was perfused continuously with either Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free solution A. The Ca2+-free solution was prepared by replacing CaCl2 with 3 mm EGTA. The osmolarity of all solution was adjusted to 310 mosmwith the major salt prior to use. Fluorescence was measured and calibrated using a PTI system (PTI Delta Ram, New Brunswick, NJ). fura-2 fluorescence was excited at 355 and 380 nm and calibrated by exposing the cells to solutions containing high and low concentration of Ca2+ and 10 µm ionomycin. The samples were fixed with 0.1m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), including 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.5% CaCl2 for 6 h and washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The samples were post-fixed with 1.33% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 2 h. Fixed samples were washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 10 min. After washing, samples were dehydrated with alcohol and incubated with propylene oxide for 10 min. Embedding Epon mixture (Epon812, MNA, DDSA, and DMP30) was prepared, and samples were sectioned using Ultramicrotome followed by double staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM-10). We examined the effect of various doses of α-synuclein on cell viability in immortalized hippocampal H19-7 cells. In human brain homogenates α-synuclein comprises ∼0.5–1% of the total proteins (7Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). When α-synuclein measuring 5–30 µm was added for 24 h to differentiated H19-7 cells induced by basic fibroblast growth factor, the cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by MTT extraction assay (Fig.1 A). When we counted trypan blue-excluding viable cells or measured the levels of lactate dehydrogenase released from membrane-damaged cells, a similar level of cell death was observed (data not shown). Similar to H19-7 cells, the exposure of primary cortical neurons to α-synuclein for 24 h reduced the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, when bacterial Ala-30 → Pro or Ala-53 → Thr α-synuclein, whose mutation was reported in the pathogenesis of familial PD (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiaclae A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iono G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6734) Google Scholar), was added to the cells, a similar level of cell death was observed, compared with that by wild type α-synuclein (data not shown). As a control, addition of bacterial glutathioneS-transferase prepared in the same recombinant expression system had no effect on the cell viability in H19-7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the induction of cell death is a specific effect of α-synuclein. To clarify the intracellular downstream signaling cascades of α-synuclein, we measured the activity of endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase. When 10 µm α-synuclein was added, a significant increase of JNK (Fig. 1 B) and a lower but marked activation of ERK and p38 activity (data not shown) were observed using anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, and anti-active p38 antibodies. Some researchers have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of nigral neuronal cell death in PD (26Jenner P. Mov. Disord. 1998; 13: 24-34PubMed Google Scholar). By using reactive oxygen species-specific fluorescent dye, CM-H2DCFDA, we found that the exogenous addition of α-synuclein causes the formation of a large amount of reactive oxygen species for 1 h post-α-synuclein stimulation (Fig. 1 C), and increasing concentrations of α-synuclein increases the fluorescence (data not shown). In addition, the disruption of cellular cytoskeletal actin structures was observed after 6 h of α-synuclein stimulation (Fig. 1 D). To elucidate how exogenous α-synuclein exerts an intracellular cytotoxic effect, cell fractionation was performed to localize proteins inside the cells. After soluble and particulate fractions had been prepared, each fraction was assayed for the presence of α-synuclein. The control cells were not found to contain any significant levels of α-synuclein (Fig. 2 A), which is consistent with a previous report in which α-synuclein only begins to be expressed after the postnatal period in the rat central nervous system (27Hsu L.J. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Most of the α-synuclein was localized in the intracellular soluble fraction but not in the particulate membrane fraction. Interestingly, α-synuclein began to accumulate in the soluble fraction as soon as 1 min after the onset of treatment (Fig.2 A). By using metabolic labeling with [35S]Met, it was possible to determine that new protein synthesis of α-synuclein is not observed in the cells after exogenous addition of α-synuclein (Fig. 2 B). This indicated that exogenous α-synuclein is rapidly transported into H19-7 cells. Immunocytochemical visualization of the cells clearly showed that the distribution of α-synuclein was uneven and took the form of granular aggregates in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 C). Immunostaining for ubiquitin, synaptophysin, and tau protein are frequently used to visualize Lewy pathology in human brain (29Arima K. Hirai S. Sunohara N. Aoto K. Izumiyama Y. Ueda K. Ikeda K.

Tomimoto H. Suenaga T. Nakamura S. Namba Y. Ikeda K. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Brain Res. 1994; 634: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas a situation in which microtubule-associated protein tau and α-synuclein were found in the same neuron but not the same parts of the cell has been reported (28Arima K. Mizutani T. Alim M.A. Tonozuka-Uehara H. Izumiyama Y. Hirai S. Ueda K. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 100: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein also binds to tau and stimulates the protein kinase A-catalyzed tau phosphorylation (34Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). As shown by immunoprecipitation assay, transported α-synuclein binds to various LB proteins, such as synaptophysin, ubiquitin, and tau protein (Fig. 3 A). Double immunolabeling studies confirmed that virtually all of the α-synuclein-positive aggregates in H19-7 cells were also ubiquitin-positive (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, α-synuclein-positive granular deposits included synaptophysin (Fig.3 C), as well as tau proteins (Fig. 3 D), inside the H19-7 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the components of α-synuclein-positive intracytoplasmic inclusions in H19-7 cells are very similar to those of LB inclusions in PD. By using electron microscopy, the cell morphologies of control cells and the cells stimulated with α-synuclein were compared. As shown in Fig.4, the membrane integrity seems to be well-maintained 30 min after the addition of α-synuclein. Furthermore, the finding, that any phenotypic changes characteristic of apoptotic cell death such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation were not observed, implies that necrotic cell death may occur inside the cells caused by extracellular α-synuclein. The most characteristic feature of the cells to which exogenous α-synuclein was added, is the formation of microvilli in the outer plasma membrane. A possible time-dependent endocytosis, via the formation of granules, in which α-synuclein could be enclosed, was observed around the plasma membrane. These data support the previous findings in which α-synuclein is readily transported into the cells by endocytosis. The highly toxic C-terminal 105-amino acid fragment of amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) can exhibit direct neurotoxic effects by forming Ca2+-permeable cation channels on neuronal membranes (35Kim H.J. Suh Y.H. Lee M.H. Ryu P. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that α-synuclein may also change the integrity of cell membrane, resulting in increased intracellular ion transport, intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in the absence or presence of α-synuclein. Consistent with previous electron microscopic observations, any change in basal-induced (Fig. 5 A) as well asN-methyl-d-aspartate- or purinergic agonist ATP-induced calcium influxes (data not shown) was not observed up to 15 min in the presence of α-synuclein. When the calcium transport assay was extended to longer time points (30 and 60 min), there was no significant change of intracellular calcium levels (data not shown). These data suggest that the membrane integrity of H19-7 cells appears to be maintained at least in the early stages of cell death induced by α-synuclein. To assess whether any membrane protein(s) is involved in the endocytosis of α-synuclein, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of trypsin during cell splitting. Treatment of trypsin at the concentration range of 5–100 µg/ml caused a dose-dependent reduction in cell toxicity by later stimulation with α-synuclein and its endocytosis. Treatment of cells with 250 µg/ml trypsin completely blocked the endocytosis of exogenous α-synuclein (Fig. 5 B). Given that trypsin does not penetrate the cell membrane and digests only protein domains on the outer surface, this finding supports the hypothesis that “carrier” or “receptor” protein(s) for α-synuclein is present in the plasma membrane. Such a protein-mediated transport mechanism would be required for the intracellular endocytosis of exogenous α-synuclein and subsequent induction of neuronal cell death. To confirm the possibility of protein-mediated transport of α-synuclein, and to identify the receptor protein(s) in the membrane, bi-functional cross-linking reagent was added after stimulation with the intention of linking α-synuclein to any binding protein(s) in its vicinity. Cross-linking of particulate fractions with dimethylsuberimidate after the stimulation revealed the presence of a specific binding protein to α-synuclein with a molecular size of about 60 kDa (Fig.5 C). In cultured neuronal cells, Rab5, which modulates transport kinetics between the plasma membrane and early endosome, is selectively localized to early endosomes (11Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 13Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14De Hoop M.J. Huber L.A. Stenmark H. Williamson E. Zerial M. Parton R.G. Dotti C.G. Neuron. 1994; 13: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The expression of endocytosis regulatory protein Rab5 and Rabaptin-5 in glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), was observed in brains with multiple system atrophy (MSA) (36Nakamura S. Kawamoto Y. Nakano S. Akiguchi I. Clin. Neuropathol. 2000; 19: 51-56PubMed Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes in MSA appear to be functionally altered with respect to the occurrence of GCIs and aberrant expression of α-synuclein. Based on this finding, Rab5 is speculated to be involved in the endocytosis of α-synuclein. To elucidate the involvement of neuronal early endosomes, immunocytochemical investigations were undertaken with an antibody to Rab5A. It was found that a monomeric GTP-binding Rab5A protein binds to α-synuclein in a specific way (Fig.6 A). Immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed that Rab5A is co-localized with α-synuclein in a granular form in the cytosolic area (Fig. 6 B). Overexpression of GTPase-deficient Rab5A proteins resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of the endocytosis of α-synuclein and subsequent cell death (Fig.7 A). After transient transfection of the dominant-negative Rab5A mutant into the cells, the particulate and soluble fractions of cell lysates were prepared. Western blot analysis showed that exogenous α-synuclein was not completely transported into the cytosol, resulting in the decreased accumulation of α-synuclein in the cytosol, compared with that of control cells (Fig. 7 B). On the contrary, higher levels of exogenous α-synucleins were anchored in the membrane fraction, suggesting that Rab5A is required for the intracellular transport of exogenous α-synuclein (Fig. 7 C). These data implied that Rab5A is critical for the complete endocytosis of exogenous α-synuclein followed by induction of neuronal cell death.Figure 7Effect of GTPase-deficient Rab5A on the intracellular endocytosis of α-synuclein and its cytotoxicity in H19-7 cells.

Stabilization of these misfolded soluble proteins was seen in cells lacking Erv29p, a probable Golgi localized protein that cycles through the ER by means of a di-lysine ER retrieval motif (KKKIY). Cells lacking Erv29p also displayed severely retarded ER exit kinetics for a subset of correctly folded proteins. We suggest that Erv29p is likely involved in cargo loading of a subset of proteins, including soluble misfolded proteins, into vesicles for ER exit. The stabilization of soluble ERQC substrates in both erv29Δcells and sec mutants blocked in either ER exit (sec12) or vesicle delivery to the Golgi (sec18) suggests that ER-Golgi transport is required for ERQC and reveals a new aspect of the degradative mechanism.

Extensive protein misfolding occurs in cells treated with either tunicamycin, which prevents N-linked glycosylation, or dithiothreitol (DTT), which prevents disulfide bond formation, and the resulting accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) (11Chapman R.

Microarray data on yeast cells stressed with tunicamycin and DTT have shown that the UPR up-regulates a wide range of genes whose encoded proteins act upon different aspects of the ER to relieve the stress induced by the misfolded proteins (12Casagrande R.

Not surprisingly, known components of the ER degradative pathway are up-regulated includingDER1, HRD1/DER3, HRD3, andUBC7. The transcription of genes encoding ER molecular chaperones including KAR2 was also induced presumably to assist in refolding the misfolded proteins. Another category of genes up-regulated by the UPR is that involved in transport between the ER and Golgi. This category included genes involved in vesicle budding from the ER (SEC12, SEC13, SEC16, andSEC24), retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER (ERD2, RER2, RET2, andSEC26), and a gene thought to be involved in cargo selection for ER exit, ERV25 (13Travers K.J.

Properly folded secretory proteins are packaged and exported from the ER and transported by COPII-coated vesicles to the Golgi to be further modified and sent to their final destination (22Kaiser C.A.

A family of ERV (ERvesicle) proteins including Erv14p, Erv25p, Erv41p, and Erv46p have been isolated from the ER-derived COPII vesicles and are thought to function in vesicle formation, cargo loading, and/or membrane fusion (26Belden W.J.

An additional family of transmembrane proteins associated with COPI and COPII vesicles, known as p24 proteins (Emp24p, Erv25p, and Erp1–Erp6), is also proposed to be involved in vesicle formation, cargo protein sorting, and regulation of vesicular transport and is required for forward transport of a select subset of secretory proteins (29Springer S.

This work searched for genes encoding additional components of the ERQC responsible for the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER ofS. cerevisiae. A number of genes up-regulated by the UPR with unknown function were screened for stabilization of an ERQC substrate from which YGR284c/ERV29 was found to be involved in the degradation of soluble ERQC substrates. Here we characterize the function and localization of Erv29p. Stabilization of soluble ERQC substrates was observed in cells that had transport blocked between the ER and Golgi, indicating that ER-Golgi transport is necessary for soluble ERQC substrate degradation. The restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT. The chemicals were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma. The yeast strains were purchased from Research Genetics. The media were prepared as described by Hill and Stevens (30Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this study are listed in TableI. To introduce the following alleles (erv14Δ::KAN,erv25Δ::KAN,erv29Δ::KAN,erv41Δ::KAN,erv46Δ::KAN, andemp24Δ::KAN) into new strains, DNA corresponding to the disrupted allele plus ∼200–400 base pairs upstream and downstream was amplified by PCR from individual strains containing these disrupted alleles available from the S. cerevisiae Genome Deletion Project (distributed by Research Genetics) using oligonucleotides specific for each locus. The amplified DNA product was then transformed into the relevant strains with selection on YEPD pH 5.0 medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). The structure of each disruption was confirmed by PCR analysis on genomic DNA utilizing oligonucleotides flanking each disrupted locus.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSEY6211MATa ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1–901 suc2-Δ9Ref. 30Hill K.J.

The structure of the disruption was confirmed by PCR analysis as described. The met14 locus in CJRY21-3Bα was gene converted toMET14 by PCR amplification of the wild type allele from SEY6211 and transformation into CJRY21-3Bα to create KHY286 to aid in radiolabeling experiments. To create thepra1ΔSS (PrA*) allele of PEP4(originally described by Finger et al.; Ref. 9Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J.

A 0.66-kilobase SacI-ScaI fragment from pAC521 was ligated to a 1.44-kilobaseSspI-BamHI fragment from pAC521 and inserted into a SacI-BamHI-digested pRS316 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This removes a portion of the internal pro-region of PrA to create the allele encoding PrA* in pAC523 (9Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J.

The sec61-2 allele (10Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was epitope-tagged at the COOH terminus with three repeated influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes and inserted in pTV3 (33Rose M.D. Broach J.R.

The PrA*-HA construct contained in pAC535 was created utilizing the methodology of Longtine et al. (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were designed with the 5′ end corresponding to the target sequence and the 3′ end corresponding to the 3×HA-KAN marker of pFA6a-3×HA-KANMX6 (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A.

This fragment was amplified by PCR, transformed with BamHI-digested pAC523 into SEY6211, and plated on G418 containing YEPD pH 5.0 medium. G418-resistant colonies were subcultured onto minimal medium lacking uracil to select for the new plasmid, pAC535. The PrA*-HA construct in pAC535 was confirmed by both PCR analysis and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. HA epitope tagging of Erv29p was performed by first amplifying a 1.9-kilobase ERV29 fragment from genomic DNA isolated from SEY6211, which was then inserted into pCR 2.1-TOPO to create pAC506. A 2.0-kilobase NotI-BamHI ERV29 fragment from pAC506 was ligated into NotI-BamHI-digested pRS313 to create pAC505. pAC505 was cut with BamHI, the ends blunted by Klenow enzyme, and religated to destroy theBamHI site within the polylinker and create pAC520. ABamHI site was introduced 136 base pairs from the start codon of ERV29 in pAC520 using a QuickChange XL Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create pAC529. A 120-base pair BglII fragment containing three influenza virus hemagglutinin epitopes from BJ7122 (kindly provided by Dr. Elizabeth Jones) was inserted intoBamHI-digested pAC529 to create pAC530. TheERV29-HA construct was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies and the subsequent complementation of the CPY* stabilization phenotype observed in erv29Δ cells.

Our interest in the ER quality control led us to investigate genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated upon ER stress for their potential involvement in the degradation of ERQC substrates. We examined recent microarray data of ER-stressed S. cerevisiaeand identified a number of uncharacterized candidate genes (TableII) based on up-regulation following ER stress induced by both expression of an ERQC substrate (12Casagrande R.

Cell. 2000; 5: 35-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the compounds DTT and tunicamycin, which inhibit protein folding in the ER (13Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). We obtained 13 strains individually disrupted for these genes and introduced a HA-tagged allele of CPY*, a well characterized ERQC substrate (8Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The half-life of CPY*-HA in parent and mutant strains was determined by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. As an internal control we also included a strain that was disrupted inHRD1/DER3 as Hrd1p is required for efficient degradation of CPY* (6Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Table II indicates that CPY*-HA was stabilized inhrd1Δ cells as expected and was also stabilized in the strain disrupted in the YGR284c open reading frame.Table IIYeast strains screened for CPY* stabilizationOpen reading frame designationGene nameCPY* stabilizationWild type−YCL044c−YDR098cGRX3−YDR411c−YDR540c−YFR041c−YGR246cBFR1−YGR284c+YKL206c−YLR423cAPG17−YMR040w−YMR184w−YOL013cHRD1+YOR289c− Open table in a new tab The YGR284c open reading frame was disrupted in cells carrying an integrated prc1–1 (CPY*) allele and examined for any stabilizing effects. The rate of CPY* degradation in KHY270 (ygr284cΔ) cells was slowed considerably compared with the parent strain KHY163 t1/2=16min versus 38 min) (Fig. 1,A and C). The effect of a YGR284cdisruption was then tested on other ERQC substrates, and it was found that PrA* (9Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was also stabilized t1/2=18min versus 52 min) but Sec61-2p (10Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and Vph1p* (35Hill K.J. Cooper A.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were not (Fig. 1, B, D–F). These results suggested that theYGR284c encoded protein (Ygr284p) is involved in the degradation of soluble ERQC substrates (CPY* and PrA*) but not membrane-spanning substrates (Sec61-2p and Vph1p*). The sequence of the YGR284c open reading frame predicts a 310-amino acid protein, Ygr284p, with a predicted molecular mass of 35-kDa and hydrophobic stretches sufficient to span a membrane up to six times (YPD database Proteome, Inc.). Data base searches revealed similarities between Ygr284p and the SURF4 family of proteins with which it shares ∼35% identity. The SURF4 family comprises Surfeit locus protein 4 from mouse and human and homologues in Drosophila melanogaster, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Caenorhabditis elegans; however, no known functions have been assigned for these proteins (Fig.2 A). The COOH terminus sequence of Ygr284p is KKKIY and matches the consensus di-lysine based ER retrieval motif KKXX for membrane proteins (36Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This retrieval motif is likely functional because it is conserved among members of the SURF4 family (Fig. 2 A), and the addition of a HA epitope tag to the COOH terminus of Ygr284p, thereby altering the required COOH-terminal exposure of the KKXX motif, renders the protein nonfunctional as judged by a failure to restore CPY* degradation in Ygr284Δ cells (data not shown). The unfolded protein response (UPR) up-regulates the expression of a subset of genes in response to stress in the ER, and YGR284chas been shown to be transcriptionally up-regulated under such conditions (12Casagrande R.

Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The UPR is mediated through UPREs found in the promoter regions of UPR genes to which the transcription factor Hac1p binds during ER stress (16Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). We examined the promoter region ofYGR284c and identified a likely UPRE at positions −106 to −85 (relative to a translational start site of +1). Fig. 2 Bshows a comparison of the potential UPREs found in theYGR284c locus with UPREs from genes known to be up-regulated by the UPR including KAR2, PDI1, LHS1,SCJ1, FKB2, and EUG1 (16Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The UPR can be induced by tunicamycin or DTT, compounds that induce misfolding of proteins within the ER by preventing N-linked glycosylation or that reduce disulfide bonds, respectively (37Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 38Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The cells in which the UPR had been induced by the addition of tunicamycin or DTT were examined for any effects on the level of Ygr284p. KHY271 (ygr284Δ) cells expressing pAC530 (Ygr284p-HA) were treated with either 10 μg/ml tunicamycin or 2.5 mm DTT for 2 h at 30 °C, and cellular extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein were immunoblotted and probed with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2 C). The 3.5–4.7-fold increase in Erv29p observed when cells were stressed with tunicamycin or DTT correlated well with the 2.8–3.5-fold transcriptional up-regulation of Erv29p detected by microarray analysis (13Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The sequence of YGR284c predicts a protein with 5–6 potential membrane spanning domains. To confirm that Ygr284p was an integral membrane protein, we performed sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) fractionation on cell lysates, a procedure that solubilizes all but integral membrane proteins (39Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). KHY271 cells carrying pAC530 (Ygr284p-HA) were lysed, treated with sodium carbonate (100 mm), and separated into membrane pellet and soluble fractions. Equivalent amounts of protein were immunoblotted and probed with anti-HA antibodies. The fractionation profile for Ygr284p was the same as for the integral membrane protein, Dpm1p (Fig.3 A), and the converse of the soluble protein phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK). The subcellular localization of Ygr284p-HA was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of Ygr284p-HA (pAC530) in KHY271 (ygr284Δ) cells. The presence of a consensus di-lysine based ER retrieval signal at the COOH terminus of Ygr284p-HA predicted an ER staining pattern as seen with the ER resident protein, Eug1p (Ref. 40Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 B). However, the staining pattern of Ygr284p-HA was clearly distinct from the typical ER staining pattern of Eug1p and was most similar to that of proteins localized to the Golgi complex (Fig. 3 B). Schroder et al. (41Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported a similar staining pattern for Emp47p, which, although possessing a functional di-lysine motif, was localized to the Golgi by immunofluorescence and fractionation (41Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cells that expressed untagged Ygr284p showed no specific staining with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The assignment of YGR284c as ERV29 by theSaccharomyces Genome Data base and subsequent publication informed us that Ygr284p/Erv29p could be isolated in ER-derived COPII vesicles and suggested a role for Erv29p in ER-Golgi transport (27Otte S. Belden W.J. Heidtman M. Liu J. Jensen O.N. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 15: 503-517Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Erv14p, Erv25p, and recently Erv41p and Erv46p have all been identified in ER-derived COPII vesicles, and their individual absences has varying effects on the trafficking of correctly folded proteins from the ER to the Golgi (26Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27Otte S. Belden W.J. Heidtman M. Liu J. Jensen O.N. Barlowe C. J.

We investigated the role of Erv29p in ER-Golgi transport by examining the forward transport of correctly folded soluble and membrane spanning secretory proteins in wild type cells and those lacking Erv29p. CPY is a useful indicator of trafficking through the secretory pathway because its molecular mass varies as it transits to the vacuole; the ER p1 precursor form (67 kDa) is further glycosylated within the Golgi complex (p2, 69 kDa) and then processed to the mature form (m, 61 kDa) in the vacuole (42Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows that the absence of Erv29p strongly delays the trafficking of CPY to the vacuole. There is a very prolonged presence of the p1 ER form throughout most of the 60-min chase period, whereas in wild type cells both the Golgi-modified p2 and the mature vacuolar form are visible even in the pulse lane. The delayed trafficking of CPY in erv29Δ cells showed no Golgi-modified p2 form, which could be due to the fact that (i) trans-Golgi trafficking was rapid compared with the ER exit rate, (ii)erv29Δ cells have a disturbed Gol"

The target sites of brassinazole were investigated by chemical analyses of endogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) in brassinazole-treatedCatharanthus roseus cells. The levels of castasterone and brassinolide in brassinazole-treated plant cells were less than 6% of the levels in untreated cells. In contrast, campestanol and 6-oxocampestanol levels were increased, and levels of BR intermediates with hydroxy groups on the side chains were reduced, suggesting that brassinazole treatment reduced BR levels by inhibiting the hydroxylation of the C-22 position. DWF4, which is anArabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 isolated as a putative steroid 22-hydroxylase, was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the binding affinity of brassinazole and its derivatives to the recombinant DWF4 were analyzed. Among several triazole derivatives, brassinazole had both the highest binding affinity to DWF4 and the highest growth inhibitory activity. The binding affinity and the activity for inhibiting hypocotyl growth were well correlated among the derivatives. In brassinazole-treated A. thaliana, theCPD gene involved in BR biosynthesis was induced within 3 h, most likely because of feedback activation caused by the reduced levels of active BRs. These results indicate that brassinazole inhibits the hydroxylation of the C-22 position of the side chain in BRs by direct binding to DWF4 and that DWF4 catalyzes this hydroxylation reaction.

P450 monooxygenases brassinosteroid(s) obtusifoliol 14-demetylase brassinolide Plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s)1 participate in many biochemical pathways, including certain essential and conserved pathways in plants, such as hormone, sterol, and oxygenated fatty acid biosynthesis (1Chapple C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of genes encoding P450s or the use of specific inhibitors of these enzymes should cause serious plant developmental defects. BRs are important plant hormones (2Clouse S.D. Sasse J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 3Yokota T. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 137-143Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and involvement of P450s in their biosynthetic pathway was indicated by the identification of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutantscpd (4Szekeres M. Nemeth K. Koncz-Kalman Z. Mathur J. Kauschmann A. Altmann T. Redei G.P. Nagy F. Schell J. Koncz C.

Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar) and the tomato mutantdwarf (6Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When grown in etiolating conditions, the A. thaliana mutants resemble light-grown plants. Cloning of the mutant genes revealed that both DWF4 and CPD loci encode P450s. Feeding experiments with BR biosynthetic intermediates revealed that the C-22 and C-23 positions of BRs are successively hydroxylated by DWF4 and CPD, respectively. However, direct evidence of their enzymatic functions and chemical analysis of endogenous BRs in the mutants have not been reported. The two enzymes are distinct, yet their functions, as well as the sequence of their corresponding genes, are similar. Recently, we reported a triazole-type BR biosynthesis inhibitor, brassinazole, which induces dwarfism in A. thaliana. The brassinazole-treated plants resemble BR biosynthetic mutants and can be rescued by BRs (7Asami T. Yoshida S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Asami T. Min Y.K. Nagata N. Yamagishi K. Takatsuto S. Fujioka S. Murofushi N. Yamaguchi I. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because brassinazole is part of a class of triazole derivatives that inhibit cytochrome P450s, it is possible that brassinazole also blocks BR biosynthetic reactions catalyzed by P450s. Feeding experiments indicate that a target site of brassinazole is the conversion of cathasterone to teasterone catalyzed by CPD. Considering the similar functions and amino acid sequences of DWF4 and CPD, we can speculate that brassinazole inhibits steps catalyzed by both enzymes. However, if brassinazole inhibits both steps, brassinazole-treated plants will not respond to cathasterone or to earlier intermediates of BR biosynthesis, making it difficult to use feeding experiments to investigate the target sites of brassinazole upstream of cathasterone. DWF4 and obtusifoliol 14-demetylase (14DM) are cytochrome P450s that act upstream of CPD. BRs cannot rescue the phenotype of antisense 14DM plants 2Kushiro, M., Nakano, T., Sato, K., Yamagishi, K., Asami, T., Nakano, A., Takatsuto, S., Fujioka, S., Ebizuka, Y., and Yoshida, S. Biochem.

Sterol C-14 reductase acts one step downstream from 14DM in BR biosynthesis. These results suggest that 14DM is not the target of brassinazole. To investigate whether DWF4 is a target of brassinazole, we first performed quantitative analyses of endogenous sterols and BRs in Catharanthus roseus, a useful model for the analysis of BR biosynthesis. Next, we analyzed the interaction between DWF4 expressed in E. coli and brassinazole and its derivatives. In this paper, we provide evidence that brassinazole blocks BR biosynthesis at the C-22-hydroxylation step to induce BR deficiency and that brassinazole binds DWF4, which indicates that DWF4 catalyzes C-22-hydroxylation. Feedback regulation of the CPD gene by BR-deficiency was also investigated using brassinazole-treated A. thaliana seedlings. Brassinazole and Brz117 used in this report were unnatural chemicals, synthesized and purified according to the method described previously (11Min Y.K. Asami T. Fujioka S. Murofushi N. Yamaguchi I. Yoshida S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Uniconazole, bitertanol, and difenoconazole were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). BR analysis was carried out according to the method reported by Noguchi et al. (12Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Choe S. Takatsuto S. Yoshida S. Yuan H. Feldmann K.A. Tax F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Seeds of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were purchased from LEHLE Seeds (Round Rock, TX). Seeds were cold-treated at 4 °C for 2 days, surface-sterilized in a 1% NaOCl solution for 20 min, and washed 5 times with sterile distilled water. Seeds were sown on plates containing a 1% agar-solidified medium including 0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts and 1.5% sucrose (w/v) with or without additional chemicals. The plates were sealed with Parafilm (American National Can Co., Chicago, IL), and plants were placed in a growth chamber under dark conditions at 22 °C for 10 days. The coding region of the DWF4 cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from an A. thaliana cDNA library (13Mizutani M. Ohta D. Sato R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using the following two primers: B1N, 5′-GAATTCATGTTCGAAACAGAGCATCATACTC; and B1C, 5′-CTCGAGTTACAGAATACGAGAAACCCTAATA. The amplified fragment was cloned using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the insert was sequenced completely. The bacterial expression vector pCWori+ (kindly provided by Drs. Sueyoshi, National Institutes of Health, and Waterman, Vanderbilt University) was used to express recombinant DWF4 in E. coli (14Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Watermann M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To improve expression efficiency in E. coli, the nucleotide sequence of the DWF4 cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the protein was modified to enrich for A/T residues without changing the amino acid sequence. Changes were made as follows: the DWF4 coding region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using primers MM6, 5′-CATATGTTTGAAACAGAACATCAT (anNdeI site was added as underlined, and the modified nucleotides are indicated by italics); and MM7, 5′-TCTAGATTACAGAATACGAGAAACCC (an XbaI site was added as underlined). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned and sequenced as above. The modified DWF4 cDNA was digested with NdeI and XbaI and ligated intoNdeI/XbaI-digested pCWori+ to produce the bacterial expression construct pCW-DWF4. E. coli cells of strain JM109 were transformed with the pCW-DWF4 construct. 10-ml cultures of the transformed cells were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium plus 100 µg/ml ampicillin and used to inoculate 1 liter of a modified Terrific Broth medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, 0.2% glucose, 0.5 mmδ-aminolevulinic acid. The medium was placed in 2-liter culture flasks and shaken at 37 °C and 225 rpm. After 3 h of incubation, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (0.1 mm) was added to induce expression of the recombinant protein. The culture was shaken continuously at 150 rpm for 48 h at 30 °C. Cells from a 1-liter culture were pelleted and resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.25), 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was sonicated 15 times for 30 s each, and bacterial membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane was resuspended in Buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 (Buffer B) and was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose chromatography column equilibrated with Buffer B. The recombinant DWF4 protein was eluted in Buffer B containing increasing NaCl concentrations, from 20 to 500 mm. Fractions enriched for P450 activity were used for spectral analysis of the recombinant DWF4 protein. The P450 content was determined by spectrophotometric analysis, using the extinction coefficient difference of the deduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum (91.1 mm−1cm−1). The binding of the triazole compounds to DWF4 was determined by measuring the triazole-induced spectral change of the oxidized DWF4 protein. The triazole compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the recombinant DWF4 protein (200 pmol/ml) in Buffer B at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µm (0.1% final Me2SO concentration). Spectral changes for each titration set were generated by successive subtractions of the spectrum of the inhibitor-free enzyme from the spectrum after addition of the inhibitor. Spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV3100 spectrophotometer. A. thaliana (ecotype Colombia) seedlings were grown in a liquid culture of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog salt medium plus 1.5% sucrose for 7 days in continuous light. Brassinazole or brassinolide was added to final concentrations of 3 µm or 30 nm (0.01% final Me2SO concentration), respectively, and seedlings were incubated for 3 h. Treated seedlings were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA was extracted. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine-hydrochloride method (15Kawakami N. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 33-42Google Scholar). 10 µg of total RNA were resolved in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and stained with CYBR Green II (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The amount of RNA loaded per lane was determined according to the strength of the ethidium bromide staining, as measured by the program NIH Image. A new gel was then loaded for RNA gel blot analysis to ensure equal loading of the samples. The RNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane and fixed to the membrane by baking for 2 h at 80 °C. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C overnight. Membranes were washed with 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Reactive bands were visualized with anti-digoxigenin-AP (Enzo) and CPD-Star (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then detected using a luminescent-image analyzer LAS 1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To prepare a probe, an EST clone of the CPD gene, 63C12 (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number T41675), was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The clone was sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A and model 310A DNA sequencing system; Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing confirmed that the cDNA contained the entire coding region of theCPD gene. The clone was digested with EcoRI, and full-length antisense RNA was prepared with digoxigenin using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To characterize the steps in BR biosynthesis blocked by brassinazole, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry chemical analysis was performed on brassinazole-treated and untreated cultured cells of C. roseus (Fig. 1). Remarkably, compared with the control cultures, the brassinazole-treated cells had increased levels of 6-oxocampestanol, a precursor in the early C-6 oxidation pathway, and campestanol, a precursor in both early and late C-6 oxidation pathways. More importantly, this analysis revealed that BR levels in the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways in brassinazole-treated cells were lower in untreated cells. Particularly, the levels of castasterone and bassinolide, considered active forms of BR, were less than 6% of those in untreated cells. These results provide direct evidence that brassinazole-treatment diminishes the levels of BRs whose side chains possess hydroxy groups and suggest that brassinazole interferes with the C-22 oxidation of BRs. Recombinant DWF4 was successfully expressed in E. coli and exhibited a Soret absorption peak at 416 nm, which is characteristic of low-spin P450s (Fig.2 A). The addition of brassinazole to the DWF4 protein induced a type II absorbance shift of the heme Soret band from 416 to 421 nm (Fig.2 A). This shift indicated direct coordination of the triazole group of the brassinazole to the heme iron of DWF4. The dissociation constant K d was determined by titrating the observed spectral absorbance difference (ΔA432-A412) versus the concentration of inhibitor (Fig.2 B). The K d for brassinazole was 1.05 × 10−6m. Uniconazole is also a triazole-type inhibitor mainly targeting a P450 involved in an early step of gibberellin biosynthesis and inhibits BR biosynthesis at a higher concentration than brassinazole (17Yokota T. Nakamura Y. Takahashi N. Nonaka M. Sekimoto M. Oshio H. Takatsuto S. Takahashi N. Phinney B.O. MacMillan J. Gibberellins. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 339-349Crossref Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for uniconazole (6.9 × 10−6m) was weaker than that of brassinazole, indicating a good agreement betweenin vivo activity and binding affinity for DWF4. Fig.3 shows the relationships between the binding affinities of some triazole derivatives to DWF4 and their ability to inhibit hypocotyl elongation in etiolated A. thaliana seedlings. The results indicate that binding affinity and hypocotyl-elongation inhibition are well correlated. Brassinazole displays both the highest binding affinity and the highest growth-inhibition activity, whereas other derivatives show low affinity and low inhibitory activity. To test the specificity of brassinazole to inhibit BR biosynthesis, we measured the binding affinity of brassinazole to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and found that brassinazole did not bind to this enzyme at all (data not shown). This result is in accordance with reversion assays in brassinazole-treated plants, which indicate that brassinazole is not a nonspecific inhibitor of plant P450s.Figure 3Binding affinities of brassinazole and some triazole derivatives to DWF4 and their activities in planta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous analysis of endogenous BRs in several BR biosynthetic dwarf mutants revealed that active BRs are deficient in these plants. Brassinazole treatment also caused deficiency of BRs downstream of cathasterone or 6-deoxocathasterone in plants, as shown in this report. Treatment of A. thaliana with specific BR intermediates or end products, such as BL or castasterone, caused a reduction in CPD mRNA levels (18Mathur J. Molnar G. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Sakurai A. Yokota T. Adam G. Voigt B. Nagy F. Maas C. Schell J. Koncz C. Szekeres M. Plant J. 1998; 14: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast, BR-insensitive A. thaliana dwarf mutants (bri1–4) accumulate very high levels of BL, castasterone, and typhasterol, indicating that BRI1 is required for the feedback regulation of BR biosynthesis (19Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Choe S. Takatsuto S. Tax F.E. Yoshida S. Feldmann K.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Noguchiet al. (19Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Choe S. Takatsuto S. Tax F.E. Yoshida S. Feldmann K.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reported increased transcript levels of genes involved in BR biosynthesis because of BR-deficiency. As these analyses were performed after lengthy chemical treatments, we examinedCPD mRNA levels in A. thaliana after 3 h of brassinazole treatment to evaluate the effect of short-term treatments (Fig. 4). CPDlevels were indeed higher in brassinazole-treated seedlings. Subsequent treatment of brassinazole-treated plants with BL substantially reduced the abundance of CPD mRNA. BL is widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom, as are biosynthetically related compounds. One advantage of using inhibitors of BR biosynthesis rather than BR-deficient mutants to analyze the roles of BRs in plants is that inhibitors can be applied to a variety of plant species. Brassinazole-treated dicots undergo morphological changes similar to those of BR-deficient A. thalianamutants, strong dwarfism with curly, dark green leaves in the light, and a de-etiolated phenotype, with short hypocotyls and open cotyledons, when grown in the dark (7Asami T. Yoshida S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The BR biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated in cultured cells of C. roseus; these pathways are nearly identical to those in A. thaliana. Recently, a rice BRI1 homolog was isolated, and loss of function of this gene also caused reduced sensitivity to exogenous brassinolide, as in the A. thaliana bri1 mutant (20Yamamuro C. Ihara Y. Wu X. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Ashikari M. Kitano H. Matsuoka M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1591-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These results suggest that brassinolide is essential for normal plant growth. To confirm that brassinazole-treated cells are deficient in BRs and to investigate the target site of brassinazole, endogenous levels of BRs in both brassinazole-treated and untreated C. roseus cells were determined. In both the early and the late C-6 oxidation pathways, endogenous levels of BRs formed downstream from the step catalyzed by DWF4 were clearly reduced in brassinazole-treated cells compared with untreated cells, indicating that the biosynthetic step targeted by brassinazole is upstream from the 22-hydroxylated BRs. The accumulation of both campestanol and 6-oxocampestanol indicates that brassinazole affects the oxidation of the C-22 position of the side chain. These two results are consistent with the conclusion that the main target of brassinazole is the 22-hydroxylation step catalyzed by DWF4. The binding affinity of the chemicals to heterologously expressed DWF4 confirmed the results of the chemical analysis of internal BRs. Brassinazole had the highestK d value among the compounds tested, whereas Brz117, difenoconazole, and bitertanol, which had weak or no growth inhibitory activity in hypocotyl elongation tests, had far lower binding affinities to DWF4 than did brassinazole. That is, the results obtained in the in vitro tests correlated with those obtainedin vivo. Uniconazole, an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, had a higher affinity than Brz117, difenoconazole, and bitertanol. This result suggests that the reduction of BRs content in uniconazole-treated plants should be because of its inhibition of the DWF4-catalyzed C-22-hydroxylation. Feeding experiments suggested that one of the target sites of brassinazole was the conversion of cathasterone to teasterone catalyzed by CPD. These results are not contradictory to those in this report. If brassinazole targets both DWF4 and CPD, a reduction in internal BRs downstream from the step catalyzed by DWF4 would be observed, as seen in chemical analyses, and conversion of cathasterone to teasterone would be blocked, as revealed by feeding experiments. Therefore, we anticipate that brassinazole targets both DWF4 and CPD. Thus far, with the exception of the tomato DWARF protein, none of the activities of the plant P450s involved in BR biosynthesis have been confirmed in functional analyses. In ourin vitro assay, campestanol, a putative substrate of DWF4, was applied to E. coli cells expressing recombinant DWF4. However, we could not detect any hydroxylated product after 24 h at 30 °C. As we thought this is possibly because of a deficiency in the E. coli electron transport system (e.g. NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, cytochrome b5, and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase), we tested several electron transport systems reported thus far (13Mizutani M. Ohta D. Sato R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Mizutani M. Ohta D.

Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), but we could not get any good results. Despite this defect in expressing the function of DWF4, the combination of the chemical analysis of internal BRs in brassinazole-treated plant cells and the binding assay of brassinazole to DWF4 demonstrated not only the target site of brassinazole but also the involvement of DWF4 in the BR biosynthetic pathway. Reductions in BRs increase the levels of transcripts coding for BR biosynthetic enzymes through a feedback-regulation mechanism. The regulatory factor was suggested to be translated de novo, because regulation was abolished in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (18Mathur J. Molnar G. Fujioka S.

In the case of gibberellin biosynthesis, transcript levels of each of the three A. thaliana gibberellin 20-oxidase genes are elevated in thegal-3 (copalyl pyrophosphate synthetase-deficient) mutant compared with Landsberg erecta and are substantially reduced by treating the mutant with gibberellin A3(24Peng J. Harberd N. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 351-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction occurs within 1–3 h, indicating that it is not related to growth rate and that the message is degraded rapidly (25Hedden P. Kamiya Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 431-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the mRNA levels of CPD inA. thaliana 3 h after treatment with brassinazole (Fig.4). The increase of CPD in brassinazole-treated A. thaliana and the decrease of CPD in brassinazole + BL-treated plants correspond well with levels observed in BR-deficient (cpd and dwf1) and BR-insensitive (bri1) mutants (18Mathur J. Molnar G. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Sakurai A. Yokota T. Adam G. Voigt B. Nagy F. Maas C. Schell J. Koncz C. Szekeres M.

As in the case ofga1–3, these fluctuations in mRNA levels within 3 h of changes in BL levels indicate that the changes are not related to growth rate and that the message is degraded rapidly. In case of dwf7/ste1 (21Choe S. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Tissier C.P. Gregory B.D. Ross A.S. Tanaka A. Yoshida S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A.

In addition, some uncommon derivatives of these steroids also accumulated. Consequently, the intensive search for steroids in brassinazole-treated cells may reveal the structures of unknown BR derivatives that may affect plant growth and development. Finally, it is demonstrated that the combination of the chemical analysis of internal BRs in brassinazole-treated plant cells and the binding assay of brassinazole to DWF4 can be an alternative way to investigate the role of the DWF4 in BR biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1530042671,"Potassium leak channels are essential to neurophysiological function. Leaks suppress excitability through maintenance of resting membrane potential below the threshold for action potential firing. Conversely, voltage-dependent potassium channels permit excitation because they do not interfere with rise to threshold, and they actively promote recovery and rapid re-firing. Previously attributed to distinct transport pathways, we demonstrate here that phosphorylation of single, native hippocampal and cloned KCNK2 potassium channels produces reversible interconversion between leak and voltage-dependent phenotypes. The findings reveal a pathway for dynamic regulation of excitability."

With the exception of platelets, LTC4S has been identified only in hematopoietic cells that also express 5-LO.We sought to establish that LTC4S was the dominant constitutive enzymatic source of LTC4 in situ in the mouse by targeted gene disruption of the LTC4S gene. The loss of function in the gene-disrupted mice relative to their controls was then used to quantitate the roles of LTC4S in models of innate and adaptive immune inflammation. Zymosan, a yeast cell wall polysaccharide, was used to elicit an intraperitoneal extravasation of plasma proteins, and hapten-specific, IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis provided a permeability increment at the skin. We also assessed for the catalytic function of LTC4S in various tissues relative to the bifunctional GSTs by the decrement in LTC4 biosynthesis in the LTC4S −/− mice. Finally, we determined whether the absence of LTC4S in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) subjected to IgE-dependent activation would lead to increased non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate LTA4 to 6-trans-LTB4 diastereoisomers or to the shunting of LTA4 to LTA4 hydrolase to form more LTB4.

The human LTC4S cDNA encodes a protein of 150 amino acids and belongs to a recently recognized superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism that includes FLAP and microsomal GSTs (MGSTs) (27Jakobsson P.-J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Science. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).

LTC4 can be formed through the transcellular metabolism of LTA4 by cells that express LTC4S, such as platelets (30Scoggan K.A. Jakobsson P.-J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

We sought to establish that LTC4S was the dominant constitutive enzymatic source of LTC4 in situ in the mouse by targeted gene disruption of the LTC4S gene. The loss of function in the gene-disrupted mice relative to their controls was then used to quantitate the roles of LTC4S in models of innate and adaptive immune inflammation. Zymosan, a yeast cell wall polysaccharide, was used to elicit an intraperitoneal extravasation of plasma proteins, and hapten-specific, IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis provided a permeability increment at the skin. We also assessed for the catalytic function of LTC4S in various tissues relative to the bifunctional GSTs by the decrement in LTC4 biosynthesis in the LTC4S −/− mice. Finally, we determined whether the absence of LTC4S in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) subjected to IgE-dependent activation would lead to increased non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate LTA4 to 6-trans-LTB4 diastereoisomers or to the shunting of LTA4 to LTA4 hydrolase to form more LTB4.

Here we provide three lines of evidence that the phagocyte G protein-coupled receptor (N-formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2)) mediates these amyloid-β-dependent functions in phagocytic cells. First, transfection of FPR2, but not related receptors, including the other known N-formylpeptide receptor FPR, reconstituted amyloid-β-dependent chemotaxis and calcium flux in HEK 293 cells. Second, amyloid-β induced both calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils (which express endogenous FPR2) with similar potency as in FPR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. This activity could be specifically desensitized in both cell types by preincubation with a specific FPR2 agonist, which desensitizes the receptor, or with pertussis toxin, which uncouples it from Gi-dependent signaling. Third, specific and reciprocal desensitization of superoxide production was observed whenN-formylpeptides and amyloid-β were used to sequentially stimulate neutrophils from FPR −/− mice, which express FPR2 normally. Potential biological relevance of these results to the neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease was suggested by two additional findings: first, FPR2 mRNA could be detected by PCR in mouse brain; second, induction of FPR2 expression correlated with induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis by amyloid-β in the mouse microglial cell line N9. Further, in sequential stimulation experiments with N9 cells, N-formylpeptides and amyloid-β were able to reciprocally cross-desensitize each other. Amyloid-β was also a specific agonist at the human counterpart of FPR2, the FPR-like 1 receptor. These results suggest a unified signaling mechanism for linking amyloid-β to phagocyte chemotaxis and oxidant stress in the brain.

It is directly toxic to cultured neurons in vitro (5Mattson M.P. Physiol.

Aβ may also induce phagocyte accumulation and activation indirectly, by inducing C5a production through activation of complement (20Bradt B.M. Kolb W.P. Cooper N.R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or by inducing macrophage colony-stimulating factor release from neurons (21Yan S.D. Zhu H.J. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A.

Consistent with a proinflammatory role, intravascular injection of Aβ causes endothelial cell leakage and leukocyte adhesion and migrationin vivo (17Sutton E.T. Thomas T. Bryant M.W. Landon C.S.

The notion that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is consistent with clinical reports linking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration to reduced incidence of disease and milder clinical course in affected patients (22Flynn B.L. Theesen K.A. Ann. Pharmacother. 1999; 33: 840-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Aβ action on cells has not been fully defined yet. Aβ has been reported to bind to several otherwise unrelated receptors, including the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE; Ref. 23Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H.J. Roher A.

Res. 1997; 22: 1437-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The role of glypican, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, integrins, and p75 neurotrophin receptor in mediating Aβ action is not defined. RAGE has been implicated in mediating Aβ-induced oxidant stress in endothelial cells and cortical neurons, NF-κB activation in endothelial cells, and induction of tumor necrosis factor-α production, chemotaxis, and haptotaxis of the mouse microglial cell line BV-2 (19El Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar); conflicting results have been reported with regard to the role of RAGE in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (28Liu Y. Dargusch R. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Scavenger receptors have been reported to mediate adhesion of rodent microglial cells and human monocytes to Aβ fibril-coated surfaces, leading to secretion of reactive oxygen species and cell immobilization (18McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to mediate internalization of aggregated Aβ protein (29Paresce D.M. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar); however, these receptors do not appear to mediate Aβ stimulation of peripheral blood monocyte-dependent neurotoxicity (30Antic A. Dzenko K.A. Pachter J.S. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Aβ has also been reported to have direct toxic effects on membranes independent of receptors (31Schubert D. Behl C. Lesley R. Brack A. Dargusch R. Sagara Y. Kimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1989-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the precise mechanisms by which Aβ induces chemotaxis and oxidant production in primary phagocytic cells remain undefined. Most known phagocyte chemotactic receptors are members of the Gi class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which signal through pertussis toxin-sensitive pathways (32Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Recently, pertussis toxin was reported to block Aβ induction of interleukin-1β release from the human monocytic cell line THP-1 (14Lorton D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 94: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as well as Aβ induction of calcium flux in HL-60 cells (33Takenouchi T. Munekata E. Peptides. 1995; 16 (; Correction (1995) Peptides16, 1557): 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This, together with the fact that calcium flux is strongly associated with GPCR activation by chemoattractants, suggested to us that Aβ may act via a GPCR. Since ligand promiscuity is a common property of chemoattractant receptors, we tested this hypothesis by examining the ability of cloned phagocyte chemoattractant receptors to reconstitute Aβ signaling in a transfected cell line. We also investigated receptors mediating Aβ signaling on mouse phagocytes (reported here) and human phagocytes (reported separately). Construction of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell lines expressing human formylpeptide receptor (FPR), human formylpeptide receptor-like 1 receptor (FPRL1R), mouse FPR, mouse FPR2, mouse lipoxin A4 receptor (encoded by Fpr-rs1), a mouse orphan receptor encoded by Fpr-rs3, and human CCR5 and CX3CR1 has been previously described (34Hartt J.K.

Fpr-rs1 andFpr-rs3 were tested because of their high structural similarity to the known formylpeptide receptors and because they are also expressed in phagocytes (37Gao J.-L. Chen H. Filie J.D. Kozak C.A. Murphy P.M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone), and 2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. A human CCR1-expressing HEK 293 cell line has also been previously described (38Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffany H.L. Gao J-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); culture conditions were the same except for usage of 200 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) as the selective antibiotic. A mouse pre-B cell lymphoma cell line (4DE4) expressing human CCR8 has been reported previously (39Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J-L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 2 mg/ml G418. The N9 murine microglial cell line was a kind gift from Dr. P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli (Universita Degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy). These cells express typical markers of resting mouse microglia and have been extensively used as representatives of primary mouse microglial cells (40Ferrari D. Villalba M. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Neutrophils were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of wild type and gene knockout litter mates of F1 and F6 backcrosses of 129/sV FPR−/− mice with C57Bl/6 mice 3–4 h after intraperitoneal injection of a 3% thioglycollate solution, as previously described (41Gao J-L. Lee E.J. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cell population was consistently composed of >90% neutrophils, as determined by light microscopy of DiffQuick-stained cytospins. Thus, hereafter we will refer to this cell preparation as neutrophils. To monitor intracellular Ca2+ concentration, adherent cells were harvested by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 15 min and then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 μmFura-2/AM at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed twice with HBSS (Life Technologies) and suspended in HBSS at 1–2 × 106/ml. One ml of cells was added to 1 ml of HBSS and stimulated with ligand in a continuously stirred cuvette at 37 °C in a fluorimeter (model MS-III; Photon Technology Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Data were recorded every 200 ms as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm following sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The following ligands were evaluated: Aβ (nonfibrillated, human residues 1–42; California Peptide Research; Napa, CA), fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF; Sigma), ATP (Life Technologies), and the chemokines RANTES, SDF-1, I-309, fractalkine, MIP-1α, and KC (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The particular chemokines tested were chosen because of their specificity for phagocyte targets. All chemokines were human with the exception of KC, which is mouse. The receptor targets for these chemokines are as follows: RANTES, CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5; SDF-1, CXCR4; I-309, CCR8; fractalkine, CX3CR1; MIP-1α, CCR1, and CCR5; CXCR2. Aβ, chemokines and ATP were dissolved in water and stored at −20 °C; fMLF was dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. In some experiments, the cells were incubated in 250 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX; Calbiochem) for 4 h at 37 °C in medium, harvested, and loaded with Fura-2/AM as described above. Immediately after harvesting, murine neutrophils were incubated in 1–2 × 106/ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM for 45 min at 37 °C. Neutrophils were washed twice in HBSS and suspended to 1–2 × 106/ml for analysis. Calcium flux was performed with N9 cells preincubated in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (37 °C, 24 h) using similar procedures. HEK 293 cells were harvested from tissue culture flasks by incubation in trypsin (0.05%)/EDTA (0.1%) (Quality Biologicals, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were suspended evenly by vigorous pipetting, and excess Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was then added to block trypsin. Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and suspended to a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml in chemotaxis medium (RPMI 1640; 20 mm HEPES (Life Technologies) and 1% bovine serum albumin (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH)). Chemoattractants, diluted in chemotaxis medium, were added to the bottom wells of a 96-well chemotaxis plate (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A 12-μm pore size membrane was placed on top, and 25 μl of cell suspension containing ∼100,000 cells was placed in the upper chamber. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, 100% humidity, 5% CO2. The membrane was carefully removed, and cells in the bottom well were counted using a hemacytometer. Methods for murine neutrophils were the same except that ∼200,000 cells were added to the top of a 5-μm pore size membrane. Chemotaxis assays for N9 cells incubated with or without LPS (300 ng/ml, at 37 °C for 24 h) were performed with 48-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe). Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pore size and 90-min incubation at 37 °C were used for measurement of microglial cell migration. Mouse neutrophils were suspended in HBSS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 106 cells/ml. 50 μl (5 × 104 cells) were distributed into wells of a 96-well microtiter chemiluminescence plate and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then a mixture of the superoxide-specific chemiluminescence indicator reagent Diogenes (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) was added to the cells (50% of total reaction volume) with appropriate stimuli or vehicle control, and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence was measured in a luminometer (Labsystems Luminoskan; Helsinki, Finland). Data are expressed as integrated luminescence (relative light units) observed during 0.5-s readings obtained at 12-s intervals over a time course of 10 min. For sequential stimulation experiments, 5 × 104 FPR −/− neutrophils were distributed into microcentrifuge tubes, and test substances were added. The mixture was then immediately transferred to a chemiluminescence plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 min (when fMLF was the first stimulus) or 9 min (when Aβ was the first stimulus), Diogenes reagent plus the final stimulus was added, and the activity was monitored for 10 min. To control for desensitization of NADPH oxidase by the first stimulus, cells were stimulated with PMA (100 ng/ml) after the second stimulation, and superoxide was measured for 10 min. To control for scavenging of superoxide by fMLF or Aβ, neutrophils were stimulated simultaneously with (i) PMA (100 ng/ml) and Me2SO (vehicle for fMLF; 0.2% of the volume in which cells were stimulated); (ii) PMA (100 ng/ml) and fMLF (50 μm); (iii) PMA (100 ng/ml); or (iv) PMA (100 ng/ml) plus Aβ (10 μm). Each condition was tested in triplicate, and the mean of the mean number (grand mean) of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable relative light units throughout the duration of the assay and the corresponding standard errors of grand means were calculated. Differences between conditions were tested for significance by two-tailed paired t tests or unequal variance tests (Mann-Whitney rank sum) where appropriate. A value ofp < 0.05 indicated significant differences. Wild type littermates of an F7 backcross of 129/sV FPR −/− mice with C57Bl/6 mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and brains from three mice were removed, pooled, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Brain tissue was sliced in a Petri dish on ice using a clean razor blade and homogenized in an ice-cold Teflon homogenizer. RNA was extracted using the RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers were used for PCR amplification of the cDNA using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For mouse FPR2, the 5′ primer 5′-TCTACCATCTCCAGAGTTCTGTGG and 3′ primer 5′-TTACATCTACCACAATGTGAACTA were used to generate a 268-base pair product. The PCR conditions for amplification were 3 min at 95 °C for the initial melting followed by 30 cycles of 1 min of melting at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, 2 min of synthesis at 72 °C, with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C and cooling to 4 °C. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel in TBE containing 10 μg of ethidium bromide/100 ml. Data were recorded on a UVP Gel Imaging System (Appropriate Technical Resource, Laurel, MD). For analysis of the N9 microglial cell line, RT-PCR was performed with 0.5 μg of total RNA extracted from cells treated with 300 ng/ml LPS for different time periods (High Fidelity ProSTARTM HF System, Stratagene, Kingsport, TN). The procedure consisted of a 15-min reverse transcription at 37 °C, 1-min inactivation of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C (30 s), annealing at 55 °C (30 s), and extension at 72 °C (1 min), with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Primers for murine β-actin gene were used as controls (Stratagene). The RT-PCR products at different dilutions were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Using induction of calcium flux as a highly sensitive and specific real time assay of receptor activation, we screened a panel of stable cell lines transfected with plasmids encoding the known phagocyte formylpeptide receptors (human and mouse FPR, human FPRL1R, and mouse FPR2), four chemokine receptors (human CCR1, CCR5, CCR8, and CX3CR1), the mouse lipoxin A4 receptor (encoded by mouseFpr-rs1), and an orphan receptor highly related in sequence to formylpeptide receptors (Fpr-rs3), as well as untransfected control cells, for responsiveness to 10 μmAβ (Fig. 1). This concentration was chosen based on Aβ dose-response studies published previously for human neutrophils and monocytes and rat microglial cells (13Bianca V.D. Dusi S. Bianchini E. Pra I.D. Rossi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15493-15499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The lipoxin A4 receptor and Fpr-rs3 were included because of their high sequence similarity to the formylpeptide receptors (37Gao J.-L. Chen H. Filie J.D. Kozak C.A. Murphy P.M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aβ induced a response in HEK 293 cells expressing FPRL1R and FPR2, which are human and mouse low affinity formylpeptide receptors, respectively. Activation of each receptor produced a robust transient that was similar in magnitude and duration to the response induced by the prototypical N-formylpeptide fMLF in the same cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and was similar kinetically to the transients induced by other classic chemoattractants and chemokines (Fig. 1). Aβ was specific for these receptors, since none of the other cell lines tested responded. The CCR1, CCR5, CCR8, and CX3CR1 and the human and mouse FPR (high affinity formylpeptide receptor) cell lines did respond to appropriate known agonists as previously described (34Hartt J.K. Barish G. Murphy P.M. Gao J-L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J.

The Fpr-rs1 andFpr-rs3 cell lines were unresponsive to fMLF but did respond to ATP through an endogenous signaling pathway. Although RNA forFpr-rs1 and Fpr-rs3 is present in these two cell lines, we have not yet obtained direct evidence of receptor protein expression. Aβ signaling could be completely blocked by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (Fig. 1, column 1,tracing labeled FPR2 + PTX), which inactivates Gi type G proteins. Pertussis toxin also blocks signaling by other FPR2 agonists (34Hartt J.K. Barish G. Murphy P.M. Gao J-L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42Liang T.S.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When FPR2- and FPRL1R-expressing cells were sequentially stimulated with 10 μm Aβ, they responded to the first but not the second stimulus (Fig. 1, column 1,tracing labeled FPR2, and data not shown) indicating homologous desensitization of the signal transduction pathway, which is characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (44Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ and fMLF reciprocally interfered with each other's signaling at FPR2 (Fig. 2, A and B) in a concentration-dependent manner, providing further evidence that both agonists act at the same receptor. This was specific, since Aβ did not affect signaling by agonists acting at any of the other receptors considered (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Aβ induced calcium flux in both FPR2- and FPRL1R-transfected HEK 293 cells in a graded concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 5 μm (Fig.3 A). In contrast, HEK 293 cells expressing either mouse or human FPR did not respond to Aβ from 0.5 to 20 μm (Fig. 3 A). However, all four cell lines responded to fMLF in a concentration-dependent manner, with EC50 consistent with those previously reported (data not shown; Ref. 34Hartt J.K. Barish G. Murphy P.M. Gao J-L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To test whether native FPR2 also functions as an Aβ receptor, we first focused on primary mouse neutrophils, which, as we have previously shown, express FPR2 endogenously (34Hartt J.K. Barish G. Murphy P.M. Gao J-L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and which can be analyzed in an FPR-deficient background due to the availability of FPR knockout mice (41Gao J-L. Lee E.J"
https://openalex.org/W2002143409,"In the conversion from colorless leucoanthocyanidin to colored anthocyanidin 3-glucoside, at least two enzymes, anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-GT), are postulated to be involved. Despite the importance of this reaction sequence for coloring in anthocyanin biosynthesis, the biochemical reaction mechanism has not been clarified, and the possible involvement of a dehydratase has not been excluded. Here we show that recombinant ANSs from several model plant species, snapdragon, petunia, torenia, and maize, catalyze the formation of anthocyanidin in vitro through a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation of leucoanthocyanidin. Crude extracts of Escherichia coli, expressing recombinant ANSs from these plant species, and purified recombinant enzymes of petunia and maize catalyzed the formation of anthocyanidin in the presence of ferrous ion, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate. The in vitro formation of colored cyanidin 3-glucoside from leucocyanidin, via a cyanidin intermediate, was demonstrated using petunia ANS and 3-GT. The entire reaction sequence did not require any additional dehydratase but was dependent on moderate acidic pH conditions following the enzymatic steps. The present study indicated that the in vivo cytosolic reaction sequence involves an ANS-catalyzed 2-oxoglutarate-dependent conversion of leucoanthocyanidin (flavan-3,4-cis-diol) to 3-flaven-2,3-diol (pseudobase), most probably through 2,3-desaturation and isomerization, followed by glucosylation at the C-3 position by 3-GT.

Although anthocyanidin is the first colored metabolite in the biosynthetic pathway, it is hardly detected in plant tissues because of its instability. Anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is the first stable colored metabolite detected in plants. The entire reaction formally involves dehydrogenation at C-2, dehydration at C-3 and C-4, and glucosylation at the hydroxyl group of C-3. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS)1is presumed to catalyze the first half of the reaction involving dehydrogenation at C-2 and dehydration at C-3 and C-4. cDNAs and genes that presumably encode ANS have been isolated from several plant species (4Menssen A.

The involvement of ANS in this step is supported by the ability of a cDNA encoding maize ANS to restore anthocyanin formation in an ANS − mutant of maize, through transient expression by particle bombardment (4Menssen A. Höhmann S. Martin W. Schnable P.S. Peterson P.A. Saedler H. Gierl A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3051-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison with deduced amino acid sequences of these ANSs suggested that they belong to a family of soluble oxygenases depending upon 2-oxoglutarate (13De Carolis E. De Luca V. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Prescott A.G. John P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 245-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The precise biochemical reaction mechanism from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin has not been clarified to date. As shown in Fig.2, three possible mechanisms have been postulated for the reaction sequence from leucoanthocyanidin to 3-flaven-2,3-diol (pseudobase), which is chemically converted into anthocyanidin (flavylium ion) by removal of the C-2 hydroxyl anion. In the first mechanism (2Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advance in Research Since 1986. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 499-535Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, pathway (A)), ANS catalyzes a desaturation at the C-2 and C-3 positions of (2R,3S,4S)-leucoanthocyanidin (15Stafford H.A. Lester H.H. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Ruhnau B. Forkmann G. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 1035-1039Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and molecular oxygen, yielding 2-flaven-3,4-diol, with concomitant release of CO2, succinate, and H2O. After isomerization of the 2,3-double bond to the 3,4-position of 2-flaven-3,4-diol, by removal of the hydroxyl group at C-4, double bond migration, and insertion of a hydroxyl group at C-2, 3-flaven-2,3-diol is formed. Alternatively, ANS may catalyze a hydroxylation at the C-2 position of leucoanthocyanidin, followed by 3,4-dehydration (1Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advance in Research Since 1980. Chapman & Hall, London1988: 399-425Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, pathway (B)). In the third postulation, 3,4-dehydration occurs as the first step, followed by a hydroxylation at C-2 (1Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advance in Research Since 1980. Chapman & Hall, London1988: 399-425Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, pathway(C)). The last two assumptions (pathways B and C) imply that the formation of 3-flaven-2,3-diol may require not only ANS but also a specific dehydratase catalyzing 3,4-dehydration. Alternatively, ANS may catalyze the dehydration of the reaction. So far there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of an external dehydratase in the whole reaction sequence, except for a preliminary report describing a genetic locus that possibly encodes a dehydratase in snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) (17Martin C. Gerats T. Jordan B. Molecular Biology of Flowers. CIB International, Wallingford, UK1992: 219-255Google Scholar). To date, in vitro biochemical analysis regarding this crucial reaction for anthocyanin biosynthesis has only been carried out with recombinant ANS from Perilla frutescens (10Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recombinant perilla ANS was shown to catalyze the formation of anthocyanidin from leucoanthocyanidin according to a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent manner when followed by an acidification with HCl. It is necessary to verify this important reaction mechanism with ANSs from various model plant species for anthocyanin biosynthesis under in vivo conditions, where ANS is combined with a UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-GT) at cytosolic and vacuolar pH. The second half of the reaction (Fig. 1), the formation of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside from anthocyanidin, has also not been completely clarified. From intertissue complementation assays in maize (18Reddy G.M. Coe E.H. Science. 1962; 138: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) it has been generally assumed that leucoanthocyanidin first is converted to 3-flaven-2,3-diol (pseudobase) by ANS and is then glucosylated by 3-GT (1Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advance in Research Since 1980. Chapman & Hall, London1988: 399-425Crossref Google Scholar). No in vitro biochemical experimental evidence has been provided to confirm the reaction sequence from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin 3-glucoside, although 3-GT activity has been detected in crude enzyme preparations of various plant species (19Dooner H.K. Nelson O.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kho K.F.F. Kamsteeg J. van Brederode J. Z.

Hahlbrock K. Harborne J.B. Mabry T.J. The Flavonoids: Advances in Research. Chapman & Hall, London1982: 641-679Crossref Google Scholar) and in preparations containing recombinant 3-GT (23Tanaka Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9224-9233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The reaction sequence catalyzed by ANS and 3-GT is postulated to occur in the cytosol, followed by transport into vacuoles, where the colored anthocyanin (flavylium ion) is formed as a consequence of the acidic pH (25Mol J. Grotewold E. Koes R. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 212-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (682) Google Scholar). However, no in vitro experimental evidence for this hypothesis has been provided yet. Therefore, it is also necessary to examine whether anthocyanidin 3-glucoside can be formed from leucoanthocyanidin using both ANS and 3-GT recombinant proteins under physiological conditions, where enzyme reactions take place under cytosolic conditions (pH 7) followed by a shift to vacuolar conditions (pH 5) (26Steahelin L.A. Newcomb E.H. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, Maryland2000: 2-50Google Scholar). In the present study, we expressed and functionally verified, for the first time, four recombinant ANSs from snapdragon (A. majus), petunia (Petunia hybrida), torenia (Torenia fournieri), and maize (Zea mays). The reaction catalyzed by these ANSs was shown to proceed via a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenation of leucoanthocyanidin in the formation of anthocyanidin. Evidence, which implicates that ANS catalyzes the reaction from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin in the absence of an external dehydratase or strong acid conditions, is provided. We show that the combination of recombinant ANS and 3-GT was sufficient and essential to yield cyanidin 3-glucoside from leucocyanidin under physiological conditions, by mimicking cytosolic enzyme reactions and transport into vacuoles. The cDNA clones Candi and A2, encoding ANS ofA. majus (5Martin C. Prescott A. Mackay S. Bartlett J. Vrijlandt E. Plant J. 1991; 1: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and Z. mays (4Menssen A. Höhmann S. Martin W. Schnable P.S. Peterson P.A. Saedler H. Gierl A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3051-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), were kind gifts from Dr. Cathie Martin and Dr. Alfons Gierl, respectively. The cDNA clone TAN1, encoding ANS from T. fournieri cv. Summer Wave Blue (Suntory Ltd.) was isolated as described previously (12Nakajima J. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Saito K. Plant Biotech. 2000; 17: 331-335Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding petunia ANS was isolated by PCR screening of a cDNA library constructed from P. hybrida cv. Surfinia (Suntory Ltd.) using the forward primer 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GTG AAT GCA GTA GTT ACA AC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCT CTA GAA CTC GTG ATT CCA ACA CAT CAT C-3′. Amplification was carried out for 25 cycles at the following conditions: 94 °C/0.5 min, 55 °C/1.5 min, 72 °C/2.8 min. The nucleotide sequence was verified by sequence analysis using the dideoxy chain termination method with Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a DNA sequencer (model DSQ-2000L; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and was shown to be identical with the published sequence (6Weiss D. van der Luit A.H. Kroon J.T.M. Mol J.N.M. Kooter J.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cDNA clonePGT8, encoding petunia 3-GT (GenBankTM accession number AB027454), was isolated fromP. hybrida cv. Surfinia. 2Yamazaki et al., submitted for publication. AnEcoRI site and XbaI site was created at the 5′- and 3′-terminal ends, respectively, of the coding region ofANS by PCR amplification with each primer set as follows: for snapdragon ANS, 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GCA CCG GCA ATA GCT CCA CCC TCA CGG G-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAT TAC TCA ACA ACC TTC TCA TCT TGT TTC CGA T-3′; for torenia ANS, 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GTT TCT CCA GCA TCT CCG AGC CCG GCC C-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAT CAC TCA ACA CTC TTA TCA TCA TGC TCA ACA-3′; for maize ANS, 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GAG TCG TCG CCG CTG CTG-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAT CAG TTG GTC TGC GGC GGC GGC-3′. For petunia ANS, an EcoRI site andXbaI site were created by PCR screening using the primer set as above. The amplified fragments were ligated into theEcoRI-XbaI site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to afford pMSDA1 (snapdragon), pMPTA9 (petunia), pMTOA6 (torenia), and pMMZA3 (maize), respectively. An XbaI site and PstI site were created at the 5′- and 3′-terminal ends of the coding region of petunia 3-GT by PCR amplification with the primer set 5′-GCT CTA GAA TGA CTA CTT CTC AAC TTC ACA-3′ and 5′-AAC TGC AGT CAA GTA AGC TTG TGA CAT TTA-3′. The amplified fragment was ligated into the XbaI-PstI site of pMAL-c2 to afford p3GTM7. The ANSs and 3-GT were expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein (MBP, 42.7 kDa) at the N terminus. Each vector was introduced into E. coli Nova Blue for overexpression. E. coli Nova Blue carrying recombinant ANS (pMSDA1, pMPTA9, pMTOA6, and pMMZA3) and recombinant 3-GT (p3GTM7) was cultured in the liquid medium (tryptone, 10 g/liter; yeast extract, 5 g/liter; NaCl, 5 g/liter) supplemented with glucose (2 g/liter) and ampicillin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C. Gene expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 28 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and disrupted by sonication in Buffer A (20 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, soluble protein extracts were obtained. For purification, the MBP-tagged ANS proteins from petunia and maize were then subjected to amylose resin column chromatography (New England Biolabs) in Buffer B (20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm maltose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 8% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Western blotting and immunostaining were performed on an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) using phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphatep-toluidine/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a substrate. The rabbit primary antibodies were prepared against the His-tagged recombinant ANS from P. frutescens (10Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and applied at a 1:200 dilution. (2R,3S,4R)-leucocyanidin and (2R,3S,4R)-leucopelargonidin were purchased from Plant Chemistry Industrial Research (Lower Hutt, New Zealand). These are stereoisomers of natural leucoanthocyanidins having 2R,3S,4S stereochemistry and are easily converted to natural isomers in the reaction mixture through a mechanism via 4-carbocation formed by removal of the hydroxyl anion from the C-4 position (28Attwood M.R. Brown B.R. Pike W.T. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1983; I: 2229-2235Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Stafford H.A. Lester H.H. Porter L.J. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 333-338Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 µl), containing 20 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 4 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.4 mm FeSO4, 1 mm 2-oxoglutaric acid, 1 mmleucoanthocyanidin, and 300–500 µg of ANS protein, was incubated at 30 °C for an appropriate period. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 µl of concentrated HCl and/or by extraction with 100 µl of isoamyl alcohol, and anthocyanidins were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC was carried out using a YMC-ODS-A312 column (diameter, 6 mm × 150 mm) with CH3OH-CH3COOH-H2O (20:15:65) as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The quantity of anthocyanidin was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 520 nm. The quantitative calibration curves were obtained with standard anthocyanidins. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a protein determination kit (Bio-Rad). The standard reaction mixture (200 µl), containing 20 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 4 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.4 mm FeSO4, 1 mm 2-oxoglutaric acid, 1 mm leucoanthocyanidin, 1 mm UDP-glucose, 300–500 µg of ANS and 3-GT proteins each, was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min for the coexistence reaction. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2 µl of concentrated HCl. The products were extracted with 200 µl of isoamyl alcohol and subjected to HPLC analysis as described above. For sequential reactions, the enzyme protein, either ANS or 3-GT, was first added and incubated for 30 min; then the first enzyme protein was removed by ultrafiltration using Ultrafree-MC (Millipore); and then the second enzyme protein was added and incubated for 30 min. After addition of concentrated HCl and extraction with isoamyl alcohol, the products were analyzed by HPLC. The reaction containing both ANS and 3-GT was carried out in the mixture (600 µl) at pH 7 as described above (the ratio of ANS to 3-GT protein was about 1:9) for 60 min, followed by removal of proteins by ultrafiltration. The product composition was confirmed to be ∼90% cyanidin 3-glucoside and ∼10% cyanidin by HPLC analysis. The filtrate was then divided into three portions (200 µl each) and subjected to changed pH conditions: pH 2 by adding 2 µl of concentrated HCl; pH 5 by adding 1 µl of 20% H3PO4; pH 7 by no addition. The cyanidin 3-glucoside was determined from ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra obtained by spectrometry using a spectrophotometer U-2001 (Hitachi). The open reading frames of cDNAs encoding ANS from snapdragon, torenia, and maize and the cDNA encoding 3-GT from petunia were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pMAL-c2 expression vectors under the control of thetac promoter. The constructs carrying ANS-encoding cDNA from snapdragon, torenia, and maize and 3-GT-encoding cDNA from petunia were named pMSDA1, pMTOA6, pMMZA3, and p3GTM7, respectively. The construct, pMPTA9, was generated by subcloning the coding region of the petunia ANS-encoding cDNA, including the 78-base pair nucleotide sequence of the 3′-flanking region, into pMAL-c2. The vectors were used to transform E. coli Nova Blue. The empty vector, pMAL-c2, was applied as a negative control, and pLMK1, carrying the ANS-encoding cDNA from perilla (10Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), was introduced intoE. coli as a positive control for the expression of catalytically active recombinant protein. The ANSs and 3-GT were overexpressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with MBP and exhibited a greater molecular mass than expected due to the presence of MBP (42.7 kDa). Soluble protein extracts of the transformed E. coli were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm expression (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2–6 and 9). Western blot analysis indicated that each recombinant ANS preparation contained antigens of the expected molecular mass when an antibody raised against recombinant perilla ANS (10Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was employed (Fig. 3 A). This cross-reactivity can be attributed to the relatively high identities (47.6–72.8%) shared between the deduced amino acid sequences of the four ANS-encoding cDNAs and the perilla ANS-encoding cDNA. Recombinant ANSs from petunia and maize were purified by affinity chromatography using an amylose resin column (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). The expression of recombinant petunia 3-GT was shown by the presence of an extra band of the expected molecular mass (92 kDa) (Fig. 3, lane 9). Crude protein extracts of E. coli transformed with pMSDA1, pMPTA9, pMTOA6, and pMMZA3 were assayed for ANS activity in the presence of cofactors and leucocyanidin as a substrate. The identity of cyanidin formed by the in vitro reaction was confirmed by co-chromatography of the reaction product with a standard using HPLC. Representative results using petunia ANS, indicating the enzymatic formation of cyanidin from leucocyanidin, are shown in Fig. 4. In the standard procedure of the assay, HCl was added to the reaction mixture to terminate the reaction prior to isoamyl alcohol extraction and subsequent HPLC analysis. However, even without addition of HCl, the same amount of cyanidin was formed. These results indicate that HCl acidification is not absolutely necessary, but isoamyl alcohol extraction and the acidic conditions found during HPLC analysis (pH 2.0–2.2) were sufficient for the formation of anthocyanidin. Furthermore, petunia ANS could also catalyze the formation of pelargonidin from leucopelargonidin (Fig. 4 F), despite an absence of pelargonidin-type pigments in petunia. Cyanidin was formed by extracts of E. coli expressing recombinant ANS from all of the different plant species (Fig.5), although cyanidin formation did not show linearity with time after 10 min of incubation, most likely because synthesized cyanidin decomposed due to an inherent instability or because ANSs were inactivated during the incubation.Figure 5Time course study for cyanidin formation catalyzed by various recombinant ANSs. Each reaction was carried out in the presence of crude protein extracts of E. colitransformed with pMPTA9 (petunia ANS, ▪), pMMZA3 (maize ANS, ▴), pMSDA1 (snapdragon ANS, ♦), pLMK1 (perilla ANS, ○), and pMTOA6 (torenia ANS, ●), respectively. The enzymatic assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified recombinant MBP-ANSs also exhibited ANS activity and were able to catalyze the formation of cyanidin (TableI). The specific activities for the formation of cyanidin were 0.972 and 0.215 microkatal/kg of protein for petunia MBP-ANS and maize MBP-ANS, respectively, obtained by initial velocities of 5 min of incubation. These results indicated that, for the conversion of leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin, only ANS is required, and no additional dehydratase is needed.Table ICofactor requirement of the reaction catalyzed by purified MBP-ANSConditionEnzymatic activitypetunia ANSmaize ANSmicrokatal/kgComplete0.972 ± 0.020.215 ± 0.01− Ascorbate<0.001<0.001− Ferrous ion<0.001<0.001− 2-oxoglutarate<0.001<0.001− O2<0.001<0.001Boiled enzyme<0.001<0.001For determination of initial velocities, the reaction for cyanidin formation was carried out for 5 min at 30 °C.

Data are mean values of triplicate incubations ± S.D. Open table in a new tab For determination of initial velocities, the reaction for cyanidin formation was carried out for 5 min at 30 °C. Complete reaction mixture (100 µl) contained 20 mm potassium Pi(pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 0.4 mm FeSO4, 1 mm(2R,3S,4R)-leucocyanidin, and 100–200 µg of purified MBP-ANS protein. Ascorbate, FeSO4, 2-oxoglutarate, or O2 (replaced with N2) was omitted from the complete reaction mixture. Boiled enzyme, the purified MBP-ANS, was heat-treated at 95 °C for 10 min prior to assay. Data are mean values of triplicate incubations ± S.D. The cofactor requirements of the purified recombinant ANSs from petunia and maize were investigated, and the results are summarized in Table I. The formation of cyanidin was absolutely dependent on the presence of ferrous ion, ascorbate, and 2-oxoglutarate. When O2 was substituted with N2, cyanidin production was not observed. These results clearly indicate that ANS belongs to a family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases requiring O2 and ferrous ion. In addition, no dehydrated compound was produced upon incubation of leucocyanidin with purified petunia ANS in the absence of cofactors (data not shown), suggesting that ANS itself has no dehydration activity toward leucoanthocyanidin. To clarify the entire reaction sequence between leucoanthocyanidin and anthocyanidin 3-glucoside, we examined combinatory and sequential reactions involving both recombinant ANS and 3-GT in vitro. Fig. 6 A shows the reaction products obtained from leucocyanidin by the combined presence of ANS and 3-GT together with the appropriate cofactors for both enzymes (2-oxoglutaric acid, sodium ascorbate, FeSO4, and UDP-glucose). Both cyanidin and cyanidin 3-glucoside were formed. Upon the sequential reaction of ANS followed by 3-GT, where the intermediates were only exposed to one enzyme at a time, the main product was cyanidin 3-glucoside, despite the presence of cyanidin (Fig. 6 B). However, upon the opposite sequential reaction,i.e. 3-GT followed by ANS, only cyanidin was formed by the action of ANS; no cyanidin 3-glucoside was produced (Fig.6 C). Furthermore, no glucosylated compound could be detected when only 3-GT was incubated with leucocyanidin (data not shown), indicating that petunia 3-GT does not accept leucoanthocyanidin as a substrate. These results indicate that the reaction sequence from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin 3-glucoside involves anthocyanidin formation from leucoanthocyanidin as the first step, followed by 3-glucosylation of anthocyanidin as the second step. More importantly, only two enzymes, ANS and 3-GT, are necessary and sufficient for the catalysis of the sequential reactions leading from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin 3-glucoside. Therefore, no additional enzyme(s) such as dehydratase are required to complete the entire reaction sequence. Thein vivo conditions involved in the transport of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside into vacuoles were mimicked in vitro, whereby the sequential reactions of ANS and 3-GT yielding cyanidin 3-glucoside as ∼90% of the products were followed by a shift in pH. After the incubation with both enzymes at pH 7 (cytosolic pH), the enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration, and a part of the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 2 or 5 (vacuolar pH) or maintained at pH 7 (cytosolic pH). The ultraviolet and visible spectra of all of the reaction products under these pH conditions were identical with those of standard cyanidin 3-glucoside (Fig.7). These results indicate that the initial reaction product of ANS and 3-GT under neutral cytosolic conditions most likely is the pseudobase of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside and that the flavylium ion of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is formed after the pseudobase has been transported into the acidic environment of vacuoles (pH 5). Most reactions involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis have been biochemically characterized with purified enzyme preparations and recombinant proteins (31Holton T.A. Cornish E.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka Y. Tsuda S. Kusumi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1119-1126Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the reactions from leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin 3-glucoside (Fig. 1) have not been well characterized. In particular, the reaction catalyzed by ANS has not been well documented, because the detection of ANS activityin vitro has not been possible with crude enzyme preparations or recombinant proteins. Our recent study on P. frutescens ANS was the only evidence provided for the formation of anthocyanidin by ANS (10Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), although this study could not completely exclude the possible involvement of an external dehydratase in a variety of model plant species. The present study indicated that all tested putative ANSs (not only perilla ANS) were capable of catalyzing the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent reaction that converts leucoanthocyanidin to an oxidized metabolite, in the absence of additional enzyme(s) such as a dehydratase, which can be readily converted to anthocyanidin by acidification. Furthermore, the inclusion of an in vitro 3-GT reaction and the effect of a pH shift that mimics transport of the glucoside into vacuoles have provided evidence for a plausible in vivo reaction sequence (as shown in Fig. 8). Namely, the 3-GT reaction takes place after the ANS reaction, and the actual substrate of the 3-GT is therefore most likely the pseudobase form of anthocyanidin present at cytosolic pH (pH 7), not the leucoanthocyanidin. The pseudobase form of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is then transported into vacuoles, where the colored flavylium ion of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is formed as a result of the acidic pH conditions of vacuoles. In the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, there are four reactions that are catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases: ANS (10, present study), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (33British L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Britsch L. Ruhnau-Brich B. Forkmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5380-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), flavonol synthase (35Holton T.A. Brugliera F. Tanaka Y. Plant J. 1993; 4: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and flavone synthase I (36Britsch L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All these reactions are concerned with oxidation at the C-2 and/or C-3 position of the flavonoid skeleton. In the reaction of flavone synthase I, the direct double bond formation at C-2 and C-3 of flavanone was proposed (36Britsch L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because no stable hydroxylated intermediates were detected in the reactions of ANS, flavonol synthase, or flavone synthase I, the mechanism involving direct 2,3-desaturation seems to be the most likely route for the formation of 2-flaven-3,4-diol (Fig. 8). Regarding the reaction mechanism of flavone synthase I, a radical mechanism was proposed for the direct 2,3-dehydrogenation of flavanone (36Britsch L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the proposed pathway A (Fig. 2) for the formation of the key compound, 2-flaven-3,4-diol, three mechanisms are possible: (i) direct dehydrogenation from C-2 and C-3, probably by a radical mechanism; (ii) hydroxylation at C-2 of leucoanthocyanidin to give flavan-2,3,4-triol and subsequent 2,3-dehydration to 2-flaven-3,4-diol (a modified pathway B in Fig. 2); (iii) hydroxylation at C-3 to give flavan-3,3,4-triol, spontaneous dehydration into 3-oxo-flavan-4-ol, and subsequent keto-enol isomerization to 2-flaven-3,4-diol. However, the route via flavan-2,3,4-triol (ii) may require a dehydratase, either leading to 2-flaven-3,4-diol or to 3-flaven-2,3-diol. If this dehydration indeed takes place, it is now evident that no external dehydratase is required, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that ANS itself may catalyze the dehydration of flavan-2,3,4-triol (pathway B in Fig. 2, for example). Because the present study provided evidence that ANS does not catalyze the dehydration of leucoanthocyanidin (pathway C in Fig. 2), it is unlikely that ANS is capable of catalyzing the dehydration of flavan-2,3,4-triol, because it has a similar structure to that of leucoanthocyanidin. In addition, currently there is no report that describes an additional dehydratase activity by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, although ANS may act to promote the dehydration as a general acid-base catalyst due to the common nature of proteins. The mechanism involving C-3 hydroxylation (iii) may be more plausible in analogy to the reaction catalyzed by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. To elucidate the detailed mechanism of 3-flaven-2,3-diol formation, further investigation may be required. Fig. 8 illustrates the most probable reaction mechanism from leucoanthocyanidin (flavan-3,4-diol) to the colored anthocyanidin 3-glucoside (flavylium ion) obtained in this study. The reaction catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases has been postulated to proceed in two steps (37Baldwin, J. E., Adilington, R. M., Aplin, R. T., Crouch, N. P., Schofield, C. J., and Ting, H. H. (1987)J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1654–1656.Google Scholar, 38Akhtar M. Wright J.N. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1991; 8: 527-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Prescott A.G. J. Exp. Bot. 1993; 44: 849-861Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Feig A.L. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 759-805Crossref Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In the first step, ANS binds with ferrous ion, which acts as a catalytic center of the reaction, and composes a complex with molecular oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate, followed by the formation of an oxoferryl enzyme complex, succinate, and CO2. This first step is common to all 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. In the second step, the oxoferryl species is used for the hydrogen radical abstraction from C-2 and C-3 or hydroxylation at C-2 or C-3, followed by spontaneous or, less likely, ANS-catalyzed dehydration that yields 2-flaven-3,4-diol and H2O. Subsequently, isomerization of the hydroxyl group and double bond of 2-flaven-3,4-diol occurs spontaneously to yield the thermodynamically more stable 3-flaven-2,3-diol (pseudobase) (41Brouillard R. Lang J. Can. J. Chem. 1990; 68: 755-761Crossref Google Scholar) at cytosolic pH. The 3-GT catalyzes 3-O-glucosylation of the pseudobase form under cytosolic neutral conditions. The pseudobase form of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is then transported into vacuoles; and under the moderate acidic condition of vacuoles (pH 5), the colored flavylium ion of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is formed by removal of the hydroxyl anion from the C-2 position of the pseudobase form. For the net formation of colored anthocyanidin 3-glucoside (flavylium ion form) from leucoanthocyanidin, only two enzymes, ANS and 3-GT, are therefore required, and the change of pH following transport of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside into vacuoles is sufficient and essential for the coloring of anthocyanidin 3-glucoside (or more modified anthocyanins). It has been suggested that ANS and 3-GT might work as a multienzyme complex (2Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advance in Research Since 1986. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 499-535Crossref Google Scholar). If an ANS-3-GT complex were formed to catalyze the sequential reactions, the intermediate of the reactions, anthocyanidin, could then be rapidly channeled between these two enzymes. However, no evidence has been provided for the channeling of the intermediate (Fig.6). In addition, our recent study with yeast two-hybrid experiments suggests that there is no apparent interaction between ANS and 3-GT from P. frutescens. 3K. Saito et al., unpublished observations. Because a protein-protein interaction between several anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes of Arabidopsis has been reported recently (42Burbulis I.E. Shirley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12929-12934Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), a more complicated organization of the entire biosynthetic machinery may be involved. We thank Dr. C. Martin, Dr. A.

In the prevailing model of phototransduction (1Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), light-excited rhodopsin interacts with the GDP form of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin and stimulates GDP-GTP exchange on its α-subunit (Tα). GTP-Tα separates from its counterpart, the βγ subunit of transducin (Tβγ), and binds the inhibitory subunit (Pγ) of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE), thus releasing the constraint of Pγ on the catalytic subunits (Pα and Pβ) of PDE. The resulting decrease in cytoplasmic cGMP leads to the closure of cGMP-gated channels and the hyperpolarization of photoreceptor plasma membranes. Although the signaling cascade of ROS has been intensively studied during the past two decades, the whole mechanism has not yet been elucidated (for review see Ref. 2Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S.

A. 1989; 86: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The lipid modification of signaling proteins has recently been discussed in connection with its ability to lead proteins to cholesterol- and sphingolipids-enriched membrane microdomains called lipid rafts (9Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that lipid rafts exist in a separate phase from the rest of the bilayer, in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase described in model membranes. Surrounding fluid membrane is in a state similar to the liquid-disordered (ld) phase. Biochemically, the components of lipid rafts are characterized by their insolubility in the detergent Triton X-100 (10London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid microdomains or rafts exist in eukaryotic cell membranes where they have important functions (11Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Trimeric G proteins have also been implicated in signal transduction in the raft (12Rehm A. Pleogh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Here, we have characterized the detergent-insoluble fraction of bovine photoreceptor ROS using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. We demonstrate that important signaling proteins such as transducin and PDE exert massive translocation between detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) and detergent-soluble membrane domains, depending on their activation steps. The importance of raft-like membrane domains on disc membranes in phototransduction will be discussed.DISCUSSIONAlthough the lateral organization of membrane lipids on the disc membrane of ROS has been expected, there has been no concrete evidence to support the presence of raft-like phases in ROS. However, we have found that a low-density buoyant fraction, i.e. a DRM, can be prepared from bovine photoreceptor disc membranes, suggesting that there are raft-like lipid domains in ROS. Here we have explored the effect of light and the unhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS on the distribution of photosignaling proteins in this raft-like fraction of ROS.First, we found that all transducins in the dark-adapted ROS, seemingly GDP-Tαβγ, were detergent-soluble, whereas light exposure elicited the recruitment of a considerable amount of transducins to DRM. Insolubility in detergents like Triton X-100 is observed in lipid bilayers that exist in physical states in which lipid packing is tight (10London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Thus, in the dark condition, transducins seem to be localized in detergent-soluble fluid membrane domains of disc membranes. On the contrary, at least a portion of transducin seems to be recruited to a raft-like tightly packed lipid phase on disc membranes. The addition of GTPγS to light-bleached ROS prior to solubilization inhibited this recruitment. Because light-bleached rhodopsin (Rh*) has high affinity to GDP-Tαβγ (19Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GTPγS inhibited the recruitment of transducin to DRM in light-bleached ROS, the transducin-binding site in DRM is highly likely rhodopsin. In addition, it should be emphasized that, although the distribution pattern of rhodopsin along the sucrose density gradient was apparently constant in all conditions, that of transducin was drastically changed by light exposure of ROS. Light-dependent recruitment of transducin to DRM might be explained in two ways: 1) Rh* binds with GDP-Tαβγ in the detergent-soluble regions of ROS membranes, and then the complex was recruited to the DRM; 2) some rhodopsins are originally localized on DRM, and when bleached, they recruit GDP-Tαβγ from detergent-soluble membrane. In the former case, light-dependent increase in rhodopsin should be observed with the assembly of transducin to the DRM, though no increase in the amount of rhodopsin in DRM was detected. Thus, this hypothesis seems to be unlikely. However, to exclude this hypothesis, more accurate measurement of rhodopsin, which is bound by transducin, in DRM should be done. On the other hand, the latter explanation seems to fit well with our data, though it may require heterogeneity of rhodopsin in the disc membrane as a basal assumption. Our data suggest that there are two rhodopsin pools in ROS, one in DRM and one in the detergent-soluble membranes. Rh* on DRM seems to have a priority to make contact with GDP-Tαβγ, in comparison to Rh* in the detergent-soluble membranes. So far, it is difficult to estimate the real size of the pool of rhodopsin on the raft-like phase in native ROS. The experiment shown in Fig. 1 may lead us to underestimate the amount of Rh*·GDP-Tαβγ complex on the raft-like phase in native system if it exists, because we used a detergent to prepare the raft-like membranes from ROS. A detergent-independent preparation method of rafts (20Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) may be useful to assess the real size of such a rhodopsin pool. So far, our data indicate that at least ∼10% of rhodopsin in ROS localizes in the raft-like phase, and a certain group of transducins selectively interacts with them. The functional significance of the rhodopsin in DRM and that of the transducin having affinity to such Rh* are obscure by this time. Exploration on the localization of the raft-like phase on disc membranes may clarify their roles in phototransduction.By contrast, PDE showed light- and GTPγS-dependent translocation from the detergent-soluble to the DRM fractions. As isoprenyl moieties on peripheral membrane proteins are considered to be a negative targeting signal to lipid rafts (21Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the two isoprenyl residues on Pαβ may cause its exclusion from the raft-like domains on the disc membrane. Proteins in ld phase membranes are soluble in Triton X-100 (10London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with the high detergent-solubility of unexcited PDE. Further, we speculate that the activation of PDE may bring about a conformational change of PDE, which might reduce its targeting signal to the ld phase presumably by rearranging the two isoprenyl moieties to an unexposed location.In addition to such a reduction in the negative targeting signal, however, a component, either protein or lipid, or a physical condition of the DRM is probably required to recruit activated PDE to the DRM. As cholesterol depletion by MCD selectively but partially releases PDE from the DRM, cholesterol seems to contribute, at least in part, to the recruitment of PDE to DRM. The incomplete solubilization of PDE by MCD suggests, however, that there is an additional component(s) or a physical condition that holds PDE in the DRM.A stimulus-dependent assembly of proteins, including PDE, at the rim region of the disc membrane has been proposed (22Koerschen M.G. Beyermann M. Mueller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The contribution of GARP2 (63,000 Da) has been implicated both in this PDE assembly and in the inhibition of PDE. So far, however, we have not observed a 63,000-Da protein that co-translocates with PDE to DRM, though the existence of GARP2 in DRM has not been excluded.It should be noted that the molecular activity of PDE in the DRM prepared from light- and GTPγS-stimulated ROS seemed not to be suppressed. Apparent molecular activity of PDE in the DRM was suppressed only partially, although almost the same proportions of Pγ and Pαβ were co-localized as discussed above. We have observed uni- or multilamellar vesicles (100–200 nm in diameter) in the DRM fraction by electron microscopy. 2M. Mieda, M. Kishimoto, H. Liu, K. Seno, T. Suzaki, and F. Hayashi, unpublished observation. Therefore, the apparent suppression of the activity is highly likely because of the inaccessibility of cGMP to enzymes facing the inner surface of the vesicles. If this is true, GARP2 would not be a good candidate as an anchor for PDE on DRM, because it strongly inhibits PDE (22Koerschen M.G. Beyermann M. Mueller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).On the other hand, there may be another possible mechanism with which active PDE is anchored to the DRM. We observed major fractions of retina-specific regulator of G protein signaling (RGS9; 55,000 Da) and a novel Gβ subunit (Gβ5L; 44,000 Da) in DRM. 3K. Seno, M. Abe, Y. Higuchi, M. Mieda, Y. Owada, H. Liu, and F. Hayashi, unpublished observation. Because they have a high-affinity to the AlF4−-GDP·Tα·Pγcomplex (23Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that they form multiprotein complex with GTPγS·Tα·Pαβγ2on the raft-like membrane domains on the disc membrane. Although Tα remaining in the DRM was scarcely detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A), such a little portion of Tα may be sufficient for the activation of all PDE in DRM. In any case, to elucidate the mechanism that keeps PDE in its active form despite the co-localization of Pγ in DRM, more accurate measurement of the amounts of PDE and Tαand knowledge about the composition of the multiprotein complex containing the activated PDE in DRM are essentially needed.Conclusively, our data strongly suggested that the raft-like phase in bovine ROS disc membranes are highly likely the place where the signaling proteins involved in phototransduction make contact with each other in their own activation step-dependent manners. By exploring the structure, temporal behavior, and function of this raft-like phase on the disc membranes, deeper insights into phototransduction system of vertebrate photoreceptors and its adaptation mechanism would be obtained. The phototransduction system in the photoreceptor rod outer segments (ROS)1 of vertebrates is a typical G protein-mediated signaling system. In the prevailing model of phototransduction (1Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), light-excited rhodopsin interacts with the GDP form of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin and stimulates GDP-GTP exchange on its α-subunit (Tα). GTP-Tα separates from its counterpart, the βγ subunit of transducin (Tβγ), and binds the inhibitory subunit (Pγ) of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE), thus releasing the constraint of Pγ on the catalytic subunits (Pα and Pβ) of PDE. The resulting decrease in cytoplasmic cGMP leads to the closure of cGMP-gated channels and the hyperpolarization of photoreceptor plasma membranes. Although the signaling cascade of ROS has been intensively studied during the past two decades, the whole mechanism has not yet been elucidated (for review see Ref. 2Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Most of the signaling proteins in ROS are membrane proteins, and they are often modified with lipids. Rhodopsin is modified by tandem palmitic acids at the carboxyl end of the fourth cytoplasmic loop (3Ovchinnikov Y.A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Tα is modified by a fatty acyl chain, and Tγ is both modified by a farnesyl group and carboxymethylated (4Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Pα and Pβ are modified by farnesyl and geranylgeranyl, respectively (7Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H.Y. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Pα subunits are carboxymethylated (8Ong O.C. Ota I.M. Clarke S. Fung B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hayashi, unpublished observation. Therefore, the apparent suppression of the activity is highly likely because of the inaccessibility of cGMP to enzymes facing the inner surface of the vesicles. If this is true, GARP2 would not be a good candidate as an anchor for PDE on DRM, because it strongly inhibits PDE (22Koerschen M.G. Beyermann M. Mueller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there may be another possible mechanism with which active PDE is anchored to the DRM. We observed major fractions of retina-specific regulator of G protein signaling (RGS9; 55,000 Da) and a novel Gβ subunit (Gβ5L; 44,000 Da) in DRM. 3K. Seno, M. Abe, Y. Higuchi, M. Mieda, Y. Owada, H. Liu, and F. Hayashi, unpublished observation. Because they have a high-affinity to the AlF4−-GDP·Tα·Pγcomplex (23Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that they form multiprotein complex with GTPγS·Tα·Pαβγ2on the raft-like membrane domains on the disc membrane. Although Tα remaining in the DRM was scarcely detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A), such a little portion of Tα may be sufficient for the activation of all PDE in DRM. In any case, to elucidate the mechanism that keeps PDE in its active form despite the co-localization of Pγ in DRM, more accurate measurement of the amounts of PDE and Tαand knowledge about the composition of the multiprotein complex containing the activated PDE in DRM are essentially needed. Conclusively, our data strongly suggested that the raft-like phase in bovine ROS disc membranes are highly likely the place where the signaling proteins involved in phototransduction make contact with each other in their own activation step-dependent manners. By exploring the structure, temporal behavior, and function of this raft-like phase on the disc membranes, deeper insights into phototransduction system of vertebrate photoreceptors and its adaptation mechanism would be obtained. We thank Dr. Shohei Maekawa and Dr. Akio Yamazaki for valuable discussions. We also express our gratitude to an anonymous reviewer for making a number of helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript."

The identification of structural elements that are involved in NST functions provides an important task. Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutants defective in nucleotide-sugar transport provide access to inactive transporters that can define such structure/function relationships. In this study, we have cloned the hamster UDP-galactose transporter (UGT) and identified defects in UGT gene transcripts from nine independent Chinese hamster ovary mutants that belong to the Lec8 complementation group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers that span the UGT open reading frame showed that three Lec8 mutants express a full-length open reading frame, while six Lec8 mutants predominantly express truncated UGT gene transcripts. Sequencing identified different single or triplet nucleotide changes in full-length UGT transcripts from three of the mutants. These mutations translate into three different amino acid changes at positions that are highly conserved in all the known mammalian NSTs. Transfection of a cDNA encoding either of the mutations Δserine 213 or G281D failed to correct the UDP-galactose transport defect in Lec8 transfectants. Most importantly, introducing these same mutations into the homologous region of the murine CMP-sialic acid transporter caused inactivation of this transporter. Thus, identifying point mutations that inactivate UGT in Lec8 mutants resulted in the discovery of amino acids that are critical to the activity of both UGT and CST, the two most divergent mammalian NSTs.

Processing enzymes, glycosidases, and glycosyltransferases, are Golgi residents, and their spatial organization in the Golgi stack generally reflects the sequence of biosynthetic steps (1Roth J. Roth J. Berger E.G. The Golgi Apparatus. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 131-161Crossref Google Scholar). The nucleotide-sugars, which are substrates for luminal glycosyltransferases, are produced in the cytoplasm or, in the case of CMP-sialic acid, in the cell nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 2Kean E.L.

The isolation of NST genes, however, succeeded only recently by expression cloning using glycosylation-defective mutants (reviewed in Refs. 4Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Three genetic complementation groups that are affected in the UDP-galactose transporter (UGT) gene have been described: the CHO mutant Lec8 (6Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Complementation cloning was carried out in Had-1 cells and in S. pombe and identified the human (9Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were isolated. Sequence alignments reveal strong conservation of UGTs, since species as distant as human andS. pombe are 40% identical (see Fig. 1 C). Little information exists on the functional modi and architecture of the NSTs. Membrane topology has been determined for the murine CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST) and, in contrast to the theoretically predicted eight transmembrane domains, it was shown to contain 10 transmembrane domains (14Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8779-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of the yeast GDP-mannose transporter, the C-terminal span seems to be essential for the formation of the dimer, while the N-terminal cytosolic tail is required for export from the ER (15Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytosolically located N- and C-terminal tails of murine UGT were found to be dispensable. Deletion of both ends affected neither the activity nor the subcellular destination of the UGT (11Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Iida M. Sudo K. Miura N. Aoki K. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to define functional subdomains in NSTs, Aoki et al. (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) constructed chimeric molecules by exchanging segments of human UGT isoform 1 with the corresponding domains of human CST. As expected from previous truncation experiments (11Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Iida M. Sudo K. Miura N. Aoki K. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic tails were interchangeable. However, exchanges of amino acid stretches that represent potential transmembrane domains inactivated the UGT with a single exception. If the C terminus plus the C-terminal helix of the UGT were replaced by the corresponding segments of human CST, the chimera preserved UGT activity. These data are consistent with experiments of Gao and Dean (18Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and suggest that the C-terminal domain of NSTs is involved in the folding of the transport active site but not in determining substrate specificity. An efficient way to obtain information on structure/function relationships in NSTs is by analyzing molecular defects that cause altered NST activity in mutant cells. Such an analysis in CHO Lec2 cells (defective in Golgi transport of CMP-sialic acid) and in murineHad-1 cells identified two highly conserved amino acids (Gly189 in the hamster CST and Gly178 in the murine UGT) that are likely to participate in the folding of active transporters (11Ishida N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20189-20195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify molecular defects that cause inactivation of the UGT in CHO Lec8 cells. Because galactose is the major acceptor for sialic acid in complex type glycoconjugates (22Cacan R. Duvet S. Kmiecik D. Labiau O. Mir A.M. Verbert A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the lec8 defect interferes with the maturation of sialylated structures. Among the glycotopes that are not synthesized is polysialic acid (PSA), a specific posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (23Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PSA can be detected with high sensitivity and has been shown in recent studies to be an excellent indicator for transformants in which defects in the sialylation pathway are complemented. Expression cloning in combination with PSA detection has been used to identify the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV (24Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study, PSA was a marker in analytical steps carried out to determine the functional consequences of lec8 mutations. Nine independent Lec8 isolates were analyzed at the molecular level. Six were found to express truncated transcripts, while three mutants possess a UGT with a single amino acid change. Amino acids replaced or deleted in the missense mutants are highly conserved residues in all mammalian transporters. Two of these mutations inactivate both the UGT and CST transporters revealing their importance for the correct folding or functional assembly of NSTs. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12CA5, directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYASL, was purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals, and mAb M5, directed against the FLAG sequence MDYKDDDDK, was from Sigma. mAb 735, directed against PSA, has been described (28Frosch M.

A rabbit antiserum against the catalytic domain of α-mannosidase II was a kind gift of Dr. K. Moremen (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). Secondary antibodies used in this study were anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Dianova), anti-mouse Ig-Cy3 conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and anti-rabbit Ig-Alexa488 conjugate (Molecular Probes). CHO K1 (ATCC CCL 61), COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), and Pro−5Lec8 cells (ATCC CRL 1737) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Additional independent Lec8 mutants listed in Table I were selected for lectin resistance and shown by complementation in somatic cell hybrids to belong to the Lec8 complementation group. 6B2 cells belong to complementation group Lec2 and were characterized previously (21Eckhardt M.

A hamster UGT homologue was isolated by colony hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe generated by PCR from the 3′-end (nucleotides 640–1182) of human UGT isoform 1 (UGT1; Ref. 9Miura N.

A CHO-K1 cDNA library was constructed as described earlier (24Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In a first round, 3 × 103 colony forming units were plated per 140-mm dish and after overnight incubation were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. 25 positive colonies were selected and plated on 94-mm dishes. Preparation of the probe, hybridization, and detection of positive colonies were performed as described in the DIG System user's guide for filter hybridization (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In the second hybridization round, 10 colonies gave positive signals on duplicate filters. Positive colonies were picked and amplified in Luria broth (LB) medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and plasmid DNA was isolated using the High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inserts were released by XhoI digestion, and after separation on a 2% agarose gel and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes were verified by a second hybridization step with the digoxigenin-labeled probe described above. Positive clones of >1 kb were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a DNA sequencing kit (AbiPrism). Only one clone, pABE-SO1, contained the full-length hamster UGT sequence in inverse orientation. Total RNA was isolated from CHO and Lec8 cells using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen). Polyadenylated RNA (Poly(A)+ RNA) was selected from total RNA using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA (2 µg/sample) was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose, 1 mformaldehyde gel in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mmsodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and transferred to nylon membranes (Qiagen). Blots were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in high SDS buffer (5× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50% formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) to a digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe. The probe was transcribed from a SacII/PstI fragment containing the 5′-coding region of the hamster UGT subcloned into pBluescript SK (+/−) (Stratagene). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min. Bound probe was detected by incubation with anti-digoxigenin Ig-alkaline phosphate conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and chemiluminescence detection using disodium-3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo-[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenylphosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a substrate. To generate N-terminally FLAG-tagged hamster UGT, the insert contained in the vector pABE-SO1 was amplified with oligonucleotide primers SO23 and SO24, which include EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively (Table II). PCR products were treated with EcoRI and XbaI, purified, and ligated into the vector pME8.1, which is a derivative of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the FLAG-sequence (MDYKDDDDKEF) 5′ of theEcoRI site. The resulting plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-SO1 directs the expression of an N-terminally FLAG-tagged UGT under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The nonapeptide underlined in the FLAG-sequence is recognized by the anti-FLAG mAb M5. The construction of the FLAG-tagged murine CST has been described previously (21Eckhardt M. Gotza B.

To generate C-terminally HA-tagged transporters, coding sequences of the hamster UGT and murine CST were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides SO18 and SO19 or ME41 and ME42, respectively, which introduce BamHI restriction sites upstream and downstream of the coding sequence (Table II). After digestion with BamHI, PCR products were purified and ligated into the BamHI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pEVRF0-HA (29Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids direct the expression of C-terminally HA (GSYPYDVPDYASL)-tagged transporters under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The sequence motif recognized by the anti-HA mAb 12CA5 is underlined. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. 1 µg of poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the oligonucleotide SO47 annealing to nucleotides 1273–1291 in the hamster UGT cDNA. The cDNA was then amplified by nested PCR using the primer pair SO45 and SO46 in the first amplification round and the primer pair SO48 and SO11 in the second amplification round. PCR conditions were as follows: 30 s at 57 °C, 90 s at 72 °C, and 15 s at 94 °C for 40 cycles. Products of RT-PCR reactions were purified on agarose gels (GFX-PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) prior to sequencing. Missense mutations identified in Lec8-derived UGT cDNAs as well as other point mutations described in this study were introduced into the wild type sequences of both epitope-tagged forms of the hamster UGT and the murine CST. Site-directed mutations were introduced by PCR using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) followed by fusion PCR. Oligonucleotide primers used to introduce point mutations and to generate full-length constructs by fusion PCR are listed in Table II. In order to generate HA-tagged UGT variants in the vector pEVRF0-HA, the primer combinations SO18/SO85 and SO19/SO86, SO18/SO97 and SO19/SO98, and SO18/SO105 and SO19/SO106 were used to introduce the mutations Y122H, ΔS213, and G281D, respectively. DNA fragments resulting from these PCRs were purified on 2% agarose gels using the GFX-PCR Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), corresponding fragments were combined, and fusion PCRs were carried out with the primers SO18/SO19, which add BamHI restriction sites to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the DNA sequence (see TableII). To generate N-terminally FLAG-tagged UGT variants in the vector pcDNA3, the reactions described above were repeated, but SO18 and SO19 were replaced by SO23 and SO24, which add EcoRI andXbaI restriction sites, respectively, to the DNA sequences. Mutations in the murine CST were introduced with the primer combinations SO114/SO115 for Y98H, SO116/SO117 for ΔS188, and SO118/SO119 for G256D. Flanking primers used in the mutagenesis step were ME41 (used together with SO114, SO116, and SO118) and ME42 (used together with SO115, SO117, and SO119). ME41 and ME42, which addBamHI restriction sites to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the DNA sequences (see Table II) were also used in the fusion reaction. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Recipient cells for transient transfections were the Lec8 subclone Lec4.8.7A and the Lec2 subclone 6B2 (21Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20189-20195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression was monitored by Western analysis, and UGT function was measured by the ability to produce sialylated NCAM detected by anti-PSA antibody (22Cacan R. Duvet S. Kmiecik D. Labiau O. Mir A.M. Verbert A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). While Lec2 cells do not produce spontaneous PSA-positive revertants at a detectable level (even after several months of culture), spontaneous Lec8 revertants arose at a significant frequency. Thus, it was necessary to deplete revertants by panning on anti-PSA-antibody 735 every 3–5 days (for details, see Ref.3Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Of the nine Lec8 subclones used in this study, Lec4.8.7A cell populations produced the fewest revertants, and therefore this cell line was routinely used as the recipient in transfection experiments. Transfections were carried out with 5 × 105 cells seeded in 6-cm Petri dishes (or on glass coverslips placed into 6-cm Petri dishes) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM and transfected with 1 µg of cDNA mixed with 6 µl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Cells were cultured for 6–8 h in the presence of the transfection mixture. Transfections were stopped with 2 volumes of the normal culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After an additional 24–72 h of culturing, analytical steps were performed. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) on 15 and 7% polyacrylamide gels. Lysis of transfected COS-7 cells was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% Nonidet P-40. CHO cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry blotting (31Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 2% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for at least 30 min at room temperature. Immunostaining with mAb 735 was performed as described (32Gerardy-Schahn R. Eckhardt M. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 1994; 8: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transport proteins were displayed with either the anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the anti-FLAG mAb M5 (Sigma). Bound primary antibodies were detected with anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Dianova), and blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium (Roth) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roth) as substrates. Cells grown overnight on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After three washing steps with PBS, the cells were permeabilized for 30 min with 0.2% saponin in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After permeabilization, samples were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBS (anti-FLAG mAb M5, 5.4 µg/ml; anti-HA mAb 12CA5, 2.5 µg/ml). The α-mannosidase II antiserum (33Moremen K.W. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6654-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was diluted 1:2000. Antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washing steps in 0.1% BSA in PBS, bound antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies: anti-mouse Ig-Cy3 (Molec"

Here we identify a major member of these complexes as class II mMOB1, a mammalian homolog of the yeast protein MOB1, and show that its phosphorylation appears to be regulated by PP2A. Yeast MOB1 is critical for cytoskeletal reorganization during cytokinesis and exit from mitosis. We show that mMOB1 associated with PP2A is not detectably phosphorylated in asynchronous murine fibroblasts. However, treatment with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid induces phosphorylation of PP2A-associated mMOB1 on serine. Moreover, specific inhibition of PP2A also results in hyperphosphorylation of striatin, SG2NA, and three unidentified proteins, suggesting that these proteins may also be regulated by PP2A. Indirect immunofluorescence produced highly similar staining patterns for striatin, SG2NA, and mMOB1, with the highest concentrations for each protein adjacent to the nuclear membrane. We also present evidence that these complexes may interact with each other. These data are consistent with a model in which PP2A may regulate mMOB1, striatin, and SG2NA to modulate changes in the cytoskeleton or interactions between the cytoskeleton and membrane structures.

PP2A also has been implicated in the development of some types of cancers, including human leukemias (1von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 282: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The PP2A heterotrimer consists of a structural (A) subunit, a catalytic (C) subunit, and a regulatory (B-type) subunit. Recently, we have shown that S/G2 nuclear autoantigen (SG2NA) and striatin form stable complexes with the core A/C heterodimer of PP2A (4Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D.G. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). SG2NA and striatin are highly related WD40 repeat proteins that bind to calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner but bear little homology to known B-type subunits (4Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K.

Interestingly, SG2NA-PP2A and striatin-PP2A immune complexes contained calcium-independent, okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity that was activated toward cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1 substrate (4Moreno C.S.

However, no known B-type subunits were detectable in immunoblots, silver stain, or Coomassie-stained gels of striatin and SG2NA immunoprecipitations, suggesting that SG2NA and striatin may represent a new family of PP2A regulatory subunits (4Moreno C.S.

One of the characteristics of the striatin family, which includes striatin, SG2NA, and zinedin (7Castets F. Rakitina T. Gaillard S. Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Monneron A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19970-19977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is that each member contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains. These domains include a caveolin binding domain, a potential coiled-coil structure (7Castets F. Rakitina T. Gaillard S. Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Monneron A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19970-19977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a calmodulin binding domain, a membrane binding domain, and a WD repeat domain (6Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins may function as scaffolding proteins, assembling a large number of proteins into a complex with the PP2A A/C heterodimer. SG2NA was originally isolated as an autoantigen in a human cancer patient (5Muro Y. Chan E.K. Landberg G. Tan E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies indicate that it is localized to the nucleus and that its expression peaks during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (5Muro Y. Chan E.K. Landberg G. Tan E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies (7Castets F. Rakitina T. Gaillard S. Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Monneron A. J. Biol.

Striatin has been detected by immunofluorescence throughout neuronal dendrites, especially in the post-synaptic densities of neuronal dendritic spines (6Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Salin P. Kachidian P. Bartoli M. Castets F. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, striatin contains two polybasic domains that are absent in SG2NA and may facilitate association with the post-synaptic membrane (6Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of striatin in vivo using antisense oligonucleotides results in decreased locomotor activity and reduced growth of dendrites in vitro (9Bartoli M. Ternaux J.P. Forni C. Portalier P. Salin P. Amalric M. Monneron A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that striatin targets PP2A to a cellular microenvironment in which it may play a role in the modulation of calcium-dependent neuronal signaling and possibly remodeling of the cellular cytoskeleton. Although striatin and SG2NA are most highly expressed in brain (6Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J.

Using affinity-purified antisera to SG2NA, we have immunopurified another member of the striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes and identified it as the mammalian class II homolog of the yeast protein, MOB1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MOB1 is an essential gene that is required for exit from mitosis, maintenance of cell ploidy, and possibly mitotic spindle pole body duplication (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). InSchizosaccharomyces pombe, MOB1 is required for cytokinesis and is localized to the spindle pole bodies throughout the cell cycle and to the medial ring during late mitosis (11Hou M.C. Salek J. McCollum D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 619-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Salimova E. Sohrmann M. Fournier N. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the mammalian class II homolog of MOB1 (mMOB1) is a member of striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes and that striatin, SG2NA, and mMOB1 may be substrates of PP2A. Moreover, we also show by immunofluorescence microscopy that a subpopulation of striatin and SG2NA appear to colocalize with mMOB1 in the perinuclear region of murine fibroblasts. NIH3T3 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as previously described (4Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D.G. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Subconfluent 15-cm dishes of NIH3T3 cells were labeled for 4–6 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 using okadaic acid during labeling, cells were treated with 1 μm okadaic acid for 2 h before lysis. However, similar labeling was also observed using 500 nm okadaic acid in other experiments (not shown). Cells were washed, whole cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (4Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D.G. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using affinity-purified SG2NA antisera chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose, samples were immunopurified from 28 15-cm dishes of NIH3T3 cells as described (13Ogris E. Du X. Nelson K.C. Mak E.K., Yu, X.X. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14382-14391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), except that immune complexes were prepared in a single batch immunoprecipitation instead of from multiple sequential immunoprecipitations. Protein complexes were eluted with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.4) and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as previously described (14Pallas D.C. Shahrik L.K. Martin B.L. Jaspers S. Miller T.B. Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Preparative immunopurifications were visualized with Colloidal Blue stain (Novex, San Diego, CA). Control immunopurifications were performed with preimmune sera chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose using two 15-cm dishes of cells analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver stain. Proteins isolated from two-dimensional gels were microsequenced by ion trap mass spectrometry as previously described (4Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D.G. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A full-length human cDNA clone of mMOB1 was obtained from the IMAGE consortium human germinal center B cell library of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (GenBankTM accession numberAA504251, IMAGE clone number 825396). The human and mouse class II homologs of MOB1 were 100% identical at the amino acid level. The mMOB1 cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the EST clone using the 5′ primer (CGGCACGAGGCCATGGTC) and the 3′ primer (TCCCAGTCGACGTTGTAAAA). The 5′ primer created an NcoI site at the start ATG codon of the mMOB1 open reading frame, and the 3′ primer was complementary to the pT7T3D-Pac vector and created aSalI site at the 3′ end. The amplified mMOB1 cDNA was blunt-cloned into the PCRscriptSK+ vector (Stratagene) and DNA-sequenced. The mMOB1 cDNA was isolated from the PCRscriptSK+ vector using the introduced NcoI and SalI restriction sites. This fragment was then ligated into theBamHI and SalI sites of the pBABE_NEO mammalian expression vector together with a BamHI-NcoI double-stranded oligonucleotide linker encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag followed by a thrombin protease cutting site (15Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The resulting clone (HA-mMOB1) expressing a fusion protein with the HA tag at the amino terminus of mMOB1 was stably transfected into NIH3T3 cells and selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum supplemented with 400 μg/ml geneticin. Lasergene DNASTAR Protean software was utilized to identify highly hydrophilic and antigenic sequences for selection of peptide antigens. Rabbit polyclonal mMOB1 antisera were generated using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated peptide DP62 as an immunogen. Peptide DP62 (RNRPGTKAQDFYNWPDESFDEMDSTC) corresponds to residues 12–36 of class II mammalian MOB1 with an additional C-terminal cysteine for coupling to KLH. Peptides were conjugated to KLH using the Imject maleimide KLH conjugation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An anti-SG2NA mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody (S-68) was generated commercially (Anogen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) against a previously described KLH-linked SG2NA peptide antigen (4Moreno C.S. Park S.

Striatin and SG2NA antibodies are available from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse fibroblasts were plated at 50% confluence and serum-starved (0.1% calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) overnight to enhance the flattening and spreading of these cells. Coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 5 min in freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde, followed by 15 min in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde. 2T. Fellner and E. Ogris, unpublished information. Coverslips were then washed 3 times in PBS and incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min. The coverslips were then washed two times in PBS, and cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 10 min. After washing three times in PBS, coverslips were blocked in PBS containing 10% horse serum, 3% BSA, and 3% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were diluted into PBS containing 10% horse serum, 3% BSA. Affinity-purified anti-SG2NA and anti-striatin polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:5000, and commercially obtained 16b12 (Berkeley Antibody Co.) specific for the HA-epitope tag was diluted 1:1000. Monoclonal SG2NA antibodies (S-68) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. For control experiments, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were preincubated with peptide antigens at 2 μg/ml, rocking at 4 °C in PBS, 10% horse serum, 3% BSA for 1 h. Coverslips were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After primary antibody incubation, coverslips were washed three times in PBS, 3% BSA and then incubated with lissamine rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:4000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in PBS, 3% BSA, 10% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS, and DNA staining was performed with Hoescht dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on an Olympus BX-60 microscope with a Photometrix Quantix CCD camera. Confocal microscopy was performed on Zeiss Microsystems LSM510 microscope. To investigate the composition of SG2NA-PP2A and striatin-PP2A complexes, NIH3T3 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and SG2NA complexes were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates. In addition to SG2NA, striatin, A subunit, and C subunit, several unidentified proteins were observed by two-dimensional gel analysis of 35S-labeled SG2NA and striatin immunoprecipitates (4Moreno C.S.

One component of these complexes that migrates as a doublet at ∼24 kDa had previously been observed in PP2A (1d6) immunoprecipitations from metabolically labeled cells analyzed on two-dimensional gels. 3K. Conroy and D. C. Pallas, unpublished data. Preparative immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified SG2NA polyclonal antisera and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by microsequencing of the 24-kDa protein by peptide ion trap mass spectrometry identified two peptides (IFSHAYFHHR and ILEPPEGQDEGVWK) that matched mammalian class II MOB1 (mMOB1) (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a homolog of the yeast protein, MOB1 (Fig.1 A). The S. cerevisiae protein, MOB1 (Mps One Binder), was first identified in a two-hybrid screen for substrates of the kinase MPS1 (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The MPS1 kinase (16Lauze E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C. Weiss E. Schutz A.R. Winey M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) carries out at least two functions during mitosis, regulation of spindle pole body duplication (17Schutz A.R. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 759-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Schutz A.R. Giddings Jr., T.H. Steiner E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and activation of a mitotic checkpoint that monitors spindle integrity (19Weiss E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae MOB1 is an essential gene required for completion of mitosis and maintenance of cell ploidy (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although yeast MOB1 interacts physically with MPS1 and can be phosphorylated by MPS1 in vitro, MOB1 is not required for the mitotic checkpoint function of MPS1 (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although deletion of MOB1 in yeast is lethal, conditional mutants arrest in late mitosis as large budded cells with separated chromatin and long bipolar spindles. Also, some temperature-sensitive MOB1 mutants cause an increase in ploidy at permissive temperatures, suggesting that MOB1 may play a role in the spindle pole body duplication function of MPS1 (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In both S. cerevisiae (20Komarnitsky S.I. Chiang Y.C. Luca F.C. Chen J. Toyn J.H. Winey M. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2100-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and S. pombe (11Hou M.C. Salek J. McCollum D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 619-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Salimova E. Sohrmann M. Fournier N. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MOB1 physically interacts with the DBF2/Sid2 kinase. Furthermore, MOB1 has been shown to be essential for cytokinesis in S. pombe. Also in fission yeast, MOB1 is localized to the spindle pole bodies throughout the cell cycle and to the medial ring during cytokinesis (11Hou M.C. Salek J. McCollum D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 619-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Salimova E. Sohrmann M. Fournier N. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the EST data bases revealed that there are two divergent classes of homologs of yeast MOB1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and humans (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the mammalian homolog identified here as a member of the PP2A complexes is the class II homolog of yeast MOB1. The class II homologs of yeast MOB1 in C. elegans, mouse, and humans are all more highly related to each other than they are to the class I homologs of MOB1 in each respective species. This is because different portions of the yeast MOB1 sequence are conserved in the two classes of MOB1 homologs (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA clones of human and mouse mMOB1 were obtained from the IMAGE consortium collection of ESTs and completely sequenced. Other class II mMOB1 cDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBankTM under the various names of 2C4D (39Temeles G.L. Ram P.T. Rothstein J.L. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod.

Okazaki Y. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), Preimplantation protein 3 (Prei3), reflects the fact that mMOB1 was present in early mouse embryonic cDNA libraries. Sequence analysis showed that mMOB1 is 100% identical between human and mouse at the amino acid level and 95% identical at the DNA level. Computer analysis of the recently releasedDrosophila genomic sequence enabled identification of the MOB1 homolog in the fruit fly. BLAST comparison of theDrosophila and human MOB1 sequences showed that they are 80% identical and 87% similar at the amino acid level (Fig.1 A). This high level of conservation is consistent with a fundamentally important cellular role for MOB1. To confirm the identification of mMOB1 as a member of striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes, NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with HA-tagged mammalian MOB1 (HA-mMOB1). Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B) confirmed the HA-mMOB1/SG2NA-PP2A and HA-mMOB1/striatin-PP2A interactions. Immunoprecipitations with PP2A monoclonal antibody (1d6), striatin antisera, SG2NA antisera, and the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody all confirmed the HA-mMOB1-SG2NA-PP2A and HA-mMOB1-striatin-PP2A complexes. Interestingly, endogenous mMOB1 was detected in 12CA5 immunoprecipitations of HA-mMOB1, striatin was detected in SG2NA immunoprecipitations, and SG2NA was detected in striatin immunoprecipitations. A control immunoprecipitation did not precipitate striatin, SG2NA, PP2A C subunit, HA-mMOB1, or endogenous mMOB1, indicating that the observed immunoprecipitations are specific (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, none of the members of these complexes were observed in 12CA5 immunoprecipitations from the parent NIH3T3 cell line that does not express HA-mMOB1 (not shown), indicating that the associations are specific. These data suggest that some component of these complexes could be a dimer or that more than one mMOB1 monomer could associate with striatin or SG2NA. Chemiluminescence quantitation of mMOB1, striatin, and SG2NA present in lysates and immunoprecipitates determined that approximately one-third of cellular mMOB1 is complexed with striatin and one-third of mMOB1 is complexed with SG2NA (data not shown). Whether the remaining third is free or complexed to other members of the striatin family could not be determined using the available reagents. To ensure that the observed stable interactions between striatin and SG2NA could not be due to cross-reactive antibodies, lysates were preboiled in 0.5% SDS and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol to disrupt complexes and denature proteins. The SDS was then diluted and absorbed into micelles with 1% Nonidet P-40, and then parallel immunoprecipitations were prepared (Fig. 1 C). The only case in which there was occasional nonspecific sticking was a small amount of the endogenous mMOB1. However, the low levels detected in the preboiled immunoprecipitations cannot account for the much higher amounts of mMOB1 found in the immunoprecipitations from unboiled lysates. The absence of co-immunoprecipitating proteins from preboiled lysates indicates that each immunoprecipitating antibody is specific and that SG2NA-PP2A-mMOB1 and striatin-PP2A-mMOB1 complexes interact. SG2NA immunoprecipitates were prepared from 35S-radiolabeled NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-mMOB1 (hereafter referred to as HA-mMOB1 cells) and analyzed on two-dimensional gels (Fig.2). A second, higher molecular weight doublet produced by the epitope-tagged HA-mMOB1 was detected in addition to the 24-kDa doublet generated by the endogenous mMOB1. This observation demonstrates that the two spots detected at 24 kDa were different isoforms of mMOB1 and not produced by different, similarly migrating proteins. It also indicates that the doublet is not a product of alternative splicing, since both species can be generated from a cDNA, and instead must be due to a post-translational modification of mMOB1. This finding, together with earlier work demonstrating that yeast MOB1 can be phosphorylated by the MPS1 (10Luca F.C. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and DBF2 (20Komarnitsky S.I. Chiang Y.C. Luca F.C. Chen J. Toyn J.H. Winey M. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2100-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) kinases raised the possibility that mMOB1 might be phosphorylated in vivo. To begin the analysis of the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of SG2NA-PP2A complexes, HA-mMOB1 cells were metabolically labeled with either 35S or 32P, and SG2NA immunoprecipitates were prepared (Figs. 2 and 3). Both SG2NA (Fig. 3) and striatin (not shown) were phosphorylated in untreated cells and became hyperphosphorylated upon okadaic acid treatment. In addition to SG2NA, unknown 47, 52, and 60-kDa proteins present in SG2NA-PP2A-mMOB1 complexes were hyperphosphorylated upon okadaic acid treatment. Whereas SG2NA was easily detected in 32P-labeled cells, mMOB1 present in SG2NA-PP2A complexes was undetectable even upon long exposure and thus did not appear to be constitutively phosphorylated. This result indicates that the post-translational modification detected by 35S-labeling was not due to phosphorylation. However, when HA-mMOB1 cells were treated w"

It is well documented that, for their biological function, Rab proteins need to be prenylated for attachment to the vesicle membrane. In contrast, we showed in the present investigation that SopE, a type III secretory protein of Salmonella, translocates onto Salmonella-containing phagosomes (LSP) and mediates the recruitment of non-prenylated Rab5 (Rab5:ΔC4) on LSP in GTP form. Simultaneously, SopE present in infected cell cytosol acts as an Rab5-specific exchange factor and converts the inactive Rab-GDP to the GTP form. The non-prenylated Rab5 subsequently promoted efficient fusion of LSP with early endosomes. This is the first demonstration that a prenylation-deficient Rab protein retains biological activity and can promote vesicle fusion, if it is recruited on the membrane by some other method.

Science. 1997; 276: 1212-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). C-terminal prenyl lipid moieties on Rab proteins serve to anchor them specifically to the cytoplasmic surface of the intracellular compartment (3Seabra M.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Unlike membrane insertion via transmembrane domains, membrane association of the Rab proteins via prenylation can be transient, which allows efficient regulation of intracellular flow of the membrane compartment (4Lobell R.B. Dixon F.A. Advances in Immunology. 68. Academic Press, New York1998: 145-189Google Scholar). Thus, prenylation of Rab proteins is believed to be indispensable for membrane attachment and subsequent biological function (5Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Kikuchi A. Kawata M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133: 187-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Similarly, maturation of phagosomes has also been found to be regulated by the fusion of endocytic vesicles, which is controlled by Rab-GTPases (6Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 7Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Among the different Rab proteins, Rab5 and Rab7 are associated with the endocytic pathway (8Mukhopadhyay A. Barbieri A.M. Funato K. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J.

Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), whereas Rab7 serves as a targeting signal for transport from the early to late/lysosomal compartment (10Mukhopadhyay A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the low pH of the lysosomal compartment mediates the killing of invading microorganisms by lysosomal hydrolases. Thus, live bacteria appear to regulate maturation of the phagosomes by modulating the recruitment of endocytic Rabs on phagosomes (12Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S.,. Huber L.A. Deretic V.

We have recently demonstrated that LSP1 specifically recruits Rab5 on the phagosomes and promotes fusion with early endosomes, thereby inhibiting transport to the lysosomes (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Hashim S. Mukherjee K. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16281-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Rab5 on the LSP depends on the presence of viable bacteria in the phagosomes, suggesting that a signal from the bacteria is required for Rab5 recruitment on the phagosomes. However, the mechanism of recruitment of a particular Rab protein by the respective bacteria-containing phagosomes is not clearly understood. In the present investigation, we have shown that SopE, a type III secretory protein of Salmonella, acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 and converts the Rab5 into the GTP form, which specifically binds with SopE transported onto the Salmonella-containing phagosomes. Our results have also demonstrated that LSP can recruit prenylation-defective Rab5 (Rab5:ΔC4) and promote efficient fusion of LSP with early endosomes, indicating that prenylation of Rab protein is not essential for the biological activity of Rab protein.

E. Galyov. Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria broth (LB) at 37 °C with constant shaking (300 rpm), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and used in phagosome preparation. To determine the molecules from the host cell cytoplasm recognized by the Salmonella, these bacteria were incubated in the presence of biotinylated cytosol prepared from the macrophages. Macrophage cytosol was biotinylated using NHS-biotin as described previously (17Robinson L.J. Gruenberg J. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York1998: 248-257Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mg of macrophage cytosol was incubated with 5.5 mg of NHS-biotin for 2 h at room temperature in a biotinylation buffer (0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.0). Unreacted biotin was quenched with glycine, and biotinylated cytosol was separated from unreacted biotin using 1 ml of a G-25 Sephadex spin column. Biotinylated cytosol (2.5 mg) was incubated with 1 × 108 Salmonella at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS (pH 7.2). Subsequently, cells were washed five times with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The biotinylated macrophage proteins bound toSalmonella were detected by Western blot analysis using avidin-HRP. Finally, cytosolic proteins recognized by theSalmonella were identified by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against endocytic Rabs and actin. To detect the Rab5 binding protein from Salmonella,Salmonella were grown overnight in LB and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (18Ziegler K. Unanue E.R J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1869-1875PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with PBS and grown in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine with constant shaking (300 rpm) for 9 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Bacteria were lysed by sonication followed by incubation in 1% Triton X in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm to get rid of unbroken cells and other debris. GST-Rab5 (200 μg) was immobilized with glutathione beads as described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and incubated in the presence of the Salmonella lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed (10,000 × g for 5 min) three times to remove unbound proteins. Subsequently, the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. A similar experiment was carried out with unlabeledSalmonella lysate, and the indicated protein was identified using antibodies against SopE by Western blot analysis. Proteins were visualized using an appropriate HRP-labeled second antibody by ECL. To determine the specificity of Rab5 binding with Salmonella, first the GST-Rab5 was biotinylated using the procedure as described previously (17Robinson L.J. Gruenberg J. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York1998: 248-257Google Scholar). Biotinylated GST-Rab5 (10 μg/ml) was incubated in PBS (pH 7.2) containing 1 × 108 Salmonella at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of non-biotinylated Rab5 or SopE. Subsequently, cells were washed five times with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The biotinylated Rab5 bound to Salmonella bacteria in the presence or absence of competitors were detected by Western blot analysis using avidin-HRP. Phagosomes containing wild type S. typhimurium, S. dublin(2229), or SopE knockout mutant S. dublin were prepared using a procedure described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, J774E clone macrophages (1 × 108) were incubated with 1 × 109 bacteria at 4 °C for 1 h to allow binding. ThenSalmonella were internalized into macrophages for 5 min at 37 °C. Finally, cells were washed (300 × g for 6 min) and resuspended (2 × 108 cells/ml) in homogenization buffer (HB; 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) and homogenized in a ball bearing homogenizer at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at a low speed (400 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The post nuclear supernatant was diluted with HB (1:3) and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Subsequently, enriched phagosomal fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of HB containing protease inhibitors and loaded onto a 1-ml 12% sucrose cushion. Samples were centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C, and the purified phagosomes were recovered from the bottom of the tube. The viability of the bacteria in the phagosomes was determined by lysing the respective phagosomes with solubilization buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100) and plated them on an LB-agar plate. We found a similar number of colonies on the LB-agar plate, indicating the presence of a comparable number of viable bacteria in respective phagosomes. Biochemical characterization of these phagosomes demonstrated that they were free of endosome, lysosome, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum contamination as observed previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To check the purity of the phagosomes, purified phagosomes were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, washed, and postfixed with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer. The phagosomes were rinsed and dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in araldite (16Hashim S. Mukherjee K. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16281-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thin sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1200 EX 11). The SopE present on purified LSP and DSP was detected by immunogold labeling using a negative staining technique as described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, respective phagosomes were purified and washed five times with ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.2) and sedimented by centrifugation. First, the purified phagosomes were absorbed with glow-discharged formver and carbon-coated nickel grids, and the specimens were quickly rinsed twice with HB and incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (HB containing 3% skim milk and 0.1% gelatin). The samples were then incubated for 2 h with mouse anti-SopE antibody (monoclonal) diluted 1:40 in blocking buffer. Subsequently, the specimens were rinsed three times (5 min each) with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse conjugated with 12-nm colloidal gold at a 1:20 dilution. The samples were washed twice with HB and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in HB for 10 min. Finally, samples were sequentially washed with HB and distilled water, stained with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min, blotted onto filter paper, and air-dried. Similarly, Rab5 was immunolocalized on phagosomes containing either wild typeS. dublin or the SopE knockout mutant of S. dublin using polyclonal rabbit anti-Rab5 antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by treatment with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 18-nm colloidal gold. Moreover, the presence of SopE was also determined on phagosomes containing either wild type S. dublin or the SopE knockout mutant of S. dublin using anti-SopE antibody. To strip off the Rab protein from each phagosome, the phagosomes were treated with Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) as described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, respective phagosomes (150 μg each) were preincubated with fusion buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mm GDP. Subsequently, 6 μg of the purified GDI was added to one set of phagosomes in the reaction mixture, and incubation was carried out for another 10 min at room temperature. Phagosomes were sedimented by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), and these Rab-stripped phagosomes were washed with PBS and used for indicated experiments. To determine the recruitment of different forms of Rab5 proteins, purified phagosomes containing respective Salmonella were treated with Rab-GDI to remove the endogenous Rabs present on the phagosomes (15Mukherjee K.

Respective Rab fusion proteins were preincubated in the presence of J774E cytosol (3.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in fusion buffer (250 mmsucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, including an ATP-regenerating system, 1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 31 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) for in vitro prenylation (19Lombardi D. Soldati T. Reiderer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Subsequently, recruitment of the different forms of Rab5 by the respective phagosomes was carried out by incubating the phagosomes at 37 °C for 10 min in fusion buffer containing 1 mg/ml cytosol supplemented with 30 ng of the indicated purified GST-Rab5 proteins. The presence of Rab5 (50 kDa of GST-Rab5) on the phagosomes was determined by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against Rab5. Similar studies were carried out to determine the recruitment of the Rab7 by respective phagosomes. To determine the direct interaction of different forms of Rab5 mutant proteins with SopE, we developed an in vitro assay to study the protein-protein interaction. First, the recombinant SopE-(78–240) (10 μg/ml) was incubated in an ELISA plate for 3 h at 37 °C in coating buffer (0.1 n sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5) to coat the protein, and subsequently, wells were washed thrice and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.01% of Tween 20 and 2% of bovine serum albumin). Wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween, and 0.2 mg/ml of different constructs of GST-Rab5:WT or mutant proteins was incubated in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C to allow binding. To determine the binding of Rab5 with SopE, wells were incubated with Rab5-specific polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) in PBS-Tween for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess antibodies were removed by washing the wells three times with PBS-Tween followed by three washes with PBS. Subsequently, wells were incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with HRP (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed five times, and finally the HRP activity present in each well was measured as described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to measure the binding of different preparation of Rab5 with SopE. To determine the specificity of Rab5 binding with SopE, similar experiments were carried out using biotinylated Rab5 subsequently probed with avidin-HRP. First, the recombinant SopE-(78–240) (10 μg/ml) was coated in an ELISA plate as described in the previous section, washed, and incubated in the presence of different concentrations of biotinylated GST-Rab5:WT in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C to allow binding. To determine the binding of biotinylated Rab5 with SopE, wells were washed and incubated with avidin-HRP (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound avidin-HRP were removed by washing the wells three times with PBS-Tween followed by three washes with PBS. Subsequently, HRP activity present in each well was measured as described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to measure the binding of Rab5 with SopE. Binding of biotinylated Rab5 (10 μg/ml) with immobilized SopE (10 μg/ml) was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of non-biotinylated Rab5 or SopE to determine the specificity. Immunodepletion of Rab5 from the cytosol was carried out using the procedure described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated with 10 μl of anti-Rab5 antibody in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The antibody-protein A/G agarose complex was washed and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl of J774E cytosol (600 μg) was added to the protein A/G agarose-antiRab5 complex and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to deplete the Rab5 from the cytosol. Subsequently, Rab5-depleted cytosol was separated from the agarose beads by centrifugation. Immunodepletion of Rab5 from the cytosol was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Rab5 antibody. Rab5-depleted cytosol was used for the in vitrofusion assay. The SopE-mediated nucleotide exchange of Rab5 was determined using an assay previously described (20Hardt W Chen L. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), with some modifications. First, the respective Rab 5 proteins were loaded with GDP and subsequently, the exchange of GDP to [32P]GTP was determined in the presence or absence of GST-SopE-(78–240). Briefly, different mutants of Rab5 (60 pmol of each protein) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 μm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA). Exchange reaction was carried out in 200 μl of exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 μm[32P]GTP, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 15 pmol of GDP-bound Rab proteins with/without an equimolar concentration of GST-SopE-(78–240) for 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots from the reaction were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membranes were extensively washed in ice-cold solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 to remove free radioactivity. The membranes were then transferred to scintillation vials, and counts were determined in the presence of scintillation fluid. A similar exchange reaction of Rab5 was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of SopE as indicated. In vitro fusion of phagosomes containing the biotinylated Salmonella with early endosomes containing avidin-HRP were carried out using a procedure similar to that described previously (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, phagosomes were purified from macrophages, and endogenous Rab proteins were stripped off from the phagosomes by GDI-GDP treatment. To determine the role of different mutant proteins of Rab5, fusion of Rab-stripped LSP with early endosomes was carried out in the presence of fusion buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, including an ATP-regenerating system, 1 mm ATP, 8 mmcreatine phosphate, 31 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.25 mg/ml avidin as scavenger) containing Rab5-immunodepleted, gel-filtered cytosol supplemented with different mutants of Rab5 (10 μg of each GST-Rab5 preincubated in the presence of cytosol) as indicated. Fusion was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by chilling on ice. The HRP-avidin-biotin bacterial complex was recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min) after solubilization of the membrane in solubilization buffer with 0.25 mg/ml avidin as scavenger. The enzymatic activity of avidin-HRP associated with the biotinylated bacteria was measured as fusion unit. The maximum fusion between endosomes and phagosomes (Control, LSP without GDI-GDP treatment) was observed at 0.5 mg/ml normal cytosol concentration, which was expressed as 1 unit of relative fusion. The HRP activity, corresponding to 1 unit, is mentioned in the legend to Fig.6. We have previously shown that live Salmonella-containing phagosomes specifically recruit Rab5 on the phagosomes and promote fusion with the early endosomes (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility of bacterial proteins that might be involved in the recruitment of different factors from the host cell cytoplasm. The results presented in Fig.1 A show thatSalmonella specifically binds two proteins from the macrophage cytosol of apparent molecular mass of 25 and 42 kDa (lane 1). To identify these proteins, Western blot analyses were carried out with antibodies against different endocytic Rab proteins, which are of about 25 kDa and regulate vesicular trafficking. The anti-Rab5 antibody specifically detected the 25-kDa protein (lane 2) bound to Salmonella, while the anti-Rab7 antibody (lane 3) did not, demonstrating thatSalmonella specifically recognized Rab5 from the host cells. Similarly, the 42-kDa protein bound to Salmonella was identified as actin (lane 4), which is consistent with the previous report that SipA, a protein from Salmonella, binds with actin to induce membrane ruffling, which facilitates the entry of the bacteria (21Zhou D. Mooseker M. Galan J.E. Science. 1999; 283: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To search for the bacterial surface protein that interacts with Rab5, GST-Rab5 was incubated with aSalmonella lysate obtained after growing the cells in the presence of [35S]methionine. The data presented in Fig.1 B show that GST-Rab5 specifically picked up two proteins of apparent molecular masses of 30 and 50 kDa from theSalmonella lysate. In contrast, no proteins were detected when GST or GST-Rab7 was used under similar conditions. Western blot analysis with anti-SopE antibody revealed the 30-kDa protein as SopE. However, we have not yet identified the 50-kDa proteins, which also bind to Rab5. Similar results were also obtained using WT S. dublin (data not shown) indicating that SopE, a type III secretory protein of Salmonella, specifically binds with Rab5. To determine the specificity of SopE-mediated binding of Rab5, S. typhimurium was incubated with biotinylated GST-Rab5 in the presence and absence of non-biotinylated Rab5 or SopE. Western blot analysis presented in Fig. 1 C shows that binding of biotinylated Rab5 with Salmonella is effectively competed by both Rab5 and SopE. To determine whether the SopE produced bySalmonella is transported onto the phagosomes, we purified phagosomes containing respective wild type and mutantSalmonella. The electron micrograph presented in Fig.2 A shows that the purifiedSalmonella-containing phagosomes are relatively pure without any contamination with other intracellular organelles. Moreover, biochemical characterization demonstrated that these phagosomes are free of endosome, lysosome, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum contamination (16Hashim S. Mukherjee K. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16281-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequently, purified liveSalmonella-containing phagosomes were probed with anti-SopE antibody followed by a second antibody conjugated with colloidal gold particles to determine the presence of SopE on the phagosomes. The immunolocalization studies presented in Fig. 2 B demonstrate that SopE is present on LSP (panel a). In contrast, phagosomes containing dead Salmonella (DSP) do not show the presence of SopE (panel b). The results presented in Fig.2 B show that phagosomes containing live, SopE knockout mutant Salmonella (S. dublin, strain SE1) were unable to recruit Rab5 on LSP (panel d). However, phagosomes containing wild type S. dublin (strain 2229) recruited significant amounts of Rab5 (panel c) on LSP, comparable to that observed with phagosomes containing wild type S. typhimurium (15Mukherjee K. Siddiqui S. Hashim S. Raje M.,. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 2 B(panel e) show that SopE is also localized on LSP harboring wild type S. dublin. It is pertinent to mention that mean numbers of gold particles are significantly higher in panels a, c, and e than in panels b,d, and f (Fig. 2 b) as observed from 100 respective phagosomes, indicating that SopE is transported onto LSP and thereby possibly recruit Rab5 on Salmonella-containing phagosomes. To understand the mechanism of Rab5 recruitment by LSP, we studied the binding of LSP with various mutant forms of Rab5, namely Rab5:Q79L, a GTPase-defective mutant (22Burstein E.S. Brondyk W.H. Macara I.G. J. Biol."

For the limited set of proteins whose folding has been investigated both in vivo and in vitro, polypeptide chains fold more efficiently in their native cellular environments (3Fedorov A.N.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11750-11753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the difference between folding in vitro and in vivo is due to the action of molecular chaperones; these protein complexes increase the yield of successfully folded protein for some polypeptide sequences (5Skowyra D.

Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Yet there are many proteins whose folding appears to be unaided by the presence of molecular chaperones, particularly in vivo (7Rospert S. Looser R. Dubaquie Y. Matouschek A. Glick B.S. Schatz G.

Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Miller, S., Schuler, B., and Seckler, R. (1998) 37,9160–9168.Google Scholar, 15Neira J.L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

These results suggest that additional cellular components may be required for the successful folding of these polypeptide chains in vivo. The recent discovery that the ribosome-associated trigger factor may cooperate with the molecular chaperone DnaK to assist in the folding of some polypeptide chains (16Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,17Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P.

During polypeptide synthesis, after amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain at the aminoacyltransferase center within the ribosome, they pass through a tunnel, emerging at the exit site on the back side of the large ribosomal subunit (21Cate J.H.

Newly synthesized polypeptide chains must be held in some conformation in order to protect the nascent chain from proteolytic digestion or unproductive associations with other nascent or unfolded chains. This is true even during co-translational folding, which still appears to require the presence of a complete folding domain (50–200 amino acids) before folding can commence (10Feldman D.E. Frydman J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The experimental difficulties involved in studying a dynamically growing nascent polypeptide chain, attached to a large (2–4 MDa) ribosome, have limited studies of the conformations of nascent chains on actively translating ribosomes. Most investigations have focused on the interactions of nascent chains with chaperones (24Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 25Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A.

Investigations using physiological translation systems have been rare (8Nicola A.V. Chen W. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the conformation of ribosome-bound, nascent polypeptide chains of the tailspike protein from Salmonella typhimurium phage P22. Tailspike is a homotrimeric protein with 666 amino acid residues per chain, arranged in an extended structure that includes a large central parallel β-helix domain (Fig. 1) (29Steinbacher S. Seckler R. Miller S. Steipe B. Huber R. Reinemer P. Science. 1994; 265: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 30Steinbacher S. Miller S. Baxa U. Budisa N. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Near the C terminus, the three separate amino acid chains wrap around one another to form an interdigitated triangular β-prism domain (31Kreisberg J.F. Betts S.D. King J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Past folding studies have demonstrated that trimerization, and the subsequent interdigitation of the C-terminal domain, is crucial for correct formation of the native structure (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tailspike is unusual in that it represents one of the few proteins whose folding and assembly has been studied extensively both in vitro and in vivo(32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Goldenberg D. Berget P. King J. J. Biol.

Because the SDS-resistant native state is distinguishable from its folding and assembly intermediates by SDS or native gel electrophoresis, the folding and assembly process can be monitored in crude extracts (33Goldenberg D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In vitro intermediates have been characterized by Seckler and co-workers (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C.

Both monomeric and trimeric intermediates have been identified, corresponding to the in vivo intermediates (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram for the pathway of tailspike folding and assembly after release of polypeptide chains from ribosomes or dilution of chains out of denaturant.Figure 2The folding pathway of released P22 tailspike chains (63King J. Haase-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Unfolded polypeptide chains organize first into structured monomeric intermediates (M), which can either proceed down the refolding pathway or convert into aggregation-prone monomers. All intermediates can be trapped by cold incubation ofin vitro refolding mixtures or newly lysed cells fromin vivo assays. Folding proceeds through a trimeric intermediate termed the protrimer (Pt), which migrates as a discrete band on native polyacrylamide gels (64Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford University Press1989: 225-250Google Scholar), observed during bothin vivo folding and in vitro refolding studies (34Goldenberg D. King J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 53Speed M.A. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Formation of the native trimer (T) is slow (t t1/2~5min in vivo; >24 h in vitro at 10 °C). The native trimer is resistant to unfolding by SDS and therefore appears as a distinct band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The folding and aggregation intermediates are sensitive to SDS-unfolding and therefore co-migrate during SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unlike the folding of many small globular proteins, tailspike folding exhibits Arrhenius behavior (i.e. linear dependence of the folding rate on temperature) (39Danner M. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence is quite steep, resulting in an activation energy of ∼165 kJ/mol (39Danner M. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for non-Arrhenius behavior during folding are still under debate (40Chan H.S. Dill K.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 2-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 41Karplus M. Folding Des. 1997; 2: S69-S75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), for the tailspike it appears that the stabilities and kinetics of the phases of folding are equally affected by temperature. A critical feature of this behavior is that tailspike intermediate populations can be trapped in the cold and remain competent for further folding for many hours (37Betts S.D. King J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The single-chain and the protrimer intermediates trapped in the cold can be separated by electrophoresis through non-denaturing acrylamide gels run in the cold (33Goldenberg D. Berget P. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7864-7871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the microsecond and millisecond lifetimes for the folding intermediates of many small globular proteins, tailspike folding intermediates persist for several hours (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Warming cold-trapped intermediates permits their continued folding to the native trimer (37Betts S.D. King J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cold-trapping therefore provides a method for temporarily stabilizing transient folding intermediates, permitting their investigation with more time-consuming experimental methods, without altering the tailspike folding pathway (34Goldenberg D. King J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The tailspike single-chain partially folded intermediate is thermolabile, and temperature-induced destabilization of this intermediate causes tailspike folding to partition from the productive pathway to the aggregation pathway (33Goldenberg D. Berget P. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7864-7871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although off-pathway aggregation occurs both in vivo and in vitro, the intermediates in vivo are less labile, requiring higher temperatures to initiate aggregation. Overexpression of GroEL/S does not alter the yield of native tailspike nor does it rescue tailspike folding mutants (42Brunschier R. Danner M. Seckler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2767-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, newly synthesized wild type tailspike chains do not appear to be associated with DnaK (44Sather S.K. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25268-25276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the GroE complex (43Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the similarities between the in vitro and in vivo folding pathways, tailspike foldingin vivo always results in higher yields of folded protein. These inconsistencies prompted us to examine other participants in protein folding in vivo; specifically, whether the translation machinery itself can stabilize early intermediates in vivo. A set of monoclonal antibodies isolated against native tailspike recognizes at least seven different classes of epitopes on the native structure (45Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10347-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1M. Jain, J. King, and P. L. Clark, manuscript in preparation. Three of these antibodies were used previously to monitor the formation of intermediates and the native state during tailspike refolding in vitro (46Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15945-15949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epitopes recognized by these antibodies appeared at different stages during refolding. One of the antibodies, 236-3, in addition to recognizing in vitro refolding intermediates, also detected tailspike polypeptide chains in the presence of immunoprecipitated ribosomes from in vitro translation mixtures. However, two other antibodies, which recognized epitopes present only on later intermediates and the native trimer during refolding in vitro, did not detect tailspike polypeptide chains in the presence of the immunoprecipitated ribosomes. These results suggest the ribosome-associated tailspike chains contained significant, but not yet native-like, levels of structural information (46Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15945-15949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methods used previously to analyze in vivo intermediates of tailspike folding (33Goldenberg D. Berget P. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7864-7871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) disrupted the ribosomal structures just prior to analysis. In order to determine the conformation of the nascent tailspike polypeptide chain while still attached to the ribosome, we characterized newly synthesized tailspike polypeptide chains using cell preparations from which intact ribosomes were recovered. Below we report the adoption of conformational motifs in newly synthesized, ribosome-bound tailspike polypeptide chains, prior to their release into the cytoplasm, and we compare these conformations with those adopted by tailspike polypeptide chains at the onset of in vitro refolding. Tailspike was purified from P22-infectedSalmonella cultures (see description below) as described previously (47King J. Yu M.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 250-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined based on an absorbance value of 1.0 at 278 nm for a 1 mg/ml solution (48Sauer, R. T., Krovatin, W., Poteete, A. R., and Berget, P. B. (1982) 21, 5811–5815.Google Scholar). Tailspike was denatured and refolded as described previously (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 46Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15945-15949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg/ml tailspike was unfolded in 5 m urea, 63 mm sodium phosphate, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 2.9, for 30 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of the unfolded protein were refolded at various time points (up to 24 h) by 50-fold dilution into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Refolding was performed at 10 °C and, as judged by SDS-PAGE,2 resulted in ∼75% of denatured chains recovering the native conformation after 24 h, consistent with previous results (32Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 46Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15945-15949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining ∼25% of denatured chains form non-native aggregates. After the final sample was diluted into refolding buffer, all samples were then placed on wet ice and diluted to a tailspike concentration conducive to the competition ELISA (i.e. a concentration where complete refolding of the protein would result in 70% antibody recognition, in order to stay within the sensitive range of the assay; see below) (46Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15945-15949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were then subjected to the competition ELISA (described below) but with an initial antigen-antibody incubation at 4 °C for only 10 min; loading and incubation of these mixtures in 96-well plates was also performed at 4 °C. Plate data were analyzed as described below and compared with the antibody recognition for an equivalent concentration of native (never unfolded) tailspike. S. typhimurium strain DB7136(su−) was grown and infected with phage P22 as described previously (47King J. Yu M.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 250-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C to a density of 2 × 108cells/ml and infected with a P22 variant,5−amN114/13−amH101(amber mutations in genes 5 and 13 prevent formation of full-length coat and lysis proteins, respectively, thereby preventing phage head assembly and bacterial cell lysis). As a control for tailspike production, cells were infected with a P22 variant containing the aforementioned amber mutations in genes 5 and13 as well as an amber mutation in the tailspike,9−amN110, which produces only a small N-terminal fragment of tailspike shown previously to be unrecognized by the anti-tailspike monoclonal antibodies (45Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10347-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Infected cells were cultured for 90 min at 30 °C. Cultures were chilled quickly on ice, and ice cubes of buffer R (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl) were added to speed chilling. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g and resuspended in buffer R containing 80 mm octyl glucopyranoside, to promote cell lysis. Cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C, in order to halt tailspike polypeptide chain maturation (37Betts S.D. King J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were defrosted for 3 min in a cold water bath, until just thawed; this freeze/thaw cycle was sufficient to effect cell lysis. Lysates were spun for 90 s at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were loaded onto 16-ml 10–30% linear sucrose gradients with a 1-ml 60% sucrose cushion. The gradients were spun at 150,000 ×g for 7.5 h and separated into 30 0.58-ml fractions. The absorbance at 260 nm was used to measure the level of nucleic acid in each fraction, and a small portion of some fractions was also subjected to SDS-PAGE, to determine which fractions contained tailspike and ribosomal proteins. To determine the role of RNA-containing structures, cell cultures were split in two. One-half was treated with 50 μg/ml RNase and 50 mm EDTA (final conditions) to destabilize and digest the ribosomal particles. Ribosome-containing fractions were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Fractions were dialyzed against buffer R to lower the sucrose concentration, applied to carbon-coated glow discharged 400 mesh copper grids, negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate, blotted dry, and examined in the JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope. To radiolabel the newly synthesized polypeptide chains, cell cultures were pulsed for 3 min or 90 s with 3.0 μCi/ml culture 14C-labeled amino acids (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after 90 min of P22 infection. Cultures were then chased with a large volume of ice-cold unlabeled casamino acids, while simultaneously chilling the entire culture on ice, occasionally with the addition of buffer R ice cubes. Cultures were then centrifuged, resuspended, and flash-frozen as described above. Mouse anti-tailspike monoclonal antibodies were a generous gift from the lab of Dr. Michel Goldberg (Institut Pasteur); for this study, monoclonal antibodies 175-3 and 51-2 were used. These antibodies have been shown to recognize epitopes on the native tailspike trimer corresponding to a central region of the β-helix domain (α(β-helix)) and a portion of the β-coil domain that includes Glu-405 (α(Glu-405)), respectively (Fig. 1) (45Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10347-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).1 An ELISA competition assay was used to detect the presence of tailspike epitopes; this was performed as described (49Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989: 287-310Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, aliquots of purified tailspike or refolding reaction were mixed with 0.04 μg/ml (final concentration) anti-native tailspike monoclonal antibody diluted in PBS/Tween (PBS buffer with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Mixtures were then loaded, in triplicate, into wells of a microtiter plate coated with 1.0 μg/ml tailspike and incubated at room temperature (22 °C). After 30 min, wells were washed three times with PBS/Tween and incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates). The plate was again washed three times, incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (2 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 1 methanolamine, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 9.8), and monitored for absorbance at 405 nm. The amount of absorbance corresponded to the amount of tailspike antibody not bound to components of the gradient fraction. Control samples with no antigen present permitted calculation of the percent of monoclonal antibody recognizing tailspike antigen in the refolding reactions. It should be noted that, under the conditions used here, the assay operated under parameters that perturbed the equilibrium established in the antigen/antibody mixtures, i.e. in some situations, more than 10% of the unbound antibody adhered to the well of the microtiter plate (50Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Hence, data used to construct the standard curve shown in Fig. 3 cannot be used to construct a Scatchard or Klotz plot for determination of an accurate dissociation constant (50Friguet B.

We demonstrated previously that E2F genes are differentially expressed in developing epidermis (Dagnino, L., Fry, C. J., Bartley, S. M., Farnham, P., Gallie, B. L., and Phillips, R. A. (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8, 553–563). Thus, we hypothesized that various E2F proteins likely play distinct growth regulatory roles in the undifferentiated stem cells and in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. To further understand the function of E2F genes in epidermal morphogenesis, we have examined the expression, regulation, and protein-protein interactions of E2F factors in undifferentiated cultured murine primary keratinocytes or in cells induced to differentiate with Ca2+ or BMP-6 (bone morphogeneticprotein 6). We find similar patterns of E2F regulation with both differentiating agents and demonstrate a switch in expression from E2F-1, -2, and -3 in undifferentiated, proliferating cells to E2F-5 in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. Inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation by transforming growth factor-β1 did not enhance E2F-5 protein levels, suggesting that this response is specific to differentiation rather than reversible cell cycle withdrawal. E2F-5 up-regulation is also accompanied by formation of heteromeric nuclear complexes containing E2F5, p130, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1. Overexpression of E2F5 specifically inhibited DNA synthesis in undifferentiated keratinocytes in an HDAC-dependent manner, suggesting that E2F-5·p130·HDAC1 complexes are likely involved in the permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle of keratinocytes responding to differentiation stimuli.

The epidermis consists of a stratified squamous epithelium composed mainly of keratinocytes at different stages of differentiation (1Zinkel S. Fuchs E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 77-90PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Within the epidermis, the basal cell layer is attached to a basement membrane (3Jones P.H. Watt F.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 4Adams J.C.

Development. 1991; 112: 193-206PubMed Google Scholar), is closest to the dermis, and contains the stem cells. These cells have continuous self-renewal potential and are responsible for renewing and maintaining the epithelium (6Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Committed basal cells lose their proliferative capacity, detach from the basement membrane, and initiate terminal differentiation. Differentiating cells migrate upwards and form postmitotic suprabasal skin layers. The signals and intracellular networks that dictate changes in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation are poorly understood. These networks are extremely important, because they ultimately determine proper skin morphogenesis and homeostasis. Important cellular networks that regulate proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types include cyclins, pRb family proteins and E2F factors. The E2F family of transcription factors consists of six known genes that form heterodimers with DP proteins (reviewed in Refs. 7Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar and 8Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). E2F factors participate in a broad spectrum of functions, including control of eukaryotic cell proliferation and patterning during early development (7Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar, 8Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 9Myster D.L. Bonnette P.C. Duronio R.J.

The importance of E2F activity is underlined by its conservation through evolution from invertebrates (18Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to mammals. The multiplicity of mammalian E2F proteins, however, suggests tissue-specific functions. For example, E2F-1 is essential for normal thymocyte apoptosis and selection (19Garcia I. Murga M. Vicario A. Field S.J. Zubiaga A.M. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 91-98PubMed Google Scholar, 20Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E.

Gaubatz S. Xu Y. Bronson R.T. Warren H.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An emerging understanding of the role and regulation of E2F factors during development underlines their importance in this process. For example, expression analysis of E2F during mouse organogenesis has revealed dynamic regulation of these genes in a number of tissues, including neurons and epithelia (25Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, in the developing epidermis, E2F-4 transcripts are abundant in the early ectoderm. Following the onset of E2F-4 expression, E2F-2 transcripts are first detected in 14.5 days postcoitus epithelium. High levels of E2F-2 expression are maintained in stratified epidermis and localize to the basal cell layer and to the epithelium surrounding the dermal papilla in the hair follicles. These are the two regions that contain undifferentiated, proliferating cells. In contrast, E2F-5 transcripts are first detected in the suprabasal layers only after the epidermis starts stratification and persist with that distribution during the postnatal period (24Lindeman G.J. Dagnino L. Gaubatz S. Xu Y. Bronson R.T. Warren H.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a switch in E2F gene expression appears to occur as epidermal keratinocytes mature and migrate into the differentiated compartment and become postmitotic, terminally differentiated cells. In this report, we explore the roles of E2F proteins in epidermal morphogenesis. Specifically, we address the regulatory pathways and functions of E2F during differentiation in primary cultured murine keratinocytes. These cultures recapitulate differentiation eventsin vivo, such as up-regulation of suprabasal keratins K1 and K10 (27Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Casanova M.L. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41219-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and growth arrest of >95% of cells (28Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) upon treatment with 1.0 mm extracellular Ca2+ or with BMP-6. We find differential expression and post-transcriptional regulation of a set of E2F proteins in differentiated mouse keratinocytes, which sharply contrast with reported changes in immortalized HaCat human keratinocytes (29Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also report that induction of differentiation in mouse keratinocytes results in formation of E2F-5·p130·HDAC11complexes, which can trigger keratinocyte entry into quiescence. Primary keratinocytes were isolated from 1–3-day-old CD-1 mice and cultured in minimum essential medium (without CaCl2, Biowhitakker) containing 8% fetal bovine serum pretreated with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad). The minimum essential medium/8% fetal bovine serum medium thus prepared contains a Ca2+ concentration of 0.05 mm, required to maintain undifferentiated cells (30Callaghan D.A. Dong L. Callaghan S.M.

Growth medium was also supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin; Life Science Technologies), murine epidermal growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 5 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (74 ng/ml), cholera toxin (10−10m), insulin (5 μg/ml), and triiodothyronine (6.7 ng/ml). Culture medium was replaced every 2 days. Experiments were conducted 3–5 days after initial plating in cultures that were 70–80% confluent by the end of the experiment. Pharmacological treatments included culture with human TGF-β1 (Life Science Technologies; final concentration, 10 ng/ml), or with BMP-6 (R & D; final concentration, 5 ng/ml) for 24 or 48 h, as indicated in individual experiments. Differentiation was also induced by addition of CaCl2 (1.0 mm, final) (30Callaghan D.A. Dong L. Callaghan S.M. Hou Y.X. Dagnino L. Slack R.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Keratinocytes were harvested and incubated for 30 min in lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm NaF and sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 0.1 mmEDTA), on ice. Protein lysates were also prepared by homogenizing freshly harvested tissues from 3-day-old mice in lysis buffer A, as described for keratinocytes. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, and supernatant fractions were stored at −70 °C or used immediately. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad). Lysates containing 50–100 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as described (41Muller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: E2F-1 (SC-251), E2F-2 (SC-633), E2F-3 (SC-878 and SC-879), E2F-4 (SC-866), E2F-5 (SC-999), DP-1 (SC-610), DP-2 (SC-829), p107 (SC-250), and p130 (SC-317). Anti-keratin 1 (PRB-165P) and anti-involucrin (PRB-140C) antibodies were purchased from Babco. Anti-pRb and monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibodies were generously provided, respectively, by R. Slack (Ottawa Hospital Neurosciences Institute) and R. Kothary (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute). Polyclonal chicken anti-E2F-2 antibodies have been described (32He Y. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All immunoblots were also probed for β-tubulin to normalize for protein loading. No significant differences in loading were noticed between samples in a given immunoblot using this method. Keratinocyte extracts were prepared from treated or untreated cultures, as indicated in individual experiments. To prepare extracts, cells were lysed in buffer A, as above. 750 μg of protein were precleared with protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with appropriate primary antibodies for immunoprecipitation. Incubation with secondary antibodies (2 h, 22 °C) was followed by protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (2 h, 22 °C) and extensive washes with lysis buffer A. Sepharose containing immune complexes was dissociated with Laemmli buffer (5 min, 95°) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Cell lysates were prepared as duplicate samples (50–100 μg), one in buffer A and the other in buffer B (buffer A lacking sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate) to prevent inhibition of the phosphatase. Those lysates prepared in buffer B were subsequently incubated with λ phosphatase (4 units/μg of protein; New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C, as suggested by the manufacturer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer A. Binding reactions were prepared as described (33Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the E2F element in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter (5′-CTA GAG CAA TTT CGC GCC AAA CTT GGA TC-3′). As a modification of the published protocol (33Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), binding reactions also contained 8 ng/μl of a mutant E2F element oligonucleotide, which contains a C → A mutation that abolishes binding to E2F (5′-CTA GAG CAA TTT CGA GCC AAA CTT GGA TC-3′). We noted that the presence of this mutant oligonucleotide further reduced nonspecific binding without affecting E2F complexes. The binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 45 min on ice and contained 5–15 μg of protein. For supershift assays, after the initial 45-min binding reaction, appropriate antibodies were added, and incubation was allowed to proceed for another 45-min period on ice, followed by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (33Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The E2F-encoding adenoviruses have been described (33Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and were generously provided by J. Nevins (Duke University). The infections were conducted at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 16 h in keratinocyte medium containing 2% serum. At this multiplicity of infection, ≥95% of keratinocytes were infected, as confirmed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of cells infected with a Lac-Z encoding virus. After infection, normal growth medium was added and supplemented, where appropriate, with 1.0 mmCaCl2. Keratinocyte cultures were incubated with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]dThd 5′-triphosphate for 2 h, and incorporation into DNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell fractions. The 3H activity was normalized to cell numbers. The multiplicity of E2F genes in mammalian cells and their regulatory mechanisms suggests that E2F proteins likely fulfill tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific functions. Indeed, expression analysis of the various E2F forms during murine organogenesis has demonstrated developmental stage- and tissue-specific regulation of E2F mRNA abundance (25Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). To further test this idea, we initially examined whether differential expression of E2F proteins is maintained in postnatal tissues, with special attention to the epidermis. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig.1 and in TableI. We were able to detect the presence of E2F-1 through -5 in all tissues examined. However, their abundance relative to each other varied from tissue to tissue. Thus, E2F-1 is present at highest levels in brain and lung, is present at moderate levels in heart, liver, and kidney, and is barely detectable in dermis and epidermis. This distribution is suggestive of a possible neuronal-specific function for E2F-1 in the adult brain. In contrast to E2F-1, E2F-2 levels were barely detectable in brain, relative to other tissues. Maximum E2F-2 expression occurred in lung, heart, and kidney, with intermediate E2F-2 levels present in dermis and liver. Epidermal E2F-2 levels were higher than in brain but lower than in all the other tissues examined.Table IPostnatal expression of E2F proteins in murine tissuesTissueE2F-1E2F-2E2F-3E2F-4E2F-5Brain+++++++++++++Heart++++++++++++++Liver++++++++++++++Lung+++++++++++++++++++Kidney++++++++++++Dermis+++++++Epidermis+++++++++Extracts prepared from the indicated tissues (100 μg/sample) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies.

A. 1994; 91: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicates high levels in lung and liver, followed by intermediate levels in epidermis and heart and the lowest levels in dermis and brain (Fig. 1 and Table I). E2F-4 and E2F-5 were fairly abundant in most tissues examined, with the exception of E2F-4 in kidney and dermis and E2F-5 in dermis and epidermis. We conclude from this analysis that differential regulation of E2F protein expression is maintained from embryonic to adult organs. The relatively low levels of all E2F proteins in epidermis may reflect the high content of structural proteins in this tissue, such as keratins, loricrin, and involucrin. The analysis of E2F expression in epidermis included all keratinocyte types present in this tissue. However, the epidermis contains various cell populations, including undifferentiated stem cells, with capacity for self-renewal or differentiation, as well as terminally differentiated keratinocytes. We had previously determined that, in embryonic murine skin, there is a switch in E2F mRNA expression during keratinocyte maturation characterized by down-regulation of E2F-2 and up-regulation of E2F-5 transcripts (26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as a first step in understanding the role of E2F factors in keratinocyte maturation, we examined changes in protein levels in undifferentiated, proliferating cultured keratinocytes or in their postmitotic, terminally differentiated counterparts. In culture, keratinocyte differentiation programs are triggered by increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to ≥0.1 mm (28Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or by the presence of BMP-6 (36Tennenbaum T. Li L. Belanger A.J. De Luca L.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the signaling cascades activated by Ca2+ and BMP-6 are different and yet converge on activation of differentiation pathways, we reasoned that using these two agents would allow us to examine the effects of differentiation induction on E2F proteins, irrespective of how the differentiation program was activated. Initial experiments were designed to confirm that our treatments indeed induced up-regulation of differentiation markers and withdrawal from the cell cycle. Withdrawal from the cell cycle was assessed by measuring incorporation of [3H]dThd into newly synthesized DNA. As shown in Fig.2 A, Ca2+ treatment of these cultures for 24 or 48 h inhibited [3H]dThd incorporation by up to 80% relative to untreated cultures, in agreement with previous observations (28Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). BMP-6 treatment produced similar decreases in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 A). To corroborate that these treatments were indeed associated with differentiation, we analyzed cell extracts for the presence of keratin 1 and involucrin, which are, respectively, early and late differentiation markers in keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 2 B, involucrin is up-regulated in the presence of elevated Ca2+ (≥0.1 mm) or BMP-6. Keratin 1 expression is also increased by 0.1 mm Ca2+ or BMP-6 but not by 1 mmCa2+, in agreement with previous reports (27Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Casanova M.L. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41219-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Having determined that Ca2+ or BMP-treated keratinocyte cultures withdrew from the cell cycle and activated differentiation genes as predicted, we then examined E2F protein expression profiles in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. This analysis revealed dissimilar regulation of E2F proteins during differentiation. Specifically, E2F-1, -2, and -3 protein levels were markedly down-regulated by Ca2+ and BMP-6 (Fig.3). The observed down-regulation of E2F-2 is in agreement with the decrease in E2F-2 mRNA we previously observed in differentiated suprabasal murine epidermal layers (26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of E2F-4 revealed its relatively high abundance in undifferentiated keratinocytes, mirroring transcript levels in murine epidermis (26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in differentiated cells. In stark contrast, E2F-5 protein levels increase substantially in differentiated cultures relative to actively proliferating cells (Fig. 3). This increase mimics changes in E2F-5 mRNA levels in differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes in vivo (26Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of various E2F family members in primary murine keratinocytes suggests important functional differences between these two factors. Of note are the differences between E2F regulation in this murine model and those reported in immortalized human HaCat keratinocytes induced to differentiate following prolonged culture under serum-free conditions (29Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Specifically, E2F-1 protein levels remain constant in differentiated HaCat cells (29Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), in contrast to their reduction in differentiated primary mouse keratinocytes. However, similar to the mouse model, E2F-1 mRNA is reduced in normal cultured human keratinocytes induced to differentiate with IF-γ (48Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggests that the protein may be protected from degradation, perhaps by interaction with pRb (40Dynlacht B.D. Moberg K.

Another difference between the mouse and the HaCat model is the marked down-regulation of E2F-5 in differentiated HaCat cells, which contrasts with its up-regulation in differentiated murine keratinocytes. Intriguingly, HaCat cells exhibit changes in E2F proteins in response to serum withdrawal followed by differentiation (43Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) that resemble those elicited in human keratinocytes by TGF-β (44Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Phys"

The carboxyl terminus of human RNase H1 is highly conserved with Escherichia coli RNase H1 and contains the amino acid residues of the putative catalytic site and basic substrate-binding domain of the E. coli RNase enzyme. The amino terminus of human RNase H1 contains a structure consistent with a double-strand RNA (dsRNA) binding motif that is separated from the conserved E. coli RNase H1 region by a 62-amino acid sequence. These studies showed that although the conserved amino acid residues of the putative catalytic site and basic substrate-binding domain are required for RNase H activity, deletion of either the catalytic site or the basic substrate-binding domain did not ablate binding to the heteroduplex substrate. Deletion of the region between the dsRNA-binding domain and the conserved E. coli RNase H1 domain resulted in a significant loss in the RNase H activity. Furthermore, the binding affinity of this deletion mutant for the heteroduplex substrate was ∼2-fold tighter than the wild-type enzyme suggesting that this central 62-amino acid region does not contribute to the binding affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. The dsRNA-binding domain was not required for RNase H activity, as the dsRNA-deletion mutants exhibited catalytic rates ∼2-fold faster than the rate observed for wild-type enzyme. Comparison of the dissociation constant of human RNase H1 and the dsRNA-deletion mutant for the heteroduplex substrate indicates that the deletion of this region resulted in a 5-fold loss in binding affinity. Finally, comparison of the cleavage patterns exhibited by the mutant proteins with the cleavage pattern for the wild-type enzyme indicates that the dsRNA-binding domain is responsible for the observed strong positional preference for cleavage exhibited by human RNase H1.

Although RNase Hs constitute a family of proteins of varying molecular weight, the nucleolytic activity and substrate requirements appear to be similar for the various isotypes. For example, all RNase Hs studied to date function as endonucleases exhibiting limited sequence specificity and requiring divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+ and Mn2+) to produce cleavage products with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (8Crouch R.J.

The activity of RNase H1 is Mg2+-dependent and inhibited by both Mn2+ and the sulfhydryl-blocking agentN-ethylmaleimide. Human RNase H1 was also inhibited by increasing ionic strength with optimal activity for both KCl and NaCl observed at 10–20 mm. The enzyme exhibited a bell-shaped response to divalent cations and pH, with the optimum conditions for catalysis observed to be 1 mm Mg2+ and pH 7–8. The protein was shown to be reversibly denatured under the influence of temperature and destabilizing agents such as urea. Renaturation of human RNase H1 was observed to be highly cooperative and did not require divalent cations. Furthermore, RNase H1 displayed no tendency to form intermolecular disulfides or to form homo-multimers.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Finally, human RNase H1 displays a strong positional preference for cleavage, i.e. the enzyme cleaves between 8 and 12 nucleotides from the 5′-RNA–3′-DNA terminus of the duplex. Many of the properties observed for Human RNase H1 are consistent with the E. coli RNase H1 isotype (e.g. the cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, and binding specificity) (16Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In fact, the carboxyl-terminal portion of human RNase H1 is highly conserved with the amino acid sequence of the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 1, Region III). The glutamic acid and two aspartic acid residues of the catalytic site as well as the histidine and aspartic acid residues of the proposed second divalent cation-binding site of the E. coli enzyme are conserved in human RNase H1 (18Kanaya S. Katsuda-Kakai C. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11621-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C.

Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, the lysine residues within the highly basic α-helical substrate-binding region of E. coli RNase H1 are also conserved in the human enzyme. Despite these similarities, the structures of the two enzymes differ in several important ways. For example, the amino acid sequence of the human enzyme is ∼2-fold longer than the E. coli enzyme. The additional amino acid sequence of the human enzyme extends from the amino terminus of the conserved E. coli RNase H1 region and contains a 73-amino acid region homologous with a double-strand RNA (dsRNA)2-binding motif (Fig.1, region I). The conserved E. coli RNase H1 region at the carboxyl terminus is separated from the dsRNA-binding domain of the human enzyme by a 62-amino acid region (Fig. 1,region II). Although the role of both regions I and II remain unclear, the dsRNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 may account for the observed positional preference for cleavage displayed by the enzyme as well as the enhanced binding affinity of the enzyme for various polynucleotides (16Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, the human enzyme is a significantly more basic protein than E. coli RNase H1 with a net positive charge of +15 for human RNase H1 compared with +2 for the E. coli enzyme. In this study we have explored the roles of the conserved amino acids of the catalytic site and the basic substrate-binding domain (region III), the roles of the dsRNA-binding domain (region I), and the 62-amino acid center region of human RNase H1 (region II) (Fig. 1). We have performed site-directed mutagenesis on the three conserved amino acids of the proposed catalytic site of human RNase H1 ((D145N), (E186Q), and (D210N)). In addition, the net positive charge of the basic substrate-binding domain was progressively reduced through alanine substitution of two (RNase H1(K226A,K227A)) and four (RNase H1(K226A,K227A,K231A,K236A)) of the lysines within this region. Deletion mutants were also prepared in which either the dsRNA-binding domain of region I (RNase H1(ΔI)) or the central region II (RNase H1(ΔII)) was deleted. Finally, a mutant protein representing the conserved E. coli RNase H1 region was prepared by deleting both regions I and II (RNase H1(ΔI–II)). The mutagenesis of human RNase H1 was performed using a PCR-based technique derived from Landtet al. (22Landt O. Grunert H. Hahn U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCRs were performed using a set of site-directed mutagenic primers and two vector-specific primers (11Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the RNase H1(D145N) mutant the 5′-oligodeoxynucleotide used for PCR was TACACTAATGGCTGCTGCTCCAGTAAT and the 3′-oligodeoxynucleotide was GCAGCCATTAGTGTAGACGACGACGACGAA. The PCR primers for RNase H1(E186Q) were 5′-AGAGCGCAAATTCATGCAGCCTGCAAA and 3′-ATGAATTTGCGCTCTTTGGTTTGTCTG. The primers for RNase H1(D210N) were 5′-TATACAAACAGTATGTTTACGATAAAT and 3′-CATACTGTTTGTATACAGAACCAGTTT. The primers for RNase H1(K226A,K227A) were 5′-GGTTGGGCAGCAAATGGGTGGAAGACAAGT and 3′-CCCATTTGCTGCCCAACCTTGAACCCAGTT. The primers for RNase H1(K226A,K227A,K231A,K236A) were 5′-GCAGCAAATGGGTGGGCGACAAGTGCAGGCGCAGAGGTGATCAACAAAG and 3′-TGCCCCTGCACTTGTCGCCCACCCATTTGCTGCCCAACCTTGAACCCAG. The PCR primers for RNase H1(ΔI) were 5′-ATCTTAGGATCCTCTGCAAGCCCGGAAGTTTCA and 3′-ATCTTACTCGAGTCAGTCTTCCGATTGTTTAGCTCC. The primers for RNase H1(ΔII) were 5′-TTTGTCAGGAAAATGGGAGACTTCGTCGTC and 3′-GAAGTCTCCCATTTTCCTGACAAAGGCCCA. The PCR primers for RNase H1(ΔI–II) were 5′-ATCTTAGGATCCATGGGAGACTTCGTCGTCGTCTA and the same 3′- primer as the RNase H1(ΔI) mutant. Approximately 1 μg of human RNase H1 cDNA was used as the template for the first round of amplification of both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of the cDNA corresponding to the mutant site. The fragments were purified by agarose gel extraction (Qiagen, Germany). PCR was performed in two rounds consisting of, respectively, 15 and 25 amplification cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 180 s). The purified fragments were used as the template for the second round of PCR using the two vector-specific primers. The final PCR product was purified and cloned into the expression vector pET17b (Novagen) as described previously (11Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The bacteria were grown in M9ZB medium (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. Wiley and Sons, NY1988: 3.10.3Google Scholar) at 32 °C and harvested atA600 of 0.8. The cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 32 °C for 2 h. The cells were lysed in 8 m urea solution, and the recombinant protein was partially purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Germany). The human RNase H1 was purified by C4 reverse-phase chromatography (Beckman Instruments, System Gold, Fullerton, CA) using a 0–80% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/distilled water (% v/v) over 40 min (24Deutscher M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 392-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was collected, lyophilized, and analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. Wiley and Sons, NY1988: 3.10.3Google Scholar). The purified protein and control samples were resuspended in 6 m urea solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma). The protein was refolded by dialysis with decreasing urea concentration from 6 to 0.5 m and dithiothreitol concentration from 5 to 0.5 mm (24Deutscher M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 392-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The refolded protein was concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon apparatus (Amicon, MA). The oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B synthesizer using 5′-O-silyl-2′-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methylribonucleoside phosphoramidites and procedures described elsewhere (25Scaringe S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B automated DNA synthesizer and standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purified by precipitation 2 times out of 0.5 m NaCl with 2.5 volumes of ethyl alcohol. The concentration of the oligonucleotides was determined by UV adsorption at A260 and previously published extinction coefficients (26Wallace R.B. Miyada C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotide substrate was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, WI), 120 pmol (7000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, CA), 40 pmol of oligoribonucleotide, 70 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled oligoribonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled oligoribonucleotide was ∼3000 to 8000 cpm/fmol. The heteroduplex substrate was prepared in 100 μl containing unlabeled oligoribonucleotide ranging from 1 to 1000 nm, 105 cpm of32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide, 2-fold excess complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide and hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl). Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min, cooled to 37 °C, and 60 units of Prime RNase Inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm were added. Hybridization reactions were incubated 2–16 h at 37 °C, and β-mercaptoethanol was added at a final concentration of 20 mm. The heteroduplex substrate was digested with 1.5 ng of human RNase H1 at 37 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of the cleavage reaction was removed at time points ranging from 2 to 120 min and quenched by adding 5 μl of stop solution (8 murea and 120 mm EDTA). The aliquots were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and resolved in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the substrate and product bands were quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The concentration of the converted product was plotted as a function of time. The initial cleavage rate was obtained from the slope (mol of RNA cleaved/min) of the best fit line for the linear portion of the plot, which consists, in general, <10% of the total reaction and data from at least five time points. The initial cleavage rates were plotted as a function of the substrate concentration (n ≥ 4), and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Ultrafit (Biosoft, NJ). TheKm value corresponds to the heteroduplex substrate concentration at half-maximum rate, and the kcat= Vmax/(total RNase H1), whereVmax corresponds to the horizontal asymptote of the hyperbolic curve. Competition experiments were performed as described for the determination of multiple turnover kinetics with the exception that 20 nm oligodeoxyribonucleotide, 10 nmoligoribonucleotide, and 60 ng of the mutant RNase H1 protein was used. Reactions were digested with 6 ng of wild-type human RNase H. The reactions were quenched, analyzed, and quantitated as described for multiple turnover kinetics. Binding affinities were determined by inhibition analysis (17Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here the cleavage rate is determined for the heteroduplex substrate at a variety of concentrations in both the presence and absence of a competing noncleavable substrate analog. The heteroduplex substrate was prepared as described above except in a final volume of 50 μl and with equimolar oligoribonucleotide and oligodeoxyribonucleotide ranging in concentration from 10 to 500 nm. The competing noncleavable substrate analog was prepared in 50 μl of hybridization buffer containing equimolar oligodeoxyribonucleotide and complementary 2′-fluoro-modified oligonucleotide. The concentration of the noncleavable substrate analog was in excess of the heteroduplex substrate and ranged from 1 to 5 μm. Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and cooled to 37 °C. Prime RNase inhibitor and MgCl2 were added to the reactions as described above. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2–16 h, and the noncleavable substrate analog was added to the heteroduplex substrate. β-Mercaptoethanol was added at a final concentration of 20 nm, and the combined reaction digested with 1.5 ng of human RNase H1. The reactions were quenched, analyzed, and quantitated as described for multiple turnover kinetics. The mutant proteins of human RNase H1 prepared for this study are described in Fig. 1. Analysis of human RNase H1 and the mutant proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig. 2. As expected, mutant proteins containing amino acid substitutions (e.g. D145N, E186Q, D210N, K226A,K227A, and K226A,K227A,K231A,K236A) exhibited molecular weights similar to the 32-kDa wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6). The RNase H1(ΔI) mutant in which the dsRNA-binding domain was deleted resulted in a 213-amino acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of 23 kDa (lane 7). The deletion of the 62-amino acid center portion of human RNase H1 (RNase H1(ΔII)) resulted in a 224-amino acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of 25 kDa (lane 8). Finally, the deletion of both the dsRNA-binding domain and the central region of the enzyme (RNase H1(ΔI–II)) resulted in a 151-amino acid protein containing the conserved E. coliRNase H1 sequence and with an approximate molecular mass of 17 kDa (lane 9). The enzymatic activities of the human RNase H1 enzyme and the mutant proteins were determined using a 17-nucleotide-long oligoribonucleotide/oligodeoxyribonucleotide heteroduplex (TableI). Substitution of any one the three amino acids comprising the proposed catalytic site of human RNase H1, (e.g. D145N, E186Q, and D210N) ablated the cleavage activity of the enzyme. In addition, alanine substitution of two (RNase H1(K226A,K227A)) or four (RNase H1(K226A,K227A,K231A,K236A)) lysine residues within the basic substrate-binding domain also ablated cleavage activity.Table IInitial cleavage rates for wild-type and mutant human RNase H1 proteinsRNase H1 proteinKm1-aND = cleavage rates below the detection limit of the assay (e.g. <1% of the heteroduplex substrate cleaved over 60 min).kcat1-aND = cleavage rates below the detection limit of the assay (e.g. <1% of the heteroduplex substrate cleaved over 60 min).nmmin−1Human wild-type383.0RNase H1(D145N)NDNDRNase H1(E186Q)NDNDRNase H1(D210N)NDNDRNase H1(K226A,K227A)NDNDRNase H1(K226A,K227A,K331A,K236A)NDNDRNase H1(ΔI)605.1RNase H1(ΔII)220.9RNase H1(ΔI–II)406.2E. coli RNase H11-bThe Michaelis-Menten kinetics forE. coli RNase H1 was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” with the exception that 500 pg of enzyme was used.38582.8The kcat and Km values were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Thekcat and Km values are an average of n ≥ 2 slopes of Lineweaver-Burk and/or Augustisson analysis with estimated errors of the coefficient of variation <10%.1-a ND = cleavage rates below the detection limit of the assay (e.g. <1% of the heteroduplex substrate cleaved over 60 min).1-b The Michaelis-Menten kinetics forE. coli RNase H1 was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” with the exception that 500 pg of enzyme was used. Open table in a new tab The kcat and Km values were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Thekcat and Km values are an average of n ≥ 2 slopes of Lineweaver-Burk and/or Augustisson analysis with estimated errors of the coefficient of variation <10%. The kinetic constants for the deletion mutants are shown in Table I. Deletion of the dsRNA-binding domain (RNase H1(ΔI)) resulted in a comparable increase in both kcat andKm values when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Conversely, deletion of region II of human RNase H1 resulted in a reduction in both kcat andKm. In this case, the Km andkcat observed for the wild-type enzyme was ∼2–3-fold greater than the kinetic constants observed for the RNase H1(ΔII) mutant. Finally, the kcat for the mutant protein in which both regions I and II were deleted (RNase H1(ΔI–II)) was ∼2-fold faster than the kcatobserved for the wild-type enzyme, whereas the Kmfor both enzymes was comparable. The positions of the cleavage sites for the wild-type and mutants of human RNase H1 in the heteroduplex substrate are shown in Fig.3. As observed previously, human RNase H1 exhibited a strong positional preference, i.e. 8–12 nucleotides from the 5′-RNA/3′-DNA terminus of the duplex (Fig.3 A). A similar cleavage pattern was observed for the RNase H1(ΔII) deletion mutant. The RNase H1(ΔI) and H1(ΔI–II) deletion mutants exhibited broader cleavage patterns on the heteroduplex substrate, with cleavage sites ranging from 7 to 13 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the RNA (Fig. 3 B). Experiments were performed to determine whether the inactive mutants of human RNase H1 competitively inhibit the cleavage activity of the wild-type enzyme. These experiments were performed under single turnover kinetics with the enzyme concentration in excess of the substrate concentration and with the concentration of the mutant protein in excess of the wild-type enzyme concentration. To ensure that inhibition of human RNase H1 activity by the mutant proteins was competitive and not due to nonspecific protein-protein interactions, competition experiments were also performed under multiple turnover kinetics with the substrate concentration in excess of the wild-type and mutant RNase H1 concentrations. Under these conditions, no reduction in human RNase H1 activity was observed in the presence of 10-fold excess mutant RNase H1 protein (data not shown). In contrast, all three of the mutant proteins tested under single turnover kinetics were observed to inhibit competitively the cleavage activity of human RNase H1 (Fig. 4). For example, the initial cleavage rate of human RNase H1 alone was determined to be 6-fold faster than the initial cleavage rate for human RNase H1 in the presence of the RNase H1(D145N) mutant. The initial cleavage rate of human RNase H1 in the presence of the region II deletion mutant (RNase H1(ΔII)) was ∼50% slower than the rate observed for human RNase H1 alone. Finally, the initial cleavage rate for human RNase H1 in the presence of the RNase H1(K226A,K227A,K231A,K236A) mutant was ∼60% slower than the rate observed for human RNase H1 alone. The binding affinities of human RNase H1 and the RNase H1(ΔI–II) mutant were determined indirectly using a competition assay as described previously (17Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cleavage rate of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide/oligoribonucleotide heteroduplex was determined at a variety of substrate concentrations in both the presence and absence of competing noncleavable oligodeoxyribonucleotide/2′-fluoro-modified oligonucleotide heteroduplex. Lineweaver-Burk and Augustinsson analysis of the data were used to determine the inhibitory constant (Ki) for the competing noncleavable heteroduplex. The Kiis equivalent to the dissociation constant (Kd) of the enzyme when a noncleavable heteroduplex is used. The dissociation constant (Kd) of human RNase H1 for the oligodeoxyribonucleotide/2′-fluoro-modified oligonucleotide heteroduplex was 75 nm (TableII). The RNase H1(ΔI), H1(ΔII), and H1(ΔI–II) mutants exhibited dissociation constants (Kd) for the noncleavable heteroduplex of, respectively, 410, 34, and 126 nm.Table IIBinding constants of RNase H1 proteinsRNase H1 proteinKdNet charge2-aThe net charge of the RNase H1 proteins was calculated by subtracting the number of"

The present study investigated the expression of the inducible form of the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-II) in human microglial cells treated with PrP-(106–126). Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that PrP-(106–126) induces NOS-II gene expression after 24 h of treatment and that this effect is accompanied by a peak of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) binding at 30 min as evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Since our previous data demonstrated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to be a potent inducer of NOS-II in these cells, we analyzed the expression of this cytokine in PrP-(106–126)-treated microglia. PrP-(106–126) caused the release of TNF-α as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a blocking antibody, anti-TNF-α, abolished NOS-II induction elicited by this peptide. Moreover, PrP-(106–126) activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the inhibition of this pathway determines the ablation of NF-κB binding induced by this fragment peptide.

The neuropathologic features that characterize prion diseases are spongiform degeneration of neurons and severe gliosis (2Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 49: 12277-12288Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Microglial activation has been observed early in the course of experimental scrapie (3Williams A. Lucassen P.J. Ritchie D. Bruce M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and microglia actively participates in the cerebral lesions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (4Muhleisen H. Gehrmann J. Meyermann R. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is well known that, once activated, microglia can release various factors that regulate neuronal and glial survival including a number of cytokines and free radicals (5Zielasek J. Hartung H.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 6: 122-191Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-II)1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been reported to occur in the brains of scrapie-infected animals (6Ju W.K. Park K.J.

Nitric oxide (NO) release from microglia is thought to play a role in neuronal cell death, and controlling NOS-II induction may be important for neuronal survival. In fact, the large quantities of NO produced by NOS-II are generally believed to cause cell damage and apoptosis (9Brune B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of NOS-II induction in prion diseases, we treated human microglial cells with the amyloidogenic PrP peptide 106–126, which has been shown previously to induce activation of microglial cells in culture (10Silei V.

We found that PrP-(106–126) treatment results in 1) binding of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) after 30 min as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 2) synthesis of TNF-α with a peak at 16 h; and 3) induction of NOS-II at 48 h. Since our previous data demonstrated TNF-α to be a potent NOS-II inducer in human microglia (17Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we used a blocking antibody, anti-TNF-α, in combination with PrP-(106–126) in order to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying NOS-II induction in these cells. This antibody was able to block the induction of NOS-II mRNA, suggesting a central role for TNF-α in regulating NOS-II expression in PrP-(106–126)-treated microglial cells. Moreover, we report here that NF-κB binding in PrP-treated microglial cells depends on the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Three synthetic PrP peptides were used for the study: a peptide homologous to residues 106–126 of human PrP (PrP-(106–126), KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG), PrP-(106–126) with an amidated C terminus (PrP-(106–126)NH2), and a scrambled sequence of PrP-(106–126) (NGAKALMGGHGATKVMVGAAA). These peptides were synthesized and purified as previously reported (13Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9678-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The PrP peptides were suspended in deionized water, sonicated for 1 min, and added to the medium at the final concentration of 80 µm. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), β-(25–35) fragment, l-NAME, SB203580, and Escherichia coliLPS (serotype 0127:B8) were from Sigma; PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem; TNF-α (specific activity, > 1 × 108units/mg of protein) was from Roche; and anti-human TNF-α blocking antibody and TNF-α ELISA kit were from R&D Systems. 100% purified microglial cells were obtained from human fetal brains following the method previously described (18Lauro G.M. Babiloni D. Buttarelli F.R. Starace G. Cocchia D. Ennas M.G. Sogos V. Gremo F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 13: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 25-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 40 µg/ml gentamicin and kept at 37 °C in a water-saturated 95% air, 5% CO2atmosphere. Human microglial cells were plated (1 × 106) in 25-cm2 flasks (Falcon) and treated for 2 days with PrP-(106–126) (80 µm), LPS (10 µg/ml) plus TNF-α (500 units/ml), and PrP-(106–126) scrambled peptide (80 µm). For the analysis of NOS-II expression, treated and untreated cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). For the detection of p38 activation, treated and untreated cells were lysed in Hepes, pH 8.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm KCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 µm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. Equivalent amounts of proteins (20 µg) were subjected to electrophoresis by using 10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 2.5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 µg/ml NOS-II monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or with phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. After extensive washing, a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 was added for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected by a chemiluminescence kit (ECL blotting system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). β-tubulin was examined as a reference. Nuclear extracts of human microglial cells were prepared according to Osborn et al. (19Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) in the presence of leupeptin (10 µg/ml), antipain (5 µg/ml), pepstatin (5 µg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar). Eight micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 2–5 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus NF-κB DNA binding site (5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGTAC-3′) of the interleukin-6 promoter in a 15-µl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 µg of poly(dI-dC), 1 µg of salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. Products were fractionated on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. In competition assays, 100× oligonucleotide competitor was added 15 min before the addition of the labeled probe. The intensity of the retarded bands was measured by a PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics). Nitrite (NO2−) was determined by using the Griess reagent (1 mm sulfanilamide, 1 mmnaphthylenediamine dihydrochloride, 100 mm HCl) in supernatants of 5 × 105 human microglial cells. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm, and NO2− concentration was determined using sodium nitrite as a standard. Since nitric oxide donors spontaneously generated nitrite, final concentrations of NO2− were estimated by the difference between the SNP (or SIN-1)-produced NO2− levels either in the presence or in the absence of cells. Total cellular RNA was purified from 5 × 105 human microglial cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62893) Google Scholar). In brief, a single extraction with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform mixture was performed. Whole RNA was reverse transcribed in cDNA using oligo(dT)12–18primers and MML-V reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified with Thermus acquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of primers specific for NOS-II (17Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or TNF-α (5′ primer, GAGCACTGAAAGCATGATCCG; 3′ primer, GCAGGTCTACTTTGGGATCATT). Conditions for TNF-α amplification were as follows: 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 30-s hybridation at 64 °C, 30-s elongation at 72 °C. Ten microliters of each PCR product were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The mRNA for the constitutive β-actin was examined as the reference cellular transcript. The release of TNF-α into culture supernatant was determined by standard ELISA techniques. Supernatant (200 µl) was placed in ELISA kit strips coated with the appropriate antibody. Sandwich ELISAs were then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems). Results were expressed as means ± S.D. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical differences between control and treatment values were assessed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Bonferroni-corrected t test. When human microglial cells were challenged with the fibrillogenic peptide PrP-(106–126), induction of NOS-II was observed after 48 h of treatment as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig.1). In addition, consistent with previous results obtained in murine microglial cells (11Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), we observed a nitrite increase in the supernatants of our cultures treated with PrP-(106–126) for 72 h (Table I). The production of nitrite was abolished by the NOS inhibitorl-NAME (500 µm). Moreover, the neurotoxic fragment 25–35 of β-amyloid (β-(25–35), the scrambled sequence of PrP-(106–126), and the nonfibrillogenic C-terminal amidated form of PrP-(106–126) (PrP-(106–126)NH2) were unable to determine any significant increase in nitrite level in these cells. Interestingly, NO donors (SNP and SIN-1) inhibit nitrite release by microglial cells challenged with PrP-(106–126) (Table I).Table INitrite levels in human microglial cells following miscellaneous treatments measured at 72 h by the Griess reactionNitrite levelsµmUntreated cells11.9 ± 1.5LPS/TNF-α26.0 ± 1.9*PrP-(106–126)28.8 ± 2.9*PrP-(106–126) scrambled11.8 ± 2.0PrP-(106–126)NH212.7 ± 1.7PrP-(106–126) +l-NAME12.2 ± 1.9PrP-(106–126) + SNP12.1 ± 2.2PrP-(106–126) + SIN-18.4 ± 1.7β-(25–35)15.8 ± 1.8Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. *,p ≤ 0.05.

In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying NOS-II induction in PrP-treated microglial cells, we analyzed by RT-PCR NOS-II mRNA, which was detectable after 24 h in cells treated with PrP-(106–126). This induction appeared to be specific, since it did not occur with the correspondent scrambled and amidated forms of PrP-(106–126). Conversely, at 8 h NOS-II mRNA was undetectable in PrP-(106–126)-treated cells, while it was evident in the positive control, LPS/TNF-α (Fig.2). By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we next investigated the possible activation of transcription factors in microglial cells during treatment with PrP-(106–126) and found that this peptide induced NF-κB binding with a peak at 30 min. This effect was absent in microglial cells treated with PrP-(106–126) scrambled and amidated peptides (Fig. 3). Since a delay of several hours existed between the binding of NF-κB and the induction of NOS-II mRNA, we tested the hypothesis that the observed NOS-II induction elicited by PrP-(106–126) was not direct but mediated by other factors. We have previously demonstrated TNF-α to be a potent NOS-II inducer in human microglia (17Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transcription of TNF-α is regulated by NF-κB, and NF-κB binding in the promoter of this gene serves as inducible transcriptional regulatory element (22Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). In our cultures, the addition of PrP-(106–126) determined the up-regulation of TNF-α mRNA at 8 h of treatment (Fig. 4) and caused the release of TNF-α in the medium with a peak at 16 h (TableII). Moreover, the addition of a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α (100 ng/ml) blocked both the induction of NOS-II mRNA and the accumulation of NO2− in microglial cells stimulated with PrP-(106–126) (Fig. 5).Table IIEffect of PrP-(106–126) fragment on TNF-α release as measured by ELISA at 16 hTNF-αpg/mlUntreated cells0 ± 0LPS253 ± 45*PrP-(106–126)276 ± 27*PrP-(106–126) scrambled0 ± 0β-(25–35)0 ± 0Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. *,p ≤ 0.05.

Because most data indicated MAPKs to regulate TNF-α expression, we sought to establish their involvement in this process. Thus, TNF-α release was measured by ELISA in the supernatants of microglial cells challenged with PrP-(106–126) alone or in combination with the pyridinyl imidazole compound SB203580 (a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor) or PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of the p42/44 MAPK pathway). As shown in Table III, treatment with SB203580 or PD98059 completely abolished TNF-α release induced by PrP-(106–126). Moreover, we have previously demonstrated microglial activation to be partially dependent on calcium entry through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (10Silei V. Fabrizi C. Venturini G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Lauro G.M. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When verapamil (inhibitor of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels) was added to the cultures stimulated with PrP-(106–126), a 50% reduction of TNF-α release was observed (Table III).Table IIIEffect of verapamil (2 µm), SB203580 (20 µm), and PD98059 (50 µm) on PrP-(106–126)-stimulated TNF-α release as measured by ELISA at 16 h.TNF-αpg/mlUntreated cells0 ± 0PrP-(106–126)311 ± 27*PrP-(106–126) + verapamil135 ± 1*§PrP-(106–126) + SB2035800 ± 0§PrP-(106–126) + PD980590 ± 0§Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. *,p ≤ 0.05 with respect to untreated cells;§, p ≤ 0.05 with respect to PrP-(106–126) treatment.

The activation of p42/44 MAPK, also called extracellular signal-regulated kinase, has been already reported to occur in microglial cells treated with fragments of the prion protein (23Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, no other studies, using any type of cells, have evaluated whether other MAPK pathways are activated after PrP treatment. We therefore examined the effect of PrP-(106–126) on phosphorylation of p38 MAPK using Western blot analysis. Fig.6 shows a representative immunoblot probed with antibodies to phosphorylated p38. The blot was stripped further and probed with nonphosphorylated p38 antibody serving as loading control. Microglial cells treated with PrP-(106–126) showed a striking increase in basal levels of phosphorylated p38 over untreated control after 5, 10, and 15 min of treatment. Since some authors have reported that the inhibition of p38 MAPK also blocks LPS-induced NF-κB activation (24Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested NF-κB binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in microglial cells treated with PrP-(106–126) in combination with the p38 inhibitor SB203580. As shown in Fig. 7, SB203580 almost completely abolished NF-κB binding in cells treated with PrP-(106–126) for 30 min. Activation of microglia is thought to play a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and microglial cells produce upon activation several factors (such as NO) that can be detrimental for neuronal survival. In particular, NOS-II expression has been reported to occur in the brains of scrapie-infected animals (6Ju W.K. Park K.J. Choi E.K. Kim J. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Kim Y.S. J. Neurovirol. 1998; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, a high intrathecal release of TNF-α in patients with sporadic and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been observed (26Sharief M.K. Green A. Dick J.P. Gawler J. Thompson E.J. Neurology. 1999; 52: 1289-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that a fibrillogenic fragment of the human prion protein consisting of amino acids 106–126 induces NOS-II expression in human microglial cells. An increase in nitrite in the supernatants of cultured murine microglia challenged with the same peptide has been previously reported (11Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of NOS-II induction has never been described. In this paper, we extend those previous findings identifying the molecular events that determine NOS-II induction in PrP-treated microglial cells, indicating possible strategies in controlling NOS-II expression. We demonstrate here that in human microglial cultures challenged with PrP-(106–126), the induction of NOS-II and the production of NO occur in a TNF-α-dependent manner via a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of p42/44 and p38 MAPK. In fact, specific inhibitors of p42/44 and p38 MAPK causes virtually complete loss of TNF-α secreted in the medium of PrP-treated cells inhibiting the consequent NOS-II induction. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the activation of p38 MAPK in PrP-treated cells. The p38 MAPK protein is an important mediator of stress-induced gene expression (27Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In particular, cytokine release by various cell types, including TNF-α (28Rutault K. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6666-6674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), is mediated via the p38 MAPK pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inhibition of p38 MAPK determines an almost complete ablation of NF-κB binding induced by PrP treatment. There is growing evidence that p38 MAPK can interact with signaling by the NF-κB pathway, but the link between p38 kinase activation and NF-κB translocation/activation is controversial and depends on the cell types investigated and stimuli used. Lee et al. (29Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3113) Google Scholar) have reported that the inhibition of p38 affected primarily the translation of TNF-α. By contrast, pyridinyl imidazoles have been reported to affect the LPS-stimulated transcription of several cytokine genes including TNF-α (30Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In particular, in the macrophage line RAW 264.7 stimulated with LPS, the presence of a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, dramatically diminished NF-κB binding (24Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Jeon Y.J. Kim Y.K. Lee M. Park S.M. Han S.B. Kim H.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that p38 is required for NF-κB-dependent gene expression through phosphorylation of a basal transcription factor, the TATA-binding protein, that in turn interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB to promote NF-κB-dependent gene expression (32Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These results serve to point out that the role of the p38 MAPK probably differs in tissues of different origin and/or differentiation states. In some tissues, the target of the kinase will be at the translation level (29Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

Inflamm. 1995; 45: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar), while in others, the p38 MAPK will interact at the transcription level (24Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,25Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N.

Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2676-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), are able to inhibit NOS-II induction. This result is particularly interesting in the view of recent data reporting that in the brains of scrapie-infected animals the activity of the constitutive isoform of NOS (NOS-I) is markedly inhibited probably for an improper membrane targeting (36Ovadia H. Rosenmann H. Shezen E. Halimi M. Ofran I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16856-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Keshet G.I. Ovadia H. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is possible that in vivo the observed impairment in NOS-I activity and the consequent diminished release of NO favor the activation of NF-κB and the induction of NOS-II in microglial cells. Moreover, it is worth noting that although both peptides β-(25–35) of amyloid and PrP-(106–126) are able to activate human microglial cells in culture (10Silei V. Fabrizi C. Venturini G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Lauro G.M. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the fragment β-(25–35), unlike PrP-(106–126), is unable to induce NOS-II expression in these cells. This is consistent with previous findings showing that β-(25–35) alone does not induce detectable nitrite accumulation in murine microglia (38Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrei G.I. Otvos Jr., L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F. Nature. 1995; 374: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). These data indicate that although the ability of PrP-(106–126) to generate fibrils is essential for NOS-II induction, the formation of fibrils by itself is not sufficient, since another fibrillogenic peptide (β-(25–35)) fails to induce both NOS-II expression and TNF-α synthesis. Because there is an imperative need to understand inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, identifying each component of the signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to the deleterious effects in the central nervous system caused by NO is important from a therapeutic standpoint, considering in particular that no therapy is currently available for human prion protein diseases."

Structural similarities in the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein suggest that Sau3AI is a pseudo-dimer, i.e. a polypeptide with two similar domains. Since Sau3AI displays a nonlinear dependence of cleavage activity on enzyme concentration and a strong preference for substrates with two recognition sites over those with only one, it is likely that the functionally active form of Sau3AI is a dimer of a pseudo-dimer. Indeed, electron microscopy studies demonstrate that two distant recognition sites are brought together through DNA looping induced by the simultaneous binding of twoSau3AI molecules to the DNA. We suggest that the dimeric form of Sau3AI supplies two DNA-binding sites, one that is associated with the catalytic center and one that serves as an effector site.

Cell. 2000; 5: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). It was interesting to note that the type II restriction endonucleaseSau3AI shares sequence homology with the DNA mismatch repair endonuclease MutH (14Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both Sau3AI and MutH recognize the same DNA sequence (GATC); but whereas MutH nicks the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated or unmethylated GATC site, Sau3AI cleaves both strands of GATC sites regardless of the methylation status (19Kessler C. Manta V. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 92: 1-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MutH is a monomer, both in solution and in the crystal, which makes sense because it only nicks the DNA (14Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Welsh K.M. Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15624-15629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, it shows only catalytic activity after mismatch-dependent activation by MutS and MutL (21Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), whereas in vitro, the requirement for MutS and MutL is less pronounced (22Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 23Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast to MutH, however, Sau3AI is an active enzyme by itself. The quaternary structure of Sau3AI is not known, but it is likely that it is a functional dimer, as most type II restriction endonucleases that have to catalyze a double-strand cut.Sau3AI is an unusually large restriction endonuclease. It possesses an additional 270 residues C-terminal to the presumptive catalytic N-terminal domain which is homologous in sequence to MutH (14Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), resulting in its being twice the size of MutH. Therefore, the question arises concerning the function of this additional C-terminal domain. It has been speculated (14Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that the role of these residues inSau3AI may be the functional equivalent to that of MutL and MutS in the case of MutH, such that Sau3AI is permanently activated. Since there is only a small amount of information regarding the biochemistry of Sau3AI, we therefore started to investigate some of the properties of Sau3AI, namely its quaternary structure and its mode of DNA cleavage. Here, we provide evidence thatSau3AI defines a new subtype of type II restriction endonucleases, being a monomer in solution that, to become active, has to dimerize in the presence of DNA, probably by binding to two recognition sites, which is accompanied by DNA looping. We conclude this from the following findings. First, we show thatSau3AI, unlike most other type II restriction endonucleases, is a monomer in solution. Second, the rate of DNA cleavage bySau3AI is not linearly proportional to the protein concentration, suggesting a requirement for cooperative binding ofSau3AI to DNA to afford cleavage. Third, substrates containing more than one GATC site are cleaved by an order of magnitude more quickly than substrates with a single GATC site, suggesting either that a monomer of Sau3AI is interacting with two GATC sites or, more likely, that Sau3AI dimerizes on the DNA, in response to binding to two GATC sites, a conclusion that is substantiated by electron microscopy, which shows thatSau3AI induces loops on DNA with two GATC sites. Oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany).Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Sau3AI was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim). Protein purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was >95%.Sau3AI concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy using the theoretical extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 85,600m−1 cm−1based on the amino acid sequence of Sau3AI (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI Entrez server. In a search for structural homologs of the C-terminal domains of Sau3AI,LlaKR2I, and Sth368I, we used fold recognition methods based on sequence-derived predictions. For this purpose, we employed the metaserver Pcons (25Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which uses severalfold recognition programs, namely the Fold and Function Assignment System FFAS (26Rychlewski L.

Protein sequence alignments of the N-terminal domains of Sau3AI, LlaKR2I, andSth368I with MutH protein sequences and alignment of the C-terminal domains of Sau3AI, LlaKR2I, andSth368I were performed using the ClustalW program (33Lloyd A. embnet.news. 1997; 4: 2Google Scholar, 34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). The alignment of the C-terminal domain of LlaKR2I withEscherichia coli MutH is based on the results of the fold prediction server Pcons. The alignments were combined and analyzed further using the program GeneDoc (35Nicholas K.B. Nicholas H.B.J. Deerfield D.W.I. embnet.news. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Sau3AI (100 μl, 400 nm) was analyzed on a 4.4-ml linear sucrose density gradient from 8 to 38% (w/w) sucrose in 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA at 4 °C in an SW 60Ti rotor using a Beckman L-60 ultracentrifuge at 55,000 rpm for 16 h. Samples of 200 μl were fractionated from the bottom of the tube using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech P1 pump and analyzed for restriction endonuclease activity using pUC8 as a substrate (see below). The following marker proteins were used: β-amylase (Mr = 200,000,s20,w = 8.9 S), alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr = 155,000,s20,w = 7.9), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 66,000,s20,w = 4.3 S), ovalbumin (Mr = 42,000,s20,w = 3.5), carbonic anhydrase (Mr = 29,000,s20,w = 2.8), and cytochromec (Mr = 12,000,s20,w = 2.1). Gel filtration was performed withSau3AI (100 μl, 400 nm) on a Superdex 200TM column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2150 mm NaCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol at 22 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Merck-Hitachi Model 6200A high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus with a Model 655 photometer (set at 280 nm) and a Model D-2500 Chromato-Integrator. The same standard proteins were used as described for sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The concentration of pUC8 plasmid DNA isolated from the dam-negative strain JM110 was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 107m−1 cm−1. Cleavage reactions were performed at 37 °C with 20 ng/μl pUC8 (11 nm) in 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 66 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, andSau3AI at the concentrations indicated. Cleavage reactions were stopped by removing 10-μl aliquots from the reaction mixture and adding 0.2 volume of gel loading buffer (250 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The reaction products were analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The ethidium bromide-stained gels were analyzed with a video documentation system (INTAS, Göttingen, Germany). The intensities of the DNA bands were quantified using the program TINA (Version 2.07d). Initial rates were calculated from the disappearance of the supercoiled form of the plasmid and the appearance of the linear form of the plasmid, respectively. Substrates containing either one or two Sau3AI recognition sequences were produced by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. Either plasmid pET15b-XhoI (a variant of pET15b in which three GATC sites at positions 491, 497, and 501 were mutated and a newXhoI site at position 491 was introduced) or pHisPI-SceI-N (36Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used as a template to obtain PCR products of varying length and site distance using the primers indicated in Table I. PCR purification was performed with the PCR purification kit from QIAGEN Inc. (Hilden, Germany). Each substrate (548 and 529 bp in length, respectively) at a concentration of 20 nm was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations ofSau3AI in the same buffer as used in the plasmid DNA cleavage assay. At defined time intervals, samples were removed from the reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 volume of gel loading buffer, and the reaction products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels. After staining with ethidium bromide, the gels were analyzed as described above for the plasmid DNA cleavage assay.Table ILength of PCR substrates and position of Sau3AI recognition sequenceTemplatePrimer A1-aGEX-her-lang, ATAAACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCAC; A783, ATCTCGACGCTCTCCCTTATGCG; B236, TAGAGGCCCCAAGGGGTTAT; PRIM1, AACGCAGTCAGGCACCGTGT; HomeB, ATGGATTGGTGATGGATTGTCTGACA; HomeG, CGCGCGAGGCAGCTCTAGAGCGGC.Primer B1-aGEX-her-lang, ATAAACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCAC; A783, ATCTCGACGCTCTCCCTTATGCG; B236, TAGAGGCCCCAAGGGGTTAT; PRIM1, AACGCAGTCAGGCACCGTGT; HomeB, ATGGATTGGTGATGGATTGTCTGACA; HomeG, CGCGCGAGGCAGCTCTAGAGCGGC.LengthNo. of GATC sitesPosition of GATC site(s)Distance between sitesbppET15b-XhoIGEX-her-langA7839082447719272pET15b-XhoIB236A783548287359272pET15b-XhoIPRIM1A3025291257pHisPI-SceI-NHomeBHomeG120413021-a GEX-her-lang, ATAAACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCAC; A783, ATCTCGACGCTCTCCCTTATGCG; B236, TAGAGGCCCCAAGGGGTTAT; PRIM1, AACGCAGTCAGGCACCGTGT; HomeB, ATGGATTGGTGATGGATTGTCTGACA; HomeG, CGCGCGAGGCAGCTCTAGAGCGGC. Open table in a new tab DNA fragments of 1204 or 906 bp in length containing one or two Sau3AI recognition sequences, respectively, were produced by PCR (TableI). The DNA fragments were purified by gel extraction using NucleoSpin® Extract 2-in-1 (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany). DNA and protein were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 5 nm DNA and various concentrations of Sau3AI ranging from 0 to 100 nm (molar ratios of enzyme to DNA between 1:1 and 20:1) in 10 mm in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2. Complexes were fixed with 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and, after 3-fold dilution in 10 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2, adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica as described (37Spiess E. Lurz R. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 20: 293-323Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 100 kV and a BioCam CCD camera (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems GmbH, Gauting, Germany). To determine contour length, measurements were carried out on projections of 35-mm negatives using a digitizer (LM4, Brühl, Nuremberg, Germany). Histograms were generated as described (38Weigel C. Schmidt A. Ruckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An analysis of the molecular weight and quaternary structure of type II restriction endonucleases revealed that Sau3AI has an unusual high molecular weight for a typical type II restriction endonuclease. Based on its amino acid sequence, theMr of 56,468 for Sau3AI is well above the average molecular weight of an orthodox dimeric type II restriction enzyme (excluding type IIs restriction endonucleases), which is ∼31,000 ± 8000 (mean ± S.D.). Of 152 restriction endonucleases (Rebase 01/25/2001) classified as type II, 143 haveMr values below 45,000. Type IIs restriction endonucleases, a subclass of type II enzymes, haveMr values ranging from 34,000 to 116,000, with a median of 52,000. For one type IIs restriction endonuclease,FokI (Mr = 66,215), it has been shown that it is monomeric in solution, but has to dimerize on the DNA to form an active endonuclease (3Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Other larger than average type II restriction endonucleases are type IIe enzymes, e.g. EcoRII, which is a homodimer (Mr = 2 × 45,608) in solution and has two binding sites for DNA, one of which is only catalytically competent (39Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krueger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Kupper D. Reuter M. Krueger D.H.

Some other type II restriction endonucleases with an unusually high molecular weight have been shown to be monomeric (at least in the absence of substrate),e.g. CcrI with an Mr of 65,300 (43Syddall R. Stachow C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 825: 236-243Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and BsuRI with an Mr of 66,300 (44Bron S. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 112-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), for which only little biochemical information is available. To examine the quaternary structure of Sau3AI, we subjected Sau3AI to both gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation analyses. Both methods can be used to determine the native molecular weight of a protein. As shown in Fig. 1,Sau3AI sedimented between bovine serum albumin (Mr = 66,000) and ovalbumin (Mr = 42,000). On a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, Sau3AI again eluted between bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. Our results therefore suggest that, in the absence of DNA,Sau3AI, whose predicted Mr is 56,468, is as a monomer in solution. This raises the question of how a monomeric enzyme can catalyze a concerted double-strand cut, whichSau3AI does (Fig. 2). Two possibilities must be considered. 1) Sau3AI has two active sites/monomer, or 2) Sau3AI dimerizes in the presence of DNA.Figure 2Time course of supercoiled plasmid DNA cleavage by Sau3AI. pUC8 DNA (11 nm) was incubated with 0.9 nm Sau3AI. Aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated, and the reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The supercoiled (sc) substrate was cleaved to give the linear (li) DNA without the accumulation of the open circle (oc) form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal domain of Sau3AI has been reported to share sequence homology with MutH (14Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since the catalytically important residues of MutH are conserved in the N-terminal domain ofSau3AI (Fig. 3), it is likely that this domain of Sau3AI is responsible for DNA cleavage. The function of the C-terminal domain of Sau3AI is not known. In a search for a function of the C-terminal domain comprising ∼270 amino acid residues, we looked for sequence homologs. The only other sequence homologs of the C-terminal domain of Sau3AI found are the C-terminal domains of LlaKR2I andSth368I, putative type II restriction endonucleases that have sequence homology to both the N- and C-terminal domains ofSau3AI (Table II). PSI-BLAST searches (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) with the C-terminal domain ofSau3AI, LlaKR2I, or Sth368I failed to identify significant sequence similarity to any other protein in the data base. Therefore, we searched for structural homologs of the C-terminal domains of Sau3AI, LlaKR2I, andSth368I using the metaserver Pcons, which employs severalfold recognition programs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Remarkably, the top hit for all three C-terminal domains was MutH (Table III). The pattern of secondary structures predicted for the C-terminal domains of Sau3AI,LlaKR2I, and Sth368I agreed with the experimentally determined structure of MutH (data not shown), further supporting the threading results. Moreover, inspection of the sequence alignment using the N- and C-terminal domains of Sau3AI,LlaKR2I, and Sth368I and all available MutH protein sequences revealed that almost all of the conserved residues are located in the structural core and/or around the active site of the crystal structure of MutH (14Ban C.

This led us to the conclusion thatSau3AI can be considered to be a pseudo-dimer,i.e. a polypeptide with two structurally similar domains. However, since only some of the catalytically important active-site residues (which are all present in the presumptive active site of the N-terminal domain) can be found in the C-terminal domain ofSau3AI (or LlaKR2I and Sth368I), it is unlikely that the C-terminal domain contains a functional active site.Table IIIdentities and similarities in the sequence alignment of E. coli MutH, Sau3AI, LlaKR2I, and Sth368ILength (amino acid residues)Sau3AILlaKR2ISth368IN-terminal halfC-terminal halfN-terminal halfC-terminal halfN-terminal halfC-terminal half%%%MutH229202-aPercentage of residues whose juxtaposition yields a >0 score in the Blosum 35 scoring table (upper line, identity; lower line, similarity).716141612392-aPercentage of residues whose juxtaposition yields a >0 score in the Blosum 35 scoring table (upper line, identity; lower line, similarity).2633343532Sau3AIN-terminal half2189341117112950284131C-terminal half271820111326422834LlaKR2IN-terminal half25081811303929C-terminal half2469143135Sth368IN-terminal half2321135C-terminal half2592-a Percentage of residues whose juxtaposition yields a >0 score in the Blosum 35 scoring table (upper line, identity; lower line, similarity).

Open table in a new tab There are only few examples of monomeric endonucleases that are capable of making a specific double-strand cut in one binding event, e.g.PI-SceI, which harbors two catalytic centers (46Christ F. Schoettler S. Wende W. Steuer S. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6908-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are now examples of type IIs (e.g. FokI) and IIf (e.g. SgrAI) restriction endonucleases known, which are monomeric (dimeric) in the absence of DNA, but dimerize (tetramerize) in the presence of DNA to achieve catalytic activity (3Bitinaite J.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these cases, a nonlinear dependence of catalytic activity on protein concentration has been reported. Therefore, the rate of DNA cleavage catalyzed by Sau3AI at various concentrations was determined to establish the relationship between the initial velocity of the reaction and the enzyme concentration. Supercoiled pUC8 plasmid DNA containing 15Sau3AI recognition sites was used as a substrate.Sau3AI restriction endonuclease was added to the reaction mixture, and the extent of cleavage was measured by withdrawing aliquots at defined time intervals and analyzing the amount of supercoiled plasmid DNA remaining. Typical results of such cleavage assays are shown in Fig. 4 A. Initial velocities (v0) were calculated for any given concentration of Sau3AI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the v0 versus Sau3AI concentration plot, a nonlinear dependence was obtained (Fig. 4 B). The fact that, at lowSau3AI concentrations, the initial velocity of the reaction is not directly proportional to the enzyme concentration suggests that the Sau3AI-catalyzed reaction is higher than first order with respect to the concentration of Sau3AI. The nonlinear relationship of v0 versus Sau3AI concentration is best explained by a cooperative binding of Sau3AI molecules to the DNA substrate. An alternative explanation for a sigmoidal dependence of the initial rate of DNA cleavage on the enzyme concentration could be that the enzyme is being inactivated at low concentrations. Although this cannot be excluded, we regard it as unlikely because the DNA cleavage assay was carried out in the presence of 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. It must be emphasized that the intermediates with only one recognition site left (Fig. 4, I-1) were cleaved only very slowly, an observation typical for type IIe restriction enzymes, which require two sites for efficient DNA cleavage. The cooperative interaction of Sau3AI with DNA could be explained by different mechanisms. For instance, it could be that the active site is formed only by dimerization of the N-terminal domains of two Sau3AI molecules, as observed for FokI endonuclease (3Bitinaite J. Wah D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2030945572,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an important regulator of protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. Changes in expression and activity of PTP1B have been associated with various human diseases; however, the mechanisms by which PTP1B expression is regulated have yet to be characterized. Previously, we have shown that the expression of PTP1B is enhanced by p210 Bcr-Abl and that PTP1B is a specific antagonist of transformation induced by this oncoprotein protein-tyrosine kinase. Here we have characterized the PTP1B promoter and demonstrate that a motif with features of a stress-response element acts as ap210 Bcr-Abl-responsive sequence, termed PRS. We have shown that three C2H2 zinc finger proteins, namely Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1, bind to PRS. Whereas binding of either Sp1 or Sp3 induced promoter function, Egr-1 repressed Sp3-mediated PTP1B promoter activation. The binding of Egr-1 to PRS is suppressed by p210 Bcr-Abl due to the inhibition of Egr-1 expression, resulting in the enhancement of PTP1Bpromoter activity.

Furthermore, disturbance of the delicate balance between the actions of PTKs and PTPs has been shown to be the cause of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and inflammation. The PTPs are now known to consist of a large family of receptor-like and nontransmembrane enzymes that rival the PTKs in structural diversity and complexity (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTPs can both antagonize PTK-induced signaling events and cooperate with PTKs to promote signal transduction processes in vivo, thus highlighting further their importance as an integral component of the cellular response to environmental cues. With this realization that PTPs are critical regulators of cellular signaling events, they have become a focus of attention for their potential to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in human disease. The prototypic member of the PTP family is PTP1B. It was first purified from human placenta as a catalytic domain of 37 kDa (2Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to occur in vivo as a full-length protein of ∼50 kDa (3Guan K.L. Haun R.S. Watson S.J. Geahlen R.L.

A. 1990; 80: 5148-5152Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PTP1B is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain fused to a non-catalytic, C-terminal segment that serves a regulatory function, targeting the protein to the cytoplasmic face of membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (6Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 63: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of insights have been gained into the physiological function of PTP1B that have emphasized its potential importance in various human disease states. For example, PTP1B has been reported to act as a negative regulator of signaling events initiated by several growth factor/hormone receptor PTKs, including the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors, as well as signaling events induced by cytokines (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Several reports noted enhanced expression levels of PTP1B in diabetic and insulin-resistant patients and animal models that may affect insulin signaling (7Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 8Byon J.C. Kusari A.B. Kusari J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2000; 274: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was also reported that there might be a negative feedback loop, governed by insulin and insulin-like growth factor stimulation, which could lead to up-regulation of PTP1B gene expression (10Kenner K.A. Hill D.E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25455-25462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol.

Of particular interest has been the demonstration that PTP1B knockout mice display hypersensitivity to insulin and resistance to diet-induced obesity (12Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies have defined how PTP1B recognizes the activation loop of the insulin receptor as a substrate and thus can modulate signaling in response to stimulation by the hormone (14Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the exciting possibility that an inhibitor of PTP1B may be of therapeutic use in the treatment of diabetes and obesity (15Moller N.P.H. Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. McCormack J.G. Curr. Opin. Drug Disc. Dev. 2000; 3: 527-540PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in the levels of PTP1B have been noted in several human diseases, particularly those associated with disruption of the normal patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation. Work from our own laboratory (16LaMontagne K.R.J. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) has shown that the expression of PTP1B is induced specifically by the p210 Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, a PTK that is directly responsible for the initial manifestations of chronic myelogenous leukemia. We have also observed that PTP1B, but not TC-PTP, its closest relative, suppresses p210 Bcr-Abl-mediated signaling and transformation (17LaMontagne K.R.J. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, PTP1B may also function as an antagonist of the p210 Bcr-Abl oncoprotein PTK in vivo. In addition, changes in PTP1B levels have been associated with other human cancers associated with oncoprotein PTKs (18Zhai Y.F. Beittenmiller H. Wang B. Gould M.N. Oakley C. Esselman W.J. Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2272-2278PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wiener J.R. Kerns B.J. Harvey E.L. Conaway M.R. Iglehart J.D. Berchuck A. Bast R.C.J. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 1994; 86: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which PTP1B gene expression is regulated in these contexts remains to be determined. We have observed that the effects of p210 Bcr-Abl on expression of thePTP1B gene are manifested at the transcriptional level. In order to define the mechanism by which PTP1B gene expression is regulated, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human gene. We found two elements that are important for expression from the humanPTP1B promoter. A sequence motif that possesses features of a site of interaction with GATA-binding proteins was identified at −167 to −151 bp from the transcription start site. Disruption of this site inhibited promoter activity in the presence of p210 Bcr-Abl, but responsiveness to the oncoprotein PTK was maintained. However, a p210 Bcr-Abl-responsivesequence, termed PRS, which was important for stimulation of activity in response to the PTK, was identified at −49 to −37 bp from the transcription start site. The PRS is contained in a sequence that displays features of a stress-responseelement (STRE), a feature originally identified inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (20Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Marchler G. Schuller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 22Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and that functions as a binding site for C2H2 zinc finger proteins (23Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In our study, we have shown that three mammalian C2H2 zinc finger proteins, Egr-1, Sp1, and Sp3, bind to PRS. Of these, both of Sp1 and Sp3 function as positive regulators, whereas Egr-1 represses Sp3-mediated transactivation of thePTP1B gene. Furthermore, expression of p210 Bcr-Abl results in down-regulation of the levels of Egr-1. Our data illustrate that the reciprocal actions of the Sp1/Sp3 and Egr-1 C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors are an important aspect of the regulation of PTP1B expression in response to the p210 Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. The 5′-flanking segment of the human PTP1B gene was isolated by PCR using the GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH). Two gene-specific primers (GSPs), 5′-GATAATGGCCGCCCAGCTCCCGGACTTGTC-3′ as GSP1 (31–60 bp relative to the translation start site) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGAGATCTCTCGAGGATCTGCTCGAACTCCTTTTCCATCTCCAT-3′ as GSP2 (1–30 bp relative to the translation start site and including an additional HindIII site), were selected on the basis of the sequence of the human PTP1B cDNA reported by Brown-Shimeret al. (5Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Lawrence J.B. Johnson C. Bruskin A. Green N.R. Hill D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 80: 5148-5152Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Primary PCR and secondary nested PCR were performed on adapter-ligated genomic libraries using the GSP1 and GSP2 gene-specific primers and the AP1 and AP2 adapter sequence primers. The resulting 2-kb PCR fragment was subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A series of 5′-deletion mutants of the PTP1B 5′-flanking region were made by PCR. The primers used for making of deletion mutants were as follows: for −838/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTCTGGGCCCCACCACACCA-3′; for −247/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTCCGTGGGCGGGGCTCCCGGG-3′; for −167/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTACGCGCGCTATTAGATATCT-3′; for −151/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTATCTCGCGGTGCTGGGGCC-3′; for −49/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGGCGGAGCCCCTGGCAGGCGT-3′; for −37/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTTGGCAGGCGTGATGCGTAGT-3′; for −49(M1)/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTAAACGGAGCCCCTGGCAGGCGT-3; and for −49(M2)/+145, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGGCGGAGAAACTGGCAGGCGT-3. The underlined bases represent the site of mutation. The following 3′ primer was used for each PCR to exclude ATG translation initiation site: 5′-CCCAAGCTTGACGGGCCAGGGCGGCTGCTGCGCCTCCTT-3′. Amplified PCR products were digested by MluI andHindIII and inserted into the pGL3 Basic (Promega) reporter plasmid, in which promoter activity can be detected by expression of firefly luciferase. In order to identify the transcriptional start site, we used the CapSite 5′ end cDNA library (Eurogenetec) as a template for PCR, using two 5′ adapter sequences (RC1 and RC2) as 5′ primers together with an internal sequence in PTP1B (241–270 bp from the translation start site, 5′-GTTAGGCAAAGGGCCCTGGGTAAGAATGTA-3′) as the 3′ primer. The other internal sequence in PTP1B (1–30 bp relative to the translation start site, 5′-ATGGAGATGGAAAAGGAGTTCGAGCAGATC-3′) was used as the 5′ control primer. Parental Rat1 fibroblasts and Rat1 fibroblasts expressing p210 Bcr-Abl (Rat1 p210), a catalytically inactive mutant of p210 Bcr-Abl (Rat1 p210 kinase negative) and v-Abl (Rat1 v-Abl) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila SL2 cells were maintained in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 25 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's protocols. Typically, we used 1 μg of the reporter plasmid for expression of firefly luciferase and 1 μg of pRL-TK (Promega), an expression vector containing cDNA encodingRenilla luciferase, as an internal control of transfection efficiency. For Drosophila SL2 cells, 2.0 × 106 cells were used for each transfection with LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). One μg of the reporter plasmid for expression of firefly luciferase was used. Expression plasmids for either human Sp1 (pPac Sp1), Sp3 (pPacU Sp3), or control plasmid without insert (pPac) were cotransfected with different amounts of Egr-1 expression plasmid (pPac Egr-1) in the amounts indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. Cells were incubated with DNA-lipid complex for 24 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared from either Rat1, Rat1 p210 Bcr-Abl, or Rat1 p210 Bcr-Abl kinase negative cells according to the method of Sadowski and Gilman (24Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract (100 μg) was incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 0.125 μmokadaic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, together with each biotinylated DNA probe (200 pmol) and 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Oncogene) at 4 °C for 6 h. The protein-DNA complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with either anti-Egr-1, anti-Sp1, or anti-Sp3 antibodies. Bound proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following biotinylated, double-stranded DNA probes were used: for PRS, biotin-5′-CTGCTTCAGGGGCGGAGCCCCTGGCAG-3′ as sense and 5′-CTGCCAGGGGCTCCGCCCCTGAAGCAG-3′ as antisense; for mutated PRS probe (PRSM), biotin-5′-CTGCTTCAGAAACGGAGCCCCTGGCAG-3′ as a sense DNA and 5′-CTGCCAGGGGCTCCGTTTCTGAAGCAG-3′ as antisense (in which the underlined bases represent the mutation site). Nuclear extract (20 μg) from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were hybridized with antibodies against Egr-1, Sp1, or Sp3 and subjected to ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies to Egr-1 (C-19), Sp1 (PEP2), and Sp3 (D-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA (20 μg) was resolved on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nylon filters. Filters were hybridized with32P-labeled probe in a buffer comprising 0.5 mNaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin at 60 °C for 12–16 h, then washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min and with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C, and then subjected to autoradiography. The cDNA probes used were rat egr-1 (1.8-kb, EcoRI-BamHI fragment), human sp1 (2.2- and 1.8-kb, BamHI fragment) and human sp3 (2.5-kb, NotI fragment). In order to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of expression of the human PTP1B gene, we isolated a 2-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the gene. The sequence of the proximal region up to −838 bp from the transcription initiation site is shown in Fig.1A. In order to identify the transcriptional start site, we used the CapSite 5′ end cDNA library (Eurogenetec) as a template for PCR, using two 5′ adapter sequences (RC1 and RC2) as 5′ primers together with an internal sequence in PTP1B (241–270 bp from the translation start site) as the 3′ primer. Another internal sequence in PTP1B (1–30 bp relative to the translation start site) was used as the 5′ control primer. By this approach, we cloned a 0.45-kb fragment (Fig. 1B), sequenced it, and identified 145 bp as the 5′-UTR in human PTP1B mRNA (Fig. 1A). A search for potential sites for interaction with DNA-binding proteins in the 5′-flanking region of the human PTP1B gene, using TFSEARCH, revealed several candidates. These include potential sites of interaction with the following: the AML-1 DNA-binding protein, which has been implicated in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation and is the product of a gene that is disrupted in certain myelogenous leukemias (25Tanaka T.

In addition, there are putative binding sites for GATA-binding proteins, which are important regulators of diverse cell differentiation pathways during development (33Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Finally, we observed that the human PTP1B gene lacks a TATA box, an initiator, or a downstream promoter element (38Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It has been reported that promoters that lack either a TATA box or an initiator element often contain multiple binding sites for Sp1, as we have noted here for the humanPTP1B gene. However, unlike many such genes that are often associated with “housekeeping” functions, PTP1B expression varies in response to a variety of signals, and the enzyme serves a critical function as a regulator of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated previously (16LaMontagne K.R.J. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that the levels of PTP1B mRNA and protein are enhanced specifically in various cells expressing p210 Bcr-Abl and that the PTK activity of the p210 Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is required for this effect. We have now generated a reporter construct in which expression of luciferase is driven by potential PTP1B promoter elements. This reporter construct, which contains 5′-flanking sequence from thePTP1B gene extending from −2 kb to +145 bp relative to the transcription initiation site, was transfected into various Rat-1 fibroblast lines, and production of firefly luciferase was monitored as a measure of promoter activity. Transfection efficiency was standardized according to expression of Renilla luciferase from a control plasmid. We observed 4-fold higher promoter activity in p210 Bcr-Abl-transformed Rat-1 cells (Rat1 p210 Bcr-Abl) compared with the parental Rat1 cells (Fig. 2). In addition, we observed that optimal expression from the PTP1Bpromoter required the kinase activity of p210 Bcr-Abl. Furthermore, expression of v-Abl, which shares the same catalytic domain as p210 Bcr-Abl, stimulated promoter activity only weakly (Fig. 2), in agreement with our previous observations of the effects of these PTKs on the levels of PTP1B protein (16LaMontagne K.R.J. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These data suggest that p210 Bcr-Abl triggers signaling events that culminate specifically in stimulation of the PTP1B promoter. To define the cis-acting element(s) in thePTP1B promoter, we made sequential truncations in the 5′-flanking region of the PTP1B gene and incorporated these deletion mutants into constructs where they drove expression of a luciferase reporter gene. The promoter activity of these constructs was compared following transfection into parental and p210 Bcr-Abl-transformed Rat1 fibroblasts. By using this approach, we identified a transcriptional enhancing element and a potentialp210 Bcr-Abl-responsive sequence, which we have termed PRS (Fig. 3). Truncation as far as −167 bp from transcription initiation site did not affect total promoter activity or responsiveness to p210 Bcr-Abl. However, we identified a transcriptional enhancing element, between −167 and −151 bp upstream from the transcription start site (Fig.3A), that displays features of a binding site for GATA family binding proteins (33Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of this element by truncation to −151 bp suppressed promoter activity by ∼60%, but the responsiveness of promoter activity to p210 Bcr-Abl was retained (Fig.3A). Truncation to −49 bp upstream from the transcription start site resulted in no further alteration in promoter activity, whereas promoter function was severely attenuated by truncation to −37 bp. Importantly, the residual activity was no longer responsive to p210 Bcr-Abl (Fig. 3A). This latter element, spanning −49 to −37 bp upstream from the transcription start site, is termed PRS and corresponds to a segment possessing features of an STRE (Fig.3B). STREs were originally identified in the promoter of theDDR2 and CTT1 gene in S. cerevisiaeand shown to bind C2H2 zinc finger proteins following stimulation by heat or osmotic stress (23Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). We introduced nucleotide substitution mutations to assess the importance of the putative STREs in PRS, and we observed that disruption of STRE-1 abolished p210 Bcr-Abl responsiveness, whereas mutation of STRE-2 was without effect (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that PRS may have a critical role in p210 Bcr-Abl-mediated up-regulation of PTP1B expression. Since we had noted that the sequence of the PRS motif possessed the features of an STRE, we assessed whether mammalian C2H2 zinc finger proteins would bind to this motif from the PTP1B promoter. We performed DNA “pull-down” assays, using biotinylated DNA probes derived from the sequence of PRS and nuclear extracts of Rat-1 fibroblast lines, to determine which proteins may bind to this motif. We observed that three C2H2 zinc finger family transcription factors, Egr-1, Sp1 and Sp3, from nuclear extracts of parental Rat-1 fibroblasts, associated with PRS probes (Fig.4A). A mutant PRS probe, in which STRE-1 was disrupted (PRSM), displayed significantly reduced affinity for these proteins (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we have used nuclear extracts of parental, p210 Bcr-Abl, and catalytically inactive p210 Bcr-Abl-expressing Rat-1 fibroblasts to determine the effects of expression of p210 Bcr-Abl on the interaction of these transcription factors with the PRS probe. We observed that expression of p210 Bcr-Abl led to a decrease in the level of Egr-1 protein (Fig.4, A and B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C), compared with that in parental Rat1 cells, resulting in a decrease in the interaction detected between Egr-1 and the PRS DNA probe (Fig.4A). In contrast, the presence of p210 Bcr-Abl enhanced the interaction of Sp1 protein with PRS (Fig. 4A) without affecting the expression level of this transcription factor (Fig. 4,B and C). These effects were dependent upon the catalytic activity of p210 Bcr-Abl. The expression levels of Sp3 and its association with the PRS probe were unaltered by p210 Bcr-Abl (Fig.4). These data indicate that PRS, which is a regulator of the activity of the PTP1B promoter, binds Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 and that expression of p210 Bcr-Abl controls the activity and expression of Sp1 and Egr-1, respectively. In order to test directly whether the C2H2 zinc finger family transcription factor Egr-1 may regulate PTP1B promoter activity, we performed cotransfection experiments in which this protein was expressed together with the reporter constructs in which expression of the luciferase gene was driven by the PTP1B promoter. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of p210 Bcr-Abl in Rat-1 fibroblasts suppressed the levels of endogenous Egr-1 compared with those observed in the parental cells. We observed that when we expressed Egr-1 ectopically in p210 Bcr-Abl-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts, up to levels that approximated those seen in the parental cells (Fig. 5,B and C), the luciferase activity driven by thePTP1B promoter was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed with constructs containing either the full-length promoter or PRS alone (Fig. 5A). These effects occurred without changes in the levels of Sp1 or Sp3 (data not shown). Furthermore, inhibition of promoter function by Egr-1 was not observed in the reporter construct containing the mutant PRS sequence (PRSM) (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that PTP1B gene expression may be negatively regulated by the transcription factor Egr-1 acting on the PRS motif in the promoter. We also conducted similar luciferase reporter assays inDrosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp factors (39Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), to assess the effect of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins on the activity of the human PTP1B promoter. The reporter plasmid containing the intact PTP1B promoter was cotransfected with expression vectors for Sp1 and/or Sp3, in the presence or absence of the Egr-1 expression vector. We observed that the intact PTP1Bpromoter-induced"

Here we present evidence that sequence-specific DNA and protein interactions at a specific array of DNA elements in the α2-MG promoter are critical for cooperative transcriptional activation of the α2-MG transcription by STAT3 and c-Jun. Our observations suggest that members of the IL-6 cytokine family induce formation of an α2-MG enhanceosome containing activated transcription factors in a specific spatial arrangement. Human HepG2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated at 2 × 105cells per well in 24-well plates. On the following day, cells were transfected with DNA (up to 1.5 µg per well) and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in triplicate. The plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was cotransfected to assess transfection efficiency. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were transferred to medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. Cells were then stimulated by addition of IL-6 (10 ng/ml), LIF (10 ng/ml), or OSM (10 ng/ml) in the presence of 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h or as indicated. IL-6, LIF, and OSM were purchased from R&D Systems. Luciferase was assayed according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega).

To construct plasmid pYN3218/GST-c-Jun, the mouse c-Jun coding sequence was fused in-frame with the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) coding sequence in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T; the entire GST-c-Jun fragment was then transferred to the mammalian expression vector pYN3218. The reporter plasmid pGL3-TKm-luc was derived from pGL3-TK-luc (Promega) by deletion of the AP1 site contributed by the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. This was accomplished by deleting 651 bp from pGL3-TK-luc, spanning positions −730 through −80 of the TK promoter, relative to the start site of transcription (43McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Axel R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Synthetic, double-stranded oligonucleotides AP1/SIE (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAATCATTTCCCGTAAATCATAGATCTTCC-3′), AP1(−)/SIE (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCTTGATGACCTGGCCGGAATCATTTCCCGTAAATCATAGATCTTCC-3′), AP1/SIE(−) (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAATCATCCACCGTAAATCATAGATCTTCC-3′), and AP1(−)/SIE(−) (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCTTGATGACCTGGCCGGAATCATCCACCGTAAATCATAGATCTTCC-3′) were digested with XhoI and BglII and cloned into pGL3-TKm-luc. (AP1 and SIE sites are underlined). The plasmid pGL3-α2MG-luc was constructed by transferring anSalI-BamHI fragment, containing the rat α2-macroglobulin promoter, from pBLCAT20 (39Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) into theXhoI site of pGL3-TKm-luc. Mutations were introduced into pGL3-α2MG-luc by oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). The following mutagenic oligonucleotides were used: AP1m (5′-GGCCATCAGTGACCTGTTCAGAGGATCTCG-3′); SIEm (5′-GAAAGTCCTTAATCCCCATGGGAATTCTTGCTAACG-3′); AP1*m (5′-GGCTAACGGGCTGGGAATTAACCTTGG-3′); AT1m (5′-CGGGTCAGGAGCCAACCTTGGCGG-3′); and AT2m (5′-CCTTGGCGGTCCGTAGGCCATCAG-3′). Pairwise binding site mutants were generated by a second round of mutagenesis. To construct pGL3-α2MG-Shift-luc, two rounds of mutagenesis were performed using oligonucleotides 5′-GGCTAACGGGTCAGGCTTTGAATTAACCTTGGCGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCTTGAATTAAGCGGTAATTAGGCCATCAGTG-3′. All mutations in expression and reporter constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. DNA-protein binding was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following duplex oligonucleotides were used as DNA probes (wild-type or mutant AP-1 and SIE sites are underlined): AP1/SIE (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAATCATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′); AP1(−)/SIE (5′-CGCTTGATGACCTGGCCGGAATCATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′); AP1/SIE(−) (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAATCATCCACCGTAAATCAT-3′); AP1(−)/SIE(−) (5′-CGCTTGATGACCTGGCCGGAATCATCCACCGTAAATCAT-3′); AT (5′-TCAGGAATTAACCTTGGCGGTAATTAGGCCATC-3′); ATm (5′-TCAGGAGCCAACCTTGGCGGTCCGTAGGCCATC-3′); AP1* (5′-CTGGCTAACGGGTCAGGAATTAA-3′); and AP1*m (5′-CTGGCTAATCGCGAGGGAATTAA-3′). Wild-type and mutant probes spanning the α2-macroglobulin promoter were prepared by digesting plasmids pGL3-α2MG-luc, pGL3-α2MG-SIEm-luc, pGL3-α2MG-AP1*m/AP1m-luc, and pGL3-α2MG-AT1/2m-luc withPvuI and TliI. Gel-purified oligonucleotides were annealed, labeled with32P, and used in EMSA as described previously (17Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled, duplex oligonucleotides was incubated with purified proteins or nuclear extracts and poly(dI-dC) (1 µg) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 24 µg of bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol); reactions (24 µl) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. For supershift experiments, antibody (1 µg) to STAT3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture after 15 min of incubation, and incubation was continued 15 min further at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel or as indicated. The pYN3218- c-Jun mammalian expression plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells as described above. At 40–48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Total cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing five times in the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and then dialyzed against STAT3 binding buffer. Purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon), and protein concentration was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Polyhistidine-tagged STAT 3 (His-STAT3) protein was expressed and purified as described previously (17Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In brief, Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant His-STAT3 and Jak1- or Jak2-expressing baculoviruses (17Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and harvested at 72 h after infection. The cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa3MO4, 15% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin), supplemented with 15 mm imidazole. Total cell lysate was bound to Ni2+-Probond (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing five times with lysis buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, bound protein was eluted stepwise with lysis buffer supplemented with 40 mm, 50 mm, and finally 350 mm imidazole. Fractions containing His-STAT3 protein were pooled, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Pooled protein was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. Purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The final protein concentration was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. STAT3β, a truncated isoform of STAT3 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acid residues, cooperates with c-Jun in transactivation of the α2-MG promoter in EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells (37Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the mechanism of cooperativity between STAT3 and c-Jun, we first examined the binding of STAT3 and c-Jun in vitro to an oligonucleotide containing binding sites for both proteins. Polyhistidine-tagged STAT3β and GST-fused c-Jun proteins were expressed separately in Sf9 cells and COS-7 cells, respectively. STAT3β was activated by co-infection with baculovirus-encoding Jak1 or Jak2. STAT3β or GST-fused c-Jun protein each exhibited specific binding to an AP1/SIE-containing DNA probe when assayed by EMSA (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3). In addition, a second, more slowly migrating species was observed when STAT3β and GST-c-Jun were combined with the AP1/SIE probe (Fig.1 A, lanes 6 and 7). This slower species was not seen in control reactions containing STAT3β and GST protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). Mutation of either the STAT3 binding site (AP1/SIE(−)) or c-Jun binding site (AP1(−)/SIE) abolished this effect (Fig. 1 A,lanes 8–21), whereas mutation of both sites (AP1(−)/SIE(−)) eliminated all specific binding (Fig. 1 A,lanes 22–28). Antibodies against STAT3, GST, or c-Jun all decreased the yield of the slow mobility complex while inducing the appearance of supershifted species (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 5–7 with lane 4). In comparison, a DNA-protein complex containing c-Jun alone was disrupted by the antibody against c-Jun but not by the anti-STAT3 antibody (data not shown). These results indicated that both STAT3β and GST-c-Jun were present in the slow mobility complex. We next examined STAT3α and c-Jun proteins for cooperative DNA binding activity in vitro, using the AP1/SIE oligonucleotide as a probe. As was seen for STAT3β, incubation of the AP1/SIE probe with STAT3α and c-Jun was associated with the appearance of a slowly migrating complex (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 2 and 3 withlane 4). Mutation of either DNA binding site abolished formation of the slower complex (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5–12), and mutation of both binding sites abolished specific binding altogether (Fig. 1 C, lanes 13–16). Taken together, these results indicate that the formation in vitroof DNA-protein complexes containing STAT3 and c-Jun requires specific DNA binding by both proteins. We next attempted to correlate the results of in vitro DNA binding experiments with the transcriptional activities of endogenous STAT3 and c-Jun proteins in cytokine-stimulated NIH3T3 or HepG2 cell lines. For this purpose, we assembled a luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-AP1/SIE-luc) in which transcription is driven by an artificial promoter containing an SIE (TTCCCGTAA) and an AP1 site (TGACTCA), separated by 11 bp. Additional reporter constructs contained mutations at the AP1 site (pGL3-AP1(−)/SIE-luc), the SIE (pGL3-AP1/SIE(−)-luc), or both (pGL3-AP1(−)/SIE(−)-luc). Wild-type or mutant constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 or HepG2 cells, and luciferase activity was assayed in response to stimulation with IL-6, LIF, or OSM (Fig.2, A and B). Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with IL-6 resulted in a 5-fold induction of luciferase expression from the standard construct, whereas LIF or OSM induced increases of 10- to 18-fold (Fig. 2 A,AP1/SIE-luc). Mutation of the c-Jun binding site (AP1(−)/SIE-luc) reduced the response to IL-6, LIF, or OSM to about 15% that observed for pGL3-AP1/SIE-luc (Fig. 2 A,AP1(−)/SIE-luc); the residual inducible response may reflect the binding of active, endogenous STAT3 to the intact SIE site. Mutation of the STAT3 binding site (AP1/SIE(−)-luc) reduced induction of luciferase activity by IL6, LIF, or OSM to about 30% that seen for pGL3-AP1/SIE-luc (Fig. 2 A,AP1/SIE(−)-luc); the residual induction may in part result from endogenous protein binding to the AP1 site. Mutation of both the AP1 site and the SIE resulted in a near complete loss of responsiveness to cytokines (Fig. 2 A, AP1(−)/SIE(−)-luc). These observations indicate that the SIE and AP1 sites interact synergistically in the induction of transcription from pGL3-AP1/SIE-luc by IL-6, LIF, or OSM in NIH3T3 cells. Treatment of HepG2 cells with OSM or IL-6 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold induction of AP1/SIE-luc reporter expression, whereas LIF had little effect on reporter activity (Fig. 2 B,AP1/SIE-luc). The IL-6 and OSM induction ratios were lower than those seen in NIH3T3 cells; this difference may be due in part to the higher basal activity of the AP1/SIE-luc reporter in HepG2 cells. Mutation of the c-Jun or STAT3 binding sites reduced induction to between 10 to 25% that seen with the AP1/SIE-luc plasmid (Fig.2 B, AP1(−)/SIE-luc andAP1/SIE(−)-luc). Cytokine-induced transcription from the artificial AP1/SIE promoter was completely abolished by mutations of both STAT3 and AP1 binding sites in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B,AP1(−)/SIE(−)-luc). These results suggested that cooperative binding of STAT3 and c-Jun might underlie the synergism between SIE and AP1 elements in supporting induction of AP1/SIE-luc transcription by cytokines. The rat α2-MG promoter contains an IL-6-responsive APRE sequence and an AP1 site, both of which are required for IL-6-inducible transcription (39Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 41Kunz D. Zimmermann R. Heisig M. Heinrich P.C.

A. 1990; 87: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine STAT3 and c-Jun interactions at this physiological promoter, we constructed a reporter plasmid (pGL3-α2MG-luc) that contains the luciferase coding region under control of the rat α2-MG promoter sequence from −190 to −100 (Fig.3 A). The pGL3-α2MG-luc plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells, and luciferase expression was assayed after stimulation with IL-6 or OSM. Transcriptional activity was markedly increased upon treatment with IL-6 (6-fold) or OSM (9-fold) (Fig. 3 B, α2MG-luc). No induction was seen with the control plasmid pGL3-TKm-luc, which lacks α2-MG promoter elements (Fig. 3 B,pGL3-TKm). Mutation of the APRE site of the α2-MG promoter (Fig.3 A, SIEm) abolished cytokine induction of luciferase expression (Fig. 3 B,α2MG-SIEm-luc), consistent with the interpretation that STAT3 binding to the APRE site is essential for activation of the α2-MG promoter by IL-6 or OSM. To determine whether an intact APRE could support IL-6-mediated α2-MG transcription in the absence of an AP1 site, the c-Jun binding site in the α2-MG promoter was mutated (Fig. 3 A, AP1m). Despite the presence of an intact STAT3 binding site, transcription of the AP1 mutant reporter was decreased to 30% of the levels supported by the intact α2-MG sequence in the presence of IL-6 or OSM (Fig.3 B, α2MG-AP1m-luc). Transcription of the reporter construct containing intact AP1 and SIE sites was 3-fold greater than the additive effects of the AP1 and SIE sites alone, suggesting that STAT3 and AP1 binding sites cooperate in activation of the α2-MG promoter by IL-6 or OSM Upon inspection, the −190 to −100 region of the α2-MG promoter was found to contain an additional potential AP1 site (AP1*, at −152 to −140) and two AT-rich regions (AT1 and AT2, at −143 to −138 and −128 to −123, respectively) (Fig. 3 A).

Ligand binding activates Gq, leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and a rise in cytosolic free calcium. This, in turn, affects cell contractility, secretion, gene transcription, and cell proliferation. More recently, the AT1 receptor has also been shown to signal by activating nonmembrane tyrosine kinases including Src, Fyn, and Pyk2 (3Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Semeniuk D.J. Doan T.N. Bernstein K.E. Regul. Pept. 1998; 78: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

Structure-function studies of the AT1 receptor have defined amino acids critical for coupling the receptor to G-proteins. For example, mutation of either Asp74 or Tyr292 results in the loss of G-protein coupling and blocks the ligand-dependent production of IP3 (11Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B.

However, the effect of these mutations on AT1 receptor-dependent tyrosine kinase signaling is not known. In fact, dissecting the importance of angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation signaling from G-protein activation is difficult because of multiple conversion points. For example, both the G-protein and tyrosine kinase pathways activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (9Schorb W. Peeler T.C. Madigan N.N. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

To separate the effects of AT1 receptor activation of G-proteins from that of tyrosine kinases, we studied a modified AT1 receptor termed M5. The M5 mutant varies from the wild-type AT1 receptor in that the last five tyrosines (positions 292, 302, 312, 319, and 339) within the intracellular carboxyl tail of the AT1 receptor were mutated to phenylalanine. We found that the M5 receptor cannot induce a ligand-mediated calcium signal, suggesting an uncoupling of the mutant receptor from G-protein activation. In contrast, the M5 receptor retained its ability to activate the Jak-STAT pathway. We also studied two other cell lines with defects in calcium signaling. One is a Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO) cell line stably transfected with an AT1 receptor containing a D74E mutation. This modified AT1 receptor was previously shown to be uncoupled from G-protein activation (11Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, we investigated angiotensin II signaling in fibroblasts derived from mice with a genetic inactivation of Gαq/11 (13Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M.

In both cell lines, angiotensin II stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. These studies are the first to show the ability of a seven-transmembrane receptor to activate an intracellular tyrosine kinase pathway in the absence of a G-protein-coupled rise in intracellular calcium. The M5 construct was made using dut− ung− mutagenesis (Bio-Rad) and verified by DNA sequencing. Native CHO were maintained in F-12 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), 0.1 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For the generation of AT1 and M5 CHO clones, the cells were stably transfected with either wild-type rat AT1A or M5 plasmid DNA under the control of the SV40 promoter (vector pZeoSV; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were selected with 250 μg/ml of zeocin until individual clones were prevalent. The cells were ring-cloned and screened for binding of 125I-sarcosyl1, Ile8-angiotensin II (125I-Sar-Ile). The cells were maintained in 125 μg/ml of zeocin for all subsequent cultures.

The cells were washed twice with physiological saline (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 10 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Varying concentrations of125I-Sar-Ile were then added in the absence or presence of 1 μm angiotensin II for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were placed on ice and washed four times with physiological saline without bovine serum albumin. NaOH (0.5 m) was added to each well, and the lysed cells were counted with a γ counter. Protein content was determined for each plate using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cells were harvested using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Briefly, cells were serum-deprived for 12–16 h and then stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for various times in 5 ml F-12 media. Trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. The cells were scraped and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was extracted with 1,1,2-trichloro-trifluoroethane and trioctylamine (3:1). The aqueous top layer was saved, and the amount of IP3 was determined by radioreceptor assay according to the manufacturer's guidelines (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were serum-deprived for 16–20 h and stimulated with 100 nmangiotensin II for various durations. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of RIPA (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were scraped, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. Lysate was incubated with 1–5 μg of antibody and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G plus Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2–24 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitant was washed two-four times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). For Cos-7 cells, the cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pBOS/Jak2 (gift from Dr. D. M. Wojchowski, Pennsylvania State University) and 10 μg of either pZEO/AT1 or of pZEO/M5 using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dry skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with 1 μg/ml of monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:1000 polyclonal anti-Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or 1:1000 monoclonal anti-STAT1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 2 h. The membrane was washed three times for 30 min and subsequently incubated with 1:4000 secondary anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The membrane was then washed and exposed for enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on X-Omat Blue film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Unless otherwise stated, all membranes were stripped after blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and reblotted with anti-Jak2 or anti-STAT1 to ensure equal loading of the immunoprecipitated protein. CHO cells were plated onto 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well with F-12 media containing no serum for 16 h. The cells were then treated with vehicle or angiotensin II for 4 h. MTS tetrazolium (Owen's reagent) (CellTiter 96® Aqueous; Promega, Madison, WI) was added at a ratio of 1:5 relative to the volume of the media. The reaction proceeded for 4 h at 37 °C and was terminated by the addition of 2% SDS. The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. For each condition, the samples were done in triplicate and averaged for each experiment. All data were presented as representative trace or mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined when p < 0.05 using student's t test. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the rat AT1A receptor tyrosine residues 292, 302, 312, 319, and 339 were converted to phenylalanine. This mutant AT1 receptor, termed M5, lacks tyrosine residues in the intracellular carboxyl portion of the molecule. The wild-type AT1 and M5 mutant were each transfected into cloned Chinese hamster ovarian cells, which were screened for receptor expression by the binding of the angiotensin II antagonist 125I-Sar-Ile. For further study, we selected clones with similar level of expressed receptor; Scatchard analysis indicated that the B max for cells expressing the wild-type AT1 receptor was 0.33 ± 0.07 pmol/μg of protein (clone 1, n = 7) although theB max for the clone expressing the M5 receptor was 0.47 ± 0.09 pmol/μg of protein (clone 5, n= 8). Receptor expression in these stable clones was significantly higher than the endogenous angiotensin II receptors in native CHO cells (0.15 ± 0.05 pmol/μg of protein; n = 4). The wild-type AT1 receptor had a K d of 0.24 ± 0.09 nm (n = 6) whereas the M5 cells had a K d of 0.18 ± 0.04 nm(n = 7). Thus, the M5 mutant showed an affinity for125I-Sar-Ile that was equivalent to that of the wild-type receptor. In CHO cells, the AT1 receptor couples only to Gq and not Gs, Gi, or Go (16Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The activation of Gq results in the increase of cytosolic free calcium released from intracellular stores (2Teutsch B. Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Bernstein K.E. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Corvol P. Clauser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test whether G-protein coupling occurs with the M5 receptor, we measured angiotensin II-mediated intracellular calcium release (Fig.1). Nontransfected CHO cells have little to no change in intracellular calcium when treated with 100 nm angiotensin II. In contrast, the addition of 100 μm ATP activated the endogenous purinergic receptors resulting in a brisk transient increase in cytosolic free calcium. An equivalent protocol was performed on cells stably transfected for wild-type AT1 receptor (Fig.1 B). Here, the addition of angiotensin II resulted in a transient rise in cytosolic free calcium, indicating activation of Gq. As expected, the subsequent addition of ATP also induced a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium. We observed that losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, completely blocked the angiotensin II-mediated calcium response but had no effect on the ATP-evoked calcium response (data not shown). In contrast to the response of the wild-type AT1 receptor, CHO cells expressing the M5 mutant showed no increase in cytosolic free calcium in response to angiotensin II (Fig. 1 C). This is not because of an intrinsic defect in calcium signaling per se, because these cells were responsive to ATP. We also evaluated the signaling of a second CHO clone expressing the M5 receptor (clone 8). Despite a nearly 10-fold greater expression of M5 receptor levels than observed with clone 5 cells, clone 8 still showed no rise of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II (data not shown). These data suggested that mutation of the carboxyl-terminal five tyrosines of the AT1 receptor disabled receptor activation of Gq. Angiotensin II-mediated calcium signaling is dependent on IP3 formation. Therefore, we investigated whether the M5 cells were deficient in IP3 production. As shown in Fig.2 A, CHO cells expressing the wild-type AT1 receptor responded to angiotensin II with a rapid increase in IP3 levels within 15 s of stimulation. Quantitation showed a 4.0 ± 1.9-fold increase over basal levels of IP3 after 15 s (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, cells expressing the M5 receptor showed no significant change (1.1 ± 0.1-fold) in IP3 production after angiotensin II addition. These data are consistent with the lack of a ligand-mediated calcium response; taken together, they suggest a loss of Gq activation by the M5 receptor. In addition to IP3 and calcium signaling, the AT1 receptor also activates nonmembrane tyrosine kinases, such as Jak2. Initially, we chose to investigate M5 activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in transiently transfected Cos-7 cells. When these cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding both the wild-type AT1 receptor and Jak2, angiotensin II induced a marked increase of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation within 3 min of ligand addition (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, the M5 receptor also responded to angiotensin II with an increase of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, repetition of this protocol showed that the time course and magnitude of Jak2 activation were similar for both the wild-type AT1 and M5 receptors. A consequence of Jak2 activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1. When Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with Jak2 and either the wild-type AT1 receptor or the M5 receptor, STAT1 was phosphorylated in an equivalent time-dependent fashion upon ligand addition. The phosphorylation of STAT1 by angiotensin II was inhibited when cells expressing either receptor type were pretreated with 10 μm valsartan, a specific AT1 receptor antagonist. Thus, the experiments in Fig. 3 show that the M5 receptor, despite its inability to signal via calcium stimulation, remains fully capable of activating the Jak-STAT system in response to angiotensin II. In addition to Cos-7 cells, angiotensin II also stimulates STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells stably expressing the AT1 receptor (17Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether a CHO clone expressing the M5 receptor would induce STAT1 phosphorylation. Stimulation of native CHO cells with angiotensin II did not show a time-dependent change in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, both AT1- and M5-expressing cell clones showed an angiotensin II-mediated increase of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation that peaked at about 30 min after ligand addition. The difference in the time course of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in transiently transfected Cos-7 cells (peak phosphorylation at 5–10 min) and stably transfected CHO cells (peak phosphorylation at ∼30 min) was equivalent to that found in previously published work (4Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 17Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, these experiments and those in Fig. 3 show that the M5 receptor remains capable of activating tyrosine kinases despite the absence of calcium signaling. The exact mechanism of angiotensin II-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation in CHO cells appears to be somewhat different from that observed in the transiently transfected Cos-7 cells. In CHO cells stably expressing the wild-type AT1 or the mutant M5 receptors, we were unable to document a ligand-mediated increase of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). In addition, the Jak-specific inhibitor AG490 was not effective in inhibiting angiotensin II-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation in CHO cells but did block STAT1 phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells, a system in which angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of Jak2 has been well established (data not shown). In contrast to the negative results with AG490, pretreatment of CHO AT1 or M5 cells with the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did block angiotensin II-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Thus, although the exact mechanism for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells is not fully understood, these data establish that, despite an absence of calcium signaling, the M5 receptor can stimulate intracellular tyrosine kinases in response to angiotensin II. To further investigate the relationship between heterotrimeric G-proteins and angiotensin II-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases, we studied two additional lines of cells. Previously, it was reported that a CHO cell line stably transfected with an AT1 receptor bearing a D74E point mutation does not couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins and, as a consequence, does not mobilize intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II (11Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When the CHO D74E cell line was stimulated with angiotensin II and studied for the time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, we found this receptor was similar to the M5 receptor in that tyrosine kinase activity was preserved in the absence of calcium signaling (Fig.6 A). We also investigated angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 using fibroblasts isolated from Gαq/11-deficient mice (13Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These mice were prepared using embryonic stem cell targeting and bear a mutation in both Gαq and Gα11 rendering these proteins functionally inactive. Again, angiotensin II resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.6 B). The time course of STAT1 phosphorylation was more rapid than that observed with CHO cells but was similar to the time course observed in Cos-7 cells (Fig. 3) and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (4Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). As anticipated, the effect of angiotensin II on STAT1 phosphorylation in Gαq/11-deficient fibroblast was markedly blunted by the AT1 receptor inhibitor valsartan (data not shown). A known effect of angiotensin II is the rapid stimulation of early response genes (19Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the onset of cellular proliferation (2Teutsch B. Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Bernstein K.E. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Corvol P. Clauser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The onset of cell proliferation was evaluated in CHO cells expressing either the wild-type AT1 or the M5 receptor mutant. These cells were serum-starved and then treated for 4 h in the absence or presence of 100 nm angiotensin II (Fig.7). The addition of angiotensin II stimulated cellular proliferation in both AT1 and M5 cells as compared with cells not treated with the ligand (Fig. 7, Ang IIversus Basal). The mitogenic effect of angiotensin II was ablated when the AT1 or M5 cells were pretreated with genistein or herbimycin, both potent inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. The native CHO cells did not show any significant differences in cell proliferation with or without angiotensin II (data not presented). These data suggest that the activation of tyrosine kinases by angiotensin II appears necessary for the induction of CHO cell proliferation by this ligand. Furthermore, because proliferation is observed with the M5 mutant, G-protein-mediated calcium signaling appears not to be necessary for the proliferation initiated by angiotensin II. The classical signaling pathway for the AT1 receptor is to couple and activate heterotrimeric G-proteins. Recently, experiments established that this receptor can also activate nonmembrane tyrosine kinases including the Jak-STAT pathway (4Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 18Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5592-5595Google Scholar). A problem in defining the functional role of angiotensin II-mediated tyrosine kinase activation is the difficulty of differentiating the effects mediated by heterotrimeric G-proteins and calcium elevation from the effects predominantly due to the kinase activation. To gain insight into this question, we studied the M5 angiotensin II receptor. This molecule contains five discrete point mutations converting the carboxyl five tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. In response to ligand, the M5 receptor showed no significant elevation of IP3 and cytosolic free calcium. This observation was consistent with the work of Marie et al. (12Marie J. Maigret B. Joseph M.P. Larguier R. Nouet S. Lombardi C. Bonnafous J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20815-20818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who identified a single point mutation of the AT1 receptor, Y292F, that hindered the production of total inositol phosphates. Marie et al. (12Marie J. Maigret B. Joseph M.P. Larguier R. Nouet S. Lombardi C. Bonnafous J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20815-20818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that this mutant receptor was uncoupled from its endogenous G-proteins. In our hands, the M5 mutation is not functionally identical to the Y292F mutation; we find that an AT1 receptor with a single Y292F mutation showed a partial calcium signal in response to angiotensin II (data not shown). Thus, we believe that the four additional Tyr to Phe mutations present in the M5 receptor are necessary for full elimination of G-protein-coupled signaling. Despite the inability of the M5 receptor to stimulate an increase of intracellular calcium, the receptor is still able to activate tyrosine kinases including Jak2. Previously, our laboratory identified the AT1 motif 319YIPP as critical in angiotensin II-mediated activation of Jak2 (18Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5592-5595Google Scholar). This work suggested that it was the proline residues within the YIPP motif that were critical for Jak2 activation. Because the M5 mutant contains a Y319F mutation, the ability of the M5 mutant to stimulate Jak2 reemphasizes that mechanisms apart from AT1 receptor phosphotyrosine residues are critical in the activation process. At present, the exact biochemical pathway by which the AT1 receptor stimulates intracellular tyrosine kinases is unknown. Other groups have investigated the structural basis for AT1receptor activation of heterotrimeric proteins. In particular, Bihoreauet al. (11Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) found that an AT1 receptor with a D74E mutation cannot induce a calcium transient. Using CHO cells stably transfected with the D74E receptor by Bihoreau et al. (11Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we independently confirmed that the AT1 D74E receptor does not stimulate calcium but does stimulate STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, similar to our experience with M5. Finally, our studies of cells with a genetic inactivation of Gαq and Gα11 showed that the AT1 receptor can activate tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of these G-proteins. Signaling by the AT1 receptor in the absence of Gαq/11 is similar to M5 receptor signaling in that both appear to represent examples of tyrosine kinase activation in the absence of G-protein coupling. Normally, angiotensin II-mediated signaling is complex with many conversion points between signaling pathways stimulated by elevated intracellular calcium and pathways downstream of kinase activation. Our work now establishes that in CHO cells, the onset of cell proliferation observed with angiotensin II can be attributed in large measure to an activation of tyrosine kinase pathways. The creation of mutant receptors lacking the ability to stimulate specific intracellular pathways is a powerful approach toward establishing the functional cause and effects of individual signaling pathways.

To substantiate the association of predicted metabolic pathways with the apicoplast and to further characterize this organelle, we have attempted to purify the apicoplast using various cell fractionation methods. Nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins are characterized by a bipartite targeting sequence consisting of a signal peptide at the extreme N terminus followed by a plastid transit domain (11Roos D.S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) indicate that this bipartite structure is both necessary and sufficient for targeting proteins into the apicoplast. Targeting appears to proceed via the secretory pathway with sequential removal of the signal peptide and the plastid transit peptide (11Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G.K. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although removal of the secretory signal sequence (in the endoplasmic reticulum) is difficult to detect by Western blotting, the processing of the plastid-targeting domain is easily observed and presumed to occur within the plastid lumen (22Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We have exploited the ability to target heterologous reporter proteins into the apicoplast to develop fluorescent and enzymatic markers for organellar purification. One recombinant fusion protein was found to disrupt apicoplast segregation (8He C.Y. Shaw M.K. Pletcher C.H. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), yielding plastid-deficient and “super-apicoplast”-containing parasites by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These mutants allow the examination of apicoplast protein synthesis, targeting, and processing in the presence or absence of the organelle. T. gondii tachyzoites were maintained by serial passage in human foreskin fibroblast cell monolayers cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator as described previously (23Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Several nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins have been shown to contain a bipartite leader sequence consisting of a secretory signal sequence thought to mediate translocation across one membrane (into the endoplasmic reticulum) followed by a plastid transit domain thought to mediate translocation across the remaining three membranes surrounding the apicoplast (11Roos D.S.

Two previously validated apicoplast targeting signals from nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins were employed in this study; these signals were derived from the N-terminal domains of the acyl carrier protein (ACP)1(14Waller R.F.

Plasmid FNRL-RFP (kindly provided by Dr. Boris Striepen) contains 150 amino acids from the N terminus of ferrodoxin NADP-reductase (FNRL) fused to a red fluorescent protein marker (DsRed,CLONTECH). Plasmid ACPL-CAT (kindly provided by Dr. Robert G. K. Donald) is a fusion between the ACP leader sequence (ACPL) (14Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). 50 µg of plasmid DNA (Qiagen Maxi-preps) was transfected into 107 freshly lysed-out tachyzoites by electroporation as described previously (23Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In transient assays, protein expression was typically assayed at 24 h post-transfection. Stable transformants were selected in the presence of 20 µm chloramphenicol. GFP, RFP, and fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope equipped with a 100-watt Hg-vapor lamp and fluorescein and rhodamine filter sets. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM510). For immunofluorescence assays, parasites were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The expression of CAT was detected using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (1:1000) (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:160; Sigma). Several protocols were evaluated for apicoplast purification. The Stansted cell disrupter (25Kelemen M.V. Sharpe J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 431-441PubMed Google Scholar) was found to be the most effective, as discussed under “Results” (cf. Fig. 2). ACPL-CAT parasites were harvested from five heavily infected 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks (∼2 × 109 tachyzoites) by filtering through 3-µm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore) and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min. Parasites were washed twice with homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6), resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 µg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin and 0.5 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and DNase I (1 µg/ml), mechanically disrupted in the Stansted biological cell disrupter at ∼2000 p.s.i., and centrifuged at 1500 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove unbroken parasites. The supernatant containing various organelles, vesicles, and other subcellular structures was centrifuged at 30,000 × gat 4 °C for 30 min onto a 2.2 m sucrose cushion (buffered with 5 mm triethanolamine-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). The interface (a crude apicoplast fraction) was collected, mixed with 2.2 m sucrose to 0.6 ml, and loaded at the bottom of a sucrose step gradient (0.3 ml each of 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.35, 1.3, 1.25, 1.2, and 1.0 m sucrose buffered with 5 mm triethanolamine-HCl and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.6). Ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Beckman L8 55 Ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 112,000 × g using an SW55 rotor, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Sucrose gradient fractions were assayed as follows. The total amount of protein in each fraction was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). As high sucrose concentrations may interfere with colorimetry, fractions were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop Ultracentrifuge to remove the sucrose before the assay. Protein gel electrophoresis was performed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using standard protocol (26Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18:64-66Google Scholar), and antigens were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.), densitometry was performed using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). CAT assays were performed using 14[C]chloramphenicol and thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G-coated plates (Fisher) essentially as described previously (23Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Quantification was carried out using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with the ImageQuant software. Specific activity in each fraction was calculated as the amount of ACPL-CAT, ROP7, or CAT activity (arbitrary units) divided by the total protein in each fraction. Enrichment ratios were defined as the specific activity in each fraction divided by the specific activity of the whole parasite control. For extraction in sodium carbonate (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), freshly prepared membranes were incubated with 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 11.5) on ice for 45 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to pellet membranes and insoluble structures. For extraction in Triton X-114 (28Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a freshly prepared 10% (v/v) stock solution of Triton X-114 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to membranes to a final concentration of 2%. Extraction was carried out on ice for 16 h followed by centrifugation at 15,000 g × 4 °C for 10 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge or at 100,000g × 4 °C for 1 h in a Beckman L8 55 Ultracentrifuge to remove Triton-insoluble material. To examine phase separation, the supernatant was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the resulting extracts were washed several times by repeating the above procedure. Proteins in the detergent phase were precipitated for 1 h in acetone at −20 °C and solubilized in SDS loading buffer for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in parallel with the aqueous phase samples. FACS was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage SE dual laser flow cytometer equipped with Coherent Innova 305 argon and Coherent Spectrum argon-krypton water-cooled lasers. GFP was excited using the primary argon laser tuned to 488 nm at 200 milliwatts, and GFP fluorescence was detected using a standard 560SP dichroic mirror along with a 530DF30 band-pass filter in FL1. RFP was excited using the secondary argon-krypton laser tuned to 568 nm at 150 milliwatts, and RFP fluorescence was detected using a 710DRLP dichroic mirror along with a 610DF30 band-pass filter in FL5. All filters were purchased from Omega Optical. Light scatter and fluorescence were collected using logarithmic amplification with forward scatter light as the threshold parameter. T. gondii tachyzoites were harvested as above and resuspended in culture medium to 5 × 106parasites/ml. Extracellular parasites were sorted using standard high speed conditions on the FACS Vantage (70-µm nozzle tip, 45-p.s.i. sheath pressure). This resulted in a drop drive frequency of 71,000 drops/s, a drive level of 6.5 volts, and a drop breakoff of 33.4 drops. At these settings, parasites flow through the cell sorter at a rate of 12,000/s with abort rates typically less than 10%. Pulse Processing Plus was used to generate a forward scatter (pulse width) parameter for aggregate detection. Parasites were sorted into standard 12 × 75-mm polystyrene collection tubes containing 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). We have previously shown that N-terminal fusion of the bipartite targeting sequences from various nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins permits the targeting of GFP into the apicoplast in stable T. gondiitransgenics (14Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and that this marker can be exploited to follow organellar replication in living parasites (see Ref. 30Striepen B. Crawford M.J. Shaw M.K. Tilney L.G. Seeber F. Roos D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar and Fig.1 A). To facilitate two-color fluorescence studies, a red fluorescent protein reporter was also targeted into the apicoplast, as shown in Fig. 1 B. To provide an enzymatic marker for subcellular fractionation, the CAT enzyme was targeted to the apicoplast as well (Fig. 1 C). All of these fusion proteins target specifically to the apicoplast, which is visible as a small dot in the apical juxtanuclear region of each tachyzoite (4Köhler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The four tachyzoites shown in each panel are the progeny of a single clonal parasite infection; T. gondiitachyzoites replicate synchronously within the intracellular parasitophorous vacuole until host cell lysis (producing 2, 4, 8, 16, … daughters/vacuole). Transgenic parasites stably expressing ACPL-CAT were disrupted by various methods (Dounce homogenizer, French press, Stansted cell disrupter, or homogenization with silicon carbide in a mortar and pestle). Cell fractionation was then carried out through a series of differential and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation steps as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were assayed for protein concentration, CAT activity, and the abundance of particular proteins by Western blotting with specific antibodies. The Stansted cell disrupter yielded the cleanest results for several subcellular organelles including the apicoplast. Results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig.2. Although we consistently observed a high enrichment ratio for rhoptries at ∼1.4/1.5 m sucrose (∼38-fold in this experiment; see panels B andD) and micronemes (data not shown), the apicoplast was widely distributed across the gradient with no fraction exhibiting >6-fold enrichment (maximum at the 1.25/1.3 m sucrose interface; see panels A and C). Similar distribution of the apicoplast and rhoptries has been observed in many different experiments using sucrose or Percoll gradients. Electron microscopic analysis (not shown) suggests that the distinctive four-membrane architecture that characterizes the apicoplast (4Köhler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 9McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) is very fragile, making the isolation of intact organelles with a uniform density very difficult. Frustrated by the apparent heterogeneity in apicoplast density, we attempted to develop an alternative strategy based on affinity purification. Such approaches have been successfully applied to chloroplast purification in plant systems (31Kausch A.P. Owen Jr., T.P. Narayanswami S. Bruce B.D. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As no apicoplast surface antigen has been identified to date (and the outer membrane of the apicoplast may be virtually indistinguishable from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus (11Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G.K. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Loffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), we engineered a series of constructs in which proteins containing a bipartite apicoplast-targeting signal were fused to a transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic epitope tag (33Sulli C. Fang Z. Muchhal U. Schwartzbach S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 457-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, none of these constructs exhibited efficient targeting to the apicoplast (data not shown). Interestingly, one construct engineered in the course of these studies (ACP-GFP-mROP1) was found to target specifically to the apicoplast, alter its morphology, and block organelle segregation during parasite mitosis (8He C.Y. Shaw M.K. Pletcher C.H. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of the ACP-GFP-mROP1 (a fusion of the ACP targeting signal to GFP and a fragment of the rhoptry protein ROP1 (34Soldati D. Lassen A. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)), stable transgenic parasites expressing FNRL-RFP within the apicoplast were transiently transfected with ACP-GFP-mROP1, as shown in Fig. 3. In untransfected parasites, each tachyzoite in every parasitophorous vacuole exhibits a red apicoplast attributable to the FNRL-RFP reporter (Fig. 1 B). Parasites expressing the ACP-GFP-mROP1 fusion, however, produce only one apicoplast per vacuole (Fig. 3 A, compare with Fig. 1). This single apicoplast contains both GFP and RFP, whereas other parasites within the same vacuole exhibit only weak, punctate GFP fluorescence in the apical region and very little RFP fluorescence (despite the continued expression of FNRL-RFP from the stably integrated transgene; see below). Confocal microscopy demonstrates that the ACP-GFP-mROP1 labels only the periphery of the apicoplast, whereas FNRL-RFP labels the organellar lumen (Fig. 3 B). RFP and GFP labeling are mutually exclusive in these parasites, as shown by the quantitative fluorescence profile, suggesting the localization of these markers to different compartments within the same organelle. This observation is consistent with previous immunoelectron microscopy showing ACP-GFP-mROP1 staining near the periphery of the apicoplast (8He C.Y. Shaw M.K. Pletcher C.H. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins and proteins that are tightly associated with membranes (including glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins such as the major T. gondii surface antigen P30) remain associated with membrane fractions after extraction with either carbonate or Triton X-114 (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 28Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the ACP-GFP-mROP1 fusion protein is associated with the complex four-membrane structure surrounding the apicoplast, we extracted crude apicoplast fractions with either Na2CO3 or Triton X-114, as shown in Fig. 4. Both the processed (∼41 kDa) and unprocessed (∼46 kDa) forms of ACP-GFP are properly targeted to the apicoplast (22Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The mature (processed) form was efficiently extracted by carbonate, consistent with the interpretation that this is a soluble protein (left panel,lane 3). The unprocessed form was only partially extracted, perhaps reflecting the association with apicoplast membranes during the processing event (35Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas the ACP-GFP-mROP1 protein was partially processed, neither the mature nor the processed forms was extracted by carbonate treatment (left panel, topof lane 4). After solubilization in Triton X-114, both the processed and unprocessed forms of ACP-GFP and ACP-GFP-mROP1 partitioned into the aqueous phase (right panel, lane 6), consistent with the lack of any stable membrane association. Protease protection assays were employed to further probe the subcellula"
https://openalex.org/W2149284388,"Biological signaling generally involves the activation of a receptor protein by an external stimulus followed by protein-protein interactions between the activated receptor and its downstream signal transducer. The current paradigm for the relay of signals along a signal transduction chain is that it occurs by highly specific interactions between fully folded proteins. However, recent results indicate that many regulatory proteins are intrinsically unstructured, providing a serious challenge to this paradigm and to the nature of structure-function relationships in signaling. Here we study the structural changes that occur upon activation of the blue light receptor photoactive yellow protein (PYP). Activation greatly reduces the tertiary structure of PYP but leaves the level secondary structure largely unperturbed. In addition, activated PYP exposes previously buried hydrophobic patches and allows significant solvent penetration into the core of the protein. These traits are the distinguishing hallmarks of molten globule states, which have been intensively studied for their role in protein folding. Our results show that receptor activation by light converts PYP to a molten globule and indicate stimulus-induced unfolding to a partially unstructured molten globule as a novel theme in signaling.

Previous results have indicated a link between formation of the signaling state and protein unfolding in PYP. This partial unfolding was detected by: (i) the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the photocycle kinetics (15Van Brederode M.E. Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Groot M.L. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); and (iv) the exchange broadening of NMR HSQC signals, particularly in the N-terminal 28 residues of PYP (18Craven C.J. Derix N.M. Hendriks J. Boelens R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14392-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we examine the hypothesis that the PYP signaling state is a molten globule state. To this end, we determine to what extent the PYP signaling state possesses the following set of specific properties widely used as the operational definition of a molten globule state (19Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar, 20Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 21France R.M. Grossman S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar): (i) a large decrease in tertiary structure but only slight reduction in secondary structure as probed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy; (ii) exposure of hydrophobic patches as revealed by 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence; and (iii) penetration of water into the core of the protein as shown by quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of aromatic amino acids. Pure PYP was obtained as described previously (4Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) from the PYP overproduction strain Escherichia coli M15/pHisp using Ni2+-affinity and size exclusion chromatography. CD spectra and time-resolved CD traces at selected wavelengths were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The CD spectrum of the activated state of PYP was obtained by time-resolved CD spectroscopy during the spontaneous decay of the signaling state of PYP to its initial state after 20 s actinic illumination with blue light (400–500 nm) at pH 4.0. The data were collected at various wavelengths upon the closure of an optical shutter. A second optical shutter was used to protect the photomultiplier tube from scattered actinic light. The signals at 446 nm showed that the conditions used resulted in 90% photoaccumulation of the signaling state. This value was used to calculate the CD spectra of the pure signaling state. PYP (2 μm) at pH 4.0 in the presence of 100 μm ANS was exposed to actinic light for 10 s to photoaccumulate the signaling state. Upon switching off the light, changes in ANS fluorescence were probed by fluorescence excitation at 310 nm and detection at 510 nm using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorimeter. The contribution of intrinsic fluorescence from PYP under these conditions was found to be small and could be accurately corrected by using fluorescence data obtained under the same conditions but in the absence of ANS. The recovery of the initial state of PYP from its signaling state was detected by fluorescence excitation at 440 nm and detection at 490 nm. The intensity of fluorescence emission from aromatic side chains upon excitation at 295 nm was detected at 340 nm as a function of acrylamide concentration using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorimeter. Quenching of the fluorescence intensity F as a function of acrylamide concentration [Q] was quantified using the Stern-Volmer constant K with the equation F0/FQ = 1 + K × [Q]. CD spectroscopy provides information about protein secondary structure through the far-UV signals caused by peptide bonds as well as protein tertiary structure by near-UV signals originating from aromatic side chains in the asymmetric chiral environment provided by the folded protein. The CD spectrum of the initial state of PYP exhibits a minimum at 222 nm and a shoulder at 206 nm (Fig.1 A), consistent with its secondary structure (1Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) as determined by x-ray crystallography (13Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The effect of photoactivation of PYP on its CD spectrum was determined by illuminating the protein at pH 4.0, resulting in essentially quantitative conversion of PYP to its signaling state. Because FTIR difference spectroscopy has shown that the structural changes that occur during formation of the signaling state at pH 3.5 and 7.0 are very similar (16Hoff W.D Xie A. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Tang X.-J. Gural J. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), these conditions provide reliable information on structural changes during PYP activation under native conditions. Light-induced conversion of PYP to its activated state results in a 19% reduction of the CD signal at 222 nm (Fig. 1,A and C). The recovery of the CD signal at 222 nm occurs with the same kinetics as the decay of the signaling state of PYP to its initial state as probed by absorbance of thep-coumaric acid chromophore. Changes in tertiary structure upon signaling state formation were probed using the strong near-UV CD signal of PYP at 270 nm. PYP contains five Tyr residues and a single Trp side chain. Of these 6 groups, Tyr-76, Tyr-94, and Tyr-98 are largely exposed to solvent, whereas Tyr-42, Tyr-118, and Trp-119 are fully buried. Therefore the latter three residues are expected to be largely responsible for the CD signal at 275 nm. The side chain of Trp-119 is packed between the central antiparallel β-sheet in PYP and its N-terminal two α-helices. The side chain of Tyr-118 is surrounded by the opposite face of the central β-sheet in PYP and α-helix 5. Finally, the side chain of Tyr-42 is part of the active site of PYP, hydrogen bonded to the p-coumaric acid chromophore, and more than 8 Å removed from both Tyr-118 and Trp-119. Thus, these three buried aromatic side chains probe the tertiary structure in three distinct regions of PYP. Upon light activation, the CD signal at 270 nm is reduced by 66% and becomes featureless, indicating a strong reduction in the tertiary structure in PYP in the signaling state (Fig. 1, B andD). The recovery of tertiary structure after photoexcitation occurs with the kinetics of the photocycle transition from the signaling state to the initial state of PYP. A loss of tertiary structure around the side chain of Trp-119 is in line with recent NMR data, which indicate a reduction in structure in the two N-terminal α-helices upon signaling state formation (18Craven C.J. Derix N.M. Hendriks J. Boelens R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14392-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The peak position of the near-UV CD signal at 270 nm demonstrates that moreover the environment of Tyr side chains becomes disordered upon photoactivation of PYP. Our results show that the signaling state of PYP maintains most of its secondary structure, whereas its tertiary structure is greatly diminished, providing strong support (19Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar, 20Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) for the proposal that the signaling state of PYP is a molten globule. The exposure of hydrophobic patches upon formation of the signaling state of PYP was investigated using the fluorescent probe ANS. This compound binds specifically to clusters of hydrophobic groups, which are highly indicative of molten globule states (19Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar, 20Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The binding of ANS to such clusters results in an increase in its fluorescence quantum yield. For all protein investigated in this respect, conversion to the molten globule state, but not the fully unfolded state, results in an increase in ANS fluorescence (18Craven C.J. Derix N.M. Hendriks J. Boelens R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14392-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). In the case of PYP the formation of the signaling state leads to a significant (12%) increase in ANS fluorescence (Fig. 2). Recovery of the initial level of ANS fluorescence occurs with kinetics identical to that of the PYP photocycle transition from the signaling state back to the initial state of PYP. Thus, the ANS binding properties of the PYP signaling state are those expected for a molten globule state. A third characteristic of molten globule states is a significant increase in hydrodynamic radius as a result of penetration of water into the folded core of the protein. To directly investigate such solvent penetration upon formation of the signaling state of PYP, the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence from aromatic side chains by acrylamide was investigated. The level of fluorescence quenching in the initial state of PYP was found to be small (Fig.3). Conversion of PYP to its signaling state resulted in a large increase (2-fold) in fluorescence quenching, demonstrating increased interaction of the buried aromatic side chains with the solvent. Conversion of PYP to its fully denatured state by the addition of GdmCl results in maximal exposure of aromatic amino acids and increases the effectiveness of fluorescence quenching by acrylamide 6-fold. Comparison of the fluorescence quenching in the initial state and native state of PYP with that in fully unfolded state indicates a 20% increase in solvent penetration upon signaling state formation. Because the signaling state of PYP exhibits all three properties specific to the molten globule states of a large number of proteins, we conclude that activation of PYP by light converts this receptor protein into a molten globule. This provides the first example of stimulus-induced partial unfolding of a receptor protein to a molten globule state. Thus, the molten globule state is not only important for understanding protein folding but also is of direct relevance to the field of signal transduction. The following considerations (4Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) explain how light activation converts PYP to a molten globule state. Absorbance of a photon by PYP results in the trans tocis isomerization of the ionized p-coumaric acid chromophore in PYP (3Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J.

Science. 1998; 279: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This event triggers an intramolecular proton transfer step from the protonated side chain of active site residue Glu-46 to the PYP chromophore (4Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Both Glu-46 and the chromophore in PYP are buried residues with anomalously shifted pK values. Changes in the protonation state of such residues at pH extremes contribute significantly to the acid and base denaturation of proteins in general (23Honig B. Yang A.-S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 46: 27-58Google Scholar). In many cases, the acid-denatured state of a protein is in fact a molten globule (24Fink A.L. Calciano L.J. Goto Y. Kurotsu T. Palleros D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12504-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Because light absorbance also causes a change in the protonation state of Glu-46 and the chromophore, this is predicated to trigger structural changes analogous to acid/base-induced denaturation and therefore can result in the formation of a molten globule. The stimulus-induced transient unfolding process in PYP can provide this receptor protein with the conformational plasticity needed for signaling state formation. Because PYP serves as a prototype for the PAS domain family (9Pellequer J.-L. Wagner-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), it is expected that transient partial protein unfolding is also involved in other proteins containing this ubiquitous signaling module. The same mechanism may also function in unrelated signaling systems. In view of the significant fraction of regulatory proteins inferred to be unstructured (25Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar), the mechanism of transient partial protein unfolding from a fully folded state to a molten globule state reported here may well be widely used in signal transduction. In this proposal the folding status of a regulatory protein depends on its signaling status. Changes in the input into the signal transduction chain affect the folding state of the protein and can thus result in signal relay. We thank Dr. Philippe Cluzel for many stimulating discussions."

Family D DNA polymerase (PolD)1 is a new family recently found in the Euryarchaeota subdomain of Archaea, the third domain of life (4Imamura M. Uemori T. Kato I. Ishino Y. Biol. Pharm.

A. 1998; 95: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). So far at least eight PolDs have been reported, and their sequences have been deposited in the genetic data bases. PolDs are composed of two subunits: a small subunit (DP1), which shows low but significant homology to eukaryotes DNA polymerase δ (7Cann I.K. Komori K. Toh H. Kanai S. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and a large subunit (DP2), which is believed to be the catalytic subunit because of its weak polymerization activity (5Uemori T. Sato Y. Kato I. Doi H. Ishino Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The interaction between the two subunits is essential for full enzyme activities. Strong polymerization and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities are obtainable only when the two subunits were mixed or co-expressed together (5Uemori T. Sato Y. Kato I. Doi H. Ishino Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the large subunit have no homology to other DNA polymerases and do not contain common motifs of other DNA polymerase families despite the fact that members of PolD from the Euryarchaeota species are highly conserved. PolD has been mainly characterized inP. furiosus; nevertheless, many aspects of the enzyme properties, such as the catalytic residues for both polymerization and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities, are still unknown. It is of particular interest that the genes coding the two subunits of PolD in Pyrococcus (P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, P. abyssi, and P. woesei) exist in an operon containing three or four other ORFs that are important in DNA replication, DNA repair, and recombination (6Ishino Y. Komori K. Cann I.K. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2232-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Myllykallio H. Lopez P. Lopez-Garcia P. Heilig R. Saurin W. Zivanovic Y. Philippe H. Forterre P. Science. 2000; 288: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). One upstream ORF (PH0124 in P. horikoshii) is a homologue to Orc1 (subunit 1 of the origin recognition complex) of yeast, and a downstream ORF (PH0119) is a homologue to yeast RadB, a protein involved in recombination. Moreover, this operon is located adjacent to a recently identified replication origin in the Pyrococcus genomes (8Myllykallio H. Lopez P. Lopez-Garcia P. Heilig R. Saurin W. Zivanovic Y. Philippe H. Forterre P. Science. 2000; 288: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The genes of replication factor C (ORF PH0112 and PH0113 in P. horikoshii) and putative DNA helicase (PH0109) are located only 6–10 kilobase pairs away from the genes of PolD. This clustering of genetically essential genes conserved inPyrococcus indicates that PolD is likely the main replicase in DNA replication in Euryarchaeota. Because the enzymes involved in DNA replication in Archaea are similar to the replicative enzymes in eukaryotes (9Edgell D.R. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), further characterization of the proteins related to DNA replication, including PolD, will help reveal the DNA replication mechanism in Archaea, as well as that in eukaryotes, which has become complicated during evolution and is difficult to study. Fortunately, the thermostability of the replication proteins and clustering of the replication genes facilitate their analysis. In the present study, we successfully cloned, expressed, and purified the PolD from P. horikoshii (PolDPho). By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues Asp-1122 and Asp-1124 as the essential residues responsible for DNA polymerizing activity. Using gel filtration analysis, we determined the molecular mass of the recombinant PolD fromP. horikoshii and proposed that PolD from P. horikoshii probably forms a heterotetrameric structure in solution.

The DP2Pho gene with the intein was split into two parts using PCR (Table I; Fig. 1). The upper part of the DP2Pho gene (DP2U, from 1 to 2347 base pairs) was amplified with primers L1 and L2. The lower part of the DP2Pho gene (DP2L, from 2348 to 4305 base pairs) was amplified using primers L3 and L4. After digestion with the restriction enzymes, DP2U and DP2L were inserted into the pGEMEX-1 vector sequentially to generate a vector pGEMEX-L(+).

To include the ribosomal binding site using PCR, a primer (pGEM-rbs) containing aSacII site was designed according to the sequences of pGEMEX-1 (Table I; Fig. 1). The DP2Pho gene fragments together with a sequence from pGEMEX-1 were then subcloned sequentially into pET15b-SM. The final co-expression vector was named pET15b/SL (Fig. 1). The sequences of the genes were verified using the LIC-4200L(S)-2 DNA system (Li-Cor, Tokyo, Japan). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the overlap PCR method (11Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the common primers L3 and L4 (Fig. 1; Table I) and two site-specific complementary primers for each mutant. After site-directed mutation with PCR and digestion with SalI and NsiI, the mutant fragments were inserted back into pET15b/SL. DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no spurious mutations had been introduced during PCR. The constructed co-expression vectors pET15b/SL and various mutant plasmids were transformed into host E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. The transformed cells were grown in 2× yeast tryptone medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C. WhenA 600 reached 0.6–1.0, 2 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to induce expression of the genes. After being cultured overnight at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing the protease inhibitor, and disrupted on ice by sonication. The disrupted cells were heated at 85 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris and denatured proteins. Expression of both DP1Pho and DP2Pho in the supernatant was checked by SDS-PAGE performed on a 10–15% gradient gel using the Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5). The dialysate was loaded onto a Hitrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer B using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1000 mm. Fractions at around 450 mm NaCl, which contained the PolDPho complex, were dialyzed against buffer A to remove the salt. Proteins from pET15b/SL and mutant plasmids were further purified by loading them onto a nickel column (Novagen). After washing with a buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, the enzymes were eluted with the elution buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. The protein content was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. The native molecular mass was estimated using fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Hiload Superdex 200-pg (26/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and 200 mm NaCl. The fraction size was 5.0 ml, and the flow rate was 2.0 ml/min. The standards used were 669-kDa thyroglobulin, 440-kDa ferritin, 232-kDa catalase, 158-kDa aldolase, and 67-kDa bovine serum albumin. The presence of dNTP in the reaction mixture is essential to synthesize DNA products by PolD. In the absence of dNTP, the substrate DNA is digested by the exonuclease activity. When the dNTP is omitted from the reaction mixture, only exonuclease activity is measurable. The DNA polymerizing activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. The standard reaction mixture (in 50 µl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8, 25 °C), 10 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 µg/ml heat-denatured salmon testes DNA, 0.25 mm dNTP mixture, 0.5 µCi (9.25 kBq) of [α-32P]dATP, and crude or purified enzymes. The reaction was performed at 70 °C for 30 min, and then the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. At least two repeats were performed independently for each sample. The primer extension ability was assayed using a 100-mer oligonucleotide whose sequences were taken from M13mp19 single-stranded DNA (5′-TCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGCACTGGCCGTCCTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACCCAACTTAATCGCCTT-3′, from positions 6254 to 6353) annealed with a 5′ end-labeled 34-mer oligomer (5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′, complementary to positions 6337–6304 of M13mp18) as a substrate. The 34-mer was radiolabeled at the 5′ terminus with the bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [α-32P]ATP. To make the substrate, 10 pmol of radiolabeled primer was mixed with 20 pmol of the 100-mer oligonucleotide in 20 µl of buffer (7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 7 mm MgCl2). The tube was boiled for 5 min and then cooled gradually to room temperature. The reaction mixture for polymerization (10 µl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8, 25 °C), 10 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm dNTP, 0.5 pmol of labeled substrate, and 100 ng of enzymes. The reaction was performed at 70 °C for 2 min. After the reaction, 10 µl of stop buffer containing 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue was added to the mixture, and the tube was heated in boiling water for 5 min. The samples were loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel (35 × 42.5 cm) containing 7 m urea and 1× TBE (89 mmTris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 2500 V. Reaction products were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture and procedures used to assay the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of the wild type and mutants were the same as for the primer extension assay, except that the dNTP was not added and 500 ng of heat-treated supernatant or 400 ng of purified enzymes was used. The reaction was performed at 70 °C for 10 min or as indicated. To measure the reaction speed of exonuclease activity, 100 ng of enzyme was used, and the reaction was performed for 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 min. The gel was electrophoresed for 3 h to get better separation of the products. After electrophoresis, the products were visualized and quantified using the PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The exonuclease activity was calculated according to the reduction of substrates, which was quantified by the ratio of signal strength of products to the total signal strength of each sample. The CD of the wild type and mutant proteins was measured with a CD spectrometer (model 62A DS, Aviv Instrument, Lakewood, NJ) utilizing a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell in the far UV region. The measurement was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 50–100 µg/ml enzyme. The fidelity of PolD was measured according to the method of Kunkel (12Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. To make the gapped DNA, M13mp18 double-stranded DNA was digested with PvuI and PvuII, purified from a 2% agarose gel using the QIAquick mini-column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and eluted in TE buffer (10 mm Tris buffer containing 1 mm EDTA). The digested M13mp18 DNA (1.0 µg in 10 µl) was added into 70 µl of sterile distilled water and denatured for 10 min at 70 °C. Then M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (2 µg in 10 µl) was added, and the tube was mixed and cooled down in an ice bath. After 10 min, 10 µl of 20× SSC buffer was added, and the mixture was heated at 60 °C for 10 min. The gapped DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The gap was filled by PolDPho with polymerization for 30 min at 70 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 mm EDTA, and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in TE. The filling of the gap was confirmed by electrophoresis using agarose gel. E. colistrain XL2 Blue (MRF′) was transformed with the polymerized DNA, and strain MV1184 was used as lawn cells for transinfection. White plaques were counted, and the fidelity was calculated as a percentage of the number of white plaques against the total plaques formed. According to the genomic sequences of P. horikoshii OT3 (13Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Miyajma N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the two ORFs PH0123 and PH0121 code for the small subunit DP1Pho (622 amino acids, 70 kDa) and large subunit DP2Pho (1434 amino acids, 163 kDa) of PolD, respectively. As inP. furiosus and P. abyssi, the two genes are arranged in tandem (with DP1Pho in the front) and are adjacent to ORFs that are important for DNA replication, recombination, and repair (6Ishino Y. Komori K. Cann I.K. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2232-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Myllykallio H. Lopez P. Lopez-Garcia P. Heilig R. Saurin W. Zivanovic Y. Philippe H. Forterre P. Science. 2000; 288: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Alignment and sequence analysis of DP2Pho with other PolD large subunits from the Archaea species revealed that DP2Pho contains a 166-amino acid mini-intein (internal protein fragment) from Cys-955 to Gln-1120 (Fig. 2; Ref. 14Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The large subunit without the intein is 1268 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 144 kDa. The DP1Pho and DP2Pho genes were first cloned into pET15b and pGEMEX-1 separately (Fig. 1). The expression of DP1Pho with the pET15b-S vector in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL and its purification from soluble fractions were successful. The expression of DP2Pho using pGEMEX-L(−) and pGEMEX-L(+) was also successful; however, the majority of the protein was in insoluble fractions. Purification of DP2Pho from soluble fractions proved difficult because of its insolubility and the degradation of the protein during purification. To obtain a stable recombinant protein and active complex, we constructed the co-expression vector pET15b/SL. In this vector, the DP1Pho and DP2Pho genes were connected in tandem into two ORFs. The two genes are transcribed under the control of a single transcription promoter and terminator (T7 promoter and T7 terminator). After transformation and induction using the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL, stable proteins were expressed as assayed by SDS-PAGE and were purified to near homogeneity with an anion exchange column and nickel column. Several milligrams of purified protein could be produced from a liter of culture. Fig.3 shows the SDS-PAGE and Western blotting profile of His-tagged PolDPho. The band position of DP2Pho is as predicted at around 140 kDa, whereas DP1Pho migrated at around 90 kDa rather than the predicted 70 kDa. The band intensity of DP2Pho was about two times that of DP1Pho, as measured by density scanning of the protein bands on the SDS gel (data not shown), indicating a 1:1 molar ratio between the two subunits. Our success in purification of PolDPho with a histidine tag (His tag) at the N terminus of DP1Pho confirmed that DP1Pho and DP2Pho form a tight complex. Using a nickel column, the complex was bound to the resin through the His tag of DP1Pho, and DP2Pho was pulled down by a strong interaction between both subunits. This may also indicate that the N terminus of DP1Pho is located at the surface of the protein complex. To compare the effects of the intein and His tag on expression and activity, vectors containing the intein and vectors without the His tag were also constructed (named pET15b/SL(+), pET11a/SL(−), and pET11a/SL(+)) using a similar approach to that described above. Preliminary results showed that when using any of the three co-expression vectors, both DP1Pho and DP2Pho were also overexpressed in E. coli. The DNA polymerization activities of the heat-treated proteins were examined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into salmon testes DNA. We found that proteins using the intein-containing vectors, pET15b/SL(+) and pET11a/SL(+), had only 10–20% of the DNA polymerization activity of proteins using vectors without the intein, pET15b/SL and pET11a/SL(−). This indicated that a small proportion of intein was self-spliced from the proteins. We also found that the addition of the His tag at the N terminus of DP1Pho had no effect on the DNA polymerization activities. Therefore pET15b/SL was used as the co-expression vector for further expression and mutagenesis. The optimal pH and magnesium requirement for DNA synthesis were determined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into salmon testes DNA under different conditions or treatments. PolDPho showed the highest activity from pH 8.5 to 9.0, and the optimal magnesium concentration was 17.5 mm. PolDPho is highly thermostable; 50% activity remained after heating at 80 °C for 60 min. The CD profiles of PolDPho at the near UV region measured at 25 and 90 °C showed similar patterns, indicating no conformational alteration at high temperature (data not shown). The molecular mass of PolDPho was assessed by gel filtration (Fig.4). Purified protein (after anion exchange and nickel columns) was loaded onto a Superdex 200-pg (26/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PolDPho was eluted at around 151 ml. By calculation with elution volumes of calibration markers (128 ml of thyroglobulin, 145 ml of ferritin, 171 ml of catalase, 176.3 ml of aldolase, and 193.5 ml of albumin), the molecular mass of PolDPho was determined to be 421 kDa. After gel filtration, each fraction was concentrated 20 times, and the concentrated samples were subjected to DNA polymerization (by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into salmon testes DNA), SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting analysis. The fraction activities varied coordinately with the UV absorption (Fig. 4) and protein band intensity (not shown). According to the ratio of band intensity between DP1Pho and DP2Pho (1:2) on SDS gel and the ratio of their molecular mass (1:2), we proposed that PolDPho has two large and two small subunits in one molecule, with a predicted molecular mass of 430 kDa. The primer extension ability and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities of PolDPho are shown in Fig.5. For the primer extension assay, 100 ng of enzyme was used in one reaction. The products (35–84-mer) were observed after reacting for 2 min (Fig. 5 A). In the 3′–5′ exonuclease assay, more enzyme (400 ng) was used, and the reaction was performed for 30 min. The products were shorter than 34-mer (Fig.5 B). The fidelity of DNA polymerization by PolDPho was assayed using the Kunkel method. Among a total of 122,202 plaques counted, 109 (0.89%) were white. The fidelity of Taq DNA polymerase, which lacks 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, was assayed simultaneously as a control. The fidelity ofTaq DNA polymerase was 1.65% (209/12,681) in our measurement, which was 1.9 times lower than PolDPho. Amino acid residues in the region from Glu-800 to Glu-1195 of DP2Pho were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. This region is clustered with negatively charged residues conserved in DP2 (Fig. 2). In addition, it contains the most conserved and unknown motif, which is disrupted by the mini-intein in P. horikoshii (from Cys-955 to Gln-1120 of DP2Pho), P. abyssi, and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (Fig. 2). Two common DNA polymerase motifs were proposed in this region through visual inspection (Ref. 7Cann I.K. Komori K. Toh H. Kanai S. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar; motif A, Lys-817–Phe-833, and motif C, Lys-884–Phe-897). The conserved aspartic acid (Asp-818, Asp-824, Asp-827, Asp-853, Asp-872, Asp-891, Asp-892, Asp-911, Asp-1122, Asp-1124, Asp-1126, Asp-1133, Asp-1152, Asp-1162, Asp-1167, and Asp-1174), and glutamic acid (Glu-800, Glu-803, Glu-843, Glu-847, Glu-867, Glu-910, Glu-1125, Glu-1165, Glu-1169, Glu-1182, Glu-1185, and Glu-1195) residues in this region were changed to alanine (TableII). Mutant proteins were expressed and partially purified by heating, and the polymerization activities were examined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into salmon testes DNA. The 3′–5′ exonuclease activity for each mutant was also assayed roughly by gel electrophoresis. Among all the 28 mutants, only D1122A and D1124A showed loss of polymerization activity, whereas the other mutants did not show a dramatic change in DNA synthesis in the preliminary screening (Table II). Mutant proteins of D112A and D1124A were further purified by passing through anion exchange and nickel columns (see “Materials and Methods”), and the DNA polymerization activities were measured and compared with a wild type protein. When the purified proteins were used, D1122A and D1124A showed only 0.51 and 0.82% activities of the wild type enzyme, respectively.Table IIThe polymerization and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities of the mutants included in this studyEnzyme2-aThe underline indicates that purified proteins were used for the assay; the other samples used a heat-treated supernatant.Polymerization activity2-bReactions were performed using 0.5 µg of supernatant or 0.2 µg of purified proteins by the acid precipitate method.3′–5′ exonuclease activity2-cReactions were performed using 0.5 µg of supernatant or 0.4 µg of purified proteins.Wild type+++2-d+, ++, and +++, indicate 1–20%, 21–60%, and 61–100% of wild type enzyme activity, respectively.+++E800A/E803A+++++D818A++++++D824A++++++D827A++++++E843A/E847A++++++D853A+++++E867A++++++D872A++++++D891A++++++D892A++++++E910A/D911A++++++D1122A—2-e—, indicates undetectable or very low activity (<1% of the wild type enzyme).++D1122E+ND2-fND, not determined.D1122Q—NDD1122R—NDG1123A+NDG1123R—NDD1124A—+D1124N+NDD1124E++NDD1124Q—NDD1124R—NDE1125A++++D1126A++++D1133A++++++D1152A+++++D1162A+++++E1165A++++++D1167A+++++E1169A++++++D1174A++++++E1182A/E1185++++++E1195A++++++2-a The underline indicates that purified proteins were used for the assay; the other samples used a heat-treated supernatant.2-b Reactions were performed using 0.5 µg of supernatant or 0.2 µg of purified proteins by the acid precipitate method.2-c Reactions were performed using 0.5 µg of supernatant or 0.4 µg of purified proteins.2-d +, ++, and +++, indicate 1–20%, 21–60%, and 61–100% of wild type enzyme activity, respectively.2-e —, indicates undetectable or very low activity (<1% of the wild type enzyme).2-f ND, not determined.

Among these, the eosinophil major basic protein (EMBP)1is noteworthy because it forms the crystalline core of the granule (and on a molar basis is the most abundant eosinophil granule protein).

The pro-molecule can be identified in eosinophil granules, and current evidence suggests that it is processed here into EMBP, which then condenses to form the eosinophil granule core (15Popken-Harris P. Checkel J. Loegering D. Madden B. Springett M. Kephart G. Gleich G.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 623-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a molecule strikingly similar to EMBP, namely the EMBP homologue (EMBPH), has been isolated from human eosinophil granule lysates (16Plager D.A. Loegering D.A. Weiler D.A. Checkel J.L.

EMBP is a 14 kDa (117 amino acid residues) intensely basic protein whose complement of basic residues consists entirely of arginines, giving rise to a calculated pI of 11.4 and a net charge of 15.0 at pH 7 (17Barker R.L.

However, pro-EMBP is almost neutral with a calculated pI of 6.2, because of the presence of a large number of acidic residues in the 90 residue long pro-portion (pI = 3.9). It has been suggested that the pro-portion of EMBP serves predominantly to protect cells from the extreme basicity of EMBP during transport from the Golgi to the eosinophil granule (19Barker R.L. Gundel R.H. Gleich G.J. Checkel J.L. Loegering D.A. Pease L.R. Hamann K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also implicates pro-EMBP as an inhibitor of human pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (20Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). EMBP is a monomer under physiological conditions that readily polymerizes in solution forming insoluble aggregates because of the presence of five free thiol groups (in addition to the four cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation) in the protein (21Oxvig C. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be non-glycosylated, contrasting with the pro-portion, which is heavily glycosylated with N-glycans,O-glycans, and glycosaminoglycans, raising the molecular weight to between 30–50 kDa (22Oxvig C. Haaning J. Hojrup P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 329-336PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of EMBP action is not known, although it has been speculated that the highly basic nature of the protein contributes to its toxicity. EMBP does not exhibit high sequence similarity to any known proteins, but has weak sequence identity (23–28%) with C-type lectin (C-TL) domains of mannose-binding protein (MBP), human lithostathine (LIT), and the low affinity IgE receptor FcεRII (23Patthy L. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of EMBP at 1.8 Å resolution, one of the most basic structures to be determined by x-ray crystallography to date. This protein is structurally related to members of the C-TL family, but its molecular architecture exhibits significant differences from those of known C-TLs, lacking the potential to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner. Our structural analysis shows that the potential carbohydrate ligands recognized by EMBP are likely to be different from those in other C-TLs. EMBP was purified from eosinophil granules of patients with marked eosinophilia essentially as described previously (24Gleich G.J. Loegering D.A. Mann K.G. Maldonado J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Abu-Ghazaleh R.I. Dunnette S.L. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Kita H. Thomas L.L. Gleich G.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 52: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the final purification step, the sample was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 0.025 m sodium acetate and 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 4.3, and fractions containing EMBP protein were identified by absorbance at 277 nm. Crystals of EMBP were grown in hanging drops by mixing equal amounts of a protein solution (16 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (100 mm malonic acid, 160 mmK2HPO4, 5 mm of l-DTT buffered with 160 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0) and equilibrating at ∼20 °C. The crystals grew in space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 74.33, b = 57.49, c = 60.96 Å and β = 113.2°, with 2 molecules of EMBP in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to a reservoir solution with 1.75 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm malonic acid, pH 6.0, and 30% glycerol. All materials were from Sigma Chemicals unless noted otherwise. EMBP crystals diffract very weakly even with the brilliance of the synchrotron beam and only about 10% of the crystals showed any discernible diffraction. However, after several trials, a diffraction data set to 1.8 Å were collected on station PX14.1 at the SRS, Daresbury, UK using a ADSC Quantum-4 CCD Detector. EMBP crystals also responded well to macromolecular crystal annealing (26Harp J.M. Timm D.E. Bunick G.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and in a few instances, incubation of cooled crystals for 3 min in cryoprotectant increased the diffraction limit from 2.5 to almost 2.0 Å, correspondingly lowering the mosaicity from 1.3o to about 0.7o. Raw data images were indexed and scaled using the DENZO and SCALEPACK modules of the HKL Suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Methods Enzymol.

Open table in a new tab The structure of EMBP was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method. Initial attempts of structure determination using mannose-binding protein (PDB code: 2MSB) (28Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (23% sequence identity with EMBP) as a search model was not successful. However, analysis of the EMBP sequence by the fold Prediction Algorithm (29Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) predicted human lithostathine, an inhibitor of pancreatic stone formation (PDB code:1LIT) (30Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), to have a tertiary fold similar to that of EMBP. Lithostathine shares 28% sequence identity with EMBP and has similarities with C-TLs in its C-terminal domain. For the purposes of molecular replacement, the lithostathine polyalanine search model was comprised only of those secondary structural elements that were identical between human mannose-binding protein, lithostathine, and the predicted secondary structural elements in EMBP. Rotation and translation function searches gave two solutions, which had a correlation coefficient (CC) of 44.4% and R-factor of 0.48; the next best solution had CC = 35.2% and R-factor = 0.51. Refinement of the EMBP structure was performed in two stages using the program CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), with 4.5% of reflections excluded for calculation of the cross-validated R-factor (R free). In the first, the alanine residues from the search model were mutated to EMBP residues wherever electron density for the same could be observed. In the second, residues that were deleted from the search model (45 residues of 117 total per monomer) were progressively built as alanines into regions of electron density. Once the R freedropped below 0.35 and the model main-chain trace was more than 90% complete, subsequent refinement cycles incorporated unrestrained individual B-factor refinement, and the gradual removal of NCS restraints. Water molecules were incorporated into the structure at this stage if they had peak heights >3ς in Fo-Fc difference electron density maps and were within hydrogen bonding distance of appropriate atoms. Eight molecules of sulfate ion and two molecules of glycerol from the cryoprotectant were also identified in the structure and were included in the final stages of refinement. The final model of EMBP comprises residues 3–117 for molecule A and 2–117 for molecule B has a crystallographic R-factor of 23.4% and free R-factor of 26.4% to a resolution of 1.8 Å (Table I). All the residues of the dimer lie in accepted regions of the Ramachandran (φ-ψ) map, with over 93% residues in the most favorable regions. In addition to the N-terminal residues not visible in the 2Fo-Fc electron density maps, no side-chain electron density could be seen for A3 Arg, A46 Ala, B47 Leu, B49 Gln, and B98 Arg, and these were modeled as alanines in the final structure. Whereas residues B46 to B50 have poor mainchain electron density and are not well defined, residues A47 to A50 have good electron density. There are 17 Arg residues in the EMBP molecule, of which two arginine side chains (A3 and B98) are not visible in the model. In addition to 159 ordered solvent molecules, eight molecules of sulfate from the crystallization medium and two molecules of glycerol from the cryoprotectant were also identified in the EMBP model. The structures of the individual EMBP monomers are virtually identical to one another with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.67 Å over 115 Cα atoms. Most of the variation present between the monomers is due to the poorly ordered loop from residues 46–50, which gives rise to an r.m.s. deviation of >1.5 Å over this region. Excluding this region results in an overall r.m.s. deviation of 0.19 Å over 110 Cα atoms. For the purposes of analysis, molecule A (which is better defined) will be used. The final atomic coordinates for EMBP have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code1H8U). To evaluate the binding of EMBP to heparin-SepharoseCL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), heparin-SepharoseCL-6B was washed with water, treated with 3m NaCl, washed again with water, and equilibrated with PO4 buffer (0.05 m PO4, pH 7.0, 0.10 m NaCl, 0.002 m EDTA, 0.01 mDTT); 0.5 ml of packed volume columns were prepared from this slurry. In control experiments, SepharoseCL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) andd-mannose immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose were washed and equilibrated similarly. All buffer solutions contained 0.002 m EDTA, 0.01 m DTT. EMBP, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) (0.15 mg of each protein) in 2.5 ml of PO4 buffer were applied to heparin-SepharoseCL-6B columns at 1.0 ml/min. The columns were eluted at 1.0 ml/min with 2.5 ml PO4 buffer, 2.5 ml of PO4 buffer-total NaCl 0.5 m, 2.5 ml PO4 buffer, total NaCl 1.0 m, 2.5 ml PO4 buffer-total NaCl 2.0 m and 2.5 ml PO4 buffer-total NaCl 3.0 m. For EMBP, the column was next eluted with 2.5 ml of PO4 buffer-total NaCl 3.0 m + 5 mg/ml heparin. All columns were run at 22 °C, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected; all supplies were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals unless noted otherwise. In a preliminary experiment, 1.0 ml of heparin-SepharoseCL-6B was treated with 1.0 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.01 m DTT, 0.002m EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min; the resulting supernatant showed an absorbance at 280 nm of 0.008. In control experiments with SepharoseCL-6B and d-mannose immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose, 0.15 mg of EMBP in 2.5 ml PO4 buffer was applied and eluted with PO4 buffer. EMBP has overall structural similarity with animal C-TLs. The protein folds into one globular domain that consists of two main α-helices and eight β-strands, the latter forming three antiparallel β-sheets (Fig.1 A). The first β-strand (β1; residues 3–11) forms an antiparallel β-sheet with β2 and β8. The two helices α1 and α2, with two and three turns, respectively, are oriented perpendicular to one another and frame the first antiparallel β-sheet between them. A disulfide bond (Cys20–Cys115) connects α1 to β8 and helps to maintain the local conformation. The second antiparallel β-sheet involves β4 and β5, is separated by a classical type II β-hairpin tight turn involving a glycine residue, and results in the formation of an extended structure away from the rest of the molecule. The third antiparallel sheet is formed from β3, β6, and β7 on the face opposite to the second antiparallel sheet. A second disulfide bridge (Cys92–Cys107) connects β6 to a single 310 helix (α3). In addition to this well defined arrangement of secondary structures, the protein also contains several extended loops (L1–4), with classical glycine-mediated tight turns, exemplified by the long loop connecting strands β5 and β6. The topology of EMBP is similar to that of canonical C-TL domains, which include rat mannose-binding protein (MBP) (32Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A.

It also resembles the C-TL domain like structures from the CD94 subunit of the natural killer cell receptor (CD94/NKG2) (36Boyington J.C. Riaz A.N. Patamawenu A. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the C-TL domain from the human hematopoietic cell receptor CD69 (37Llera A.S. Viedma F. Sanchez-Madrid F. Tormo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7312-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and a member of the rodent Ly-49 gene family (38Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The similarity extends to the overall shape, including positions of the conserved secondary structural elements and two disulfide bonds (Fig. 1, B and C). However, there are striking differences between EMBP and other members of the C-TL family, especially in the orientation of the long loops L1, L3, and L4 (Fig.1 A). EMBP is most similar to lithostathine (LIT) (30Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with which it has an overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.07 Å over 105 Cα atoms. The overall deviation between EMBP and the lectin cores of other C-TL family members is between 1.2 and 1.6 Å over 90–103 Cα atoms, with most variation found in the extended antiparallel β-sheet (β4–β5) and L1, followed by L3 and L4 (Fig. 1 B). It comes as no surprise that the regions with highest variation are also those that have been implicated in Ca2+-mediated carbohydrate recognition in other C-TLs. Calcium binding is a prerequisite for carbohydrate recognition in most of the classical C-TLs (39Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 40Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 41Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 42Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There are at least two structurally well defined calcium binding sites reported in C-TLs (43Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each of which is conserved both at the sequence and at the structural level (Fig. 1 D). Site I in the archetype, MBP, is made from residues from L1 and L4 and involves Asp161, Glu165, Asp188, Glu193, and Asp194 and coordinates a calcium ion in the groove formed between these loops. Site 2 of MBP is formed on the opposite face of the molecule, involves residues from L3 and L4 (residues Asn187, Glu185, Glu193, Asn205, and Asp206). These residues are almost invariant among all the Ca2+-binding members of this family (except for occasional substitution of acids by their corresponding amines) and play a role in determining specificity of sugar recognition (44Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 45Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In EMBP, however, the area defined as site I in other C-TLs is extended to form a tongue-like structure (β4–L1–β5) that points away from L4, resulting in an open, shallow groove. The EMBP residues equivalent to site I residues in MBP are Ile58, Arg65, Arg88, Gly90, and His91. Similarly, EMBP residues corresponding to MBP Ca2+ site II are Gln84, Trp86, Gly90, Arg103, and Arg104 (Fig.1 D). As can be seen from the above, none of the residues involved in Ca2+ binding are conserved in EMBP, and this area contributes to the maximum variation in tertiary structure when EMBP is compared with other C-TLs. EMBP is similar to LIT in that the latter also has not been shown to bind Ca2+ ion. The loss of ion binding capacity in LIT is mainly because of differences in the amino acid sequence and some topological difference in L1. However, the probable loss of the Ca2+ recognition site in EMBP is predicted because of the absence of any acidic coordinating residues in the two sites, their replacement with arginines, and large differences in the conformation of loops L1, L3, and L4 (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, CD94 (36Boyington J.C. Riaz A.N. Patamawenu A. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), CD69 (37Llera A.S. Viedma F. Sanchez-Madrid F. Tormo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7312-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Ly-49 (38Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) contain C-TL like domains, appear to be evolutionarily divergent from C-TLs, and do not bind either calcium or carbohydrate. However, a more recent report on the C-TL domain structure of CD69 indicated the binding of a carbohydrate-like structure but no Ca2+ binding (46Natarajan K. Sawicki M.W. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14779-14786Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate-recognition site in C-TLs is formed by a set of highly conserved residues juxtaposed by loops L1, L3, L4, and a β-strand (β3 in MBP, β7 in EMBP). In all structures of C-TLs in complex with carbohydrates (44Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 47Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the interaction of the protein and sugar is similar, with a calcium ion serving as the nucleus of the combining site. The carbohydrate binding specificity is provided by pairs of conserved acidic residues (Fig. 1 D). Mutagenesis and structural studies show that carbohydrate binding specificity can be changed by replacing or changing the order of these key residues (44Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar,45Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The residues necessary for sugar binding are Glu185, Asn187, Glu193, Asp194, Asn203, and Asp204 (MBP numbering), with residues 185 and 187 imparting sugar specificity in these proteins (44Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). As metal ion coordination and sugar binding are closely linked in C-TLs, it is predicted that EMBP cannot bind sugars with a mechanism similar to that seen in other members of this family of proteins. Indeed, equivalent residues in EMBP are Gln84, Trp86, His91, Arg103, and Arg104, thereby changing the local structure and charge of the binding pocket, effectively abolishing the mode of carbohydrate recognition seen in canonical C-TLs. The region corresponding to the carbohydrate/calcium binding site in EMBP is highly basic, and different in structure from that in the other C-TLs. Of the eight sulfate ions identified in the EMBP dimer structure, six make contacts with residues in the region corresponding to the C-TL carbohydrate-binding site. Although the sulfate ions originated from the cryoprotectant, there is a strong correlation between the positions of the residues that interact with the sulfates and the positions of those involved in sugar recognition in C-TLs. Residues Arg88 and His91 from L3–L4, along with residues Arg103, Arg104, His106, and Arg109 from β6 and β7 bind three sulfate ions along the predicted carbohydrate-binding site in tight hydrogen bonding networks. A fourth sulfate also bound to Arg65 from L1. His91 is involved in interactions with two sulfate ions that are separated by a distance of 8.4 Å within this region (Fig.2 A). This exactly matches the distance between the two sulfates in sugars likeN,O-6-disulpho-glucosamine, a component of long-chain glycosaminoglycans (GAG) such as heparin and heparan sulfate. Thus, the position of the sulfate ions, however fortuitous, in the EMBP structure provides some clues to the possible nature of the EMBP ligand. Furthermore, the nature of the residues constituting the carbohydrate-binding site, the absence of Ca2+ ions in the structure, and the highly basic nature of the protein suggest that the carbohydrates recognized by EMBP are likely to be very different from that seen with other proteins of the same family. The role of heparin or heparin-like sugars in EMBP function is not clearly understood. However, it is known that EMBP activities can be reversed by addition of heparin in the experimental setup. For example, EMBP-stimulated cytokine production in IL-1 stimulated cells could be reversed by the addition of heparin (48Rochester C.L. Ackerman S.J. Zheng T. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4449-4456PubMed Google Scholar). EMBP inhibits the binding ofN-methyl-scopolamine (NMS) to heart membrane muscarinic M2 receptors and causes the dissociation of NMS receptor complexes in a dose-dependent fashion, an effect that can also be reversed by the addition of heparin (49Jacoby D.B. Gleich G.J. Fryer A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The highly basic nature of EMBP provides an obvious means for it to bind highly acidic moieties. Therefore, it is logical to assume that EMBP would bind heparin, heparin-like, or other sulfated sugars with high affinity, and that this may have implications for the physiological function of EMBP. To test our hypothesis regarding the nature of sugars recognized by EMBP, we have modeled the interactions of the most abundant repeating unit of heparan sulfate (1,4-dideoxy-O 2-sulfo-glucorinic acid-N,O6-disulfo-glucosamine) with EMBP. The carbohydrate coordinates were obtained from the structure of the Foot-and-Mouth disease virus-oligosaccharide receptor complex (PDB code: 1QQP) (50Fry E.E. Lea S.M. Jackson T. Newman J.W. Ellard F.M. Blakemore W.E. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Samuel A. King A.M. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate was first docked onto EMBP with the two sulfates of disulpho-glucosamine superimposed on the two sulfates of free EMBP. The model was then subjected to 300 rounds of Powell minimization, applying steric restraints on the protein, using the program CNS v1.0 (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). There was no steric impediment imposed on the modeled sugar or symmetry-related molecules of EMBP. The interactions of free sulfate ions with EMBP are retained in the model with additional interactions made between the sugar ring and protein (Fig.2 A). The nature of these interactions in the model provides a plausible explanation for the binding of heparin to EMBP (Fig.2 B) in agreement with the inhibition data available (51Gleich G.J.

The argument that EMBP binds specifically to heparin was experimentally proven by performing binding experiments in the presence of heparin. Figs. 3, A and Bshow the elution profiles of the cationic proteins from three heparin-SepharoseCL-6B columns. ECP, pI 10.8, was readily desorbed from the column at pH 7 and 0.5 m NaCl with 100% recovery by absorbance; EPO, pI 10.8, desorbed from the column at pH 7 and 1.0m NaCl with 88% recovery; at pH 7 EMBP, pI 11.4, was not desorbed with 3.0 m NaCl, and not with 3.0 mNaCl + 5 mg/ml heparin. Experiments with SepharoseCL-6B andd-mannose columns showed that EMBP did not bind to these materials; 91% of the applied EMBP was recovered from each solid phase with PO4 buffer. Also, the findings from the control experiments on ECP and EPO are critical and show that EMBP binding is markedly more avid than the binding of two other highly cationic proteins, both from the eosinophil granule and both with pIs that are close to that of EMBP (ECP and EPO have pIs of 10.8). These experimental results support the finding from the crystal structure that EMBP is a heparin-binding protein. However, it is very likely that heparan sulfate is not the sole physiological ligand for EMBP, because EMBP may have capacity to recognize a wide variety of sulfated ligands (4Gleich G.J. Kita H. Adolphson C.R. Frank M.M. Austen K.F. Claman H.N. Unanue E.R. Samter's Immunologic Diseases. Little, Brown & Co., Boston1995: 205-245Google Scholar). The possibility of EMBP to recognize sulfated sugars provides a new interpretation for the role of the proform of EMBP. EMBP is produced as a proform of 207 amino acids (23.5 kDa) that is moderately acidic, because of the presence of a large number of acidic residues in the pro-piece (pI = 3.9). It has been believed that the pro portion of pro-EMBP protects the cell during transport of the protein from the Golgi apparatus to the eosinophil granule (55Popken-Harris P. McGrogan M. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Kubo H. Thomas L.L. Moy J.N. Sottrupjensen L. Snable J.L. Kikuchi M.T. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1472-1480PubMed Google Scholar), where EMBP is processed to form the crystalline granule. In addition, pro-EMBP is also heavily glycosylated in the pro section to the extent that its apparent molecular mass is increased to 50–90 kDa. Analysis of carbohydrate composition has shown that in addition to N- andO-linked glycan groups, pro-EMBP also carries glycosaminoglycans and is thus a proteoglycan (22Oxvig C. Haaning J. Hojrup P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 329-336PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the pro portion of EMBP, in addition to neutralizing the complex, also functions to inactivate the protein by blocking the carbohydrate-binding site of EMBP with glycosylated moieties during transport to the eosinophil granule. EMBP is a member of the C-TL family by virtue of its overall topology. However, it lacks the ability to coordinate Ca2+ ion, and the invariant residues involved in the binding of carbohydrate by other lectins are not present. It is also evolutionarily distinct from the major C-TL subfamilies. Acidic amino acids that make up the carbohydrate-binding site are replaced predominantly by arginine and histidine residues, thereby changing the local charge and shape of this site. The presence of sulfate ions in this site and the correspondence of interacting residues with those in C-TLs indicate that EMBP has the capacity to bind sulfated sugars, and as such molecules like heparin have been shown to inhibit the activity of EMBP in various assays. We have modeled the interaction of a repeating disaccharide of heparan sulfate at the putative carbohydrate-binding site of EMBP, and binding experiments have shown that EMBP specifically binds heparin. Direct structural study to establish the binding mode of such a ligand with EMBP is currently underway. Our structural studies provide a platform for further studies toward unraveling EMBP function."

Here, we show that AIIt inhibits fibrin clot lysis by stimulation of plasmin autodegradation, which results in a loss of plasmin activity. Furthermore, the C-terminal lysine residues of its p11 subunit play an essential role in the inhibition of fibrin clot lysis by AIIt. We also found that AIIt binds to fibrin with a K d of 436 nm and a stoichiometry of about 0.28 mol of AIIt/mol of fibrin monomer. The binding of AIIt to fibrin was not dependent on the C-terminal lysines of the p11 subunit. Furthermore, in the presence of plasminogen, the binding of AIIt to fibrin was increased to about 1.3 mol of AIIt/mol of fibrin monomer, suggesting that AIIt and plasminogen do not compete for identical sites on fibrin. Immunohistochemical identification of p36 and p11 subunits of AIIt in a pathological clot provides important evidence for its role as a physiological fibrinolytic regulator. These results suggest that AIIt may play a key role in the regulation of plasmin activity on the fibrin clot surface.

The (patho-) physiological existence of fibrin is linked to its homeostatic roles, such as temporary matrix formation in wound healing and the formation of a hemostatic plug. Accumulation of fibrin is a hallmark of a variety of diseases, such as cancer and arteriosclerosis (4Musial J. Wilczynska M. Sladek K. Cierniewski C.S. Nizankowski R. Szczeklik A.

The polymerization of the fibrin monomer and the degradation of the fibrin polymer are physiologically balanced by the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, respectively (5Plow E.F. Herren T.

Dissolution of a fibrin clot is mainly conducted by plasmin, the terminal enzyme of the fibrinolytic cascade. Plasmin, an 85-kDa serine protease, is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including fibrinolysis, wound healing, tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, and the invasion and spread of transformed tumor cells (5Plow E.F.

First, [Glu]plasminogen is converted to the more reactive [Lys]plasminogen by plasmin itself through proteolytic removal of the N-terminal 77 amino acids. Second, plasmin also activates the plasminogen activators, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which, in turn, convert [Lys]- or [Glu]plasminogen to plasmin (13Henkin J. Marcotte P. Yang H.C. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1991; 34: 135-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is well established that fibrin stimulates the rate of tPA-dependent plasminogen activation by at least two orders of magnitude due to the localization of plasminogen and tPA to the fibrin surface via their lysine-binding kringle domains (17Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Fleury V. Angles-Cano E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as the histidine-proline rich glycoproteins or certain extracellular matrix proteins that interact with the kringle domains of plasminogen, have also been shown to stimulate plasminogen activation (19Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5718-5726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol.

Typically, these interactions involve the binding of the kringle domains with the C-terminal lysine residues of the plasminogen-binding protein. Hajjar's group recently reported that the Ca2+-binding protein, annexin II, stimulated the tPA-dependent formation of plasmin from [Glu]plasminogen or [Lys]plasminogen 20-fold or 14-fold, respectively, in vitro. They also reported that plasminogen activation was inhibited on human umbilical vein endothelial cell surfaces after transfection of these cells with antisense oligonucleotides directed against annexin II mRNA, suggesting that annexin II may function as a fibrinolytic receptor for plasminogen on the surface of endothelial cells (23Cesarman G.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin II was originally described as an intracellular Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding protein, and subsequent studies suggested that this protein could be involved in regulating membrane trafficking events such as exocytosis or endocytosis (28Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, annexin II does not contain a C-terminal lysine residue, and the mechanism by which this protein interacted with plasminogen was unclear. Annexin II also exists in cells as a heterotetramer, called annexin II heterotetramer (AIIt), which consists of two annexin II molecules referred to as the p36 subunit and two molecules of an 11-kDa regulatory subunit referred to as the p11 light chain. Importantly, p11 contains two lysine residues at its C terminus. Ninety to ninety-five percent of the total cellular annexin II is present in the heterotetrameric form in many cells such as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, bovine intestinal epithelial cells, and calf pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (29Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 30Nilius B. Gerke V. Prenen J. Szücs G. Heinke S. Weber K. Droogmans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30631-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, it was established that AIIt binds tPA, plasminogen, and plasmin and stimulates tPA-dependent plasminogen activation about 300-fold in vitro (31Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This activation was mediated by binding of plasminogen kringle domains to the C-terminal lysine residue of the p11 subunit, suggesting that the p11 subunit facilitates the majority of the AIIt-mediated stimulation of tPA-dependent plasminogen activation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation experiments established the colocalization of p11 and annexin II on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (31Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

Choi et al., manuscript in preparation.. Taken together, these data provided evidence that AIIt played a key role in plasminogen activation on the cell surface. We recently reported that AIIt inhibited the fibrinolytic activity of plasmin (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted using fibrin clots generated from purified components in a cell-free system (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that AIIt associated with the fibrin clot in vitro (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a separate series of experiments, we showed that preincubation of AIIt and plasmin resulted in the stimulation of the autocatalytic digestion of the plasmin heavy and light chains, resulting in a decrease in plasmin activity (31Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was therefore unclear from our results if the antifibrinolytic activity of AIIt was due to its stimulation of plasmin autodegradation or due to its ability to associate with fibrin thereby sterically hindering the interaction of plasmin with fibrin. In the present report, we demonstrate that the antifibrinolytic activity of AIIt is due to its stimulation of plasmin autodegradation by a mechanism that requires the C-terminal lysine residues of the p11 subunit. Bovine intestinal mucosa heparin (3 kDa, 50 USP units/mg), ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA), and thrombin (2300 NIH units/mg) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Human recombinant tPA was obtained from Genentech, was purified by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose (35Husain S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and was an 80–90% single chain as determined by SDS-PAGE. [Glu]plasminogen, [Lys]plasminogen, plasmin, the amidolytic plasmin specific substrate, Spectrozyme 251 (H-d-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide), and the tPA amidolytic substrate Spectrozyme 444 (methyl-d-cyclohexatyrosyl-glycyl-arginine paranitroaniline acetate) were obtained from American Diagnostica. Fibrinogen was obtained from Sigma and further purified by chromatography on Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove contaminating plasminogen. Annexin II tetramer (AIIt) was prepared from bovine lung as previously described (36Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recombinant annexin II monomer and p11 subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (37Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,38Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant annexin II from bacterial lysates involved chromatography on hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, and gel permeation chromatography on Superose 12. Purification of recombinant p11 involved ion-exchange chromatography on Fast-Q and Fast-S and gel permeation chromatography on Superose 12. Recombinant AIIt was formed by mixing equimolar annexin II and p11 followed by gel permeation chromatography on Superose 12. All proteins were stored at −70 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Anti-p11 and annexin II monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The bacterial expression vector (pDS10) encoding the cDNA of human total calcium mutant annexin II was kindly provided by Dr. Volker Gerke. This vector has all five Ca2+-binding sites of annexin II inactivated and has the mutation A65E in the annexin II sequence to provide an epitope for antibody recognition (39Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This site was reverted back to the wild-type sequence (E65A) before bacterial transformation (40Filipenko N.R. Kang H.M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mutant annexin II cDNA sequence was excised from the pDS10 vector using PCR (40Filipenko N.R. Kang H.M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction resulted in a blunt-ended cDNA encoding the exact amino acid sequence of annexin II and therefore did not encode for the six extra amino acids as previously reported. ABamHI site was added to the 3′-end using PCR with the appropriate primers. This cDNA sequence was then ligated into anNdeI-cut, Klenow-filled-in, BamHI-digested pAED4.91 vector. These vectors were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and grown as previously described (37Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the p11 subunit deletion mutant (lacking the two C-terminal lysine residues) was produced by PCR mutagenesis as previously described (38Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cDNA expression construct, pAED4.91-p11del KK was confirmed by DNA sequencing to lack Lys-95 and Lys-96. The expression of the p11del KK in BL21(DE3) E. coli and the subsequent purification were performed as previously described (37Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fibrin polymer lysis experiments were performed in a volume of 400 μl at 25 °C using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer to monitor changes in turbidity at 450 nm (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Initially, fibrin clots were formed by incubation of 8 μmfibrinogen with 0.83 NIH units/ml thrombin in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2) at room temperature. After turbidity had reached a stable level, 100 μl of buffer A containing 42 nm plasmin and test substances such as glycerol, ε-ACA, or other proteins were gently layered on top of the fibrin polymer reaction mixture, and turbidity was measured as described previously (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AIIt and [Glu]plasminogen were radioiodinated as previously described (41Suenson E. Thorsen S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, either AIIt or plasminogen (10 μm) was incubated for 3 min at room temperature with 37 MBq (= 1 mCi) of Na125I and three IODO-BEADs (Pierce Chemical Co.) in phosphate-buffered saline. Free I125 and protein were separated using a PD-10 desalting column (Sephadex G-25, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated, and eluted with buffer A. The specific activity of the protein preparations ranged from 1000 to 2000 cpm/pmol of protein. Fibrin clots were formed as described above for the fibrin polymer lysis assay. After turbidity had reached a stable level, fibrin clot lysis was triggered by gently layering 200 nm radioiodinated plasminogen and 25 nm tPA with or without 1 μm AIIt. After 12 h of incubation at 25 °C, 10 μl of each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the pattern of plasminogen or plasmin degradation was detected by autoradiography. The autoradiographs were quantitated by densitometric analysis using a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4c flatbed scanner and Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Fibrin polymerization was initiated by addition of thrombin (5 NIH units/ml) to a series of Eppendorf tubes, preheated to 37 °C, containing 5 μm fibrinogen, 4.2 nm125I-labeled AIIt, and various concentrations of unlabeled AIIt in buffer A. To examine the binding of AIIt to fibrin in the presence of plasminogen, fibrin was formed by incubation of thrombin (5 NIH units/ml), 5 μm fibrinogen, 4.2 nm125I-labeled AIIt, 2 μmunlabeled AIIt, and various concentrations of plasminogen in the absence or presence of 10 mm ε-ACA (42Suenson E. Bjerrum P. Holm A. Lind B. Meldal M. Selmer J. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22228-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrin clots were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clots were washed with buffer A three times, and AIIt bound to the fibrin clot was calculated from radioactivity of the fibrin pellets. Radioactivity of the pelleted clots in the thrombin-untreated tubes was subtracted from that of the pellet in the thrombin-treated tubes. Nonspecific binding was typically less than 10% of total binding. Fibrin polymers were formed in 24-well plates by incubation of 8 μm fibrinogen with 0.83 NIH unit/ml thrombin in buffer A as described above. The kinetics of tPA-mediated plasminogen activation in the absence or presence of AIIt on fibrin was determined by measuring amidolytic activity of the plasmin generated during activation of plasminogen. The reaction was performed with the substrate H-d-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide (Spectrozyme 251) at a final concentration of 100 μm, and in buffer A containing 2 nm tPA in the absence or presence of 1 μm AIIt. Alternatively, AIIt-stimulated plasmin formation on the fibrin clot was examined in the presence of various concentrations of AIIt. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm [Glu]plasminogen and was monitored at 405 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 Bioassay reader. Initial rates of plasmin generation were calculated using linear regression analysis of plots ofA 405 nmversus time squared as previously outlined (43Drapier J.C. Tenu J.P. Lemaire G. Petit J.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1979; 61: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Linear regression was performed with the computer program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). For time course data, the data were fit to the equation,A 405 nm = B +K*t 2, where K is the rate constant for the acceleration of p-NA generation andB is the y intercept. This equation describes the rate of p-nitroanilide (p-NA) production from a mixture of tPA, plasminogen, and spectrozyme 251. Under our experimental conditions, K was proportional to the initial rate of plasmin formation from plasminogen. Typically, the initial rates of plasmin generation were reported in units ofA 405 nm/min2 × 10−3. A lung tissue specimen was obtained from an autopsy of a patient who had suffered a pulmonary thromboembolism. The lung tissue was fixed overnight in 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Three-micron-thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and placed on coated glass slides. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. No antigen retrieval technique was necessary. Sections were stained using a Ventana Nexes immunostainer with a Ventana DAB detection kit. Antibody was applied manually at an appropriate time in the cycle. Anti-p11 monoclonal antibody was diluted with Dako antibody diluting buffer to a working concentration of 1:40, whereas the anti-annexin II monoclonal antibody was diluted to a working dilution of 1:25. Antibodies were incubated with samples for 30 min. The slides were counterstained with Ventana hematoxylin and bluing agent. Coverslips were placed over the slides, which were then examined using a Zeiss microscope fitted with a SPOT digital camera. Nonlinear least-squares fitting was performed using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Results are representative of a minimum of three experiments. AIIt, fibrinogen, and [Glu]plasminogen concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (A 280) using the extinction coefficients (Ε mg/ml) 0.68, 1.51, and 1.68, respectively. We previously reported that the plasmin-dependent lysis of a fibrin polymer, produced from purified components, was totally blocked if AIIt was present during fibrin polymer formation (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was unclear from these studies if, in the presence of fibrin, AIIt inhibited plasmin activity directly or indirectly inhibited plasmin activity by promoting plasmin autodegradation. We therefore used an in vitro fibrin polymer lysis assay to address this question. In this assay, fibrin was formed from fibrinogen by thrombin and fibrin polymer dissolution was initiated by addition of plasmin in the presence or absence of AIIt. Fibrin clot polymerization and subsequent lysis were measured with a simple turbidity assay (A 450). As shown in Fig. 1, the two respective processes of fibrin polymerization (clotting) and fibrinolysis are indicated by an initial rapid increase in turbidity to a plateau value (polymer formation) and, after addition of plasmin to the fibrin polymer, a subsequent return to the value of nonpolymerized material (fibrinolysis). Lysis of the fibrin clot was completely abolished in the presence of AIIt. Interestingly, the AIIt-mediated inhibition of plasmin fibrinolytic activity was blocked by glycerol in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Glycerol has been shown to inhibit plasmin autodegradation but not plasmin-dependent clot lysis (44Jespersen J. Gram J. Astrup T. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data therefore suggested that AIIt blocked fibrin clot lysis by accelerating plasmin autodegradation, thereby reducing the availability of plasmin for fibrin clot lysis. It has been documented that plasmin autodegradation results in a loss in plasmin activity and degradation of the plasmin heavy (A) and light (B) chains. To establish if AIIt blocked fibrin clot lysis via stimulation of plasmin autodegradation, we analyzed the plasmin reaction products during fibrinolysis. Fibrinogen was incubated with thrombin, and, after 30 min, a stable fibrin clot was formed. Radioiodinated plasminogen was added to the clot, and fibrinolysis was initiated by addition of tPA. After 12 h, the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of fibrin, tPA converted plasminogen into plasmin as illustrated by the appearance of the 55-kDa A chain and 25-kDa B chain of plasmin. In contrast, when AIIt was added to the reaction, degradation of both the plasmin A (H-Pm) and B (L-Pm) chain was apparent (Fig. 2). Densitometric quantitation of the autoradiogram showed that 11.8% of the A chain and 43.6% of the B chain of plasmin remained after incubation with 1 μm AIIt. Furthermore, in the presence of 5 μm AIIt, only 5.4% of the A chain and 35.1% of the B chain of plasmin remained (Fig. 2, inset). These results therefore establish that the inhibition of fibrin clot lysis by AIIt is due to its acceleration of plasmin autodegradation. AIIt is a Ca2+-binding protein, and binding of Ca2+ to the p36 subunit regulates many of its biological activities (28Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 46Kang H.M. Choi K.S. Kassam G. Fitzpatrick S.L. Kwon M. Waisman D.M. Trends. Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The p36 subunit of AIIt contains five established Ca2+-binding sites. We utilized a recombinant AIIt mutant to establish if the Ca2+-binding sites of AIIt played a role in the inhibition of fibrin clot lysis. TCM AIIt, which has all five Ca2+-binding sites of the p36 subunit inactivated, significantly blocked plasmin-dependent fibrin clot lysis in a similar fashion to wild-type AIIt (Fig.3A). This suggested that the five Ca2+-binding sites in the p36 subunit of AIIt do not play a role in the inhibitory effect of AIIt on fibrin clot lysis. AIIt binds plasminogen via the C-terminal lysine residues of its p11 subunit (38Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Removal of the C-terminal lysines blocks the ability of AIIt to accelerate tPA-dependent plasminogen conversion to plasmin (38Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine if the C-terminal lysines of the p11 subunit of AIIt participate in the antifibrinolytic activity of AIIt, we carried out plasmin-dependent fibrin clot lysis in the presence of recombinant mutant AIIt (AIIt(K-K)−) whose two p11 C-terminal lysine residues were deleted (Fig. 3B). The results show that, unlike the wild-type and TCM AIIt, AIIt(K-K)− did not block plasmin-dependent fibrin clot lysis. Therefore, these data suggested that the C-terminal lysine residues of AIIt play an important role in the inhibitory effect of AIIt on fibrin clot lysis. We previously demonstrated that AIIt pelleted with a fibrin clot (34Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kassam G. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result prompted us to characterize the binding of AIIt to the fibrin polymer. A fibrin polymer was formed by incubation of fibrinogen and thrombin with radioiodinated AIIt. The fibrin clot was centrifuged, and the AIIt binding to the fibrin clot was quantitated. Fig.4 shows the binding isotherm for the binding of AIIt to fibrin. AIIt bound fibrin polymer in a specific and saturable manner with a K d of 269.4 ± 60.0 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). The binding approached a plateau at about 1.6 μm AIIt, which corresponded to about 0.28 mol of AIIt/mol of fibrin monomer. Scatchard analysis (Fig. 4, inset) established that the binding of AIIt to fibrin was mediated by a single, moderate affinity-binding site. The low stoichiometric binding of AIIt to fibrin could be due to steric hindrance. For example, it is possible that the binding sites in the dense areas of the clot may not be"

Understanding the precise conformational transformation of an inactive GPCR into an activated form capable of interacting with a G-protein is a key problem in elucidating the molecular steps of cell surface receptor signaling. Rhodopsin, a member of the GPCR family, is involved in photon absorption in retinal rod cells and activation of transducin, a specific G-protein (1Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin is a bipartite molecule composed of the protein opsin (∼40 kDa) and 11-cis-retinal (a derivative of vitamin A), which is covalently linked to opsin through a protonated Schiff base with Lys296 located in transmembrane helix VII (H-VII) (1Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Khorana H.G. J. Biomol. Struct. Design. 1999; 1: 1-16Google Scholar). The determination of the x-ray structure of the first GPCR, rhodopsin, provides new insights into the ground state conformation of this receptor (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar). The inactive conformation of rhodopsin is stabilized by the 11-cis-retinal chromophore. The positive charge of the Schiff base linkage is placed in a highly hydrophobic environment and is neutralized by Glu113 (6Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar,7Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Science. 1989; 246: 928-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Absorption of a photon by the chromophore causes photoisomerization around the C11=C12 double bond and the formation of all-trans-retinylidene (8Yoshizawa T. Wald G. Nature. 1963; 197: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Photoisomerization of the chromophore to the all-trans isomer causes changes in the polyene chain of the chromophore, including reorientation of the C9 and C13 methyl groups and repositioning of the β-ionone ring, which ultimately leads to deprotonation of the Schiff base and changes at the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin (3Khorana H.G. J. Biomol. Struct. Design. 1999; 1: 1-16Google Scholar). These changes are sufficient to drive a conformational change of the protein and transient activation of opsin before the Schiff base hydrolyzes to release all-trans-retinal from opsin. The atomic resolution structures of these intermediates are not yet available. The activation process of rhodopsin has been investigated by biochemical methods, and several models have been proposed. In one of the most widely accepted models, it is proposed that photoactivation involves a critical proton transfer between the protonated Schiff base and the glutamate counter-ion. However, it is clear that the structural constraint imposed on opsin by the protonated Schiff base–counter-ion interaction can account only partially for the receptor inactivation (4Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 287-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The photoactivation process could also involve the repositioning of the methyl groups of all-trans-retinal compared to 11-cis-retinal, particularly movement of the methyl group at C9 could cause activation by triggering a conformational change in opsin (2Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Retinal analogs, with a bridge between C10 and C13 of 1–4 carbons which prevents isomerization around the C11=C12 bond, stabilize opsin in its inactive conformation (or minimally active) even under light conditions (9Akita A. Tanis S.P. Adams M. Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 6372-6376Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Zankel T. Johnson R.H. Chang C.W. Sekiya N. Naoki H. Yoshihara K.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is believed that lack of isomerization or incomplete isomerization around the C11=C12 bond in the polyene chain of the retinal analog is the cause of this lack of rhodopsin activation. Alternatively, the repositioning of the β-ionone ring of the chromophore may be needed to trigger conformational changes that lead to the formation of the active form of rhodopsin. We revisited this problem using ring-constrained (“locked”) retinal analog regenerated rhodopsins and the three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin in the ground state to understand what changes within the chromophore binding pocket are allowed without substantial receptor activation. Two isomeric cyclic ketones (9-cis- and 9-trans-) containing four double bonds were prepared by condensation between β-ionone and 3-methoxy-2-cyclohexenone followed by subsequent reduction, hydrolysis and water elimination (12van der Steen R. Groesbeek M. van Amsterdam L.J.P. Lugtenburg J. van Oostrum J. de Grip W.J. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1989; 108: 20-28Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Horner-Emmons reaction of the ketone followed by diisobutylaluminium hydride reduction afforded an isomeric mixture of four 11-cis-locked retinal analogs in an approximately equal ratio. The mixture was separated using isocratic normal phase HPLC with 4% ethyl acetate and hexane. Each fraction was rechromatographed additionally using the same conditions to achieve the final isomeric purity of 95–98%. Rod outer segments membranes from 50 retinas (∼40 mg of rhodopsin) were suspended in 20 ml of H2O. The suspension was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 16 mm NH2OH (freshly prepared), and the mixture was placed on ice and bleached with a 250-watt lamp at a distance of 10 cm for 30 min. The bleached rhodopsin (opsin) was washed extensively with 20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl and finally suspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. The above opsin suspension (350 µl) was mixed with ∼54 nmol of 11-cis-locked retinal analog inN,N-dimethylformamide orN,N-dimethylformamide only (9 µl) as a control, and the mixture was incubated on a nutator at room temperature overnight under dim red light conditions. The reconstituted rhodopsin analog was then solubilized with 10 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the solubilization mixture was centrifuged at 86,000 × gfor 15 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto 0.7 ml of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 10 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 0.1 m NaCl) in a glasswool plug Pasteur pipette at 10 °C. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer A (monitored by the disappearance of UV absorption at ∼350 nm), and the fractions containing rhodopsin analogs were eluted with 700 µl of 300 mm methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in buffer A. The purified rhodopsin analogs were bleached twice by a photographic flashlight from a 5-cm distance. The retinoids were converted to their oximes by adding 300 µl of MeOH and 150 µl of 0.4 m NH2OH, pH 6.5, and the oximes were extracted twice with 500 µl of hexane. Retinoids were analyzed by normal phase HPLC (Alltech, silica 5 µ, 2.1 × 250 mm) with 4% ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (13Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F.

Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The activity of transducin was determined by following the light-dependent binding of [35S]GTPγS (2 Ci/mmol) at 28 °C (15Wessling Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transducin concentration was 1.5 µm, [35S]GTPγS was 4 µm,and rhodopsin regenerated with 11-cis-retinal or1–4 analogs in native membranes was 5 nm. To prepare the FTIR samples, 24 µm opsin membranes (16Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were incubated overnight with 240 µm native 11-cis-retinal or with the mixture of locked retinal analogs in BTP buffer (130 mm NaCl, 20 mm BTP, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2). Suspensions of membranes were centrifuged for 25 min at 100,000 ×g, yielding 2.2 mm rhodopsin in the pellet (from absorption at 500 nm). The buffer solution was removed and the pellet transferred to a 30-mm diameter temperature-controlled transmission cell with two BaF2 windows and a 5-µm teflon gasket. The spectra were recorded using a Bruker ifs 66v spectrometer (17Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at pH 7.5 and 25 °C. For both samples, Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectra were generated. Activities of 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (11-cis-RDH) in retinal pigment (prRDH) epithelium microsomes or all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase (all-trans-RDH) in rod outer segments were assayed by monitoring the production of [15-3H]retinol analogs (reduction of retinal analogs). The reaction mixture (100 µl) contained MES (final concentration, 80 mm, pH 5.5), pro-S-[4-3H]NADH (13Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

The reaction was incubated at 33 °C for 10 min, then quenched with 400 µl of MeOH and 100 µl of 1 m NaCl, and extracted with 500 µl of hexane. After mixing and separating phases, 400 µl of the upper phase was removed and dried with a stream of argon. The residue was dissolved in 120 µl of hexane, and 100 µl was analyzed by normal phase HPLC (Beckman, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane for analogs 1 and4 or 4% ethyl acetate in hexane for analogs 2and 3 at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min using an HP1100 with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.06.03 software. The corresponding retinol analog fraction was collected and subjected to scintillation counting. Coordinations for bovine rhodopsin were taken from the Protein Data Bank (1F88). Addition of hydrogen atoms and all optimizations were done in Insight II (Insight II release 98.0 (1998), Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego).

The ESFF force field is a rule-based force field that was developed at Molecular Simulations Inc. The charges are determined by minimizing the electrostatic energy with respect to the charges under the constraint that the sum of the charges is equal to the net charge on the molecule. Retinal and its four locked analogs together with Lys296 were optimized with the rest of the protein fixed. The same procedure was applied to residues near (4.5 Å) the movable part of rhodopsin structure. Then the complete protein structure was optimized without constraints. Visualizations were done on a portion of rhodopsin confined to a 4.5 Å radial distance from the retinal and Lys296 atoms. It was necessary to remove some of the residues to show the retinal inside the cavity. Additional information is provided in the figure legends. To obtain additional insight into the activation mechanism, we prepared four retinal analogs with a two-carbon bridge linking C10 and C13 of retinal as part of a cyclohexene ring (10Zankel T.

All 11-cis-locked retinal isomers were stable in solution; however, these isomers could be converted into each other in solution by a short bleach (for example, bleaching of 11-cis-locked isomer 3 is shown in Fig.2, A and B), with isomer 1 produced in the lowest abundance. To ensure quantitative extraction, particularly in the presence of biological membranes (see below), each isomer was pre-column derivatized with hydroxylamine, and anti-oximes were fully chromatographically resolved, while syn-oximes were only partially resolved (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig.3, all four 11-cis-locked isomers in solution individually give rise to a mixture ofanti-oximes after photobleaching. In contrast, when reacted with opsin in native membranes, in the absence of bleaching, 9,11,13-tri-cis- (1), 11,13-di-cis-(2), and 9,11-di-cis- (4) locked retinal analogs spontaneously isomerized to each other (Fig. 3) because of isomerization around the C13–C14 bond. This observation is consistent with earlier studies with di-cis-retinals that showed that the cisC13=C14 bond is destabilized upon reaction with opsin (22Shichida Y. Nakamura K. Yoshizawa T. Trehan A. Denny M. Liu R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6495-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 11-cis-Locked analog 3did not isomerize after binding to opsin (Fig. 3). Bleaching of 11,13-di-cis- (analog 2) and 11-cis-locked (analog 3) rhodopsin produced isomerization around the C9=C10 double bond. Quantitative analysis of the 9,11,13-tri-cis and 9,11-di-cis locked retinal regenerated rhodopsin was more difficult due to isomerization in the dark; however, all isomers were produced upon photoisomerization. The locked retinal structures differ significantly from each other, and clear specificity is observed with other enzymes utilizing these analogs. Recombinant 11-cis-RDH and native 11-cis-RDH in retinal pigment epithelium membranes preferred analogs 1 and3 as substrates (“Experimental Procedures”) (13Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M.

The difference in specificity between these two dehydrogenases results from the recognition of the C13=C14–C15 carbon triad configuration in addition to the β-ionone ring (Fig. 3). Thus, rhodopsin's infidelity in discriminating the locked analogs results from the relaxed structural constraints in the active site rather than the structural flexibility of these hydrophobic analogs.Figure 3Oximes produced from each 11-cis-locked retinal isomer in solution and in rhodopsin with or without photobleaching and substrate specificities of 11-cis- and all-trans-RDH toward each isomer.

The product was analyzed by normal phase HPLC and quantified by scintillation counting. For example, 11-cis-RDH activities with analogs 1 and3 and pro-S-[4-3H]NADH as substrates were 92.3 and 40.1 nmol/min/mg, respectively, but no activity with analogs 2 and 4 could be detected. In contrast, recombinant prRDH activities with analogs 2 and4 and pro-S-[4-3H]NADPH as substrates were 1.33 and 2.33 nmol/min/mg, respectively.

Similar absorption maxima of rhodopsin regenerated with analogs (conformational sensitive opsin shift), ranging from 494 to 510 nm (data not shown), suggest that the interaction of opsin and the chromophore is not considerably changed as a result of the different configuration around the C9 and C13 double bonds found among these analogs. The structural changes in the retinal analogs bound to opsin upon isomerization and how opsin accommodates such changes were investigated utilizing the recently solved high resolution three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin (5Palczewski K.

Open table in a new tab The assay was carried out for 3 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rhodopsin was regenerated with 11-cis-retinal or one of the four retinal analogs (1–4) (see Fig. 1). The binding was initiated by addition of [35S]GTPγS in the dark or freshly bleached samples. The assay was performed in triplicate. All four locked retinal analogs were modeled in the active site of rhodopsin (Fig. 4 A) (“Experimental Procedures”). These chromophores fit well into the retinylidene binding site. The ε-nitrogen of Lys296, in a Schiff base with analogs 1–4, projects directly toward the Glu113 counter-ion, (Fig. 4 A), which is in agreement with the ∼500 nm absorption maximum for rhodopsin regenerated with these analogs. Modeling suggests that fitting analogs2 and 4 into the binding pocket of opsin requires flipping the β-ionone ring about the C6–C7single bond to give a 6s-trans conformation (Fig.4 A; see Fig. 1. legend). This repositioning also leads to changes in the location of the cyclohexene ring, compared with isomers1 and 3. There is no structural restriction from the protein on conformational changes of the chromophore, as observed experimentally by interconversion of one locked analog into the others. Importantly, the position of the C12–C15 region is hardly changed among these four bound retinal analogs. Liu and Mirzadegan (23Liu R.S.H. Mirzadegan T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8617-8620Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) proposed a model of the rhodopsin active site from reconstitution studies of rhodopsin with different mono-, di-, and tri-cis-retinals and concluded that despite significantly different geometry, for example for 7-cis-retinal versus 11-cis-retinal, the chromophores provide the same “points of anchor,” in particular, for the position of the β-ionone ring. With a high resolution structure of rhodopsin and using locked analogs, it appears that these early assertions, despite the rotation of the β-ionone ring, could be valid. FTIR was employed to investigate changes in the hydrogen bonding of rhodopsin, regenerated with the locked retinal analogs and then exposed to light (Fig.5).Figure 5FTIR difference spectra of rhodopsin before and after illumination. Red, difference spectrum of rhodopsin regenerated with the mixture of locked retinals; green, difference spectrum of the 11-cis-retinal regenerated sample (control measurement). Negative bands correspond to vibrations present in rhodopsin, positive bands to vibrations in the photoproduct (for details, see “Results and Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For rhodopsin regenerated with locked analogs, there is a distinct light-induced difference band in the spectrum at 1,206 cm−1. It belongs to the spectral region that reflects light-induced changes in retinal geometry and retinal-protein interaction (fingerprint region). In the same region, the more complex fingerprint of the normal sample is dominated by the 1,238 cm−1 band with the same negative polarity. Protonation-dependent bands around 1,700–1,770 are insignificant. The spectral changes in the amide I and II are marginal, indicating lack of major light-induced alterations in the peptide backbone (amide I and II bands at 1,700–1,620 and 1,570–1,500 cm−1, respectively) (Fig. 5). Small spectral changes around 1,768/1,745 cm−1 indicate minor changes in hydrogen bonding of Asp83 and Glu122. The intensity of the 1,206 cm−1 band did not decrease when the sample was treated with 2 mm hydroxylamine or washed extensively with bovine serum albumin. None of the spectral changes was observed in control measurements employing the retinal analogs in alcoholic solution or when added to aqueous bovine serum albumin solution (data not shown). We conclude that, in agreement with the extraction experiments, light-induced changes in the chromophore (different from those seen with C11=C12 double bond isomerization) do occur, but the activating structural changes in opsin are absent. The orientation of the β-ionone ring of 11-cis-retinal in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C.

A., Palczewski, K., and Stenkamp, R. E.

Glaubitz C. Choi G. Mason A.J. Watts A. Nature. 2000; 405: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NMR and crystal structure models are very similar for the polyene chain; however, the β-ionone ring is flipped from the 6s-cis(C5C6C7C8 torsion angle −72.35 seen in the crystal structure) to the 6s-transconfiguration observed by NMR. Accommodation of both the 6s-trans and the 6s-cis conformations in the active site would be possible if the key interaction between opsin and the β-ionone ring of the chromophore (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Nature. 1975; 258: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Importantly, Ito and colleagues (27Imamoto Y. Sakai M. Katsuta Y. Wada A. Ito M. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6257-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Ito M. Katsuta Y. Imamoto Y. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 915-919Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown that rhodopsin can be regenerated with 6s-cis and 6s-trans-11-cis-retinal. Borhan and colleagues (29Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), employing a photolabeling approach using an 11-cis-locked analog similar to 1 but carrying a 3-diazo group on the β-ionone ring, identified Trp265 as being in close proximity to the β-ionone ring after photoactivation of the cross-linker (see Ref. 5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). Based on our studies, it now seems likely that the 3-diazochromophore analog also undergoes photoisomerization to give a mixture of isomers similar to1–4. Our modeling studies suggest that only two of these “locked” analogs (1 and 3) would cross-link with Trp265 on helix VI, whereas two others (2 and 4), resulting from β-ionone flipping, would position the diazo group away from Trp265. The full analysis of the cross-linking studies is complicated by the fact that stoichiometric cross-linking to Trp265 was not achieved and the likely possibility that all four chromophore analogs would be present after photolysis (29Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Upon illumination of another retinal analog that was photoisomerized to the all-transconfiguration, a clear movement of the chromophore ring was observed, resulting in cross-linking to Ala169 on helix IV (Fig.4 D). Photoisomerization of rhodopsin reconstituted with locked analogs of retinal but without activation provides additional evidence that changes in the polyene chain configuration and relocation of the C9 methyl group are insufficient for activation. This observation is also in agreement with an earlier finding that rhodopsin regenerated with an acyclic analog of retinal, lacking a functional β-ionone ring, is not activated upon illumination (30Jäger F. Jäger S. Krutle O. Friedman N. Sheves M. Hofmann K.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7389-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Gly121 is a contact residue with the C9 methyl of the chromophore (31Han M. Groesbeek M. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the x-ray structure shows that Gly121 is more than 4 Å away from the chromophore (Fig. 4, B and C). However, Gly121 could affect packing of residues in the active site in such a way that when Gly121 is replaced by other amino acids and 11-cis-retinal by analogs containing 9-aliphatic group larger than methyl, this raises the dark activity of rhodopsin depending on the position 121 side chain size and the size of the C9 substituent of the retinal (31Han M. Groesbeek M. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The C9methyl group is, however, essential for complete and efficient transformation of rhodopsin from the early photoproduct to the activated form (32Ganter U.M. Schmid E.D. Perez-Sala D. Rando R.R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5954-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Meyer C.K. Bohme M. Ockenfels A. Gartner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation can be explained by less constrained fitting of 9-demethyl-all-trans-retinal into the 11-cis-retinylidene binding site compared with all-trans-retinal (data not shown). Based on this and previous work, it appears that photoisomerization of the 11-cis-chromophore to the all-trans configuration causes a twist of the chromophore within the 11-cis-retinylidene binding pocket (intermediates known as Photo and Batho) (Fig. 4 C). Our results suggest that in the next stage, cis-trans isomerization causes repositioning of the β-ionone ring which ultimately determines the fate of the receptor activation states. If the photoisomerized chromophore is in an extended conformation, this repositioning of the β-ionone ring is followed by reorganization of transmembrane helix III, and subsequently helix VI (residues 244–276) moves away from H-III (termed Lumi and MI rhodopsins, respectively). This new position of the β-ionone ring initiates, in turn, a sequence of conformational changes (for summary, see Ref. 35Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) which produces the activated receptor (metarhodopsin II) (Fig. 4 D). These changes cause deprotonation of the chromophore Schiff base and concurrent protonation of Glu113, and changes on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin (35Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). If the photoisomerization occurs within the 11-cis-retinal binding site, like observed with the locked analogs, despite undergoing isomerization (as shown in this report; see also Ref. 36Sheves M. Albeck A. Ottolenghi M. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. De Grip W.J. Einterz C.M. Lewis J.W. Schaechter L.E. Kliger D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6440-6444Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), there is no (or marginal) activation (Fig. 5 and TableI). In addition, demonstrated plasticity of the binding site, in accommodating different cis conformers of retinal (Fig.4 D), provides an explanation for the ability to regenerate rhodopsin with drastically different chromophore isomers such as 11-cis-retinal, 9-cis-retinal, 7-cis-retinal, and several di-cisderivatives.

The extracellular domain of Lu gps contains a potential integrin binding site in the third IgSF domain as well as five N-glycosylation consensus motifs, one in the third domain and the others in the fourth domain. The 40 C-terminal residues of the Lu gp cytoplasmic tail carry three characteristic motifs involved in protein-protein interaction, polarization to plasma membrane, and intracellular signaling pathways (3Yu H.

In the present study, we further extended these studies by generating deletion mutants of the NH2 extracellular domain of Lu gps and mutants of the RGD and glycosylation motifs in order to better characterize the binding site and protein motifs involved in the interaction with human laminin. By the use of direct interaction biosensor assays and inhibition assays with a flow cytometer, we found that the first three N-terminal Ig-like domains are critical for interaction with laminin. Moreover, neither the RGD nor theN-glycosylation motifs of the third IgSF domain are involved in this interaction. Human K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Stable transfected K562 cells expressing Lub isoform were obtained as described (10El Nemer W. Gane P. Colin Y. Bony V. Rahuel C. Galactéros F. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. J. Biol.

Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant cDNAs encoding different extracellular domains of the Lu gp were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA GC-rich kit (CLONTECH) and the Lub cDNA in pcDNA3 vector as template (10El Nemer W.

The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned in the pIgplus vector (pIg-Tail Expression System; Ingenius; R & D Systems) and used for transient transfection of COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (ProFection mammalian transfection system, Promega). The transfected COS cells were grown 5 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with Glutamax-1 and immunoglobulin-depleted fetal calf serum. The cell culture supernatants containing the secreted Fc proteins were applied to a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the Lu-Fc proteins were eluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant Fc protein concentrations were assessed by colorimetric assay using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and the integrity of the preparations was checked by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with silver nitrate. Biosensor studies were performed on a Biacore X instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All experiments were performed at 25 °C using an HBS buffer, comprising 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA. Rabbit anti-human Fc (Pierce) was diluted in a 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and covalently coupled to a CM-5 or to an F1 biosensor chip by amine coupling, using an amino coupling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lu-Fc and Fc control proteins were diluted in HBS buffer and coupled to the anti-human Fc antibody. Typically, a coupling level of 200–400 and 10–20 response units (RU) were used for mapping and kinetic analyses, respectively. Different concentrations of immunopurified laminin-10/11 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or control fibronectin and merosin (laminin-2) proteins were injected over the coupled Lu-Fc surface as well as a control protein surface (ICAM-4-Fc) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A 25 mmNaOH solution was used for regeneration of the immobilized surface between different Lu-Fc injections. Sensorgrams obtained for the Fc control protein were systematically subtracted from those obtained for Lu-Fc proteins. For kinetic analysis, a range of six different laminin concentrations were injected (5, 8, 10, 16, 20, and 30 nm) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min with an Rmax not exceeding 100 RU. Affinity constants were estimated by curve fitting using BIA Evaluation 3.0 software assuming a 1:1 binding model. In another series of experiments, laminin-2 and laminin-10/11 were diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 3.3, and covalently coupled (9,000–10,000 RU) to flow cells FC1 and FC2, respectively, of a CM-5 biosensor chip by amine coupling using an amino coupling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lu-Fc and Fc control proteins were diluted in the HBS buffer and injected over the laminin covered surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Sensorgrams obtained for laminin-10/11 were subtracted from those obtained for laminin-2. Laminin binding inhibition assay using secreted chimeric Lu-Fc fragment was performed as follows. 500-ng aliquots of laminin were incubated with different dilutions of the Lu-Fc fragment or a control Fc fragment for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The suspensions were then added to 5 × 105 K562 cells expressing the Lub isoform and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-laminin monoclonal antibody (anti-A chain) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech, Marseille, France) for 20 min at 4 °C. After another washing step, 0.1 ng of TO-PRO-1 iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added, and positive cells (dead cells) were excluded from analysis. Sequences of the five IgSF domains were searched against the SMART domain data base (21Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) for alignment against V-set and C2-set profiles. The Protein Data Bank was also searched using PSI-BLAST (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Mizuguchi, manuscript in preparation. for predicting the Lu domain's secondary structures relative to experimentally solved structures of Ig-like domains. Homology modeling of Lu IgSF domain 3 was performed using one of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 C2 domain (Protein Data Bank identifier 1EV2, chain E, position 150–254) as template with the Modeller4 program (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10537) Google Scholar). The interaction of the common extracellular region of Lu and Lu(v13) gps with laminin was first analyzed by plasmon resonance experiments using a Biacore X instrument. This region of 518 amino acids is organized in five IgSF domains, noted Lu12345 thereafter. The sequence coding for Lu12345 was fused to that coding for the Fc fragment of a human IgG, and the soluble chimeric Lu-Fc fusion protein was expressed in COS-7 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). After purification on Protein A-Sepharose, the chimeric polypeptide migrated as an expected single band of 106 kDa (Fig.1). For biosensor assays, the rabbit anti-human Fc antibody was immobilized directly to a carboxylated dextran matrix chip, and the Lu12345-Fc fusion protein was captured on the matrix and tested for interaction with laminin. As shown in Fig.2, protein laminin 10/11 bound to Lu12345-Fc in a dose-responsive fashion in the range of 5–30 nm laminin. The specificity of the binding interaction was determined by showing that laminin did not bind to the immobilized adhesion molecule ICAM-4-Fc, which contains two IgSF domains (23Sali A. Blundell T.L.

In further control experiments, it was found that neither laminin-2 (α2β1γ1) nor fibronectin at 20 nm bind to either immobilized Lu12345-Fc or ICAM-4-Fc fusion proteins (data not shown). For kinetic analysis, small amounts of Lu12345-Fc were captured on the anti-human Fc surface in order to not exceed an Rmax of 50–100 RU when injecting saturating concentrations of laminin. After injecting a range of six different concentrations (5, 8, 10, 16, 20, and 30 nm), kinetic analysis revealed that Lu12345-Fc bound laminin with high affinity, with a dissociation equilibrium constantKD of 10.8 nm (kinetic constantka = 2.45 × 106m−1 s−1). This value correlates well with recently reported independent studies (6Parsons S.F. Lee G. Spring F.A. Willing T.N. Peters L.L. Gimm J.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. Anstee D. Chasis J.

Ekblom P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since α5 chain is present only in laminin 10 and 11 isoforms (27Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D.

Le van Kim C. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it was postulated that Lu gps bind to laminin-10/11 via the specific α5 chain (Ref. 6Parsons S.F. Lee G. Spring F.A. Willing T.N. Peters L.L. Gimm J.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. Anstee D. Chasis J. Blood. 2001; 97: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and this report), which is also in agreement with other studies showing that sickle red blood cells adhere to laminin-10/11 isoforms (29Lee S.P. Cunningham M.L. Hines P.C. Joneckis C.C. Orringer E.P. Parise L.V. Blood. 1998; 92: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the laminin α5 chain is expressed in bone marrow and by several developing epithelial cells, and a majority of epithelial cells might use laminin-10 rather than laminin-1 as an adhesive protein in vivo (26Ferletta M. Ekblom P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gu Y. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Hjalt T. Jonsson J.I. Ekblom M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the IgSF domain(s) that interact(s) with laminin-10/11, 11 IgSF domain deletions (three small deletions of five amino acids and two single amino acid mutants) were generated and expressed as Fc fusion proteins. The schematic structure of these mutants is shown on Fig. 3. To generate entire domain removal, deletion sites were chosen in the interdomain sequences deduced from the putative structure of the Lu gp (1Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5496-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Lu12345-Fc protein containing the five extracellular IgSF domains was used as a positive control when analyzing the interaction between the different mutated proteins and laminin-10/11. The four deletion constructs Lu1234-Fc, Lu123-Fc, Lu12-Fc, and Lu1-Fc were first analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), and among these, we found that only Lu1234-Fc and Lu123-Fc bound to laminin (Fig.4 A). The lack of interaction between laminin and Lu1-Fc and Lu12-Fc proteins was not due to defective chimeras, since these proteins were able to bind to monoclonal antibody LM342, which recognizes the Lubepitope localized in the first IgSF domain in Biacore experiments (data not shown). Kinetic analysis also revealed that Lu123-Fc and Lu12345-Fc had similar binding affinity for laminin 10/11 (KD = 9.8 nm versus 10.8 nm), and this result, together with those reported above, suggests that the laminin binding site(s) of Lu gps includes the third IgSF domain and that domains 4 and 5 neither enhance nor decrease laminin binding affinity. Accordingly, deletion mutants Lu4-Fc, Lu5-Fc, and Lu45-Fc did not bind to laminin 10/11 (Fig. 3 and 4 A).Figure 4Binding of laminin-10/11 to Lu-Fc mutants coupled to an anti-Fc antibody immobilized on the surface of a plasmon resonance sensor chip. A rabbit anti-human Fc antibody was immobilized (8,000 RU) on a carboxylated dextran matrix chip before coupling ICAM-4/LW-Fc (280 RU) and Lu-Fc mutants (200–300 RU) in flow cells FC1 and FC2, respectively. Laminin-10/11 was injected at 20 nm over the recombinant Fc protein surfaces at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Curves represent subtracted sensorgramms (FC2 − FC1) normalized as to the base line of 0 RU. A, proteins Lu1-, Lu12-, Lu13-, Lu3-, Lu23-, Lu1245-, Lu-4, Lu5-, and Lu45-Fc did not bind laminin, whereas those containing intact IgSF domains 1, 2, and 3 (Lu123- and Lu1234-Fc) bind similarly to the wild type protein Lu12345. B, LuN321A- and LuR292A-Fc bind laminin as the intact chimera Lu12345, whereas proteins Lu-ΔLNVNL-, Lu-ΔRVEDY-, and Lu-ΔPSPEY-Fc exhibit abnormal binding curves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results are in general agreement with a recent study published when this work was being written (6Parsons S.F. Lee G. Spring F.A. Willing T.N. Peters L.L. Gimm J.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. Anstee D. Chasis J. Blood. 2001; 97: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, our studies further extended this analysis, since a panel of nine other Lu chimeras carrying different Ig domain deletions, small deletions, and single point mutations into IgSF domain 3 (see Fig. 3) were investigated. The laminin binding capacity of Lu123-Fc but not of Lu12-Fc constructs pointed to the important role of domain 3 of Lu gp for ligand binding. To confirm this result, we first generated a mutant protein lacking domain 3 only. As shown in Fig. 4 A, this Lu1245-Fc chimera did not bind to laminin-10/11. To test whether the N-glycan of domain 3 is important for laminin binding, asparagine 321 was mutated into alanine to abolish the unique potentialN-glycosylation site of the first three IgSF domains, which is well exposed at the beginning of strand E according to the structural model proposed in Fig.5 B. The LuN321A-Fc construct directed the synthesis of a soluble protein with an apparent molecular mass of 103 kDa versus 106 kDa for the wild type protein (Fig. 1). This indicates that the Asn321 glycosylation site is used, and the loss of about 3 kDa is compatible with the removal of a single N-glycan chain. Arginine 292 belonging to a potential RGD integrin binding site of domain 3 was also mutated into alanine (construct LuR292A-Fc), since the RGD motif is commonly involved in cell adhesion and is crucial for some integrin binding and for the binding of many proteins to cells, such as fibronectin and transferrin to their cognate receptors (31Ruoslahti E. Tumour Biol. 1996; 17: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Dubljevic V. Sali A. Goding J.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 B, the sensorgram of the interaction between laminin-10/11 and LuN321A-Fc and LuR292A-Fc constructs was similar to that obtained with Lu12345-Fc, indicating that neither N-glycosylation nor the RGD motif of domain 3 were involved in the interaction with laminin 10/11. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that the mouse homologue of Lu gp binds human laminin but does not contain any RGD motif (6Parsons S.F. Lee G. Spring F.A. Willing T.N. Peters L.L. Gimm J.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. Anstee D. Chasis J. Blood. 2001; 97: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Rahuel C. Colin Y. Goossens D. Gane P. El Nemer W. Cartron J.P. Le van Kim C. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, as shown on the model of the Lu IgSF domain 3 structure (Fig. 5 B), the RGD sequence is not included in a loop, as observed for fibronectin RGD sequence (33Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar) but lies extended in the C-terminal part of strand βB, just after the cysteine residue implicated in disulfide bonding with the strand βF cysteine, and therefore has a different presentation as compared with canonical RGD. Next, three different small deletions of five amino acids were introduced into the third IgSF domain of the Lu12345-Fc protein (see Fig. 3). All deleted amino acids are conserved between human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 5 A). These are predicted to be localized in three regions included in distinct secondary structures, namely the B-C loop and the beginning of the C strand (Lu ΔPSPEY-Fc), the F strand (Lu ΔRVEDY-Fc), and the D strand and the beginning of the D-E loop (LuΔLNVNL-Fc) (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 4 B, these small deletions within domain 3 drastically alter the association and dissociation curves and reduce the laminin binding property of the extracellular region of the Lu gps. Disruptions of regular secondary structures in which these segments participate and the nonobservance of geometrical constraints probably impede the correct folding of domain 3. It is also worth noting that two of the deleted segments (ΔPSPEY-Fc and ΔRVEDY-Fc) contain two amino acids (underlined Y and V, respectively) whose positions are always occupied by hydrophobic amino acids in the multiple alignment of C2 domains and are buried within three-dimensional structures (data not shown). These amino acids are therefore predicted to be essential to the maintenance of the IgSF fold, and their absence would thus drastically impair the correct folding of domain 3. Although these results confirm the importance of the third domain, it could not be concluded whether domain 3 alone, albeit critical, was sufficient for laminin binding. Indeed, it is often observed that the combination of several IgSF domains is necessary for interaction with partners, as discussed below. To further address this issue, a mutant protein containing only domain 3 (Lu3-Fc) was generated. As shown in Fig.4 A, Lu3-Fc did not bind to laminin-10/11 even when large amounts of laminin were injected, indicating that the third IgSF domain of Lu gps is necessary but not sufficient to mediate laminin-10/11 binding. Together with the positive binding of Lu123-Fc to laminin, these results indicated that domain 1 and/or 2 may also play a role in the interaction process. To find out whether the interaction involves domain 1 or 2, Lu13-Fc and Lu23-Fc chimeras were generated, but none of these two chimeras were found to bind to laminin-10/11 (Fig.4 A). To confirm these results, we performed a reverse series of biosensor assays in which laminin-10/11 was covalently coupled to the sensor chip, and several dilutions of Lu-Fc chimeras were injected. Laminin-2 was used as a negative control. Lu12345-Fc, Lu1234-Fc, Lu123-Fc, LuN321A-Fc, and LuR292A-Fc showed typical specific binding curves with laminin-10/11, whereas the other Lu-Fc chimeras did not bind to the immobilized laminin (data not shown). Previous adhesion and flow cytometric analyses have shown that K562 cells expressing Lu gps bind laminin (9Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10El Nemer W. Gane P. Colin Y. Bony V. Rahuel C. Galactéros F. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16686-16693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and that the Lu12345-Fc chimera protein dose-responsively inhibited the laminin-Lu gp interaction (10El Nemer W. Gane P. Colin Y. Bony V. Rahuel C. Galactéros F. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16686-16693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To further confirm the BIAcore results (see above), we have used the different Lu-Fc chimeras to inhibit the interaction of laminin with K562.Lu cells. Increasing amounts of each recombinant protein were preincubated with 500 ng of laminin-10/11 prior to the binding assay with K562.Lu cells. Among all the mutated proteins, only Lu123-Fc, Lu1234-Fc, LuN321A-Fc, and LuR292A-Fc molecules dose-responsively inhibited the binding of laminin to K562.Lu cells, as did the control Lu12345-Fc protein (Fig.6). More than 80% inhibition was obtained with 10 pm of these mutated constructs. The inhibition assays largely confirm the BIAcore results and indicated again that laminin binding to K562.Lu cells requires the three first Ig-like domains of Lu gp. All these results suggested that the interaction between laminin-10/11 and Lu gps involves sequences present in the three extracellular domains 1, 2, and 3, which might be arranged together so that they provide a specific interaction surface. Lu gps share sequence similarities with cell adhesion molecules belonging to the IgSF (e.g. neural cell adhesion molecule, axonin, etc.), which are similarly organized (i.e. with an N-terminal string of IgSF domains (5 and 6 for neural cell adhesion molecule and axonin, respectively). Interestingly, the first four IgSF domains of axonin (this is also true for hemolin) adopt a U-shaped arrangement, forming a compact four-domain module with contacts between domains 1 and 4 and between domains 2 and 3 (34Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By analogy, as the IgSF domain 4 of Lu gp does not appear critical for laminin binding (see Fig. 4 A), it is suggested that the first three IgSF domains of Lu gp could constitute a three-domain module having a specific spatial arrangement with domains 1–3 playing a key role in the interaction properties. Similarly, the interaction between laminin and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule apparently requires the first two IgSF domains only (35Zen Q. Riddle M.E. Fong A.M. Patel D.D. Paulsen D.M. Truskey G. Telen M.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (Abstr. 171): A1360Google Scholar). Independently, two groups have reported the characterization of the laminin binding site on the fifth (19Zen Q. Cottman M.

Here, we have shown by two different techniques, using purified chimeric proteins and Lu-expressing cells, that the N-terminal domains 1–3 are critical for laminin-10/11 interaction, since neither domain 1, domains 1 + 2, domain 3, domains 1 + 3, nor domains 2 + 3 were able to mediate laminin interaction. In addition, the present study demonstrates that the structural integrity of the IgSF domain 3 is necessary for laminin-10/11 interaction and that neither N-glycosylation nor RGD motifs of this domain were involved in laminin-10/11 binding. Our results and those recently reported (6Parsons S.F. Lee G. Spring F.A. Willing T.N. Peters L.L. Gimm J.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. Anstee D. Chasis J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 728-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that have assigned the laminin binding domain to the fifth IgSF domain of Lu gp. Although different techniques of investigation have been used, and much fewer mutants analyzed compared with the present report, the reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but we cannot exclude the possibility that Lu gps may have two distinct binding sites for laminin. Further investigation should document the critical residues of Lu gps involved in laminin interaction and reciprocally those involved in the laminin α5 chain counterpart more precisely. This information may be useful to develop inhibitors that block the Lu-laminin interaction and may reduce the increased adhesion of sickle red cells to laminin, which is suspected to contribute to vaso-occlusion in patients (16Wick T.W.

https://openalex.org/W2041171856,"Generation of the amyloid peptide through proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. The highly elusive β-secretase was recently identified as a transmembrane aspartic proteinase, Asp2 (BACE). The Asp2 homolog Asp1 (BACE2/DRAP) has also been reported to exhibit β-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Most aspartic proteinases are generated as inactive proenzymes, requiring removal of the prodomain to generate active proteinase. Here we show that prodomain processing of Asp1 occurs between Leu62 and Ala63 and is autocatalytic. Asp1 cleaved a maltose-binding protein-Asp1 prodomain fusion protein and a synthetic peptide at this site. Mutation of one of the conserved catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of Asp1 to asparagine (D110N) abolished this cleavage. Mutation of P1′ and P2′ residues in the substrate to phenylalanine reduced cleavage at this site. Asp1 expressed in cells was the mature form, and prodomain processing occurred intramolecularly within the endoplasmic reticulum/early Golgi. Interestingly, a proportion of mature Asp1 was expressed on the cell surface. When full-length Asp1(D110N) was expressed in COS-7 cells, it was not processed, suggesting that no other proteinase can activate Asp1 in these cells. Generation of the amyloid peptide through proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. The highly elusive β-secretase was recently identified as a transmembrane aspartic proteinase, Asp2 (BACE). The Asp2 homolog Asp1 (BACE2/DRAP) has also been reported to exhibit β-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Most aspartic proteinases are generated as inactive proenzymes, requiring removal of the prodomain to generate active proteinase.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 565-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Asp2 mRNA is abundant in the brain, and overexpression of Asp2 in cultured cells results in an increase in the level of β-secretase-derived soluble APP and intracellular C-terminal fragments. An increase in the level of secreted amyloid β-peptide has also been observed in cells overexpressing Asp2. In addition, Asp2 colocalizes with APP within intracellular Golgi compartments, where β-secretase cleavage is known to occur (10Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The homolog of Asp2, Asp1 (BACE2), has also been identified (11Saunders A.J. Kim T.-W. Tanzi R.E.

Like all aspartic proteinases, Asp1 and Asp2 are generated as proenzymes; and in most cases, removal of the prodomain is required to produce mature active enzyme. Therefore, an analysis of the mechanism of prodomain cleavage and the identification of the protease(s) that catalyze this event are essential for further understanding of the amyloidogenic cascade. Clearly, any upstream activating proteinases could represent novel therapeutic targets through which APP processing might be modulated. Recently, it has been reported that activation of Asp2 is mediated by furin or a furin-like enzyme that recognizes the RXXR motif immediately upstream of the prodomain cleavage site (20Bennett B.D.

Having previously shown that prodomain processing in Asp1 occurs between residues Leu62 and Ala63(13Hussain I. Powell D.J. Howlett D.R. Chapman G.A. Gilmour L. Murdock P.M. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Schneider K. Ratcliffe S.J. Tattersall D. Testa T.T. Southan C. Ryan D.M. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we aimed in this study to determine whether this is an intra- or intermolecular event and to identify any enzyme(s) that could mediate this cleavage. Asp1 (base pairs 61–276) and Asp2 (base pairs 64–225) fragments spanning the prodomain cleavage site (Ala21–Tyr91) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, in which the reverse oligonucleotide encoded a His6 tag followed by a termination codon at the 3′-end. The fragments were cloned in frame to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence at the BamHI/HindIII sites in pMal2c (New England Biolabs, Inc.) to generate MBP-Asp1pro-His6and MBP-Asp2pro-His6. Sequences were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. Generation of the Asp1-Fc/Signal pIgPlus construct has been described previously (13Hussain I. Powell D.J. Howlett D.R. Chapman G.A. Gilmour L. Murdock P.M. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Schneider K. Ratcliffe S.J. Tattersall D. Testa T.T. Southan C. Ryan D.M. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Asp2-Fc construct was generated by subcloning the Asp2 cDNA (base pairs 61–1359) into the HindIII/XhoI sites in the Signal pIgPlus vector (R&D Systems). Mutant constructs and the MBP-Asp1 prodomain construct terminating at the prodomain cleavage site were generated by QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and sequenced. Asp1-Fc and Asp2-Fc were expressed in COS-7 cells and purified from the culture medium as described previously (13Hussain I. Powell D.J. Howlett D.R. Chapman G.A. Gilmour L. Murdock P.M. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Schneider K. Ratcliffe S.J. Tattersall D. Testa T.T. Southan C. Ryan D.M. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The MBP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Briefly, protein expression was induced in 800 ml of LB medium with 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 10 min and lysed by sonication in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg of lysozyme, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with amylose resin (5 ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The amylose resin was packed into a disposable column and washed twice with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions (1 ml) containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. MBP fusion proteins (2.5 μg) were incubated with Asp1-Fc or Asp2-Fc (25 nm) in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5–6.5) in a final volume of 60 μl at 37 °C, and an aliquot (12 μl) was removed at the indicated times. An equal volume of gel sample buffer was added to terminate the reaction, and samples were analyzed on 8% Tris/glycine gels (Novex). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cleavage assays were set up as described above. 10–30 μl of the incubation solutions were purified using 10-μl pipette tips loaded with a C18 resin (ZipTip, Millipore Corp.) employing the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. For MALDI-MS analysis, peptides were directly eluted from the ZipTip on to the MALDI plate with matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in water/acetonitrile (2:1) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). For Nanospray MS analysis, peptides were eluted from the ZipTip using water/acetonitrile (1:1) containing 5% formic acid. The eluate was immediately loaded into a Nanospray microcapillary (type N, Protana, Odense, Denmark). MALDI-time-of-flight-MS was performed on a TofSpec SE instrument (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Nanospray MS and MS/MS experiments were performed on an orthogonal acceleration quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass) equipped with a Z-spray ion source for Nanospray analysis. Peptide ADGLALALEPALAK(Ahx-dnp)G (50 μm) was incubated with Asp1-Fc or Asp2-Fc (50 nm) in 50 mm sodium acetate and 20 mm NaCl (pH 4.5) for 2 h in a final assay volume of 30 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 volumes of 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The assay components were loaded onto a Poros R1 column (Applied Biosystems) in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile over 15 min). The chromogenic dnp group on the full-length peptide and carboxyl terminus-derived cleavage products was followed by monitoring at 360 nm. Amino terminus-derived products are not detected at 360 nm due to loss of the dnp group. To determine the Km, reactions contained 10 nm enzyme and increasing substrate concentrations. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and the amount of peptide cleaved was determined by HPLC as described above. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraFit Version 4.09. Incubations with inhibitory peptides were carried out as described above following preincubation of Asp1-Fc with 10 μm MBP-tagged Asp1 prodomain peptide or 1 μm APP β-secretase inhibitorH-Lys-Thr-Glu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Stat-Val-Ala-Glu-Phe-OH (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 30 min. COS-7 cells overexpressing APP751 carrying the Swedish mutation (K651N/M652L) were transiently transfected with Asp1mycHis6/pcDNA3.1 or mutant Asp1(D110N)MycHis6/pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h post-transfection, cells were grown at the indicated temperatures or in the presence of brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) or monensin (20 μm) for 16 h, after which time cell lysates were generated as described previously (4Hussain I.

Proteins in the cell lysates were deglycosylated by treatment withN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were resolved on Tris/glycine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) for Western blot analysis using an anti-His6 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (4Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell.

COS-7 cells overexpressing APP751 carrying the Swedish mutation were transiently transfected with Asp1mycHis6/pcDNA3.1. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline prior to incubation with EZ-linkTM sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Perbio Science UK Ltd.) at 0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm glycine and harvested for lysis as described previously (4Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Cell-surface biotinylated proteins were purified using streptavidin-agarose and eluted in gel sample buffer. Samples were resolved on Tris/glycine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-His6 antibody, antibody WO2 raised against amino acids 1–16 of the amyloid β-peptide domain of APP (4Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), or with anti-KDEL antibody (StressgenBiotech Corp.). To investigate prodomain processing of Asp1, we generated a recombinant MBP-Asp1 prodomain fusion protein that encodes MBP fused to Asp1 (amino acids 21–91) encompassing the prodomain cleavage site, with a His6 tag at the C terminus (MBP-Asp1pro-His6) (Fig.1 a). Modeling studies using the published sequence of Asp1 (BACE2) and sequence alignments were used to define the limits of the prodomain. The MBP-Asp1pro-His6 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using amylose resin. Purified MBP-Asp1pro-His6 migrated as a doublet of ∼51 kDa on gels (Fig. 1 b) and was immunoreactive with both an anti-MBP and an anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 1 c). We have shown by N-terminal sequencing that both bands have the same MBP N terminus; hence, the difference in the two bands is most likely to be in the number of histidine residues at the C terminus. To confirm this, in-gel digestion of these two bands followed by peptide mass fingerprinting employing MALDI-time-of-flight-MS was performed. The results indicated that both bands correspond to the MBP-Asp1pro-His6 fusion protein. However, the N-terminal peptides as well as the His6-containing C-terminal peptides were not observed directly in the MALDI mass spectra. The failure to detect these peptides may have been caused by suppression effects known to occur in the MALDI analysis of digest mixtures (23Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A minor band of lower molecular mass (∼40 kDa) was also observed that was immunoreactive with the anti-MBP antibody, but not with the anti-His6 antibody, suggesting that it represents a truncated form of the substrate or free MBP. Cleavage of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 at the prodomain cleavage site (Leu↓Ala) is expected to generate two cleavage products, a large 47-kDa amino-terminal fragment and a small 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment. To determine if Asp1 or Asp2 can mediate cleavage at this site, MBP-Asp1pro-His6 was incubated with pure catalytically active Asp1 or Asp2, both expressed as soluble Fc fusion proteins (Fig. 1 d). Incubation of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 with Asp1-Fc resulted in a clear shift in the molecular mass of the prodomain substrate from ∼51 to ∼47 kDa (Fig. 2 a), consistent with cleavage at the predicted site and loss of the 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment, which was not detected. Western blot analysis showed that whereas MBP-Asp1pro-His6 was immunoreactive with both anti-MBP and anti-His6 antibodies, the 47-kDa cleavage product was immunoreactive only with the anti-MBP antibody due to loss of the C-terminal His6 tag following cleavage (Fig.2 c). MS analysis of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 incubated with Asp1-Fc was undertaken to detect the 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment. MALDI-MS revealed the presence of one major and two minor carboxyl-terminal peptides in the samples incubated Asp1-Fc that were absent from control samples. To define the cleavage sites, Nanospray MS/MS analysis of the three cleavage peptides was performed. MS/MS sequence data showed clearly that the bulk of the processing of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 occurred at the expected site, yielding the carboxyl-terminal peptide starting with ALEP (Fig. 2 d). In addition, MS/MS sequencing of the two minor peptides revealed cleavage of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 to yield carboxyl-terminal peptides beginning with LAMVD and AMVD (Fig. 2 d). The ability of Asp1 to mediate prodomain cleavage at the correct site in the context of a recombinant fusion protein suggests that in vivo, this proteinase may autoactivate, removing its prodomain to generate the mature enzyme. In contrast, cleavage of MBP-Asp1pro-His6 by Asp2 is very inefficient (Fig.2 a), suggesting that it is unlikely to activate Asp1in vivo. To determine whether the Asp2-Fc or Asp1-Fc fusion protein can process the Asp2 prodomain, we generated an MBP-Asp2pro-His6 fusion protein in which amino acids 22–66 of Asp2 were fused to MBP with a C-terminal His6 tag. This protein was also expressed inE. coli and purified using amylose resin. Incubation of this protein (∼49 kDa) with Asp1-Fc or Asp2-Fc did not result in a detectable shift in molecular mass (Fig. 2 b). Hence, in contrast to Asp1, prodomain cleavage of Asp2 is unlikely to be autocatalytic, and it does not appear to be mediated by Asp1. This result is consistent with reports suggesting that prodomain processing of Asp2 is mediated by another proteinase (20Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.-C. Citron M.

To determine the optimum pH profile for cleavage, MBP-Asp1pro-His6 was incubated with Asp1-Fc at pH 4.5, 5.5, or 6.5. Of the pH values tested, Asp1-Fc cleaved MBP-Asp1pro-His6 efficiently at pH 4.5, with 80% of the substrate converted into product within 30 min (Fig.3 b). At pH 5.5, cleavage was still evident, although only 24% of the substrate was converted to product within 30 min. At pH 6.5, cleavage was less efficient, with only 22% turnover of substrate within 30 min. The catalytic activity of aspartic proteinases is dependent on the presence of two aspartic acid residues in the active site. Hence, processing of MBP-Asp1pro-His6should be abolished if either of the catalytic aspartic acid residues in Asp1 is mutated. The first catalytic aspartic acid residue in Asp1-Fc was mutated to asparagine (D110N), and the protein was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified from the medium using protein A-Sepharose. In the cleavage assays, Asp1(D110N)-Fc was unable to cleave MBP-Asp1pro-His6 at the prodomain cleavage site since no shift in molecular mass was apparent (Fig. 3 a). N-terminal sequencing of mutant Asp1-Fc revealed that 100% of the protein still possessed its prodomain, whereas wild-type Asp1-Fc expressed in COS-7 cells was fully processed and had the amino-terminal sequence A63LEP (13Hussain I. Powell D.J. Howlett D.R. Chapman G.A. Gilmour L. Murdock P.M. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Schneider K. Ratcliffe S.J. Tattersall D. Testa T.T. Southan C. Ryan D.M. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the mutant Asp1(D110N)-Fc is not processed in COS-7 cells due to its inability to autoactivate. Phenylalanine scanning mutagenesis was conducted through the Asp1 prodomain cleavage site to determine the effect on prodomain processing. Residues P2–P2′ (ALAL) in MBP-Asp1pro-His6 were mutated individually to phenylalanine, and the purified mutant proteins were incubated with Asp1-Fc. Cleavage of the mutant MBP-Asp1pro-His6 substrates appeared to be as efficient as that of the wild-type substrate when expressed as the proportion of substrate cleaved (Fig. 3 c). However, MALDI-MS analysis of the 4-kDa cleavage product revealed that mutation of the P1′ and P2′ residues reduced the level of the peptide detected with the N-terminal sequence ALEP and increased the level of peptide detected with the N-terminal sequence LAMVD. In contrast, mutations at the P1 and P2positions had no effect on cleavage. This indicates that the active site of Asp1 is unable to accommodate large bulky residues at either the P1′ or P2′ position. We went on to determine whether Asp1 can cleave a synthetic peptide spanning the prodomain cleavage site of Asp1. Incubation of Asp1-Fc with peptide ADGLALALEPALAK(Ahx-dnp)G resulted in cleavage to give a single dnp-labeled product (Fig.4, a and b). MS analysis showed that this cleavage occurred at the predicted prodomain cleavage site, between Leu6 and Ala7. Asp2-Fc also cleaved the Asp1 prodomain peptide at this site, albeit poorly in comparison with Asp1-Fc (data not shown). An initial velocity plot of Asp1-Fc-mediated cleavage of the synthetic peptide with respect to substrate concentration is shown in Fig. 4 c, giving aKm at pH 4.5 of 197 ± 30 μm. To determine if the Asp1 prodomain has any inhibitory activity, assays were carried out in the presence of an MBP-tagged Asp1 prodomain peptide (residues 21–62). Preincubation of active Asp1-Fc (50 nm) with a 10 μm concentration of this peptide resulted in ∼16% inhibition of cleavage of synthetic Asp1 cleavage peptide under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). This contrasts with >50% inhibition of cleavage by 1 μm APP β-secretase inhibitor, indicating that the prodomain is a very weak inhibitor of Asp1. To determine if Asp1 autoactivates in vivo and to identify the intracellular compartment in which prodomain processing occurs, COS-7 cells overexpressing APP751 carrying the Swedish mutation (K651M/N652N) were transiently transfected with Asp1MycHis6 or mutant Asp1(D110N)MycHis6. To detect Asp1 proenzyme, transfected cells were grown at reduced temperatures, which have been shown to lead to the retention of proteins in different compartments of the secretory pathway (24Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were generated and subjected to deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F prior to Western blot analysis with the anti-His6 antibody. Untreated Asp1 migrated as a protein of ∼60 kDa (Fig.5 a, first lane) and, upon deglycosylation, exhibited a shift in mobility to a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa due to removal of the N-linked glycans (second lane). Deglycosylation and immunodetection of Asp1 in the cell lysate from cells grown at 15 °C, which inhibits the transit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, revealed two closely migrating bands of ∼50 and ∼54 kDa (Fig.5 a, third lane). The 54-kDa protein corresponds to the prodomain-containing form of Asp1, whereas the 50-kDa protein is the mature proteinase that lacks the prodomain. Hence, at low temperature, prodomain processing of Asp1 is reduced, resulting in the accumulation of the proenzyme. In contrast to wild-type Asp1, when Asp1(D110N)MycHis6 was deglycosylated, it migrated exclusively as the proenzyme of ∼54 kDa following growth at 37 and 15 °C (Fig. 5 a, fourth and fifth lanes). Thus, processing is abolished in the mutant enzyme. A further implication of this result (see below) is that, in these cells, there is no other enzyme that is capable of processing Asp1. The detection of mature as well as pro-Asp1 following growth at 15 °C (Fig. 5, a and b) suggests that processing can occur early in the secretory pathway. When cells were grown at 20 °C, which inhibits the transit of protein from thetrans-Golgi network to the cell surface (25Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), very little proenzyme accumulated (Fig. 5 b), implying that very little prodomain processing occurs in post-Golgi compartments. To further confirm the identity of the intracellular site where prodomain processing of Asp1 occurs, cells were grown in the presence of drugs known to interfere with the trafficking of proteins (Fig.5 b). Growth in the presence of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A, which causes a redistribution of proteins that normally reside in the Golgi into the ER (26Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), revealed the accumulation of both pro and mature forms of Asp1. In contrast, growth in the presence of the monovalent ionophore monensin, which disrupts late Golgi and endosomal functions (27Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused the accumulation of mature Asp1, but little proenzyme. Hence, the majority of prodomain processing of Asp1 does not occur in late Golgi/endosomal compartments, but rather in the ER/early Golgi compartments. The results described above for the processing of the active-site mutant enzyme indicate that no other intracellular proteinase is capable of cleaving the prodomain of Asp1 and that prodomain cleavage is an exclusively intramolecular event. To confirm this finding, Asp1(D110N)MycHis6 was coexpressed with untagged wild-type Asp1. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates with the anti-Asp1 C terminus antibody showed that expression of both Asp1 proteins was successful (Fig. 5 c, upper panel). If the cotransfected untagged Asp1 is able to cleave the prodomain of Asp1(D110N)MycHis6 intermolecularly, the mature form of this protein should now be detected with the anti-myc or anti-His6 antibody. However, Western blot analysis with the anti-His6 antibody revealed that Asp1(D110N)MycββHis6 still migrated as the proenzyme in these cells (Fig. 5 c,lower panel). Hence, prodomain processing of Asp1 occurs exclusively through an intramolecular reaction. Proportions of cellular APP and Asp2 have been shown to be present on the cell surface (28Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 29Yamazaki T. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To determine whether Asp1 is also expressed at the cell surface, we performed biotinylation experiments on COS-7 cells overexpressing APP751 carrying the Swedish mutation and transiently transfected with Asp1. Transfected cells were incubated with sulfosuccinimidobiotin to biotinylate the cell-surface proteins. Cell lysates were generated, and the biotinylated cell-surface proteins were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose. A significant level of total Asp1 was detected at the cell surface (Fig. 5 d,upper panel, lane 1). As a control, the cell-surface and intracellular cell extracts were also probed for APP, which is known to reside on the cell surface (28Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 29Yamazaki T. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and for the endoplasmic reticulum-localized chaperones Grp94 and Grp78 (31Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S.D. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with published data, we found that APP was present at the cell surface and intracellularly (Fig. 5 d, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins were detected only within the cell (lower panel, lane 2). To determine if Asp1 residing at the cell surface is the mature proteinase lacking the prodomain, the biotinylated cell extracts were deglycosylated withN-glycosidase F prior to incubation with streptavidin-agarose. Following deglycosylation, the biotinylated cell-surface Asp1 migrated at a molecular mass consistent with the mature form of the protein (Fig. 5 e, lane 1). Thus, prodomain processing of Asp1 occurs during its transit through the secretory pathway en route to the cell surface, and the protein expressed on the cell surface is the processed, potentially active form of the enzyme. However, prodomain processing is not a prerequisite for transit to the cell surface, as Asp1(D110N)mycHis6, which still possesses its prodomain, was also expressed at the cell surface (data not shown). All known aspartic proteinases are generated as proenzymes, requiring removal of the prodomain to generate mature proteinase (32Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although most aspartic proteinases such as pepsin and cathepsin E autoactivate upon acidification, others such as renin require a separate proteinase activity for prodomain cleavage. It has recently been reported that Asp2 does not autoactivate and that removal of its prodomain is mediated by furin or a furin-like enzyme (20Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We report that in contrast to Asp2, Asp1 is capable of autocatalytic activation, cleaving its prodomain to generate mature proteinase.In vitro, Asp1 cleaved both an MBP-Asp1 prodomain fusion protein and a synthetic peptide at the predicted prodomain cleavage site (Leu62↓Ala63 in full-length Asp1). This cleavage was abolished when one of the conserved aspartic acid residues in the active site of Asp1-Fc was mutated to asparagine. In addition, mutation of either the P1′ (Ala) or P2′ (Leu) residue in the MBP-Asp1 prodomain substrate to phenylalanine reduced cleavage at this site. The other cleavages observed when MBP-Asp1pro-His6 was incubated with Asp1-Fc are unlikely to be physiologically relevant, as Asp1-Fc secreted from cells had only one N-terminal sequence, A63LEP. In vivo, the majority of wild-type Asp1 expressed in cells was the mature form lacking the prodomain. However, when Asp1(D110N) was expressed in cells, the proenzyme accumulated, presumably due to its inability to autoactivate. Similarly, soluble Asp1(D110N)-Fc secreted from COS-7 cells still possessed the prodomain, whereas wild-type Asp1-Fc was fully processed. Prodomain processing of Asp1 occurred intramolecularly, as coexpression of Asp1(D110N) with full-length wild-type Asp1 did not result in prodomain processing of mutant Asp1. These observations indicate not only that prodomain cleavage is autocatalytic, but also that no other cellular activity can compensate for the lack of prodomain processing of the mutant Asp1(D110N) in these cells. Although we showed in vitro that Asp2 could cleave both MBP-Asp1pro-His6 and a synthetic peptide, cleavage was inefficient compared with Asp1, suggesting that Asp2 is unlikely to be a major Asp1-processing enzyme in vivo. In addition, we showed in cultured cells that autoactivation of Asp1 occurred in the ER/early Golgi. Mature Asp1 was observed in cells following growth at 15 °C or in the presence of brefeldin A. This is in contrast to prodomain processing of Asp2, which is dependent upon an enzyme that resides in the trans-Golgi network (20Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.-C. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37712-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Autocatalytic activity of aspartic proteinases is known to be induced by acidic conditions (32Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although the pH of the ER/early Golgi compartment is only mildly acidic at pH ∼6.5 (33Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 6803-6808Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated in vitro that Asp1 exhibited activity at this pH, which may be sufficient to allow prodomain processing in vivo. The prodomain of Asp1 did not exhibit any significant inhibitory activity in vitro, suggesting that the prodomain may be required for proper folding of the protein, as has been reported for Asp2 (35Shi X.-P. Chen E. Yin K.-C. Na S. Garsky V.M. Lai M.-T. Li Y.-M. Platchek M. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Tang M.-J. Thiebeau J. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10366-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To conclude, prodomain processing of Asp1 and Asp2 is clearly very different; Asp1 autoactivates upon acidification, whereas Asp2 requires a separate enzymatic activity to cleave its prodomain. The autocatalytic nature of Asp1 suggests a less stringent regulation of its activity compared with Asp2. However, it is feasible that other intracellular factors exist that influence the activity of Asp1.

https://openalex.org/W1963554504,"Abstract Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are membrane-anchored heterodimers on the surface of antigen-presenting cells that bind the T cell receptor, initiating a cascade of interactions that results in antigen-specific activation of clonal populations of T cells. Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is associated with certain MHC class II haplotypes, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR2. Two DRB chains, DRB5*0101 and DRB1*1501, are co-expressed in the HLA-DR2 haplotype, resulting in the formation of two functional cell surface heterodimers, HLA-DR2a (DRA*0101, DRB5*0101) and HLA-DR2b (DRA*0101, DRB1*1501). Both isotypes can present an immunodominant peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP-(84–102)) to MBP-specific T cells from multiple sclerosis patients. We have previously demonstrated that the peptide binding/T cell recognition domains of rat MHC class II (α1 and β1 domains) could be expressed as a single exon for structural and functional characterization; Burrows, G. G., Chang, J. W., Bachinger, H.-P., Bourdette, D. N., Wegmann, K. W., Offner, H., and Vandenbark A. A. (1999) Protein Eng.12, 771–778; Burrows, G. G., Adlard, K. L., Bebo, B. F., Jr., Chang, J. W., Tenditnyy, K., Vandenbark, A. A., and Offner, H. (2000) J. Immunol. 164, 6366–6371). Single-chain human recombinant T cell receptorligands (RTLs) of ∼200 amino acid residues derived from HLA-DR2b were designed using the same principles and have been produced in Escherichia coli with and without amino-terminal extensions containing antigenic peptides. Structural characterization using circular dichroism predicted that these molecules retained the antiparallel β-sheet platform and antiparallel α-helices observed in the native HLA-DR2 heterodimer. The proteins exhibited a cooperative two-state thermal unfolding transition, and DR2-derived RTLs with a covalently linked MBP peptide (MBP-(85–99)) showed increased stability to thermal unfolding relative to the empty DR2-derived RTLs. These novel molecules represent a new class of small soluble ligands for modulating the behavior of T cells and provide a platform technology for developing potent and selective human diagnostic and therapeutic agents for treatment of autoimmune disease."

The membrane domain consists of 10 transmembrane segments, M1–M10, whose secondary structure is mainly α-helical (4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

M1–M4 and M5 extend into a large cytoplasmic “head” containing the ATP binding site and the catalytic center for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The two high affinity Ca2+ binding sites are located in the membrane domain, and side chain and backbone oxygen atoms in M4–M6 and M8 serve as Ca2+ ligands (4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J.

Furthermore, acidic residues in the cytoplasmic loop connecting M6 and M7 (L67) seem to play a role in determining the Ca2+binding properties of the enzyme, possibly by directing the calcium ions toward the liganding residues in the membrane (7Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Many more residues in the membrane and at the boundary between the cytoplasmic and membrane sectors could be of importance for the recognition and binding of Ca2+, since the pathway for migration of the calcium ions between the cytoplasm and the membrane-embedded ligands is unknown.The specific inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases thapsigargin is of interest in relation to the understanding of the structure-function relationships of enzyme-Ca2+ interaction, since it has been shown to prevent high affinity Ca2+ binding (8Inesi G. Sagara Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor may bind preferentially to a preexisting enzyme form with low affinity for Ca2+ (E2 state) and stabilize this form, or it may interact more directly with the Ca2+binding pocket or with the gateway to this pocket. In studies of chimeric proteins made up from parts of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and the thapsigargin-insensitive Na+,K+-ATPase, we previously demonstrated that transmembrane segment M3 of the Ca2+-ATPase contains residues of crucial importance to thapsigargin inhibition (10Nørregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of more discrete chimeric changes later indicated that the NH2-terminal half of M3 is the more critical part with respect to thapsigargin sensitivity (11Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a conserved phenylalanine in this region, Phe256, was shown to undergo spontaneous mutations in cultured cells under selection pressure in the presence of thapsigargin (12Yu M.

The residues Glu309 and Gly310 in the Ca2+ binding part of transmembrane segment M4 have also been shown to be important to thapsigargin sensitivity (6Andersen J.P. Biosci.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe present study reveals the importance of transmembrane segment M3 of the Ca2+-ATPase for the kinetics of Ca2+interaction at the cytoplasmically facing sites and for the major conformational changes and the dephosphorylation of the enzyme.The data in Figs. 8 and 9 directly demonstrate that the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the Ca2 E1 form is enhanced relative to wild type in mutants A and F and reduced in mutant B. Furthermore, as explained below, the reduced apparent affinity of mutant B for Ca2+ seen in the steady-state phosphorylation experiment in Fig. 3 A indicates that in this mutant there is a substantial reduction of the rate of Ca2+ binding as well.The changes in the maximum steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate, seen in Fig. 2, can be explained by the mutational effects on theE1P to E2P transition and the dephosphorylation of E2P. In the wild-type enzyme, the E1P to E2P transition is one of the major rate-limiting steps for ATP hydrolysis under the experimental conditions corresponding to Fig. 2 (27Champeil P. le Maire M. Andersen J.P. Guillain F. Gingold M. Lund S. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16372-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, in mutants A and B there seems to be a nearly perfect match between the decrease in the steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate and the decrease in the E1P toE2P transition rate (both being reduced to approximately one-third in mutant A and two-thirds in mutant B, relative to wild type). The conspicuous reduction of the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P observed for mutants C and D should make the dephosphorylation rate-limiting for ATP hydrolysis in these mutants, and very low rates of ATP hydrolysis were indeed found. Furthermore, the slightly enhanced maximum steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis seen for mutant F in Fig. 2 is in accordance with the enhanced E1P toE2P transition rate of this mutant. The reason that the steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate has increased much less than the E1P to E2P transition rate could be that due to the right shift of the Ca2+activation curve (Fig. 3) the phosphorylation reaction of mutant F is not yet fully activated at the Ca2+ concentration where Ca2+ inhibition of the E1P toE2P transition starts to take place.Our data indicate a local segregation of the functional effects of the mutations along M3, with the NH2-terminal half being important for the interaction with Ca2+ and theE1P to E2P transition, and the COOH-terminal (lumen near) half being particularly important for the dephosphorylation of E2P. The dephosphorylation block caused by mutations C and D is similar to that seen for certain point mutations in the transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6 (6Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and demonstrates a long range functional interaction between the membranous parts of the enzyme and the catalytic site in the cytoplasmic domain. It is possible that the dephosphorylation block is mediated through a change in the position of M4, since some of the residues replaced in mutants C and D are in rather close contact with M4 residues in the wild-type enzyme (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar).The finding that the apparent affinity for Ca2+ is lower in mutant B than in mutant A at 25 °C (Fig. 3 A), although the rate of Ca2+ dissociation is about 20-fold lower in mutant B compared with mutant A under the same conditions (Fig. 8), calls for some explanation. Furthermore, it is not straightforward to understand the higher apparent cooperativity (Hill number) of mutant A relative to the wild type that makes the curves intersect in Fig. 3 A, or the reversal of the apparent Ca2+ affinities of mutants A and B occurring when the temperature is lowered to 0 °C (Fig. 3 B). These problems encouraged us to perform a series of computations of the predicted relationship between the Ca2+ concentration and the phosphorylation level, using the software SimZyme described under “Experimental Procedures.” In TableII is shown theK0.5 value and the apparent cooperativity (Hill number, nH) of Ca2+ activation of phosphorylation predicted for various choices of the rate constants in Scheme FS1. Selected examples of the complete computed activation profiles are shown in Fig. 11. Simulation 1, which results in K0.5 = 2.3·10−7m andnH = 1.39, is seen to reproduce the data for the wild type in Fig. 3 A (K0.5 = 2.3·10−7m,nH = 1.48) rather satisfactorily. As explained in a footnote to Table II, this simulation is based on the rate constants determined in the transient kinetic experiments carried out with the wild type at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The other simulations in Table II demonstrate the effects of varying several of the rate constants in the enzyme cycle one by one and in combination, thus providing insight into the factors determining the apparent Ca2+ affinity and cooperativity. As expected, an increase of the rate of Ca2+ dissociation without a change in the rate of Ca2+ binding (i.e. a reduced Ca2+ affinity) results in a right shift of the activation curve corresponding to an increased K0.5 value (reduced “apparent Ca2+ affinity”); see simulations 6 and 7. However, we had not expected that the enhanced Ca2+dissociation in addition would give rise to an increase of the Hill number (from 1.39 to 1.69 for a 10-fold increase in Ca2+dissociation rate). It was furthermore somewhat surprising that a combined 10-fold reduction in both the “off” and the “on” rate constant for Ca2+ (i.e. retaining a normal Ca2+ affinity) results in a right shift of the activation curve corresponding to a 6-fold decrease in the apparentaffinity (simulation 10). Changes to theE1-E2 equilibrium (simulations 2–5) result in changes to the K0.5value but not in substantial changes to the apparent cooperativity. A 10-fold increase of the phosphorylation rate has very little influence on the K0.5 value or the apparent cooperativity (simulation 12). On the other hand, a 10-fold lowering of the dephosphorylation rate results in a conspicuous increase of both the apparent Ca2+ affinity and the Hill number (simulation 13). This is a purely kinetic effect, unrelated to the Ca2+binding properties of the enzyme, explaining very well the left shift of the activation curve, relative to wild type, observed in Fig.3 A for the very slowly dephosphorylating mutants C and D.Table IIComputed values for the apparent Ca2+ affinity and cooperativity in Ca2+ activation of phosphorylation for various choices of rate constants in the enzyme cycle in Scheme FS1SimulationRate constants2-aFor simulations 2–16, only the rate constants differing from those used in simulation 1 are indicated. The rate constants are designated according to SchemeFS1.2 There are no rate constants representing reaction 6, since reactions 5 and 6 were combined into a single dephosphorylation step with rate constants k5/k−5due to the very high rate of reaction 6 under normal conditions (26).

The basis for our assignment of the rate constants is as follows. The valuesk1 = 25 s−1, k4 = 35 s−1, and k5 = 5 s−1 were previously estimated from data obtained with the wild type (18) in experiments similar to those corresponding to Figs. 5 and 10 in the present paper. The value k−3 = 27 s−1 was obtained from Fig. 8 (for further consolidation, see Ref. 18). Assuming that the two calcium ions dissociate through a common gateway,k−2 = 0.5 · k−3 (23,24). The value k−1 = 50 s−1 was assigned to reproduce as accurately as possible the apparently monoexponential time dependence of phosphorylation starting from the Ca2+-deprived enzyme (Fig. 4 in Ref. 18, the wild type data corresponding to Fig. 5 (left panels) of the present paper). The rate constants for Ca2+ binding, k2 andk3, were varied until the best possible fit to the wild-type data in Fig. 3 A was obtained. To reduce the latitude, k2 and k3 were assumed to be equal. A further helpful constraint for the wild type is that the degree of cooperativity observed in the phosphorylation experiment is similar to that reported for equilibrium Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP (Hill number 1.3–1.4) (21), which is fulfilled for the indicated assignments of the rate constants corresponding to reactions 1, 2, and 3.

Simulations 1, 15, and 16 represent the wild type, mutant A, and mutant B, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, simulation 15 shows that it is feasible to combine the various changes to the partial reactions observed experimentally for mutant A into an activation profile (K0.5 = 2.7·10−7m,nH = 1.70), matching rather accurately the experimental activation curve for this mutant in Fig. 3 A(K0.5 = 2.7·10−7m, nH = 1.90). As illustrated in Fig. 11, both the increased Hill number, which makes the curve corresponding to mutant A intersect the wild-type curve, and the almost normal apparent Ca2+ affinity seen for mutant A, despite the increased rate of Ca2+ dissociation, are reproduced satisfactorily when the rate constant of 150 s−1 for Ca2+ dissociation (Fig. 8) is combined with an increase in the rate of theE2 to E1 transition (Figs. 5 and 7) and a reduction of the E1P toE2P transition rate to approximately one-third that of the wild type (rate constant 1.6 s−1, Fig. 10).Furthermore, the fact that mutant B exhibits low apparent Ca2+ affinity (Fig. 3 A) despite a reduced rate of Ca2+ dissociation (Figs. 8 and 9) can be understood on the basis of the computations, if it is assumed that both the “on” and the “off” rate for Ca2+ are reduced in this mutant. Thus, simulation 16 shows that the data for mutant B in Fig.3 A (K0.5 = 9.6·10−7m,nH = 1.34) are reproduced rather satisfactorily (K0.5 = 9.7·10−7m, nH = 1.24) by the combination of a 4-fold decrease in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation (as observed for mutant B in Fig. 8) with an 8-fold decrease in the rate of Ca2+ binding and with the observed reduction of theE1P to E2P transition rate to approximately two-thirds that of the wild type (rate constant 3.5 s−1). Hence, in addition to a confirmation of the conclusions already drawn on the basis of the experimental studies of the partial reactions, the computational analysis of the data in Fig. 3 A provides the additional information that the rate of Ca2+ binding is reduced 8-fold in mutant B.On the basis of the computations, we may also offer a tentative explanation of the reversal of the apparent Ca2+ affinities of mutants A and B seen when the temperature is lowered to 0 °C (Fig. 3 B). The right shift of the titration curve observed at 0 °C for mutant A would be explained if the rate constants associated with Ca2+ dissociation,k−2 and k−3, had a less steep temperature dependence in mutant A than in the wild type, corresponding to a lower Arrhenius activation energy of the conformational change opening the pathway between the Ca2+sites and the cytoplasm. The reason for the left shift of the activation curve observed for mutant B at low temperature could, on the other hand, be that the temperature dependence of the Ca2+dissociation rate is steeper in this mutant than in the wild type, corresponding to increased activation energy of the gate-opening conformational change.The mutational effects on the kinetics of Ca2+ interaction observed here clearly point to a direct or indirect role of the NH2-terminal part of M3 in control of the gateway to the Ca2+ sites. The recently published high resolution crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase in Ca2 E1 form (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) does not reveal the entrance pathway to the Ca2+ sites, presumably because it normally closes following the binding of the calcium ions (“occlusion”). However, the residues substituted in mutants A, B, and F could be intimately related to such a pathway, since they are at the same time located near the cytoplasmic surface of the protein and rather close (12–25 Å) to one of the Ca2+ sites.The cytoplasmic loop connecting M6 and M7 (L67) has been suggested to play an important role in the coordination of conformational changes in different parts of the enzyme, and a movement of this loop could possibly affect the Ca2+ sites through a rearrangement of M6 (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in the Ca2 E1 crystals, the COOH-terminal end of L67 is connected to the NH2-terminal part of M3 through hydrogen bonds to the lysine replaced by glutamate in mutant A (Lys252) (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The interference with these hydrogen bonds may constitute the reason for the observed effects of the amino acid substitutions in mutant A on the opening of the gateway to the Ca2+ sites and on theE1-E2 equilibria of the phosphoenzyme and dephosphoenzyme forms.The importance of M3 for thapsigargin sensitivity seems to be associated particularly with residues located in the short segment between Phe256 and Leu260, substituted in mutants F and B (Fig. 1). It has previously been discussed that the reduced sensitivity to thapsigargin resulting from amino acid substitutions in M3 might represent an indirect effect rather than the removal of side chains directly participating in the binding of thapsigargin (11Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A critical factor could be theE1-E2 conformational equilibrium, since it has been proposed that thapsigargin reacts preferentially with the E2 form (9Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wictome M. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. East J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lack of correlation between the mutational effects on the sensitivity to thapsigargin and the displacement of theE1-E2 equilibrium found in the present study is therefore noteworthy. That mutants B and F display a much more substantial reduction of the thapsigargin sensitivity than mutant A, in which theE1-E2 equilibrium is displaced in favor of E1, shows that other factors are more critical and raises the question of whether in mutant A the E1 form in its Ca2+-free state might actually bind thapsigargin with high affinity. The concurrence of very low thapsigargin sensitivity with a reduced rate of Ca2+ binding in mutant B is striking and may suggest that the same factors are involved in preventing Ca2+ and thapsigargin from entering into their binding sites. It is possible that thapsigargin binding requires an open state of the entrance pathway to the Ca2+ s"

We studied the mechanism of transcriptional activation by human c-Jun in a human RNA polymerase II transcription system composed of highly purified recombinant and native transcription factors. Transcriptional activation by c-Jun depends on the TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factor (TAF) subunits of transcription factor IID (TFIID). Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that c-Jun binds with high specificity to the largest subunit of human TFIID, TAFII250. The region of TAFII250 bound by c-Jun lies in the N-terminal 163 amino acids. This same region of TAFII250 binds to TBP and represses its interaction with TATA boxes, thereby decreasing DNA binding by TFIID. We hypothesized that c-Jun is capable of derepressing the effect of the TAFII250 N terminus on TFIID-driven transcription. In support of this hypothesis, we found that c-Jun increased levels of TFIID-driven transcription in vitro when added at high concentrations to a DNA template lacking activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites. Moreover, c-Jun blocked the repression of TBP DNA binding caused by the N terminus of TAFII250.

Understanding how this multitude of factors sets levels of transcription of individual genes is the goal of much research. Emerging evidence indicates that transcriptional activators have the potential to stimulate transcription via many different mechanisms. For example, activators can exert their effects by binding components of the transcription machinery, including subunits of the TFIID1 and mediator complexes (for review, see Refs. 1Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 2Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) as well as by recruiting chromatin modifying complexes (for review, see Ref. 3Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Whereas unique combinations of activators and coactivators function at different promoters, RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors (TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, and -H) are thought to function at most mRNA-encoding genes (for review, see Ref. 4Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The TFIID complex plays a central role in core promoter recognition and the assembly of preinitiation complexes regardless of the manner by which the remaining basal transcriptional components are recruited, either via a stepwise pathway or as a holoenzyme (5Carey M.F. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1003-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs) whose sizes range from 18 to 250 kDa (for review, see Ref. 6Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Subunits of TFIID contact core promoter elements including the TATA box, initiator, and downstream promoter element (7Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 8Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9Verrijzer C.P.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). At some promoters, the recruitment of TFIID limits the overall level of transcription in vitro. Efficient recruitment of TFIID can be achieved by upstream activators that interact with TFIID components (11Wang W. Gralla J.D. Carey M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, activators can elicit a conformational change in the TFIID-TFIIA-promoter complex, as observed by DNase I footprinting (14Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Chi T. Carey M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although direct interactions between TBP and activators have been noted, the primary functional targets of activators within TFIID are the TAF subunits. TAFs were coined coactivators in recognition of their requirement for activated transcription in some in vitro systems (16Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 17Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 55: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Recently, the ability of TAFs to adopt multifunctional roles as components of distinct complexes including TFIID, Spt-Ada-Gen5-acetyltransferase (SAGA), p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and TBP-free TAFII complex (TFTC) has been demonstrated (for review, see Ref. 1Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The validity of the coactivator function of TAFs has been firmly established from examples in yeast, Drosophila, and human systems. Although TAFs can function as coactivators, regulated transcription of some promoters is not dependent on TAFs in vitro andin vivo (18Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N.

The mediator and other complexes are also targets of transcriptional activators and serve to coactivate transcription (for review, see Ref. 2Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the context of chromatin, nucleosome-remodeling complexes and histone acetyltransferases such as cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) function to coactivate transcription (3Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). It is likely that activators can stimulate transcription by many different mechanisms depending upon the conditions and the context of the promoter at which the activator binds. One mechanism by which activators can function is by relieving the effects of factors that repress basal transcription. Although this is certainly true of activators in the context of chromatin, mechanisms of transcriptional repression and derepression have also been observed in the absence of chromatin. For example, the binding of TFIID to core promoters is internally repressed by the largest subunit of TFIID, TAFII250 (23Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Most of the work on the mechanism of this repression has been carried out with dTAFII230 and yTAFII145, the Drosophila and yeast homologs of human TAFII250. Repression is mediated by a small domain (∼150 amino acids) in the N termini of these proteins that binds directly to TBP and inhibits its ability to bind TATA boxes (23Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of dTAFII230 can repress TBP-driven transcription when added in excess of TBP in an in vitro transcription system (23Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis identified the concave DNA binding surface of TBP as a binding site of the N terminus of dTAFII230 (25Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In NMR studies, amino acids 11–77 of dTAFII230 appeared to mimic DNA by binding to the DNA binding cleft of TBP (26Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A second region of dTAFII230 (amino acids 118–143) interacts with the convex surface of TBP and further stabilizes the dTAFII230-TBP interaction (27Kotani T. Miyake T. Tsukihashi Y. Hinnebusch A.G.

The importance of TAFII250 repression to transcriptional regulation in cells and the potential for targeting the N terminus of TAFII250 as a means to derepress transcription are currently under study. TFIIA, which aids TFIID in binding core promoters, can prevent TAFII250 from inhibiting TBP-DNA binding in vitro (28Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, yTAFII145 and yTFIIA bind competitively to TBP (24Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The acidic activation domain of VP16 also binds the underside of TBP and can block the interaction of dTAFII230 with TBP (25Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Kotani T. Banno K. Ikura M. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activators have not, however, been shown to bind directly to the N terminus of TAFII250 to remove its repressive effects on TBP-DNA binding. AP-1 transcription factors of the Jun and Fos families activate many genes including those involved in cell growth and proliferation (for review, see Ref. 30Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). AP-1 proteins each contain an extended α-helical dimerization/DNA binding domain of ∼62 amino acids that consists of a leucine zipper found C-terminal of a basic region (31Turner R. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 243: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Dimers bind DNA through sequence-specific contacts between amino acids in the basic regions and the major groove of the DNA helix (32Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Members of the Jun family can form homo- and heterodimers. Members of the Fos family cannot form homo- or heterodimers among themselves but can heterodimerize with Jun proteins. Although there is high sequence homology in the basic leucine zipper domains of AP-1 proteins, there is much less homology in other regions, which contain activation domains. The activation domains of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are essential for transcriptional activation in vitro, have been characterized functionally (33Abate C. Luk D. Gagne E. Roeder R.G. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5532-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Bohmann D. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Sutherland J.A.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite a wealth of studies, the mechanisms by which c-Jun and c-Fos stimulate transcription are not well understood. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which human c-Jun activates transcription using a highly purified human RNA polymerase II transcription system. Activation of transcription by recombinant c-Jun was found to be dependent on TAFs. Interactions between c-Jun and TAFs were identified and characterized using protein-protein affinity chromatography, which revealed that c-Jun binds to the N terminus of human TAFII250. The function of c-Jun in derepressing transcription driven by TFIID and the ability of c-Jun to block TAFII250 repression of TBP transcription and DNA binding were characterized in vitro. Our results reveal a unique interaction between c-Jun and TAFII250 that results in derepression of TFIID-driven transcription in vitro. These studies lead to a novel model for activation in which c-Jun interacts with TAFII250 to relieve repression of TFIID-DNA binding, thereby contributing to transcriptional activation. pET-Jun, a plasmid for expressing full-length human c-Jun, was a gift from T. Hoey (Tularik, Inc.). In creating this plasmid an NcoI site was generated that changed the fourth base pair in the c-Jun-coding region from AT to GC, resulting in a point mutation in the second amino acid of c-Jun (Thr to Ala). pGEX-Jun was created by digesting pET-Jun with NcoI andEcoRV and subcloning the c-Jun cDNA into theNcoI and StuI sites of pGEX-2TKN (a kind gift of S. Ruppert and R. Tjian). Plasmids for expressing TAFs (pTβ-hTAF250, pTβ-dTAF40, pTβ-dTAF30α, and pTβ-dTAF30β) were gifts from R. Tjian. HA-hTAFII250 was expressed in SF9 cells as previously described (37Chen J.-L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). pTβ-hTAF250-(1–560) and pTβ-hTAF250-(1–163) were created by digestion of pTβ-hTAF250 with EcoRI and SmaI, respectively, followed by gel purification of the linearized plasmid and ligation. pGEX-hTAF250-(1–163) was created by digestion of pTβ-hTAF250-(1–163) with NdeI and EcoRI and insertion of the DNA fragment into pGEX-2TKN. Plasmid p(AP-1)5-E1b-CAT was created by inserting five direct copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 element from the human metallothionein IIA promoter (−105 to −96) into the XbaI site of plasmid E1b-CAT (38Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Plasmid p(AP-1)5-E1b-G-less, used as template DNA in the in vitro transcription assays, was created by inserting a 377-base pair G-less cassette (excised from p(GAL4)5-E1b-G-less (a kind gift from M. G. Peterson and R. Tjian) with SacI) into the SacI site of p(AP-1)5-E1b-CAT. Plasmid p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which contains five GAL4 sites upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter (AdMLP; −53 to +10) and a 380-base pair G-less cassette, was generated by subcloning aHindIII-EcoRI fragment isolated from plasmid G5-MLP-G-less (a kind gift from Mike Carey) into the HindIII and EcoRI site of pBluescript-KS(+). Recombinant full-length human c-Jun was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21:DE3. Cultures (500 ml) were grown in LB containing 0.3 mm ampicillin at 37 °C until theA 600 nm was 0.4. Expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated 4 times for 15 s. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor at 18,000 rpm and 4 °C. Precipitated material (inclusion bodies) containing c-Jun was resuspended in 10 ml of 5 mm DTT and sonicated 2 times for 30 s. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C. Insoluble material was washed three more times by resuspending in 10 ml of 5 mm DTT, followed by centrifugation. Pellets from the final wash were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 7 m urea) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Soluble protein was loaded on an 8-ml column packed with sulfopropyl-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with three column volumes of buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl followed by three column volumes of buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. c-Jun was then eluted with buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl and subjected to three sequential dialyses in buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT) containing the following additions: 1) 1 m urea and 1 m NaCl; 2) 1 m NaCl; 3) 0.1 mNaCl. After dialysis, the purified c-Jun was separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. GST-Jun was expressed in E. coli strain XA90. Cultures were grown in LB containing 0.3 mm ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 nm was 0.4. Expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated 4 times for 15 s. Insoluble material was washed with 5 mm DTT as described for c-Jun above. Pellets from the final wash were resuspended in a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 6 m guanidine-HCl, and protein was extracted by overnight nutation at 4 °C. After centrifugation to remove the remaining insoluble material, extracts were diluted to give final concentrations of 200 ng/μl of GST-Jun. Samples were subjected to three sequential dialyses in buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl and guanidine-HCl at 2, 1, and 0.5m. The guanidine-HCl was then slowly lowered to 50 mm by pumping (over 10 h) buffer B containing 0.1m NaCl into the third dialysis listed above. After dialysis, samples containing GST-Jun were separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Just before use in protein-protein interaction assays, GST-Jun was further purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by two washes with 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and three washes with the appropriate protein-protein interaction assay buffer (see below and figure legends). The affinity resin contained ∼1 mg of protein/ml of beads. GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and GST were expressed in E. coli strain XA90 as described for GST-Jun above. Harvested cells were resuspended in 1/50 culture volume of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were sonicated 4 times for 15 s and centrifuged for 30 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor at 18,000 rpm and 4 °C. Supernatants from the centrifugation were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h with constant nutation. Resin was washed two times with 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For use in protein-protein interaction assays, the resin was washed three times with ten column volumes of the appropriate protein-protein interaction assay buffer (see below and figure legends). For elution, resin was washed five times with 10 column volumes of buffer C (100 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 120 mm NaCl). Protein was eluted by incubating resin at 4 °C for 10 min in 1 column volume of buffer C containing 20 mm glutathione (reduced) with constant nutation. Eluates were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Samples were separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Each reaction contained 1 μg of GST-Jun or GST immobilized on 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immobilized proteins and extracts containing target proteins were incubated with micrococcal nuclease at 30 °C for 10 min. Target proteins were then incubated with GST or GST-Jun beads at 4 °C for 2 h with constant nutation in TGEMD buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1m NaCl. After incubation, beads were washed at least 3 times with 10–15 bead volumes of buffer. Protein was eluted from the beads in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. General transcription factors (TBP, TFII-B, -E, -F, and -H) and RNA polymerase II were expressed and purified as previously described (40Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Human TFIID was immunopurified (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TFIIA was prepared as previously described (41Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

The amounts of general factors and buffer conditions used for transcription were as previously described (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The amounts of the TFIID (10 ng) and TBP (0.5 ng) used in transcription reactions contained equal moles of TBP, as determined by quantitative Western analysis with polyclonal antibody directed against TBP (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To study transcriptional activation (see Fig. 1B) c-Jun was incubated with p(AP-1)5-E1b-G-less for 5 min on ice. After the addition of general transcription factors, reactions (20 μl) were transferred to 30 °C for 25 min before adding nucleoside triphosphates. RNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. To study derepression (see Fig. 4), c-Jun was incubated with TBP or TFIID in 13-μl reactions for 10 min on ice. p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template DNA and the remaining general transcription factors where then added to reactions in a final volume of 20 μl.Figure 4c-Jun derepresses TFIID-directed transcription from a template that lacks AP-1 sites. Recombinant c-Jun was incubated with TBP (lanes 2–5) or TFIID (lanes 7–10) before adding p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less (consisting of the adenovirus major late core promoter upstream of a 380-base pair G-less cassette) and the remaining general transcription factors. The amounts of c-Jun added to the transcription reactions were 30 ng (lanes 2 and7), 200 ng (lanes 3 and 8), 400 ng (lanes 4 and 9), and 700 ng (lanes 5and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study transcriptional repression (see Fig. 5A) GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and GST were added to transcription reactions containing p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template DNA before the addition of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and RNA polymerase II. In Fig. 5B, c-Jun was incubated with GST-TAFII250-(1–163) (lanes 3 and 4) in 3 μl for 13 min on ice. p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template DNA was then added, followed immediately by the addition of the general transcription factors to a final volume of 20 μl. DNase I footprinting reactions were performed with a 183-base pair DNA fragment containing the AdMLP (−53 to +33) 32P-labeled on the 5′-end of the nontemplate strand. The buffer conditions were identical to those used for transcription (before the addition of NTPs). When present, GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and c-Jun were incubated together in a reaction volume of 2 μl for 10 min on ice. These mixtures were then added to reactions containing promoter DNA followed immediately by the addition of TBP at a final concentration of 6 nm in a final volume of 20 μl. After 10 min at 30 °C, 1 μl of a solution containing 0.15 units/μl of DNase I (Promega) and 10 mmCaCl2 was added to each reaction. Reactions were stopped, and DNA products were analyzed as described (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of c-Jun transcriptional activation, we developed a human RNA polymerase II transcription system reconstituted from highly purified recombinant and native general transcription factors. This system is useful for studying the roles of individual subunits of the general RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, including the TFIID TAFs, in basal and activated transcription. Recombinant human c-Jun was expressed inE. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig.1A). To test the activity of c-Jun for activating transcription in vitro we created a DNA template, p(AP-1)5-E1b-G-less, containing five AP-1 elements upstream of the adenovirus E1b TATA box and a 377-base pair G-less cassette. We detected basal transcription from this templatein vitro (Fig. 1B) in reactions reconstituted with equal molar concentrations of either immunopurified native TFIID (lane 1) or recombinant TBP (lane 3). Interestingly, reactions reconstituted with TBP reproducibly showed higher levels of basal transcription than those containing TFIID even though equivalent molar concentrations of TBP and TFIID were used (39Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is likely to be due to activities present in the TFIID complex that inhibit its binding to DNA, such as the N terminus of TAFII250 (23Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). c-Jun (30 ng) activated transcription ∼10-fold in reactions reconstituted with TFIID (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2) but did not stimulate transcription in reactions reconstituted with TBP (Fig.1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, in a highly purified in vitro transcription system, TAFs are required for transcriptional activation by human c-Jun. The finding that TAFs were required to mediate transcriptional activation by c-Jun in our in vitro transcription system led us to hypothesize that c-Jun interacted with one or more of the TAFs. To identify interactions between c-Jun and TAFs, we performed protein-protein affinity chromatography utilizing immobilized GST-Jun and in vitro translated 35S-labeled TAFs. TAFs were incubated with GST-Jun or control GST resin, and after extensive washing, proteins bound to the resins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. These studies revealed that TAFII250 interacted with immobilized GST-Jun but not control GST (Fig.2A, lanes 1–3). Other TAFs, for example dTAFII40, dTAFII30α, and dTAFII30β, did not interact with GST-Jun (Fig.2A, lanes 4–12). To further characterize the affinity and specificity of the c-Jun-TAFII250 interaction, we utilized extracts of insect cells containing HA-tagged TAFII250 that was expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. Insect cell extracts were incubated with immobilized GST-Jun and control GST. After extensive washing, bound protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As shown in Fig. 2B, the GST-Jun resin specifically purified recombinant HA-TAFII250 from the crude insect cell extract. The numerous and abundant insect cell proteins in the extract were not retained on the GST-Jun resin. To gain insight into the role of the c-Jun-TAFII250 interaction in transcriptional activation, we delimited the region of TAFII250 that is bound by c-Jun. Two C-terminal deletions of TAFII250 were expressed by in vitro translation and tested for interaction with immobilized GST-Jun: TAFII250-(1–560) and TAFII250-(1–163). As shown in Fig.3A, TAFII250-(1–560) and TAFII250-(1–163) each bound GST-Jun at a level comparable with that observed for full-length TAFII250 (amino acids 1–1893). As an additional test of the ability of the N-terminal 163 amino acids of TAFII250 to bind c-Jun, we expressed and purified a GST-TAFII250-(1–163) fusion protein and incubated the immobilized GST-TAFII250-(1–163) with purified c-Jun. The silver-stained SDS gel in Fig. 3B shows GST-TAFII250-(1–163) bound c-Jun (lane 5). c-Jun was not retained on control GST resin (lane 4). Thus, purified c-Jun can bind directly to GST-TAFII250-(1–163). These results revealed that the region of TAFII250 bound by c-Jun is the N-terminal domain, which is known to inhibit TBP-DNA binding and transcription. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that c-Jun binds the N terminus of TAFII250 and inhibits its repression of TBP-DNA binding, thereby contributing to transcriptional activation. It is possible that the lower level of basal transcription observed with TFIID compared with recombinant TBP (see Fig. 1) was due to the N-terminal region of TAFII250 interacting with the DNA binding surface of TBP to repress the binding of TBP to TATA DNA. In this case, c-Jun may bind directly to the N terminus of TAFII250 in TFIID to derepress transcription. To test this we used a DNA plasmid that lacks known AP-1 sites, p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less, which contains the adenovirus major late core promoter (−53 to +10) upstream of a 380-base pair G-less cassette. TFIID and TBP were incubated separately with increasing concentrations of c-Jun and then added to transcription reactions with p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less. As shown in Fig.4, lanes 7–10, c-Jun stimulated transcription when preincubated with TFIID. The level of transcription with TFIID approached that observed with TBP at the highest concentrations of c-Jun. c-Jun did not increase the level of transcription when preincubated with TBP (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5). To demonstrate that the N terminus of TAFII250 can repress in vitro transcription and to directly test whether c-Jun can inhibit TAFII250-mediated transcriptional repression, we added purified GST-TAFII250-(1–163) to transcription reactions. The ability of TAFII250-(1–163) to repress basal transcription was determined by comparing the effects of GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and GST on basal transcription in a minimal in vitro transcription system consisting of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, RNA polymerase II, and negatively supercoiled p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template DNA. As shown in Fig.5A, the addition of GST-TAFII250-(1–163) repressed basal transcription by more than 95%, whereas GST did not affect transcription when titrated over the same concentration range. Thus, the N terminus of TAFII250 can repress basal transcription in a highly purified minimal transcription system. We next tested the ability of c-Jun to block transcriptional repression caused by GST-TAFII250-(1–163). c-Jun was preincubated with GST-TAFII250-(1–163) before adding the p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template (lacking known AP-1 sites) and the remaining transcription factors. c-Jun overcame the repression of basal transcription observed with GST-TAFII250-(1–163) (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3 and 4 withlane 2). These data demonstrate that c-Jun can bind the N terminus of TAFII250 to block its ability to repress basal transcription. It was possible that the transcriptional effects presented above resulted from c-Jun binding the N terminus of TAFII250 to inhibit its repression of TATA box binding by TBP. To test this, we performed DNase I footprinting with TBP using a DNA fragment containing the adenovirus major late core promoter but lacking AP-1 sites. GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and c-Jun were added to determine their effects on TBP-DNA binding. Fig. 5C shows plots of relative intensities (y axis) versus position on the gel (x axis) for the region spanning the TATA box (left to right represents top to bottom on the gel). TBP alone protected bands in the TATA box region from DNase I digestion by greater than 90%. GST-TAFII250-(1–163) almost completely repressed TBP-DNA binding. In the presence of GST-TAFII250-(1–163), the intensities of bands in the TATA box region were decreased by less than 10% from the control reaction performed in the absence of transcription factors. Incubation of c-Jun with GST-TAFII250-(1–163) blocked the repression of TBP binding, resulting in ∼70% of the maximal protection in the TATA box region that was observed with TBP alone. Since the footprinting experiments were performed with recombinant TBP, GST-TAFII250-(1–163), and c-Jun, we can rule out a requirement for other general transcription factors in repression by GST-TAFII250-(1–163) and inhibition of this repression by c-Jun. Taken together, the transcription and DNase I footprinting experiments strongly support a model in which c-Jun binding to the N terminus of TAFII250 inhibits repression of TBP-DNA binding and transcription initiation. Here we have elucidated one mechanism by which c-Jun activates transcription. c-Jun binds the N terminus of TAFII250 to derepress RNA polymerase II transcription. Not only did c-Jun derepress TFIID-directed transcription in vitro, but c-Jun was also capable of blocking repression of TBP-DNA binding by the N terminus of TAFII250. Our results are the first to characterize a mechanism by which c-Jun activates RNA polymerase II transcription in a cell-free system. In addition, we provide the first evidence that activators can directly bind the N terminus of TAFII250 to derepress transcription in vitro. Derepression is emerging as a general mechanism for controlling levels of transcription in eukaryotic cells. This is not surprising since derepression is a prevalent mechanism for controlling gene expression in prokaryotes (43Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The most widespread example of derepression in eukaryotes is thought to be the alteration of chromatin structure by histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (3Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In small nuclear RNA transcription the snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc) has a built-in DNA binding damper that is deactivated by the transcriptional activator Oct-1 (44Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another general mechanism of transcriptional repression in eukaryotic cells results from the interaction of the N terminus of the largest TFIID subunit to the concave surface of TBP to prevent binding of TFIID to TATA boxes (23Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The finding that c-Jun binds the N terminus of TAFII250 to derepress TFIID-driven transcription in vitro further supports the generality of derepression as a means of regulating eukaryotic transcription. We are left wondering whether other transcriptional activators also bind the N terminus of TAFII250 to derepress transcription. We note that significant stimulation of transcription from the p(GAL4)5-AdMLP-G-less template (which lacks known AP-1 sites) required 400 ng or more of c-Jun. These amounts are far greater than the amounts of transcriptional activators typically used inin vitro transcription experiments. For example, we observe significant activation from p(AP-1)5-E1b-G-less with 15 ng of c-Jun. With this low amount of c-Jun we do not observe activation from any template that does not contain known AP-1 sites. Moreover, in early c-Jun activation experiments, we did not titrate c-Jun to high enough levels to observe AP-1 site-independent derepression. Perhaps other transcriptional activators that bind the N terminus of TAFII250 to derepress transcription will be revealed through a combination of protein-protein interaction assays (with activators and the N terminus of TAFII250) and in vitro transcription experiments aimed at testing for site-independent transcriptional stimulation in a TFIID-dependent transcription system. Other models for derepression of TFIID binding have been studied. For example, it has been shown that VP16 and dTAFII230 competitively bind the concave surface of TBP (25Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A point mutation in TBP (L114K) that disrupted the TBP-VP16 interaction prevented VP16 activation in vivo. The same point mutation in TBP also disrupted interaction with dTAFII230. In addition, when the N terminus of yTAFII145 was replaced with an acidic activation domain, the fusion protein autoinhibited TFIID in yeast (29Kotani T. Banno K. Ikura M. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A two-step “hand-off” model has been proposed to explain the function of acidic activation domains in derepressing DNA binding by TFIID (25Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Kotani T. Banno K. Ikura M. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the first step, the acidic activation domain replaces the N terminus of dTAFII230/yTAFII145 by binding the underside of TBP. In the second step, TBP binds to the TATA box when the acidic activation domain releases its hold on TBP. This proposed mechanism of relieving the internal repression of TFIID binding is quite different from the mechanism of derepression by c-Jun that we have characterized here; however, both modes of derepression serve to increase TFIID-driven transcription. Since TFIIA has been shown to stimulate TFIID binding to the TATA box and to compete with the largest subunit of TFIID for binding TBP (24Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,28Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is possible that transcriptional activators could indirectly derepress TAFII250 inhibition of TATA box binding by helping TFIIA bind TBP. Although TFIIA may play a role in c-Jun derepression, it is not required under all conditions. In our highly purified in vitro transcription system we found that c-Jun blocked the repression of transcription by GST-TAFII250-(1–163) in the absence of TFIIA. Furthermore, using DNase I footprinting we found that c-Jun blocked the ability of GST-TAFII250-(1–163) to repress TATA box binding by TBP. Thus, TFIIA and other general transcription factors are not required for the function of c-Jun in derepressing TBP binding in vitro. TBP has also been shown to dimerize in vitro and in vivo either alone or when part of TFIID (45Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 46Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K.P. Benjamin L.R. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13842-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Dimers form through interactions between the concave surfaces of two molecules of TBP, resulting in a complex that is not capable of binding DNA. The coordination of TBP dimerization and the N terminus of TAFII250 interacting with TBP is not understood. Perhaps these two distinct mechanisms of repressing TFIID-DNA binding function together to ensure that the repressed state is maintained in the absence of interaction with TFIIA and transcriptional activators.

https://openalex.org/W2051569873,"Nuclear export of IκBα is mediated by the CRM1 nuclear export receptor. However, the identity of the nuclear export sequences NES(s) in IκBα that are responsible for binding of IκBα to CRM1 is controversial. Both a N-terminal NES-like region (amino acids 45–54) and a C-terminal NES-like region (amino acids 265–280) have, in a number of reports from different laboratories, been implicated in CRM1-dependent nuclear export of IκBα. We now demonstrate that the N-terminal NES-like region, but not the C-terminal NES-like region, is required for RanGTP-dependent binding of IκBα to CRM1. IκBα is a relatively weak substrate for CRM1, with an affinity for CRM1 that is 100-fold less than the minute virus of mice NS2 protein, a high affinity cargo protein for CRM1. We also demonstrate that IκBα functions as a physical adaptor between CRM1 and NFκB/Rel proteins. Both free IκBα and Rel-associated IκBα have comparable affinities for CRM1, suggesting that CRM1 does not discriminate between free IκBα and Rel-associated IκBα. Nuclear export of c-Rel by IκBα requires the N-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα but is not affected by alanine substitutions within the C-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα. In contrast, nuclear export of the v-Rel oncoprotein by IκBα is disrupted by alanine substitutions within either the N-terminal or the C-terminal NES-like sequences. However, alanine substitutions within the C-terminal NES-like sequence significantly reduce the affinity of IκBα for v-Rel, suggesting that loss of export function for this mutant is secondary to reduced association between IκBα and v-Rel. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the N-terminal NES-like sequence in IκBα is required for RanGTP-dependent binding of both free IκBα and NFκB/Rel-associated IκBα proteins to CRM1.

Mammalian cells have five NFκB/Rel proteins, termed p50, p52, RelA(p65), c-Rel, and RelB. The NFκB/Rel proteins are defined by the presence of an N-terminal, highly conserved region of 300 amino acids known as the Rel homology domain. The Rel homology domain is responsible for dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding by NFκB/Rel proteins. NFκB/Rel proteins are regulated, in large part, through association with members of the Inhibitory of kappa B (IκB) family of ankyrin repeat proteins. A major regulatory mechanism for controlling NFκB/Rel proteins is sequestration in the cytoplasm. Crystallographic analysis of the ternary p50·p65·IκBα complex has revealed that NLSs within the dimeric p50·p65 complex are masked by IκBα, suggesting that IκBα inhibits nuclear import of NFκB/Rel proteins by blocking access of the nuclear import machinery to the NLSs of NFκB (4Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 5Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic sequestration of NFκB/Rel proteins arises from a dynamic equilibrium between nuclear import and nuclear export. For example, treatment of unstimulated cells with leptomycin B results in the relocalization of both NFκB/Rel and IκBα proteins to the nucleus (6Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, leptomycin B treatment results in sustained nuclear localization of NFκB/Rel and IκBα proteins following transient stimulation with activating agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α (6Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because the CRM1 nuclear export receptor is specifically inactivated by leptomycin B (8Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar), CRM1-dependent nuclear export is important for cytoplasmic sequestration of NFκB/Rel and IκBα proteins under conditions of both basal and post-induction repression. CRM1 binds short leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NESs) in its cargo proteins (8Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

IκBα contains two leucine-rich regions that resemble previously characterized NESs, amino acids 45–54 and 265–280 (Fig. 1). However, there is contradictory evidence in the literature regarding the requirement of these NES-like sequences for nuclear export of IκBα (7Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J.

Dargemont and co-workers (14Arezana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to show that IκBα could be exported from the nucleus. In these experiments, alanine substitutions for hydrophobic residues within the C-terminal NES-like sequence reduced the rate of IκBα export when injected into nuclei of Xenopus oocytes (14Arezana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, our laboratory demonstrated that IκBα mediates nuclear export of the v-Rel oncoprotein and that this nuclear export function of IκBα is reduced by mutations within the C-terminal NES-like region of IκBα (15Sachdev S. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5445-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, more recent experiments have suggested that the N-terminal NES-like sequence in IκBα is critically required for CRM1-dependent nuclear export of IκBα. For example, Hope and co-workers (7Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that alanine substitutions within the N-terminal NES-like sequence abolished nuclear export of IκBα proteins following microinjection into the nuclei of 3T3 cells. Miyamoto and co-workers (16Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) showed that mutations within the N-terminal NES-like sequence markedly increased nuclear accumulation of a GFP-IκBα protein in transiently transfected COS cells. In agreement with both of these results, our laboratory (17Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) has recently shown that the entire N-terminal domain of IκBα, including the N-terminal NES-like sequence, is required for nuclear export of GST-IκBα in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. Finally, using both yeast and mammalian cells, Sen and co-workers (18Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have showed that the N-terminal NES-like sequence is required for CRM1-dependent nuclear export of IκBα. There is also contradictory evidence in the literature regarding the requirement of these two NES-like sequences for binding of IκBα to CRM1. In one set of experiments, the C-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα was shown to be required for binding to in vitrotranslated CRM1 (12Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-terminal NES-like sequence has been shown to be required for interaction with CRM1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (16Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this study, we now demonstrate that purified IκBα binds to purified CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis of an export-competent ternary complex between IκBα, CRM1, and RanGTP indicates IκBα has a relatively weak affinity for CRM1. The N-terminal NES-like sequence, but not the C-terminal NES-like sequence, is required for the formation of a ternary IκBα·CRM1·RanGTP complex. We also examined the role of the respective NESs of IκBα in IκBα-mediated nuclear export of NFκB/Rel proteins. The N-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα is required for IκBα-mediated nuclear export of c-Rel, whereas both NES-like sequences of IκBα are required for IκBα-mediated nuclear export of v-Rel. However, alanine substitutions within the C-terminal NES-like sequence markedly reduce the affinity of IκBα for v-Rel, suggesting that loss of IκBα-mediated nuclear export of v-Rel is secondary to reduced binding of IκBα to v-Rel. Taken together, our data indicate that the N-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα is required for both binding of IκBα to CRM1 and for CRM1-mediated nuclear export of the IκBα·Rel complex. The construction of recombinant DNA molecules was performed by standard techniques (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An EcoRI fragment containing the avianIκBα cDNA was used as the progenitor for all of the mutants IκBα utilized in this study (20Davis N. Ghosh S. Simmons D.L. Tempst P. Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Bose H.R. Science. 1991; 253: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All point mutations were constructed from phagemid single-strand DNA and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. TheIκBα genes were expressed in monkey COS cells by using a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived vector. The CMV-based expression vectors for c-Rel and v-Rel have been described previously (15Sachdev S. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5445-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST expression vectors for IκBα and IκBα-CA4 have been described previously (17Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The GST expression vector for IκBα-NA4 was constructed by insertion of the mutant cDNA into pGEX-2T. The GST-NS2 vector contains the NS2 open reading frame inserted into pGEX-5X and was a gift from David Pintel (University of Missouri). The expression vector for His-tagged IκBα contained theIκBα open reading frame inserted into theNdeI site of pET15b. The expression vectors for His-c-Rel contained codons 1–320, and His-v-Rel contained codons 1–331 inserted into the BamHI site of pET15b. The pQE32-derived expression vectors for wild-type Ran, RanQ69L, and RanGAP proteins were obtained from Dirk Gorlich (University of Heidelberg). A pET-based expression vector for the CRM1 protein was obtained from Peter Askjaer (University of Aarhus) (13Askjaer P. Jensen H.T. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A baculovirus encoding HA-CRM1 was the generous gift of Alan Diehl (University of Nebraska Medical Center). The recombinant GST-IκBα proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified with glutathione-agarose as described previously (17Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The His-tagged IκBα, c-Rel, and v-Rel proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described in the Novagen pET manual. The Ran proteins were expressed in BLR pRep4 cells and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography (Invitrogen) as described (13Askjaer P. Jensen H.T. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The His-CRM1 protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. For His-CRM1 production, a single colony from a freshly transformed plate was inoculated into 50 ml of TB containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until A600 reached to 0.1, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2 ml of fresh TB. The resuspended cells were inoculated in 750 ml of TB containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, grown at 37 °C to an A600of 0.1, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 4 h at 20 °C. The cell pellets were lysed with Bugbuster (Novagen) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and a protease inhibitor mixture mix (Calbiochem). The His-tagged CRM1 proteins were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography (Invitrogen). All purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. HA-CRM1 was purified from Tini insect cell lysates infected at high multiplicity with a baculovirus encoding HA-CRM1. Lysates were collected in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and clarified by centrifugation. A protease inhibitor mix was included during the lysis step. Insect cell lysates were incubated with an anti-HA affinity matrix (Covance) at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the affinity matrix was extensively washed with incubation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). COS and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed with 1 μg of each pCMV4-based expression plasmid and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) per 35-mm dish. 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of a pCMV4-based expression plasmid encoding c-Rel or v-Rel per 100-mm dish using calcium phosphate. 293T lysates were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mmsodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mix. The cellular localization of Rel and IκBα proteins was analyzed 36–48 h after transfection by indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (15Sachdev S. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5445-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-IκBα rabbit antiserum was followed by anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for detection of the ectopically expressed IκBα protein. A monoclonal mouse antiserum directed against Rel (3C1; provided by Henry R. Rose, Jr., University of Texas) was followed by anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for detection of the ectopically expressed Rel protein. 3 μg of Ran was incubated for 30 min on ice with [γ-32P]GTP (10 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 100 mmpotassium acetate and 5 mm EDTA. Loading was stopped by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mmfollowed by gel filtration on a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with hydrolysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures containing 50 pmRan[γ-32P]GTP, 500 nm CRM1, and 0–15 μm GST-IκBα or GST-NS2 proteins in 25 μl of hydrolysis buffer were incubated at 15 °C for 30 min. The samples were placed on ice, 10 nm RanGAP was added, and the samples were immediately placed at 30 °C for 2 min. The reactions were diluted into 1 ml of ice-cold hydrolysis buffer and filtered through nitrocellulose (0.45 Micron, Micron Separations Inc.). Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of hydrolysis buffer, and radioactivity was counted in the presence of 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Ready Safe, Beckman) on a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer. For HA-CRM1 pull-down assays, 100 ng of immobilized HA-CRM1, 1 μg of GST-IκBα, and 1–2 μg of RanQ69L GTP in incubation buffer was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The matrix was extensively washed with incubation buffer prior to addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For GST-IκBα pull-down of HA-CRM1, the GST-IκBα proteins were loaded onto glutathione-agarose beads in incubation buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were extensively washed and incubated with 20 μl of insect cell lysates containing HA-CRM1 in the presence of 1 μg of RanQ69L GTP at 4 °C for 2 h. The matrix was extensively washed with incubation buffer prior to addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in incubation buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. For GST-IκBα pull-down of v-Rel, 100 μl of 293T cell lysates was incubated with GST-IκBα bound to glutathione-agarose beads in the presence of 0–1 mm His-IκBα protein. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were extensively washed with incubation buffer prior to the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In all binding assays, immunoblot analysis was used to measure proteins that remained bound to the respective solid supports after extensive washing. The samples were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. HA-CRM1 was detected by anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Covance), GST-IκBα proteins were detected by anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), His-IκBα was detected by a polyclonal rabbit anti-IκBα antiserum, His-v-Rel was detected by a polyclonal mouse antiserum directed against the v-Rel NLS, full-length v-Rel was detected by a polyclonal rabbit anti-Rel antiserum, and Ran was detected by a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (Covance). All primaries were used at dilutions of 1:2000 to 1:4000. The secondary antibodies were either horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (New England BioLabs) used at a dilution of 1:20,000 or horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) used at a dilution of 1:10,000. To detect multiple proteins on the same nitrocellulose filter, some filters were stripped with IgG Elution Buffer (Pierce) before subsequent antibody incubations. The proteins were visualized using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents followed by exposure to XAR-5 film. For quantification, proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membrane were visualized using Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce), and intensity of bands was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis (FXImager, Bio-Rad) using Bio-Rad's Quantity One software. The formation of an export competent complex between CRM1 and a NES-bearing cargo protein requires cooperative binding of RanGTP (13Askjaer P. Jensen H.T. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine if IκBα binds to CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner, the ability of purified IκBα to bind purified CRM1 was determined in the absence or presence of RanGTP. HA-tagged CRM1 (HA-CRM1) was immobilized on anti-HA agarose beads, and His-tagged IκBα (His-IκBα) was added in the presence or absence of RanQ69L GTP. The agarose beads were extensively washed, and the presence of bound IκBα was determined by immunoblot analysis. Binding of His-IκBα to HA-CRM1 was markedly increased in the presence of RanQ69L GTP (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and4). A 16-fold increase in the amount of His-IκBα bound to CRM1 was observed when RanQ69L GTP was included in the binding reaction (Fig. 2 B). To determine which NES-like sequence in IκBα is required for RanGTP-dependent binding to CRM1, the ability of GST-tagged IκBα proteins to associate with HA-CRM1 was determined. Wild-type and mutant GST-tagged IκBα proteins were incubated with immobilized HA-CRM1 in the absence or presence of RanQ69L GTP. After extensive washing, the amount of bound GST-IκBα proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis. As expected, binding of GST-IκBα to HA-CRM1 was markedly increased in the presence of RanGTP (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Mutant GST-IκBα proteins containing alanine substitutions within either the N-terminal (GST-IκBα-NA4) or the C-terminal (GST-IκBα-CA4) NES-like sequences were still able to associate with CRM1, although a substantial decrease of CRM1 binding was observed with GST-IκBα-NA4 (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 2, 3, and 4). To closely mimic the in vivo situation where CRM1 interacts with multiple cargo proteins, lysates from 293T cells were included during the binding reaction. Under these conditions, the GST-IκBα or GST-IκBα-CA4 proteins were still able to bind HA-CRM1, although at reduced levels compared with the level of binding observed with the purified proteins (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and3 with lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, binding of the GST-IκBα-NA4 protein to HA-CRM1 was abolished by the inclusion of 293T cell lysates in the binding reaction (Fig.3 A, lane 7). To confirm that the N-terminal and not the C-terminal NES-like sequences are required for association with CRM1, the respective GST-IκBα proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose and incubated with insect cell lysates containing HA-CRM1. Equivalent amounts of RanQ69L GTP were added to each sample. The agarose beads were extensively washed, and the amount of bound HA-CRM1 was determined by immunoblot analysis. Binding of HA-CRM1 to GST-IκBα-NA4 was markedly reduced compared with either the GST-IκBα or the GST-IκBα-CA4 proteins (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4). A 3-fold reduction in binding of HA-CRM1 to the immobilized GST-IκBα-NA4 protein was observed (Fig. 3 C). To provide a quantitative measure of the affinity of IκBα for CRM1, we used a RanGAP protection assay that has previously been used to measure the affinity between CRM1 and NES-bearing cargo proteins (11Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell.

The slow intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran is markedly stimulated by a GTPase activating protein, RanGAP. However, upon formation of an export-competent ternary complex between RanGTP, CRM1, and a NES-bearing cargo protein, RanGAP is no longer able to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ran. In this assay, the ability of a NES-bearing cargo protein to inhibit RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner provides an estimate of the affinity of the cargo protein for CRM1. In the presence of CRM1 alone, minimal protection of RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis was observed (Fig. 4). To confirm that our CRM1 preparation was competent for binding a NES-bearing cargo protein, the NS2 protein from the minute virus of mice (MVM) was used. The MVM NS2 protein contains a leucine-rich NES that binds with high affinity to CRM1 (11Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A GST-NS2 fusion protein was able to inhibit RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Consistent with previously published results (11Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the GST-NS2 protein was a high affinity substrate for CRM1, because 0.07 μm GST-NS2 was sufficient to provide 50% protection against RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran. In contrast, 8 μm GST-IκBα was required to achieve 50% protection against RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Thus, the affinity of IκBα for CRM1 is relatively weak, ∼100-fold less than that of the MVM NS2 protein. The ability of the mutant GST-IκBα proteins to inhibit RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran was determined. The GST-IκBα-CA4 protein was equally effective as the wild-type GST-IκBα protein for protection against RanGAP, with an apparent affinity of 8 μm. In contrast, 15 μmGST-IκBα-NA4 protein did not provide significant protection against RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran. Taken together, the binding assays and the RanGAP protection assays provide strong evidence that the N-terminal NES-like sequence of IκBα is required for formation of an export-competent complex with CRM1 and RanGTP. In contrast, mutations of hydrophobic residues within the C-terminal NES-like sequence do not affect RanGTP-dependent association of IκBα with CRM1. There is strong experimental evidence in support of the notion that nuclear export of NFκB/Rel proteins is mediated by CRM1. For example, cytoplasmic sequestration of p65 by IκBα is CRM1-dependent (7Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Likewise, our laboratory has previously reported that cytoplasmic retention of the v-Rel oncoprotein by IκBα is abolished by leptomycin B (15Sachdev S. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5445-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if IκBα is an adaptor that mediates binding of NFκB/Rel proteins to CRM1 or if NFκB/Rel proteins can bind directly to CRM1. Importantly, a functional NES has been identified in p65 (24Harhaj E.W. Sun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We utilized the RanGAP protection assay to characterize the adaptor function of IκBα. For these experiments, we used C-terminal truncated c-Rel-(1–320) or v-Rel-(1–"

Although the origin opening caused by binding of the host DnaA protein has been shown to be critical for the loading of the DnaB helicase, to date there has been no direct evidence presented for the formation of the DnaB complex at the DnaA box site. For these studies, we used the replication origin of plasmid RK2 (oriV), containing a cluster of four DnaA boxes that bind DnaA proteins isolated from different bacterial species (Caspi, R., Helinski, D.

Size exclusion chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, and electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that the DnaB helicase is delivered to the DnaA box region, which is localized ∼200 base pairs upstream from the region of origin opening and a potential site for helicase entry. The DnaABC complex was formed on both double-stranded superhelical and linear RK2 templates. A strict DnaA box sequence requirement for stable formation of that nucleoprotein structure was confirmed. In addition, our experiments provide evidence for interaction between the plasmid initiation protein TrfA and the DnaABC prepriming complex, formed at DnaA box region.

Originally, the DnaA binding site consensus sequences was determined for the Escherichia coli DnaA protein (21Schaefer C. Messer W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the consequence of DnaA protein binding to a DnaA box sequence can result in various types of functions, depending on the bacterial system. Binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA box consensus sequence, localized within a promotor region, can stimulate or inhibit transcriptional activity, hence, the regulation of gene expression and/or stimulation of the initiation of DNA replication (22Messer W. Weigel C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, the binding of DnaA protein to specific DnaA boxes, localized within bacterial replication origins, is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. The binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes at the E. coli chromosomal replication origin results in destabilization of duplex DNA at the A+T-rich region and an open complex formation (4Fuller R.S.

In the case of bacterial plasmids, the origin region of these extrachromosomal elements contains characteristic structural elements,i.e. multiple repeat sequences (iterons), DnaA box sequences, and an A+T-rich region (32Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 2295-2324Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The one or more clusters of direct repeats are specific multiple binding sites for the plasmid replication initiation protein (Rep) (32Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 2295-2324Google Scholar). The DnaA box sequences are also often organized within clusters, and they act as binding sites for the host DnaA initiation protein (32Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C.

Unlike in the case for the E. colireplication, the origin binding of the host DnaA protein itself does not result in plasmid origin opening at the A+T-rich region (13Konieczny I. Doran K.S.

However, DnaA protein binding to DnaA box sequences does enhance unwinding of the origin region, initiated by the binding of the plasmid Rep protein to the iterons. The generated ssDNA lies within the 13-mer sequence at the A+T-rich region, and it is a potential site for bacterial helicase delivering and loading. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between the DnaA protein and the host DnaB helicase are critical for the recruitment of the helicase to the origin region (31Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol.

In addition, the observed interactions of the replication initiation protein of plasmids R6K and pSC101 with theE. coli DnaB helicase are also likely to play a role in the positioning of the DnaB helicase at the origin of the narrow host range plasmid (40Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

The 393-base pair (bp) minimal origin, oriV, from the plasmid RK2, contains five 17-bp direct repeats (42Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), four DnaA boxes, and A+T-rich repeat sequences (13-mers), which are the initial sites of helix destabilization (13 )(Fig. 1). The DnaA binding sites localized within the RK2 replication origin consist of a cluster of two inverted pairs of DnaA box consensus sequences, separated by only a few bp (13Konieczny I. Doran K.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific interaction between the DnaA and DnaB proteins has been shown; however, both DnaA and TrfA proteins are required for helicase activity at RK2 DNA (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the site of DnaB helicase interactions with the RK2 region of the replication origin by various techniques, including size exclusion chromatography, SPR, and EM. These results demonstrate that the DnaA box cluster, located within oriV, by itself serves as a site for the formation of the DnaABC complex. This formation does not require a superhelical DNA structure or open complex formation. This DnaA box cluster is localized ∼200 bp upstream from the region of origin opening. Furthermore, the DnaABC complex is capable of interacting with the plasmid initiation protein TrfA, and this interaction is presumably initiated by the DnaB protein.

The construction and purification of the C-terminal His6-tagged E. coli DnaB protein, which have been found active both in vitro and in vivo, will be described elsewhere. Polyclonal anti-DnaB antibody was provided by Dr. Jaroslaw Marszalek (University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland). Anti-TrfA antibody was as described previously (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pTJS42 is a mini-replicon of the plasmid RK2 and contains the five iteron minimal oriV (46Schmidhauser T.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1983; 9: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Commercially available proteins and chemicals used in this study included: HU and SSB from Enzyco, Inc.; bovine serum albumin (fraction V), creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, Protein A (10 nm colloidal gold-labeled), and rNTPs from Sigma; Sepharose CL-4B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Qiagen; and goat anti-rabbit IgG from Bio-Rad. Streptavidin matrix-coated Sensor Chip S.A. (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) was used for the SPR analysis. Column gel filtration utilized to isolate the RK2 prepriming complex was performed as described previously (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume, 100 μl; 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml BSA, 4% sucrose, 4 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP), containing histidine-tagged versions of DnaA and DnaB proteins, DnaC, and pTJS42, which carries the RK2 minimal origin of replication, was incubated for 20 min at 32 °C. After incubation, the reactions were run through a Sepharose CL-4B column (0.5 × 12 cm), equilibrated at room temperature with the incubation buffer and 0.01% Brij 58. Fractions (80 μl) were collected, and a portion of each (40 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by semi-dry protein transfer, and immunoblotting with rabbit antisera specific against DnaB protein. Bound rabbit antibody was detected by a colorimetric reaction with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The reactions were performed in a standard prepriming reaction in buffer (100 μl), containing supercoiled RK2 template, DnaC, and histidine-tagged versions of DnaA and DnaB proteins. The reaction mixture was assembled on ice and then incubated at 32 °C for 20 min. Samples were cross-linked by the addition of 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Non-complexed proteins were removed by column filtration on Sepharose CL 4B. The void fractions were pooled together, and after cutting the DNA with the desired restriction enzyme, the mixture was once again applied to the column. Fractions containing protein complexed with DNA were collected and prepared for the antibody assay. The standard antibody assay for electron microscopy contained the cross-linked column filtrated sample and polyclonal antibodies against DnaB. Protein A-colloidal 10 nm gold particles were added cross-linked and diluted. Samples were adsorbed on mica sheets, stained with uranyl acetate, and platinum-carbon-coated. Binding of the DnaA protein to the oriV fragment was performed as described above; however, carbon coating instead immunodetection was used. Samples were examined at 60 kV in a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Micrographs were digitalized for the position of the DNA-protein complex. For the standard SPR analysis, a 64-bp 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (5′-AACGCCTGATTTTACGCGAGTTTCCCACAGATGATGTG GACAAGCCTGGGGATAAGTGCCCTGC-3′) and non-biotinylated complementary oligonucleotide were annealed and immobilized on to the Sensor Chip SA surface as described previously (1Caspi R. Helinski D.R. Pacek M. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18454-18461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SPR analysis was performed on a BiaCore 1000, by injecting 10 μl of protein solutions in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 40 mmpotassium glutamate, 80 μg/ml BSA, 4% sucrose, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm ATP) for 2 min at room temperature. Protein (DnaA, DnaC, and histidine-tagged proteins DnaB and TrfA254D/267L) injections were followed by SPR buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20) for 3 min., and after subtraction of the background response signal (obtained in a control experiment), the results were plotted as sensograms. Following the completion of each protein binding analysis, the surface of the chip was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 0.05% SDS, which releases all bound protein without affecting the binding capacity of the immobilized DNA. To analyze DnaA box requirement for helicase complex formation, the oligonucleotides A4 (AACGCCTGATTTTACGCGAGT TTCCCACAGATGATGTGGACAAGCCGATATCGCGGTGCCCTGC) and A1–3 (AACGCCTGAAGGATTCGAAGGATATCGCGGATGAACGCCTTGTGCCTGGGGATAAGTGCCCTGC) with a scrambled DnaA box consensus sequence were synthesized, annealed with complementary strands, and analyzed as described above. For the control of nonspecific protein-DNA interactions, an oligonucleotide duplex lacking the DnaA box sequences (AACGCCTGAAGGATTCGAAGGATATCGCGGATGAACGCCTTGTGCCGATCTGCTGGTGCCCTGC) was synthesized, immobilized, and analyzed. No significant response signal was detected in the control experiments. A histidine-tagged version of DnaB helicase (1000 ng) was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads in buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP) for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation, followed by three washes in incubation buffer, non-histidine-tagged TrfA protein (1 μg) was added to the reaction containing resin bound DnaB helicase. The protein complexes were formed for 60 min at room temperature, and then unbound protein was removed by three washes in incubation buffer, containing 20 mmimidazole. DnaB-TrfA complexes were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-TrfA polyclonal antibodies. A modified ELISA assay with glutaraldehyde cross-linking reagent (31Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal anti-DnaB antibodies was used for detection TrfA-DnaB interactions. DnaC protein, BSA, and histidine-tagged versions of DnaA, DnaB, and TrfA proteins were used. Requirements for DnaB helicase activity during replication initiation at the plasmid RK2 origin has been characterized previously (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a specific interaction between DnaA and E. coli DnaB helicase is critical for the helicase activity (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, helicase activation strictly depends on TrfA binding at the RK2 origin and formation of an open complex (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this work, we analyzed the minimal requirements for formation of the helicase prepriming complex at oriV by performing size exclusion chromatography with a Sepharose CL-4B column. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (pTJS42), containing the minimal RK2 origin (Fig.1), was incubated with purified proteins and then analyzed for the presence of bound DnaB helicase. The results show clearly that both DnaA and DnaC proteins are required for the complexing of the DnaB helicase with the oriV template DNA (Fig. 2 A). The DnaB helicase did not form a stable complex with the template DNA if the incubations were carried out without the DnaA or DnaC proteins (Fig. 2,B and C). Furthermore, addition of formaldehyde in order to stabilize DnaB-DNA interaction did not result with isolation of DnaB complexes with oriV when DnaA and DnaC were not present in the reaction mixture (data not shown). Previous studies demonstrated that direct interactions between E. coli DnaA and DnaB proteins are essential for the plasmid RK2 replication activity (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the position of the DnaA boxes at oriV is critical for origin activity (35Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If the correct helical phasing is disrupted by the insertion of less or greater than one helical turn, then DnaB cannot be efficiently loaded at the open region and replication activity is substantially reduced (35Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Size exclusion experiments, described in Fig. 2, show that both E. coli DnaA and DnaC proteins are required to form the helicase complex at RK2 DNA. To investigate possibility that the DnaA box region is the site for DnaBC complex delivery to the RK2 replication origin, we performed EM and SPR studies. After incubation of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC with the supercoiledoriV template, proteins and DNA were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes, and prepared for EM analysis. Utilization of antibodies against DnaB and protein A-colloidal gold particles allowed us to determine the position of the DnaB helicase on the plasmid DNA fragment. The results from this procedure demonstrated that the DnaB helicase particles were located within the minimal RK2 replication origin. Moreover, statistical analysis indicates that the majority of DnaB complexes were detected at a site that corresponds to the position of the DnaA box region at oriV (Fig.3). We further examined the requirements and real time kinetics of helicase complex formation at theoriV DnaA box region by utilizing the SPR technique. A 64-bp linear double-stranded DNA fragment, containing four DnaA box sequences, was linked to the sensor chip. The DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins were injected over the sensor matrix and tested for binding. Sensograms, which indicate change of mass at the attached DNA fragment, clearly show signals from DnaA protein binding to the DnaA box fragment (Fig. 4). In addition, a DnaBC complex was detected at the linear DnaA box DNA, following the formation of a complex between the DnaA protein and DNA (Fig. 4 A). The association of DnaB with the DnaA nucleoprotein complex at the DnaA box fragment requires DnaC (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Interactions of DnaB helicase with a DnaA-bound oriV fragment, containing DnaA box sequences. Surface plasmon resonance experiments show the binding and dissociation kinetics of the DnaABC complex on a linearoriV DNA fragment, containing four DnaA boxes. Immobilization of the 64-bp linear DNA was performed on a streptavidin matrix-coated sensor chip S.A. by biotin covalent linkage as followed by the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). SPR analysis was performed by injecting 10 μl of solutions containing the DnaA (65 ng), DnaB (120 ng), and DnaC (22 ng) proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, sensogram shows the binding of the DnaA protein to the immobilized DNA fragment, followed by the binding of a previously preformed DnaBC complex. B, the DnaA protein was bound to the DNA fragment, followed by the injection of the DnaB helicase only. C, the DnaA protein was bound to the DNA fragment, followed by the injection of the DnaC protein only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have recently shown that specific DnaA box sequences at oriV are critical for the cooperative binding of the E. coli DnaA protein (37Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, DnaA box mutants were constructed and tested for activity in vivo andin vitro. The scrambled DnaA box sequence GATATCGTC, which was shown to be defective in binding to the E. coli DnaA protein (37Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Langer U. Richter S. Roth A. Weigel C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was introduced into the A4 and A1–3 positions of the 64-bp fragment of oriV, respectively. The mutant DNA fragments were immobilized on to the streptavidin matrix-coated sensor chip. The two altered DnaA box fragments, designated A4 (DnaA box 4 scrambled and wild type sequences of DnaA boxes 1, 2, and 3) and A1–3 (DnaA boxes 1, 2, and 3 scrambled and wild type sequence of DnaA box 4), were analyzed for binding of the DnaB/DnaC complex in the presence of DnaA protein. Only a slight amount of the helicase complex at DnaA box fragment A4 was detected (Fig. 5). The magnitude of the response signal was not substantially increased following the addition of either the DnaA protein or the DnaBC complex. Similar results were obtained with the A1–3 mutant DNA fragment, attached to the sensor chip matrix (Fig. 5). Thus, a single wild-type A4 box structure was not sufficient for the formation of a stable DnaA/oriV complex or a stable complex of oriV and DnaB helicase. In contrast to these results, the 64-bp oriVfragment, containing the wild-type DnaA box sequence, reproducibly formed a stable ABC complex. These results are consistent with previously published observations, which showed that the DnaA box A4 is critical for cooperative binding and stable association of E. coli DnaA protein with oriV (37Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A specific DnaA-DnaB interaction is required for the formation of a helicase complex at oriV; however, both DnaA and TrfA proteins are necessary for DnaB helicase loading and activation (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The TrfA protein binds to iteron sequences at the origin, and these interactions result in the unwinding of the A+T-richoriV region (13Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for helicase loading on to the ssDNA in the open region and helicase activation for DNA helix unwinding are not yet known. In this paper, we have demonstrated the formation of a specific DnaABC complex at the DnaA boxes of oriV linear and supercoiled DNA templates. We proceeded further to test whether the TrfA protein could interact with such a DnaABC complex, formed at the DnaA box region. Once again, a double-stranded linear fragment, containing wild-type sequences of the four DnaA boxes, was attached to the sensor chip. The DnaABC complex was formed by injection of DnaA, followed by injection of DnaBC and, finally, injection of the TrfA protein. A strong response signal was observed after addition of the TrfA protein (Fig.6 A), despite the absence of DNA binding sites for the TrfA protein, indicating that the observed response is due to TrfA interactions with the DnaABC complex at the DnaA boxes. In a control experiment, the DnaBC complex was not injected prior to the injection of the TrfA protein, which resulted in no detectable response signals (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, after formation of the DnaA box/DnaABC/TrfA complex, a very rapid dissociation from the sensor chip was observed (Fig.6 A). SPR studies demonstrated that TrfA protein interacts with the DnaABC prepriming complex, formed at the DnaA box oriV region. We further determined whether or not these interactions are due to physical contacts between the TrfA protein and bacterial helicase. Affinity chromatography and ELISA studies verified that TrfA interacts with DnaB (Fig. 7, A and B). Following cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, a DnaB-TrfA complex was immunodetected by ELISA, and the magnitude of the observed signal was very similar to that obtained for the DnaB-DnaA complex. In control experiments, DnaB protein formed a strong complex with DnaC, but it did not interact with BSA (Fig. 7 B). Our results demonstrate for the first time the primary formation of an E. coli DnaB helicase complex at the DnaA box region of a plasmid replication origin. SPR experiments showed that this structure depends on the binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA boxes and the DnaB helicase in the form of a complex with its accessory protein DnaC (Figs. 4 and 5). In general, these results are consistent with the original studies on DNA replication initiation at the E. coli replication origin oriC (2Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar, 48Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar). Similar to the bacterial system, a DnaABC prepriming complex is formed at the plasmid RK2 origin (Fig. 2) (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, specific DnaA-DnaB interactions along with the presence of DnaA box sequences are critical for the formation of prepriming complexes on both oriC (31Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andoriV (43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, bacterial and plasmid RK2 helicase delivery strategies differ in some aspects. After the DnaABC complex is established at oriC, the binding of DnaA protein itself in the presence of ATP results in unwinding of the origin at the A+T-rich region, which then allows helicase loading on to the ssDNA (49Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Similarly, the E. coli DnaB helicase is positioned on ssDNA in the DNA/RNA heteroduplex region of plasmid pBR322 after RNA polymerase moves through the replication origin destabilizing helical structure (50Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18895-18906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, helicase is delivered to the plasmid RK2 replication origin without TrfA-dependent helix destabilization within the A+T-rich region (Fig. 4) (13Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, our experiments clearly show that the DnaB helicase forms a complex of ∼200 bp, upstream from the 13-mer structures, that is the site of ssDNA formation (Fig. 3). In addition, our work shows that the stable association of helicase with oriV depends on the presence of the DnaA boxes (Fig. 5). Mutations in these sequences, which inactivateoriV, also prevent DnaB complex formation. Interestingly, helicase formation within the DnaA box region requires the presence of DnaC. It has been shown that DnaC protein possesses a cryptic ssDNA binding activity that is probably involved in DnaB helicase loading on ssDNA (51Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that DnaC is required for the formation of a helicase complex on dsDNA. Probably, the helicase loading is a two-step reaction. The first step is DnaABC complex formation on dsDNA. In the second step, a cryptic ssDNA binding activity of DnaC ATPase is involved in helicase loading on to ssDNA. Our results are consistent with previously published studies on mutant DnaA boxes (36Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DnaA box 4 is critical for cooperative binding of DnaA protein to all four DnaA boxes, located within the RK2 origin. SPR analysis also demonstrated that these mutations in DnaA box 4 destabilized DnaA complex formation at oriV (Fig. 5). The finding that DnaB complex formation occurs within a 64-bp segment of a functional RK2 minimal origin of replication, as well as the failure of DnaB complex formation within this mutant forms of this segment, together indicate that the DnaA box region within the RK2 replication origin is the site of DnaB complex formation prior to loading on the ssDNA in the A+T-rich region. It should also be noted that the type of DnaA box required for plasmid RK2 replication is host-dependent (36Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 52Cowan P. Krishnapillai V. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 53Cross M.A. Warne S.R. Thomas C.M. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 132-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 54Shah D.S. Cross M.A. Porter D. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 608-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmids with mutations in DnaA box 4 or a deletion of all four DnaA boxes are not stably maintained in E. coli and P. putida; however, these mutants displayed some replication activity in P. aeruginosa (36Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of deleting all four boxes can be overcome in vitro by increasing the concentrations of the DnaA protein. Possibly, low affinity binding of DnaA protein elsewhere in oriV would explain DnaA-dependent replication initiation in the absence of the four DnaA boxes (36Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At very high DnaA protein levels, diffuse protection of the 13-mer sequences and the surrounding region was observed by the Dnase I footprinting technique (13Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FororiC, DnaA has been shown to bind to the 13-mers by the methods of filter binding, oligonucleotide displacement (55Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, more recently, SPR studies. 2W. Messer, unpublished results. Although the deletion of the entire oriV DnaA box region tenders the origin non-functional in vivo in E. coli (36Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), high concentration of DnaA protein in vitropossibly could result in the association of the E. coliDnaABC with the A+T rich region of the RK2 origin. Another possible explanation for the activity DnaA box deletion mutants of oriV in vitro at high DnaA concentrations and in vivo in P. aeruginosa may be that these activities are brought about or enhanced by DnaA-TrfA and/or DnaB-TrfA interactions. Our SPR experiments demonstrated interactions between the TrfA protein and the DnaABC complex, formed at the DnaA box sequences (Fig. 6). Specific interactions between the TrfA protein and DnaB helicase have been shown by the ELISA technique and affinity chromatography. Further investigations are in progress to examine the specificity of TrfA interactions with DnaB by utilizing DnaB proteins isolated from different bacterial species. Mutational analysis and binding assays have shown that the plasmid pSC101 (40Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and R6K (56Ratnakar P.V.A.L. Mohanaty B.K. Lobert M. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, it has been shown that RepA-DnaB interaction is required for DnaB complex formation at the pSC101 origin. Our results demonstrate that, although the replication initiation protein TrfA interacts with DnaB helicase (Figs. 6 and 7), this interaction is not required for DnaB helicase complex formation at the DnaA boxes. The formation of a DnaB complex at the replication origin in the absence of TrfA protein may be an important feature of RK2 replication initiation, which contributes to the broad host range replication activity of this plasmid. In this scenario, a DnaB helicase complex is formed at the RK2 origin, and it is activated by the TrfA-dependent opening of the 13-mer region and TrfA interaction with the DnaB helicase.

Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), plays a central role in the initiation of transcription due to its numerous enzymatic activities: the 3′-5′ XPB helicase opens DNA around the promoter (5Coin F.

Mutations in the two helicases XPB and XPD are associated with three rare genetics disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy (14Berneburg M. Lehmann A.R. Adv.

To understand the role of TFIIH in transcription, we have engaged projects on each subunit within TFIIH.

These various defects highlight the central role of p44 within TFIIH, with the understanding that this subunit also interacts with almost all the other subunits of the core TFIIH both in human and in yeast (20Bardwell L.

Having depicted the role of the N-terminal part of p44 which regulates the XPD helicase activity, we here focus our attention on the C terminus end. In the present study, we demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal cysteine-rich motif in preserving TFIIH architecture. We also show that double mutations in the RING finger motif affect the transcriptional activity of TFIIH by preventing its escape from the promoter. Baculoviruses expressing the TFIIH subunit were constructed in the pVL1392 or pACAB4 vectors (PharMingen). The cDNAs coding for XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p34 subunits of THIIH, and for cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1 subunits of the CAK complex, were inserted into the pVL1392 expressing vector (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Each p44 single mutant was obtained by PCR mutagenesis using two pairs of oligonucleotides on a wild type plasmid containing the p44 open reading frame: CCTCCTGCTAGCTCAAGTTCTGAA in combination with either GACACTGTGGAGCGAAATAGCCT, CCAAAGTAAGACAGCGATTTTACATTCAA, CTGACATCCATAAGCAAATCTTTCTCC, GGCACACAGCAGCAACATAAACATG, AGAAAACATTTTGGGCCACAGCACA, GCAACAGTGTAGAGAATCAGCAACAAAAAC, AGCCAGGGCAACAGGCTAGAGAATC, or GAATACAGCCAGGGGCACAGTGTAG (to synthesize the 5′ part of p44 C291A, C308A, C345A, C360A, C363A, H376A, H380A, and C382A, respectively) and CGGGTCCCAGGAAAGGATCCTCA in combination with either AGGCTATTTCGCTCCACAGTGTC, TTGAATGTAAAATCGCTGGTCTTACTTTGG, GGAGAAAGATTTGCTTATGGATGTCAG, CATGTTTATGTTGCTGCTGTGTGCC, TGGCTGTGGCCCAAAATGTTTTCT, GTTTTTGTTGCTGATTCTCTACACTGTTGC, GATTCTCTAGCCTGTTGCCCTGGCT, or CTACACTGTGCCCCTGGCTGTATTC (to synthesize the 3′ remaining part of these p44 mutations). The double mutants (C360A/C363A and H376A/H380A) were obtained by the same PCR procedure. The mutated fragment was then substituted to the wild type open reading frame using the BamHI/NheI restriction sites. Both XPB and cyclin H were fused to a 6-histidine tag at their N-terminal extremity. The resulting vectors were transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) inSf9 cells (Spodoptera frugiperda 9). The recombinant viruses were purified from isolated plaques, and viral stocks were prepared by a three-step growth amplification. The calculation of the multiplicity of infection of each virus stock solution as well as the determination of the best ratio for the expression of each subunit allowed us to optimize the coexpression of the different subunits stoichiometrically. Cobalt chelate affinity purification: Sf9 cells were infected with combinations of baculoviruses expressing the different subunits of TFIIH as described previously (23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 48 h after infection, cells were collected, washed, and dounced in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Nonidet P40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture, and then the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g during 30 min. The supernatants were first applied on a heparin-Ultrogel column. After a five-resin volume wash with buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl, the proteins were eluted with this buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. After a 3-h dialysis against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl) fractions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 140 fraction volume of cobalt chelate affinity resin (CLONTECH). After a 20-volume wash with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole, proteins were eluted with 100 mm EDTA and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 mm KCl for 3 h at +4 °C. Recombinant CAK was purified as described previously (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Infected Sf9 cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cross-linked to p44 antibody. The resin was washed twice with buffer C containing 150 mm KCl, and the elution was performed by incubating the resin 6–7 h at 4 °C in 0.15 ml of the same buffer in the presence of 2 mg/ml p44 epitope peptide and 0.2 mg/ml insulin. The run-off transcription assay was performed by incubating all general transcription factors (TFII-A, -B, -E, -F, -H, -TBP), RNA pol II, and the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) for 15 min at 25 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (24Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription was then carried out for 45 min at 25 °C in the presence of ribonucleotides including radiolabeled CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA transcripts were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide/urea gel and analyzed by autoradiography. The abortive initiation as well as the ATPase and the helicase assays were done as described earlier (5Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Bradsher J. Coin F. Egly J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2532-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; briefly RNA pol II and the basal transcription factors, including mutants or wild type rIIH6, were incubated with a premelted DNA (−8/+2) for 30 min at 28 °C in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, and dinucleotide ApG as an initiate substrate. After preinitiation complex formation the RNA synthesis was initiated upon addition of CTP, GTP, [α-32P]UTP, cordycepin, and 6.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 28 °C. The samples were applied on a 12% polyacrylamide/urea gel and analyzed by overnight autoradiography. The C-terminal part of p44 binds three zinc atoms through two independent modules: the first contains a C4 zinc finger motif (from aa 291 to aa 308) and chelates a zinc through Cys-291, Cys-294, Cys-305, and Cys-308. The second module is a RING finger motif (from aa 345 to aa 385) and binds two zinc through Cys-345, Cys-348, Cys-368, and Cys-371 and through Cys-360, Cys-363, and as strongly suggested in Ref. 26Fribourg S. Kellenberger E. Rogniaux H. Poterszman A. Van Dorsselaer A. Thierry J.C. Egly J.M. Moras D. Kieffer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31963-31971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, through two of these four residues: His-376, His-380, Cys-382, and Cys-385 (Fig. 1). Whereas the first motif does not exhibit a typical three-dimensional structure, NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1 B) shows that the second one assumes three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets (β1, Gln-332 to Ile-334; β2, Val-357 to Val-359; and β3, Val-366 to Cys-368) packed against a small α-helix (Val-369 to Asp-372). To investigate the role of the p44 cysteine-rich motifs in the overall activity of TFIIH, we have generated several points mutations in the conserved cysteines and histidines, among human to yeast, implied in the zinc chelation by changing them to alanine (Fig. 1 A). These have been generated by PCR following a classical procedure of site-directed mutagenesis. PCR products were subcloned into the pVL1392 vector and finally inserted into the baculovirus genome by recombination. Sf9 insect cells were thereafter infected with the recombinant viruses able to overproduce each of the wild type subunits of TFIIH, including XPB, p62, p52, p34, and XPD as well as the mutated p44. TFIIH subcomplexes (rIIH6, containing core TFIIH plus XPD, see “Experimental Procedures”) from infected insect cell extracts were either immunopurified using monoclonal antibodies directed toward p44 or were loaded on an heparin-Ultrogel column followed by a cobalt chelate affinity column. To analyze the role of the C4 zinc finger motif, we have mutated cysteines to alanine at position 291 and 308 (Fig. 1 A). Immunopurified rIIH6 complexes, carrying wild type or mutated p44, were washed at 150 mm salt and further analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3). Although all the rIIH6 subunits are present in the baculoviruses extracts (data not shown), both mutated recombinant IIH6/p44-C291A and IIH6/p44-C308A complexes lack p62 (lanes 2 and 3). When either p44-C291A or p44-C308A are coexpressed with p62, they are able to interact with this latter one (data not shown). It is worthwhile to mention that even at low salt concentration (150 mm), both C291A and C308A mutations in p44 do not allow integration of p62 within the core TFIIH. Furthermore, as expected in the absence of one TFIIH subunit, none of these two mutated rIIH6 complexes exhibit any transcriptional activity (data not shown). We then focused our attention on the RING finger motif and generated alanine point mutations in the following residues: Cys-345, Cys-360, Cys-363, His-376, His-380, and Cys-382 (Fig. 1 A). The rIIH6 complexes carrying these p44 mutations were purified from infected cell extracts and further analyzed by Western bloting. None of the p44 mutations were found to modulate the composition or the stoichiometry of the purified rIIH6 complexes (Fig. 2 B, upper panel, lanes 2–7). The various rIIH6 complexes were then tested in a run-off transcription assay containing, in addition to MLP, RNA pol II, the basal transcription factors, TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and CAK. The CAK subcomplex was purified using the ability of the cyclin H subunit to bind to a cobalt affinity column and was added in the reaction to stimulate the RNA synthesis. The amounts of rIIH6 were adjusted on the basis of p62 and p52 content, according to Western blot analysis. The transcriptional activity of the rIIH6 complexes was not modified by the p44 single mutations using the wild type recombinant IIH6 as a reference (Fig. 2 B,lower panel, compare lanes 2–7 with lane 1). It has to be noticed that CAK fully exerts its stimulatory function, thus demonstrating that a single mutation in the RING finger motif of p44 does not prevent CAK anchoring to the core TFIIH (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, when carrying double mutations in the RING finger motif of p44 (Fig. 1 A), rIIH6/p44-C360A/C363A and rIIH6/p44-H376A/H380A exhibit a strong reduction of their transcriptional activity (10% of residual activity) (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lanes 8and 9), although both complexes contain all the core subunits (upper panel, lanes 8 and 9). p44 is a central protein in the core TFIIH complex and has been shown to interact with XPB, XPD, p62, and p34 (20Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3926-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,21Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).2 We have expressed XPB, XPD, p62, or p34 and either wild type or mutated p44 and subsequently immunopurified the binary complexes using p44 antibody, to demonstrate that the p44 double point mutations do not modify the interactions with the subunits of the core TFIIH (data not shown). Having shown that double mutations in the RING finger motif were detrimental for transcriptional activity of rTFIIH, we were then wondering if it could affect its proper enzymatic activities. ATPase activity was then assayed in the presence of DNA by incubating each p44 mutated rIIH6 complex with [α-32P]ATP as a substrate. All of the complexes exhibit an ATPase activity similar to that of the wild type (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1–2 with lanes 3–10). The N-terminal part of p44 interacts with and regulates the XPD helicase within TFIIH, giving rise to its optimum transcriptional activity. To investigate whether p44 C-terminal mutations do not affect the interaction with the XPD helicase, we carried out immunoprecipitation on Sf9 extracts coinfected with baculovirus overexpressing XPD and either p44/C291A, p44/C308A, p44/C360A/C363A, or p44/H376A/H380A, using monoclonal antibody raised against XPD. After extensive washing at 0.4m KCl, the immunoadsorbed proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and tested for their ability to unwind the DNA. First, none of these p44 mutations prevent the interaction with XPD (Fig.3 B, upper panel, compare lane 1 withlanes 2–5). Second, not only p44wt, but each mutated p44 so far tested, are able to regulate similarly the XPD helicase activity (Fig. 3 B, lower panel, compare lane 6with lanes 1–5). Since the double mutations in the p44 RING finger motif do not affect TFIIH enzymatic activities, but are detrimental for its transcriptional function, we then wondered which step of the transcription is defective. Transcription initiation involves a succession of events, including promoter opening, first phosphodiester bond formation, promoter escape, and RNA elongation. We first investigated the ability of the rIIH6/p44-C360A/C363A and rIIH6/p44-H376A/H380A double mutant complexes to form the first phosphodiester bond, when added in an assay containing MLP in addition to the other transcription factors as well as the dinucleotide CpA, [α-32P]CTP, and CAK. Both rIIH6 mutated complexes, when compared with the wild type rIIH6, allow the association of CTP to the CpA dinucleotide to form a three-nucleotide-long product, meaning that the p44 RING finger mutations, detrimental for the run-off transcriptional activity of TFIIH, do not prevent the first phosphodiester bond formation (Fig.3 C, lower panel, compare lanes 2–3with lanes 4–7). This reaction is highly specific, since in the absence of either TFIIH or TBP, which initiate the formation of the preinitiation complex on the TATA-box, no synthesis occurs (Fig.3 C, lower panel, compare lane 8 withlanes 9 and 1, respectively). We then investigated the ability of rIIH6/p44-C360A/C363A and rIIH6/p44-H376A/H380A to allow the escape of RNA pol II from the promoter. This assay monitors the escape by using a premelted DNA template around the start site (from the position −8 to position +2), which circumvents the promoter opening step (5Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Holstege F.C. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and consequently the requirement of a functional XPB helicase. To allow the accumulation of products that escape the promoter, we employed the chain terminating ATP analog cordycepin, which stops transcription elongation at thymidines at position +17 and +31 (see Ref. 25Bradsher J. Coin F. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2532-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). The reaction is TFIIH-dependent and gives rise to 17- and 31-oligonucleotide length products (Fig. 3 C,upper panel, compares lane 8 with lane 9). Both rIIH6/p44-C360A/C363A and rIIH6/p44-H376A/H380A do not allow the RNA pol II to escape from the promoter to synthesize longer transcripts (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, comparelanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and5 and lanes 6 and 7, respectively). Together these results demonstrate for the first time the implication of p44, and more particularly its RING finger motif in the promoter escape step. It is now accepted that TFIIH joins the promoter late during the formation of the stable preinitiation complex. Once part of this closed and inactive preinitiation complex, and upon addition of ATP as a source of energy (27Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

XPD, the second helicase of TFIIH, does not play a role in the opening step, since present or not, mutated or not in its ATP binding site, RNA synthesis, although at a lower level, might occur. Rather it was suggested that it is its physical presence that is required for optimal RNA synthesis in addition to its ability to maintain the CAK complex within TFIIH. Indeed by binding on the one hand MAT1 and on the other hand p44, XPD likely bridges the CAK subcomplex to the core TFIIH (1Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 32Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The role of p44, as an essential subunit of the core TFIIH, was further sustained by the discovery that a mutation in its yeast counterpart (SSL1) conferred UV sensitivity due to a nucleotide excision repair defect (18Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was then found that mutations either in the N-terminal moiety of p44 or in the C-terminal end of XPD, by preventing their interaction and thus optimal XPD helicase activity, lead to a destabilization of TFIIH. Besides a role as the regulatory subunit of XPD, p44 presented in its C-terminal moiety a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain, which was defined to contain a RING finger motif by NMR studies (26Fribourg S. Kellenberger E. Rogniaux H. Poterszman A. Van Dorsselaer A. Thierry J.C. Egly J.M. Moras D. Kieffer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31963-31971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present study details the role of the C-terminal part of p44. First, mutations in the C4 zinc finger of p44 completely destabilize the overall architecture of TFIIH. Indeed mutations of the Cys-291 and Cys-308, which chelate a zinc atom together with the Cys-294 and Cys-305, prevent the formation of the core TFIIH: immunopurification, from infected insect cells extracts, of rIIH6 complexes carrying these mutations shows that these mutants lack the p62 subunit. This is not due to a decrease in the interaction between the mutated p44 and p62, since these proteins coimmunoprecipitate when they are coexpressed in insect cells. It is most likely due to a specific role of this C4 zinc finger motif in the structure of TFIIH, since first a complete depletion of p44, and second mutations in the RING finger motif, do not prevent the incorporation of p62 within TFIIH (this study and Ref.23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Second C360A/C363A and H376A/H380A double mutations in p44 inhibit TFIIH transcription activity. It is worthwhile to notice that the single mutation of one of these four residues has no effect on the basal transcription activity of TFIIH, indicating that chelation of a zinc atom by three amino acids (instead of four) is sufficient to maintain the RING finger motif of p44. Further investigations of the transcription reaction show that these double mutations in p44, although they allow the first phosphodiester bond formation, inhibit further RNA synthesis by RNA pol II, emphasizing the crucial role of the RING finger motif in the promoter escape process. Additional experiments have shown that this is not due to a defect in the XPD helicase activity within TFIIH (the present study) nor to the inability of cdk7 to phosphorylate the largest subunit of RNA pol II (data not shown). Indeed, CAK was still able to stimulate all the transcription reaction, when added to the rIIH6 complexes, showing that it is fully integrated within TFIIH upon XPD/p44 interaction. We can then assume that the defect of promoter clearance observed for the double RING finger mutants is not due to a defect of CAK activity, but rather to an inaccurate positioning of an other subunit of TFIIH, such as XPB. Indeed, we cannot exclude that p44 mutations might also prevent some protein-protein interaction in which the RING motif is required (26Fribourg S. Kellenberger E. Rogniaux H. Poterszman A.

To conclude, we can hypothesize that p44 could allow the slipping of TFIIH on the DNA during the promoter escape knowing that TFIIH is associated with the RNA pol II during the synthesis of the first 40–50 nucleotides (see Ref. 33Zawel L.

Whether or not the RING finger motif of p44 directly binds some transcription factors or the promoter, as suggested by cross-linking experiments 3R. H. Ebright, personal communication. or by gel shift assays 4A. Tremeau-Bravard, C. Perez, and J.-M. Egly, unpublished data. , remains to be further investigated.

The RING motifs can be classified into two subgroups according to the presence of a cysteine or histidine in the fifth position: C3HC4 (RING-HC) and C3H2C3 (RING-H2) fingers. Otherwise their composition and length can vary substantially. The RING finger has been found in a variety of eukaryotic proteins of diverse evolutionary origin that are involved in various cellular processes such as oncogenesis, development, signal transduction, and apoptosis (1Saurin A.J Borden K.L.B.

RING fingers have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions and formation of multi-protein complexes. The RING motif of promyelocytic leukemia gene product is important in the assembly of protein complexes linked to SUMO-1 (a small ubiquitin-like modifier protein) modifications (4Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RING finger has also been suggested to act as a DNA-binding motif (5Lovering R. Hanson I.M. Borden K.L. Martin S. O'Reilly N.J. Evan G.I. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Trowsdale J. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The function of many RING-containing proteins can be mediated through DNA binding or chromatin association. RAG1 is involved in V(D)J recombination complex, and RAD-16 participates in DNA repair (6Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5657-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RING finger-containing polycomb group proteins Psc, Su(z)2, Bmi-1, and RING1 are involved in the maintenance of the transcriptionally repressed state of genes by regulating chromatin structure (7Rastelli L.

Hasegawa M. Ishida A. Isono K. Taniguchi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5672-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor mediator TIFα is tightly associated with euchromatin (11Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas BRCA1 appears to be associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (12Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, the RING structures of these latter proteins have not been implicated in mediating their binding to chromatin or DNA.Recent intriguing results have shown that many RING proteins are able to mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination in vitro (13Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10364-10369Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 14Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. However, as pointed out by Lorick et al.(13Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10364-10369Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar), only some of these proteins are likely to function primarily as E3s, and the RING finger-mediated ubiquitination probably provides many of these proteins with a self-regulatory function.The small nuclear RING finger protein SNURF was initially identified as an androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Rat SNURF is a highly hydrophilic protein composed of 194 amino acid residues of which about 30% are charged (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The charge distribution of SNURF is asymmetrical; two negatively charged regions separate three basic amino acid clusters. The N terminus of SNURF encompasses a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and the C3HC4-type RING motif is localized in the C-terminal region. SNURF interacts with AR via its N-terminal region, whereas the RING finger plays a key role in the binding to promoter specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to AR and other steroid receptors, SNURF also enhances the activity of Sp1-regulated transcription. In contrast to many other coactivators, SNURF does not possess a conventional activation domain(s). To get better insight into the biological role of SNURF, we have studied the interaction of SNURF and its mutated forms with DNA. Our results indicate that SNURF possesses a general DNA binding activity that may explain some of its characteristics as a transcription-activating protein.DISCUSSIONThe rat RING finger protein SNURF was originally isolated as an androgen receptor-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (15Moilanen A-M.

The corresponding protein in human and mouse has been termed RNF4 (33Chiariotti L. Benvenuto G. Fedele M. Santoro M. Simeone A. Fusco A. Bruni C.B.

These sequences are highly conserved, exhibiting 96% identity between rat and mouse protein and 91% identity between rat and human. Interestingly, no obvious SNURF/RNF4 orthologs are found inDrosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to interacting with steroid receptors and Sp1 (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell.

Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol.

The actual molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by SNURF is not known as no clear-cut intrinsic transcription activation or repression function has been found for SNURF. One potential explanation for the effects of SNURF is that it associates with DNA. Our results indicate that SNURF indeed possesses a general DNA binding ability without an apparent nucleotide sequence specificity. Interaction of SNURF with dsDNA was found to be more resistant to ionic strength than that of another non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, HMG-1. SNURF was also able to bind to single-stranded DNA. A similar behavior has been previously reported for HMG-1 and HMG-2 as well as for HMG-14 and HMG-17 (37Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These HMG proteins are thought to function as architectural proteins that modify the structure of chromatin to generate conformations that facilitate or enhance various other DNA-dependent activities (27Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Some non-sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, such as Ku autoantigen, recognize preferentially DNA termini (38Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which was a property, however, not inherent to SNURF. With linear DNA molecules, the cooperative DNA binding mode of SNURF correlated with the length of the DNA fragment in a fashion that resembles the binding characteristics of heterochromatin protein 1 (39Zhao T. Heyduk T. Allis C.D. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28332-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin protein 1, HMG-14, and -17, SNURF also is capable of binding to nucleosomes (27Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 37Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 39Zhao T. Heyduk T. Allis C.D. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28332-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting that SNURF can recognize four-way junction DNA and that it shows binding preference for core histones H3 and H4. Binding to these DNA structures is a common property of many architectural proteins, and a wide variety of structurally and functionally unrelated DNA-binding proteins have been shown to bind preferentially to four-way junction DNA (40Zlatanova J. van Holde K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, HMGI(Y), that favors binding to the four-way junctions, has been reported recently to associate with SNURF/RNF4 (36Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Besides the RING structure and the two nuclear localization signals (a bipartite-type and an SV40-type), no other protein motifs have been identified in SNURF sequence (Fig. 2). Our results show that the intact RING finger motif is not essential for the ability of SNURF to bind to DNA, further supporting the role of this structure as a protein-binding motif (16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the basic amino acid cluster (8RKRR11), present in the N terminus of SNURF and overlapping with the bipartite nuclear localization signal, revealed that this sequence is primarily responsible for the interaction with DNA and binding to nucleosomes. Of the individual residues, Arg8 plays a key role in DNA binding. These results suggest that the SNURF-DNA interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature. Interestingly, this type of Arg-rich cluster in theDrosophila homeodomain protein Bicoid is necessary for the recognition of both DNA and RNA targets (41Niessing D. Driever W. Sprenger F. Taubert H. Jäckle H. Rivera-Pomar R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and similar motifs are found in a class of RNA-binding proteins (42Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, an intriguing possibility that, like the Bicoid, SNURF is capable of recognizing RNA targets as well.In addition to abolishing the DNA binding of SNURF, mutagenesis of the N-terminal basic amino acids also blunts the ability of the protein to stimulate transcription even though this particular SNURF domain is not centrally involved in heterologous protein interactions (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The relative DNA binding activity of various SNURF mutants correlated well with their ability to enhance transcription, strongly suggesting that interaction with DNA is essential for SNURF coactivator function. It is also worth pointing out that the mutations in the N terminus of SNURF did not alter nuclear localization of the proteins. Because also the RING finger-disrupted SNURF(C136S/C139S) interacts with DNA but is incapable of activating Sp1-mediated transcription (16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the binding to DNA cannot be the sole mechanism governing the ability of SNURF to activate transcription.Taken together with our previous results, these data imply that SNURF enhances Sp1 activity through a combinatorial effect, involving protein-protein interaction and DNA binding (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SNURF may function through a similar mechanism also with other transcription factors such as Gscl (35Lyngsø C. Bouteiller G. Damgaard C.K. Ryom D. Sanchez-Munoz S. Nørby P.L. Bonven B.J. Jørgensen P.

These results are reminiscent of the ability of HMG-1 to stimulate many sequence-specific transcription factors including steroid receptors (27Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 43Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a non-sequence-specific DNA binding activity has been recently shown for many coregulatory proteins implicated in steroid receptor function such as Hap46, TLS/FUS, and C1D/SUN-CoR (44Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 45Baechtold H. Kuroda M. Sok J. Ron D. Lopez B.S. Akhmedov A.T. J. Biol.

This may reflect the requirement of AR regions outside the DNA binding domain for an efficient interaction with SNURF (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). With regard to AR, our additional experiments have shown that SNURF influences nuclear compartmentalization of the receptor (25Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of DNA binding activity of SNURF in this process remains to be elucidated.In conclusion, our data suggest that SNURF is a bifunctional protein that can interact both with transcription factors and with DNA/nucleosomes, thereby promoting the assembly of nucleoprotein structures involved in transcriptional control. A similar bifunctional activity may be a feature common to many transcriptional coregulatory proteins. RING1 (really interesting new gene) finger is a motif of conserved cysteines and histidines that coordinate two zinc atoms in a “cross-brace” system, a ligation scheme distinct from those of the classical zinc fingers (1Saurin A.J Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 2Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The RING motifs can be classified into two subgroups according to the presence of a cysteine or histidine in the fifth position: C3HC4 (RING-HC) and C3H2C3 (RING-H2) fingers. Otherwise their composition and length can vary substantially. The RING finger has been found in a variety of eukaryotic proteins of diverse evolutionary origin that are involved in various cellular processes such as oncogenesis, development, signal transduction, and apoptosis (1Saurin A.J Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 2Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Borden K.L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). RING fingers have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions and formation of multi-protein complexes. The RING motif of promyelocytic leukemia gene product is important in the assembly of protein complexes linked to SUMO-1 (a small ubiquitin-like modifier protein) modifications (4Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RING finger has also been suggested to act as a DNA-binding motif (5Lovering R. Hanson I.M. Borden K.L. Martin S. O'Reilly N.J. Evan G.I. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Trowsdale J. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The function of many RING-containing proteins can be mediated through DNA binding or chromatin association. RAG1 is involved in V(D)J recombination complex, and RAD-16 participates in DNA repair (6Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5657-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RING finger-containing polycomb group proteins Psc, Su(z)2, Bmi-1, and RING1 are involved in the maintenance of the transcriptionally repressed state of genes by regulating chromatin structure (7Rastelli L. Chan C.S. Pirrota V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Alkema M.J. Bronk M. Verhoeven E. Otte A. van't Veer L.J. Berns A. van Lohuizen M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and Mel-18 is shown to act as a transcriptional repressor via binding to specific DNA sequence (10Kanno M. Hasegawa M. Ishida A. Isono K. Taniguchi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5672-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor mediator TIFα is tightly associated with euchromatin (11Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas BRCA1 appears to be associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (12Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, the RING structures of these latter proteins have not been implicated in mediating their binding to chromatin or DNA. Recent intriguing results have shown that many RING proteins are able to mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination in vitro (13Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10364-10369Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 14Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. However, as pointed out by Lorick et al.(13Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10364-10369Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar), only some of these proteins are likely to function primarily as E3s, and the RING finger-mediated ubiquitination probably provides many of these proteins with a self-regulatory function. The small nuclear RING finger protein SNURF was initially identified as an androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Rat SNURF is a highly hydrophilic protein composed of 194 amino acid residues of which about 30% are charged (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The charge distribution of SNURF is asymmetrical; two negatively charged regions separate three basic amino acid clusters. The N terminus of SNURF encompasses a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and the C3HC4-type RING motif is localized in the C-terminal region. SNURF interacts with AR via its N-terminal region, whereas the RING finger plays a key role in the binding to promoter specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to AR and other steroid receptors, SNURF also enhances the activity of Sp1-regulated transcription. In contrast to many other coactivators, SNURF does not possess a conventional activation domain(s). To get better insight into the biological role of SNURF, we have studied the interaction of SNURF and its mutated forms with DNA. Our results indicate that SNURF possesses a general DNA binding activity that may explain some of its characteristics as a transcription-activating protein. DISCUSSIONThe rat RING finger protein SNURF was originally isolated as an androgen receptor-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein in human and mouse has been termed RNF4 (33Chiariotti L. Benvenuto G. Fedele M. Santoro M. Simeone A. Fusco A. Bruni C.B. Genomics. 1998; 47: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences are highly conserved, exhibiting 96% identity between rat and mouse protein and 91% identity between rat and human. Interestingly, no obvious SNURF/RNF4 orthologs are found inDrosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to interacting with steroid receptors and Sp1 (15Moilanen A-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), RNF4 has been recently shown to associate with Gscl (goosecoid-like) homeodomain transcription factor (34Galili N. Nayak S. Epstein J.A. Buck C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 102-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activator of stromelysin I gene transcription (SPBP) (35Lyngsø C. Bouteiller G. Damgaard C.K. Ryo"
