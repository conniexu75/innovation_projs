https://openalex.org/W3194553971,"Fructose consumption is linked to the rising incidence of obesity and cancer, which are two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally1,2. Dietary fructose metabolism begins at the epithelium of the small intestine, where fructose is transported by glucose transporter type 5 (GLUT5; encoded by SLC2A5) and phosphorylated by ketohexokinase to form fructose 1-phosphate, which accumulates to high levels in the cell3,4. Although this pathway has been implicated in obesity and tumour promotion, the exact mechanism that drives these pathologies in the intestine remains unclear. Here we show that dietary fructose improves the survival of intestinal cells and increases intestinal villus length in several mouse models. The increase in villus length expands the surface area of the gut and increases nutrient absorption and adiposity in mice that are fed a high-fat diet. In hypoxic intestinal cells, fructose 1-phosphate inhibits the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase to promote cell survival5-7. Genetic ablation of ketohexokinase or stimulation of pyruvate kinase prevents villus elongation and abolishes the nutrient absorption and tumour growth that are induced by feeding mice with high-fructose corn syrup. The ability of fructose to promote cell survival through an allosteric metabolite thus provides additional insights into the excess adiposity generated by a Western diet, and a compelling explanation for the promotion of tumour growth by high-fructose corn syrup."

https://openalex.org/W3193575564,"Supersolid states simultaneously feature properties typically associated with a solid and with a superfluid. Like a solid, they possess crystalline order, manifesting as a periodic modulation of the particle density; but unlike a typical solid, they also have superfluid properties, resulting from coherent particle delocalization across the system. Such states were initially envisioned in the context of bulk solid helium, as a possible answer to the question of whether a solid could have superfluid properties1–5. Although supersolidity has not been observed in solid helium (despite much effort)6, ultracold atomic gases provide an alternative approach, recently enabling the observation and study of supersolids with dipolar atoms7–16. However, unlike the proposed phenomena in helium, these gaseous systems have so far only shown supersolidity along a single direction. Here we demonstrate the extension of supersolid properties into two dimensions by preparing a supersolid quantum gas of dysprosium atoms on both sides of a structural phase transition similar to those occurring in ionic chains17–20, quantum wires21,22 and theoretically in chains of individual dipolar particles23,24. This opens the possibility of studying rich excitation properties25–28, including vortex formation29–31, and ground-state phases with varied geometrical structure7,32 in a highly flexible and controllable system. Two-dimensional supersolidity is demonstrated using highly magnetic, ultracold dysprosium atoms."

Interactions between the nervous and immune systems have recently emerged as important regulators of host defence and inflammation1-4. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuronal and immune cells co-operate in brain-body axes to orchestrate metabolism and obesity. Here we describe a neuro-mesenchymal unit that controls group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), adipose tissue physiology, metabolism and obesity via a brain-adipose circuit. We found that sympathetic nerve terminals act on neighbouring adipose mesenchymal cells via the β2-adrenergic receptor to control the expression of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the activity of ILC2s in gonadal fat. Accordingly, ILC2-autonomous manipulation of the GDNF receptor machinery led to alterations in ILC2 function, energy expenditure, insulin resistance and propensity to obesity. Retrograde tracing and chemical, surgical and chemogenetic manipulations identified a sympathetic aorticorenal circuit that modulates ILC2s in gonadal fat and connects to higher-order brain areas, including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Our results identify a neuro-mesenchymal unit that translates cues from long-range neuronal circuitry into adipose-resident ILC2 function, thereby shaping host metabolism and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3193706068,"Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3194039967,"Protein quality control systems are crucial for cellular function and organismal health. At present, most known protein quality control systems are multicomponent machineries that operate via ATP-regulated interactions with non-native proteins to prevent aggregation and promote folding1, and few systems that can broadly enable protein folding by a different mechanism have been identified. Moreover, proteins that contain the extensively charged poly-Asp/Glu (polyD/E) region are common in eukaryotic proteomes2, but their biochemical activities remain undefined. Here we show that DAXX, a polyD/E protein that has been implicated in diverse cellular processes3-10, possesses several protein-folding activities. DAXX prevents aggregation, solubilizes pre-existing aggregates and unfolds misfolded species of model substrates and neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Notably, DAXX effectively prevents and reverses aggregation of its in vivo-validated client proteins, the tumour suppressor p53 and its principal antagonist MDM2. DAXX can also restore native conformation and function to tumour-associated, aggregation-prone p53 mutants, reducing their oncogenic properties. These DAXX activities are ATP-independent and instead rely on the polyD/E region. Other polyD/E proteins, including ANP32A and SET, can also function as stand-alone, ATP-independent molecular chaperones, disaggregases and unfoldases. Thus, polyD/E proteins probably constitute a multifunctional protein quality control system that operates via a distinctive mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W3195722571,"Social isolation and loneliness have potent effects on public health1-4. Research in social psychology suggests that compromised sleep quality is a key factor that links persistent loneliness to adverse health conditions5,6. Although experimental manipulations have been widely applied to studying the control of sleep and wakefulness in animal models, how normal sleep is perturbed by social isolation is unknown. Here we report that chronic, but not acute, social isolation reduces sleep in Drosophila. We use quantitative behavioural analysis and transcriptome profiling to differentiate between brain states associated with acute and chronic social isolation. Although the flies had uninterrupted access to food, chronic social isolation altered the expression of metabolic genes and induced a brain state that signals starvation. Chronically isolated animals exhibit sleep loss accompanied by overconsumption of food, which resonates with anecdotal findings of loneliness-associated hyperphagia in humans. Chronic social isolation reduces sleep and promotes feeding through neural activities in the peptidergic fan-shaped body columnar neurons of the fly. Artificial activation of these neurons causes misperception of acute social isolation as chronic social isolation and thereby results in sleep loss and increased feeding. These results present a mechanistic link between chronic social isolation, metabolism, and sleep, addressing a long-standing call for animal models focused on loneliness7."
https://openalex.org/W3195683697,"Abstract On Earth’s surface, there are only a handful of high-quality astronomical sites that meet the requirements for very large next-generation facilities. In the context of scientific opportunities in time-domain astronomy, a good site on the Tibetan Plateau will bridge the longitudinal gap between the known best sites 1,2 (all in the Western Hemisphere). The Tibetan Plateau is the highest plateau on Earth, with an average elevation of over 4,000 metres, and thus potentially provides very good opportunities for astronomy and particle astrophysics 3–5 . Here we report the results of three years of monitoring of testing an area at a local summit on Saishiteng Mountain near Lenghu Town in Qinghai Province. The altitudes of the potential locations are between 4,200 and 4,500 metres. An area of over 100,000 square kilometres surrounding Lenghu Town has a lower altitude of below 3,000 metres, with an extremely arid climate and unusually clear local sky (day and night) 6 . Of the nights at the site, 70 per cent have clear, photometric conditions, with a median seeing of 0.75 arcseconds. The median night temperature variation is only 2.4 degrees Celsius, indicating very stable local surface air. The precipitable water vapour is lower than 2 millimetres for 55 per cent of the night."
https://openalex.org/W3193345780,"Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) are materials that exhibit long-range order but lack periodicity in any direction. Although IQCs were the first reported quasicrystals1, they have been experimentally observed only in metallic alloys2, not in other materials. By contrast, quasicrystals with other symmetries (particularly dodecagonal) have now been found in several soft-matter systems3–5. Here we introduce a class of IQCs built from model patchy colloids that could be realized experimentally using DNA origami particles. Our rational design strategy leads to systems that robustly assemble in simulations into a target IQC through directional bonding. This is illustrated for both body-centred and primitive IQCs, with the simplest systems involving just two particle types. The key design feature is the geometry of the interparticle interactions favouring the propagation of an icosahedral network of bonds, despite this leading to many particles not being fully bonded. As well as furnishing model systems in which to explore the fundamental physics of IQCs, our approach provides a potential route towards functional quasicrystalline materials. Model patchy colloids with directional bonding are designed that assemble into icosahedral quasicrystals through the propagation of an icosahedral network of bonds and may be realized using DNA origami particles."
https://openalex.org/W3195669443,"Viral pathogens are an ongoing threat to public health worldwide. Analysing their dependence on host biosynthetic pathways could lead to effective antiviral therapies1. Here we integrate proteomic analyses of polysomes with functional genomics and pharmacological interventions to define how enteroviruses and flaviviruses remodel host polysomes to synthesize viral proteins and disable host protein production. We find that infection with polio, dengue or Zika virus markedly modifies polysome composition, without major changes to core ribosome stoichiometry. These viruses use different strategies to evict a common set of translation initiation and RNA surveillance factors from polysomes while recruiting host machineries that are specifically required for viral biogenesis. Targeting these specialized viral polysomes could provide a new approach for antiviral interventions. For example, we find that both Zika and dengue use the collagen proline hydroxylation machinery to mediate cotranslational modification of conserved proline residues in the viral polyprotein. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of proline hydroxylation impairs nascent viral polyprotein folding and induces its aggregation and degradation. Notably, such interventions prevent viral polysome remodelling and lower virus production. Our findings delineate the modular nature of polysome specialization at the virus-host interface and establish a powerful strategy to identify targets for selective antiviral interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3195785575,"The Sign test is a famous nonparametric test from classical statistics used to assess the one or two sample averages. The test is practical when the sample size is small, or the distributional assumption under a parametric test does not satisfy. One of the limitations of the Sign test is the exact form of the data, and the existing methodology of the test does not cover the interval-valued data. The interval-valued data often comes from the fuzzy logic where the experiment’s information is not sure and possesses some kind of vagueness, uncertainty or indeterminacy. This research proposed a modified version of the Sign test by considering the indeterminate state and the exact form of the data—the newly proposed sign test methodology is designed for both one-sample and two-sample hypothesis testing problems. The performance of the proposed modified versions of the Sign test is evaluated through two real-life data examples comprised of covid-19 reproduction rate and covid-positive daily occupancy in ICU in Pakistan. The findings of the study suggested that our proposed methodologies are suitable in nonparametric decision-making problems with an interval–valued data. Therefore, applying the new neutrosophic sign test is explicitly recommended in biomedical sciences, engineering, and other statistical fields under an indeterminate environment."
https://openalex.org/W3196113187,"Imaging techniques based on fluorescence and bioluminescence have been important tools in visualizing tumor progression and studying the effect of drugs and immunotherapies on tumor immune microenvironment in animal models of cancer. However, transgenic expression of foreign proteins may induce immune responses in immunocompetent syngeneic tumor transplant models and augment the efficacy of experimental drugs. In this study, we show that the growth rate of Lewis lung carcinoma (LL/2) tumors was reduced after transduction of tdTomato and luciferase (tdTomato/Luc) compared to the parental cell line. tdTomato/Luc expression by LL/2 cells altered the tumor microenvironment by increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) while inhibiting tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Interestingly, tdTomato/Luc expression did not alter the response of LL/2 tumors to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. These results suggest that the use of tdTomato/Luc-transduced cancer cells to conduct studies in immune competent mice may lead to cell-extrinsic tdTomato/Luc-induced alterations in tumor growth and tumor immune microenvironment that need to be taken into consideration when evaluating the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs and vaccines in immunocompetent animal models."
https://openalex.org/W3193667714,"Since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China, and due to the open accessibility of COVID-19 data, several researchers and modellers revisited the classical epidemiological models to evaluate their practical applicability. While mathematical compartmental models can predict various contagious viruses’ dynamics, their efficiency depends on the model parameters. Recently, several parameter estimation methods have been proposed for different models. In this study, we evaluated the Ensemble Kalman filter’s performance (EnKF) in the estimation of time-varying model parameters with synthetic data and the real COVID-19 data of Hubei province, China. Contrary to the previous works, in the current study, the effect of damping factors on an augmented EnKF is studied. An augmented EnKF algorithm is provided, and we present how the filter performs in estimating models using uncertain observational (reported) data. Results obtained confirm that the augumented-EnKF approach can provide reliable model parameter estimates. Additionally, there was a good fit of profiles between model simulation and the reported COVID-19 data confirming the possibility of using the augmented-EnKF approach for reliable model parameter estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3193648005,"Long-distance transport is associated with stress-related changes in equine immune function, and shipping-associated illnesses are often reported. Horses are frequently transported short distances, yet the effects of short-term transport on immune function remain largely unknown. Twelve horses, aged 15–30 yr, were assigned to either the control (n = 6) or treatment (n = 6) groups; treatment horses received a daily antioxidant supplement 3 weeks before and after transport. All horses were transported for approximately 1.5–2 hr on Day 0. Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture at 15-min pre- and post-transport and on Days –21, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21. Body temperature, heart rate, body weight, total cortisol, and gene expression of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12α, IL-17α, SAA1, and TNFα in whole blood were measured. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, stimulated with PMA/ionomycin, and stained for IFNγ and TNFα before analysis via flow cytometry. Statistical analyses were performed with significance set at P &lt; 0.05 (SAS 9.4). Transport and supplementation did not appear to affect body weight, heart rate, IL-4, IL-8, IL-12α, IL-17α, change (Δ) in the % and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFNγ + lymphocytes after stimulation, or Δ in the % and MFI of TNFα + lymphocytes after stimulation. Supplementation decreased IL-1β and SAA1 expression. Transport increased total cortisol concentration, body temperature, and IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 expression but decreased IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ expression. Short-term transportation affected physiological, endocrine, and immune responses; supplementation may ameliorate inflammation in aged horses. Immune responses were most altered at 15-min post-transport and typically recovered by Day 1, suggesting that horses may be vulnerable to disease during and almost immediately after short-term transport."
https://openalex.org/W3194608187,"Purpose To investigate the impact on services for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients during the COVID-19 (2019coronal virus disease) pandemic in one tertiary center in Beijing. Methods A retrospective cohort study. Two reviewed consecutive RRD patients cohorts of the same length were treated during two different periods: the COVID-19 pandemic and the pre-COVID-19 group. The characteristics of patients, surgery, anesthesia methods, length of hospital stay, and the latest follow-up were recorded and analyzed. Results There were 79 patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group with a 55.9% reduction (179). Compared to patients in the pre-COVID-19, patients in the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer presurgical waiting times (28days, 3days, p&lt;0.001), a higher percentage of patients with presurgical poor (less than 0.02) visual acuity (55.7%, 32.4%, p = 0.009), and a higher percentage of patients with presurgical choroidal detachment (34.2%, 19.6%, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the severity of presurgical proliferative vitreoretinopathy between the two groups (p = 0.64). Surgeries on pathological myopia patients with macular hole retinal detachment were postponed in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a lower percentage of scleral buckling (27.8%, 41.3%, p = 0.02) and a lower rate of subretinal fluid drainage (45.4%, 75.7%, p = 0.01) in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no significant difference in either postoperative visual acuity (p = 0.73) or the rate of single-surgery retinal attachment (p = 1) between the two groups. Patients in the COVID-19 pandemic had a shorter length of hospital stay (3hours, 35 hours, p&lt;0.001), and a lower percentage of patients received general anesthesia (48.1%, 83.2%, p&lt;0.001). None was infected with COVID-19 disease during the pandemic. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown caused prolonged presurgical waiting times, shorter hospital stays, less general anesthesia, and a significant reduction of RRD surgeries. The RD were more complicated, the surgeons were more conservative on procedures and patients selection, while the surgery outcomes were comparable."
https://openalex.org/W3195370463,"The catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) indicator has been used to measure the medical cost burden of households. Many countries have institutionalized their health insurance systems to reduce out-of-pocket payments, the main contributor to the financial burden. However, there is no method to estimate how the insurance coverage reduces the CHE. This study proposes an approach to evaluate the effectiveness of insurance in reducing the CHE impacts in terms of incidence and gap, which are based on a modified calculation method of CHE. Additionally, we apply these methods to data from the Korea Health Panel Survey (2011–2016). The results are as follows. First, under the setting of a threshold of 10%, the CHE incidence rate was 19.26% when the Korean national health insurance benefits reduced the CHE’s incidence for 15.17% of the population in 2017. Second, the results of the concentration index of CHE showed that the intensity approach of CHE is better than the incidence approach. Third, the new approach we applied revealed that health insurance reduces the burden of CHE to some degree, although it was not an efficient way to reduce CHE. In conclusion, this study provides new policy approaches to save the finances of national health insurance and reduce the intensity of CHE at the same time by raising the low-cost burden of medical services and lowering that of high cost. Moreover, we suggest that policymakers should focus on income level of the households rather than specific diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3195580287,"Community-based health insurance (CBHI) as a demand-side intervention is presumed to drive improvements in health services quality, and the quality of health services is an important supple-side factor in motivating CBHI enrollment and retention. There is, however, limited evidence on this interaction. This study examined the interaction between quality of health services and CBHI enrollment and renewal. A mixed-method comparative study was conducted in four agrarian regions of Ethiopia. The study followed the Donabedian model to compare quality of health services in health centers located in woredas/districts that implemented CBHI with those that did not. Data was collected through facility assessments, client-exit interviews, and key informant interviews. In addition to manual thematic analysis of qualitative data, quantitative descriptive and inferential analyses were done using SPSS vs 25. The process related (composite index including provider-client interpersonal communication) and outcome related (client satisfaction) measures of service quality in CBHI woreda/districts differed significantly from non-CBHI woredas/districts, but there were no significant differences in overall measures of structural quality between the two. The study found better diagnostic test capacity, availability of tracer drugs, provider interpersonal communication, and service quality standards in CBHI woredas. A higher proportion of clients at CBHI health centers gave high ratings of overall satisfaction with services. Individual and household factors including family size, age, household health care-related expenditures, and educational status, played a more significant role in CBHI enrollment and renewal decisions than health service quality. Key-informants reported in interviews that participation in the scheme increased accountability of health facilities in CBHI woredas/districts, because they promised to provide quality services using the CBHI premium collected at the beginning of the year from all enrolled households. This study indicates a need for follow-up research to understand the nuanced linkages between quality of care and CBHI enrollment."
https://openalex.org/W3195968166,"Acute gastroenteritis (AGE), characterized by diarrhea and vomiting, is an important cause of global mortality, accounting for 9% of all deaths in children under five years of age. Since the reduction of rotavirus in countries that have included rotavirus vaccines in their national immunization programs, other viruses such as norovirus and sapovirus have emerged as more common causes of AGE. Due to widespread use of real-time RT-PCR testing, sapovirus has been increasingly reported as the etiologic agent in both AGE outbreaks and sporadic AGE cases. We aimed to assess the role of sapovirus as a cause of endemic AGE worldwide by conducting a systematic review of published studies that used molecular diagnostics to assess the prevalence of sapovirus among individuals with AGE symptoms. Of 106 articles included, the pooled sapovirus prevalence was 3.4%, with highest prevalence among children <5 years of age (4.4%) and among individuals in community settings (7.1%). Compared to studies that used conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR assays had a higher pooled prevalence (5.6%). Among individuals without AGE symptoms, the pooled sapovirus prevalence was 2.7%. These results highlight the relative contribution of sapovirus to cases of AGE, especially in community settings and among children <5 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3195266199,"Routine immunization (RI) delivery was declared a public health concern in Nigeria in 2017 because of persistently low immunization coverage rates reported in independent surveys. However, administrative coverage rates remain high, suggesting serious data quality issues. We posit that a shorter timespan between service provision and data reporting can improve the monitoring of RI data, and developed a short message system (SMS) text reporting strategy to generate daily RI data points from health facilities (HFs). The goal was to assess whether daily data collection produces complete, reliable and internally consistent data points. The SMS reporting platform was piloted between December 2017 and April 2018 in two Local Government Areas (LGAs, equivalent to districts) of Nasarawa state, Nigeria. The 145 healthcare workers from 55 HFs received one mobile phone and pre-configured SIM card, and were trained to send data through predefined codes. Healthcare workers compiled the data after each vaccination session and transmitted them via SMS. We analyzed completeness, number of weekly sessions, and supportive supervision conducted. During the pilot phase, we received data from 85% (n = 47) of the 55 HFs. We expected 66 fixed-post sessions and 30 outreach sessions per week, but received data for 33 fixed-post and 8 outreach weekly session on average. More HFs reported on Tuesdays compared to other days of the week. When assessing internal consistency, we observed that the reported number of children vaccinated was sometimes higher than the number of doses available from opening a given number of vaccine vials. When found, this discrepancy was noted for all antigens during fixed-post and outreach vaccination sessions. Despite these initial discrepancies, transmitting RI data sessions via texting is feasible and can provide real-time updates to the performance of the RI services at the HF level."
https://openalex.org/W3081630787,"The success of deep learning in recent years has arguably been driven by the availability of large datasets for training powerful predictive algorithms. In medical applications however, the sensitive nature of the data limits the collection and exchange of large-scale datasets. Privacy-preserving and collaborative learning systems can enable the successful application of machine learning in medicine. However, collaborative protocols such as federated learning require the frequent transfer of parameter updates over a network. To enable the deployment of such protocols to a wide range of systems with varying computational performance, efficient deep learning architectures for resource-constrained environments are required. Here we present MoNet , a small, highly optimized neural-network-based segmentation algorithm leveraging efficient multi-scale image features. MoNet is a shallow, U-Net -like architecture based on repeated, dilated convolutions with decreasing dilation rates. We apply and test our architecture on the challenging clinical tasks of pancreatic segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images as well as brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We assess our model’s segmentation performance and demonstrate that it provides performance on par with compared architectures while providing superior out-of-sample generalization performance, outperforming larger architectures on an independent validation set, while utilizing significantly fewer parameters. We furthermore confirm the suitability of our architecture for federated learning applications by demonstrating a substantial reduction in serialized model storage requirement as a surrogate for network data transfer. Finally, we evaluate MoNet ’s inference latency on the central processing unit (CPU) to determine its utility in environments without access to graphics processing units. Our implementation is publicly available as free and open-source software."
https://openalex.org/W3193645742,"Previous research has identified subjective and objective knowledge as determinants of consumers’ acceptance of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in the medical and food industries. In contrast to a large body of literature on the effects of attitudes or knowledge on food preferences, the extent to which consumers’ knowledge affects their valuation of non-GMO food producing plants (i.e., plants grown for food or ornamental purposes) is less understood. This manuscript investigates the relationship between consumers’ knowledge of relevant non-GMO certification programs and their acceptance and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for non-GMO plants. The first study used an Internet respondent panel and choice experiment, while the second study utilized an in-person experimental auction. In line with previously reported low public acceptance of genetically modified food products, respondents were receptive of and willing to pay premiums for non-GMO food producing plants. This study found that subjective and objective knowledge impacted the premiums for non-GMO labels, with the high subjective and low objective knowledge group generating the highest WTP. Low subjective and low objective knowledge resulted in the lowest WTP. Findings suggest a disconnect between subjective and objective knowledge of non-GMO certification programs, which in turn influences consumer valuation of those products."
https://openalex.org/W3194406294,"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to originate in China from where it spread to other parts of the world. The first cluster of diseased individuals was reported in China as early as in December 2019. It has also been well established that the virus stroke Italy later in January or in February 2020, hence distinctly after the outbreak in China. The work by Apolone et al. published in the Italian Medical Journal in November 2020 and retracted upon expression of concern on 22 March 2021, however propose that the virus could have stroke people already in September 2019, possibly following even earlier outbreak in China. By fitting an early part of the epidemic curve with the exponential and extrapolating it backwards, we could estimate the day-zero of the epidemic and calculated its confidence intervals in Italy and China. We also calculated how probable it is that Italy encountered the virus prior 1 January 2020. We determined an early portion of the epidemic curve representing unhindered exponential growth which fit the exponential model with high determination >0.97 in both countries. We conservatively suggest that the day-zero in China and Italy was 8 December 2019 (95% CI: 3 Dec., 20 Dec.) and 22 January 2020 (95% CI: 16 Jan., 29 Jan.), respectively. Given the uncertainty of the very early data in China and adjusting hence our model to fit the exponentially behaved data only, we can even admit that the pandemic originated through November 2019 (95% CI: 31 Oct., 22 Dec.). With high confidence (p <0.01) China encountered the virus prior Italy. We generally view any pre-pandemic presence of the virus in humans before November 2019 as very unlikely. The later established dynamics of the epidemics data suggests that the country of the origin was China."
https://openalex.org/W3195289467,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD), which represents the optical attenuation, poses a major threat to the production activity, air quality, human health and regional sustainable development of arid and semi-arid areas. To some degree, AOD shows areal air pollution level and possesses obvious spatio-temporal characteristics. However, long-time sequences and detailed AOD information can not be provided due to currently limited monitoring technology. In this paper, a daily AOD product, MODIS-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), is deployed to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from 2000 to 2019. In addition, the importance of influencing factors for AOD is calculated through Random Forest (RF) Model and the propagation trajectories of pollutants are simulated through Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model. Spatio distribution of AOD presents a tendency that AOD value in northern Xinjiang is low while the value in southern Xinjiang is high. Regions with high AOD values are mainly concentrated in Tarim Basin. AOD in southern Xinjiang is the highest, followed by that in eastern Xinjiang and AOD value in northern Xinjiang is the lowest. Seasonal variation of AOD is significant: Spring (0.309) &gt; summer (0.200) &gt; autumn (0.161) &gt; winter (0.158). Average AOD value in Xinjiang is 0.196. AOD appears wavy from 2000 to 2014 with its low inflection point (0.157) appearing in 2005, and then increases, reaching its peak in 2014 (0.223). The obvious downward tendency after 2014 shows that the use of coal to natural gas (NG) conversion project improves the conditions of local environment. According to RF Model, NG contributes most to AOD. HYSPLIT Model reveals that aerosol in southern Xinjiang is related to the short-distant carriage of dust aerosol from the Taklimakan Desert. Aerosol there can affect Inner Mongolia through long-distant transport. Blocked by the Tianshan Mountains, fine dust particles can not cross the Tianshan Mountains to become a factor contributing to AOD in northern Xinjiang."
https://openalex.org/W3196267952,"In response to the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, Mexico implemented a volumetric tax of one Mexican peso (MP) per liter of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) in 2014. In contrast to Mexico’s volumetric tax design, the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa (ZA) implemented SSB taxes based on sugar density. This kind of tax is likely to yield larger health benefits than volumetric taxes by imposing a larger tax burden on high-sugar SSB and/or encouraging reformulation. However, sugar-density taxes might yield lower tax revenues. This study aims to simulate the effect of sugar-density taxes as those in the UK and ZA on SSB purchases (in terms of volume and sugar), SSB prices, and tax revenue in Mexico and compare this effect to its counterpart under the current volumetric SSB tax. Additionally, we simulate the effect of sugar-density taxes under different scenarios of reformulation. We conducted all these simulations based on a structural model of demand and supply using household purchase data for 2012–2015 in urban Mexico. We found that the current volumetric one-MP tax led to an SSB purchase reduction of 19% for both volume and sugar and an SSB price increases by MP $1.24. We simulated similar effects under the UK and ZA sugar-density taxes when these taxes were equivalent to the volumetric one-MP tax, and there was no reformulation. When assuming reformulation, the sugar reduction under the sugar-density taxes was up to twice larger than the volumetric one-MP tax. However, we found that the volumetric one-MP tax yielded the largest tax revenue across all tax designs. From a public health perspective, sugar-density taxes are likely to be more effective in tackling the overweight and obesity prevalence in Mexico; however, tax revenue might be lower under these taxes."
https://openalex.org/W3194197248,"Introduction Head injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, especially in resource-limited countries including Ethiopia. However, little is known about the mortality rate and its predictors among these patients in Ethiopia. Thus, the study aims to assess the incidence rate of mortality and its predictors among patients with head injury admitted at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods Institutional based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 1220 randomly selected head injury patients admitted from July 2017 to July 2019. Bivariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of mortality. Proportionality assumption was tested by a global test based on the Schoenfeld residuals test. Results The incidence of the mortality rate was 2.26 (95%CI: 1.9–2.6) per 100-person day observation. The independent predictors of time to death were age above 65 years (AHR:3.49, 95%CI:1.63, 7.48), severe TBI (AHR: 8.8, 95%CI:5.13, 15.0), moderate TBI (AHR:3, 95%CI:1.73,5.31), hypotension (AHR:1.72, 95%CI: 1.11,2.66), hypoxia (AHR:1.92, 95%CI: 1.33,2.76), hyperthermia (AHR:1.8, 95%CI: 1.23,2.63) and hypoglycemic (AHR:1.94, 95%CI: 1.34, 2.81) positively associated with mortality, while underwent neurosurgery was negatively associated with mortality (AHR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11,0.53). Conclusion The incidence of mortality rate among head injury patients was high. Older age, moderate and severe TBI, hypotension and hypoxia at admission, neurosurgical procedure, and the episode of hyperthermia and hypoglycemia during hospitalization were the independent predictors of mortality among head injury patients. Therefore, intervention to reduce earlier deaths should focus on the prevention of secondary brain insults."
https://openalex.org/W3194468082,"Deep learning based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to stereo matching. Compared with the traditional method, the speed and accuracy of this method have been greatly improved. However, the existing stereo matching framework based on a CNN often encounters two problems. First, the existing stereo matching network has many parameters, which leads to the matching running time being too long. Second, the disparity estimation is inadequate in some regions where reflections, repeated textures, and fine structures may lead to ill-posed problems. Through the lightweight improvement of the PSMNet (Pyramid Stereo Matching Network) model, the common matching effect of ill-conditioned areas such as repeated texture areas and weak texture areas is solved. In the feature extraction part, ResNeXt is introduced to learn unitary feature extraction, and the ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) module is trained to extract multiscale spatial feature information. The feature fusion module is designed to effectively fuse the feature information of different scales to construct the matching cost volume. The improved 3D CNN uses the stacked encoding and decoding structure to further regularize the matching cost volume and obtain the corresponding relationship between feature points under different parallax conditions. Finally, the disparity map is obtained by a regression. We evaluate our method on the Scene Flow, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 stereo datasets. The experiments show that the proposed stereo matching network achieves a comparable prediction accuracy and much faster running speed compared with PSMNet."
https://openalex.org/W3195703587,"Peach tree allergens are present in fruit, pollen, branches, and leaves, and can induce systemic, respiratory, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal symptoms. We studied the capacity of peach fruit/Pru p 1, Pru p 3, Pru p 4, Pru p 7 and peach pollen/Pru p 9 for inducing symptoms following oral or respiratory exposure in a large group of subjects. We included 716 adults (aged 21 to 83 y.o.) exposed to peach tree pollen and fruit intake in the study population. Participants completed a questionnaire and were skin tested with a panel of inhalant and food allergens, including peach tree pollen, Pru p 9 and peach fruit skin extract. Immunoglobulin E antibodies (SIgE) to Pru p 1, Pru p 3, Pru p 4 and Pru p 7 were quantified. Sensitised subjects underwent oral food challenge with peach fruit and nasal provocation test with peach tree pollen and Pru p 9. The prevalence of sensitisation to peach fruit was 5% and most of these had SIgE to Pru p 3, with a very low proportion to Pru p 4 SIgE and no SIgE to Pru p 1 and Pru p 7. In only 1.8%, anaphylaxis was the clinical entity induced. Cases with positive skin tests to peach and SIgE to Pru p 3 presented a good tolerance after oral challenge with peach fruit. The prevalence of skin sensitisation to peach tree pollen was 22%, with almost half recognising Pru p 9. This induced respiratory symptoms in those evaluated by nasal provocation. In a large population group exposed to peach fruit and peach tree pollen, most individuals were tolerant, even in those with SIgE to Pru p 3. A positive response to Pru p 9 was associated with respiratory allergy."
https://openalex.org/W3193316389,"Background Visual impairment (VI) is a decreased ability to see things which is critical problem for health professionals and students to whom normal vision is essential for their daily activity. If it is not timely managed, visual impairment leads to physical, psychological, and socio-economic malfunctions to the victims and nation. Despite the above impacts, currently there is no study in Ethiopia on this topic. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of visual impairment and its associated factors among Medical and Health Science students at the University of Gondar. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2020 among Medical and Health Science students. After recruiting study participants using systematic random sampling technique, we applied pre-tested self-administered questionnaire for sociodemographic variables and also visual acuity measurement was performed using Snellen chart placed at a distance of 6 meters. Visual acuity tested separately for each eye and for both eyes in a well- illuminated area. Pinhole was used for those participants with a visual acuity of &lt; 6/9. Participants with a presenting visual acuity of &lt; 6/12 in the better eye were diagnosed as having visual impairment. Epi data version 3.1 and stata version 14 were used for data entry and statistical analysis, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used, and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was reported to declare the statistical significance and strength of association between VI and independent variables. Results A total of 654 students were screened for visual acuity. The prevalence of visual impairment was 12.5% (95% CI: 10.21, 15.31). Age above 25 years (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.26) and current alcohol drinking (AOR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.7, 5.00), were statistically significant factors of visual impairment. Conclusion The prevalence of visual impairment among medical and health science students was high. Age of study participant and current alcohol consumption were statically significant factors. This study warrants the routine screening of Medical and Health science students for visual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3193442191,"The expected reduction of ice algae with declining sea ice may prove to be detrimental to the Pacific Arctic ecosystem. Benthic organisms that rely on sea ice organic carbon (iPOC) sustain benthic predators such as the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). The ability to track the trophic transfer of iPOC is critical to understanding its value in the food web, but prior methods have lacked the required source specificity. We analyzed the H-Print index, based on biomarkers of ice algae versus phytoplankton contributions to organic carbon in marine predators, in Pacific walrus livers collected in 2012, 2014 and 2016 from the Northern Bering Sea (NBS) and Chukchi Sea. We paired these measurements with stable nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) to estimate trophic position. We observed differences in the contribution of iPOC in Pacific walrus diet between regions, sexes, and age classes. Specifically, the contribution of iPOC to the diet of Pacific walruses was higher in the Chukchi Sea (52%) compared to the NBS (30%). This regional difference is consistent with longer annual sea ice persistence in the Chukchi Sea. Within the NBS, the contribution of iPOC to walrus spring diet was higher in females (~45%) compared to males (~30%) for each year (p < 0.001), likely due to specific foraging behavior of females to support energetic demands associated with pregnancy and lactation. Within the Chukchi Sea, the iPOC contribution was similar between males and females, yet higher in juveniles than in adults. Despite differences in the origin of organic carbon fueling the system (sea ice versus pelagic derived carbon), the trophic position of adult female Pacific walruses was similar between the NBS and Chukchi Sea (3.2 and 3.5, respectively), supporting similar diets (i.e. clams). Given the higher quality of organic carbon from ice algae, the retreat of seasonal sea ice in recent decades may create an additional vulnerability for female and juvenile Pacific walruses and should be considered in management of the species."
https://openalex.org/W3193445611,"Objective To explore the influence of biological characteristics on the yield of Amomum villosum Lour. and Amomum longiligulare T. L. Wu, to find an effective pollen viability evaluation method and storage method to solve the problem of the low yield of Amomum plants. Methods Five germplasm of Amomum plants were used to investigate the effects of the phenological phase, pollen viability, and stigma receptivity on natural and artificial fruit set. Results Amomum longiligulare T. L. Wu showed late flowering, and its natural pollination rate is higher than that of Amomum villosum Lour. In all germplasm, the artificial pollination rate and fruit setting rate are more than 3 times higher than that under natural conditions. Fruits begin to drop seven days after successful pollination, and the fruit drop is basically stable after one month. The hybridization verification showed that TTC method was simpler and more accurate than in vitro germination method. Optimal storage conditions for pollen are 4°C and high humidity. After 36 h of storage, pollen can still be used for artificial cross-pollination or as hybrid parents. Conclusion The special biological characteristics are the fundamental reason for the low natural pollination rate of Amomum plants. The accurate measurement method of Amomum plants pollen is the TTC method, and storage at 4°C and high humidity can increase the yield, which was six times that of the natural yield."

Aims The purpose of the current study is to provide the clinical and epidemiological standard of the population affected by COVID-19 in the city of Juiz de Fora, MG to better understand the disease and its risk factors, in order to enable more appropriate conduct for patients. Methods A retrospective observational study was carried out from March to August of 2020, with 266 participants admitted to the emergency department of the Instituto de Clínicas e Cirurgia de Juiz de Fora—Hospital Monte Sinai. Data were tabulated, analyzed, and classified according to the outcome using an ordinal regression model. Results Among the 266 admitted patients, the most common findings were ground-glass opacifications on chest CT (78.8%), cough (75.6%), fever (58.4%), and rhinorrhea (34.5%). There were greater severity and greater need for hospitalization and admission to the ICU in patients who were male, tachypneic at the time of admission, with older age, and with underlying diseases. Conclusion Collected data allowed for a better understanding of the disease, its severity criteria, and its pattern of affection in Juiz de Fora, MG. More studies based on the analysis of the behavior of COVID-19 in different regions must be carried out, to improve treatment and support to local populations."
https://openalex.org/W3194970883,"Human modification of water and nutrient flows has resulted in widespread degradation of aquatic ecosystems. The resulting global water crisis causes millions of deaths and trillions of USD in economic damages annually. Semiarid regions have been disproportionately affected because of high relative water demand and pollution. Many proven water management strategies are not fully implemented, partially because of a lack of public engagement with freshwater ecosystems. In this context, we organized a large citizen science initiative to quantify nutrient status and cultivate connection in the semiarid watershed of Utah Lake (USA). Working with community members, we collected samples from ~200 locations throughout the 7,640 km 2 watershed on a single day in the spring, summer, and fall of 2018. We calculated ecohydrological metrics for nutrients, major ions, and carbon. For most solutes, concentration and leverage (influence on flux) were highest in lowland reaches draining directly to the lake, coincident with urban and agricultural sources. Solute sources were relatively persistent through time for most parameters despite substantial hydrological variation. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus species showed critical source area behavior, with 10–17% of the sites accounting for most of the flux. Unlike temperate watersheds, where spatial variability often decreases with watershed size, longitudinal variability showed an hourglass shape: high variability among headwaters, low variability in mid-order reaches, and high variability in tailwaters. This unexpected pattern was attributable to the distribution of human activity and hydrological complexity associated with return flows, losing river reaches, and diversions in the tailwaters. We conclude that participatory science has great potential to reveal ecohydrological patterns and rehabilitate individual and community relationships with local ecosystems. In this way, such projects represent an opportunity to both understand and improve water quality in diverse socioecological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3193632569,"Objective This study aims to connect two strands of the psychology and economics literature, i.e., behavioural finance and agent-based macroeconomics, to assess the impact of managerial overconfidence at the micro and macro levels of the economy as a whole. Method We build a macroeconomic stock-flow consistent agent-based model that is calibrated for the specific case of Poland to explore whether the overconfidence of top corporate managers in the context of their initial capital structure decisions is detrimental for the firms being managed in this way, the financial market dynamics, and the selected macroeconomic indicators. We model heterogeneous firms with different capital structure decision criteria depending on their degree of managerial overconfidence. Our model also includes a complete macroeconomic closure with aggregated households, capital producers, banking, and a public sector. Results We find that firms with overconfident managers outperform in terms of investment and size but are also more fragile, thereby making them more likely to default. Finally, we run policy shocks and show that while investors’ flight to liquidity creates financial turmoil and increases the probability of default. Conclusions This paper contributes to the knowledge base by linking behavioural corporate finance and agent-based macroeconomics. In general, the excess overconfidence on the micro level, either an increase in the proportion of overconfident firms or a higher degree of overconfidence among managers, has a strong destabilizing impact on the economy as a whole on the macro level."
https://openalex.org/W3193897308,"Recent studies report seasonality in healthcare-associated infections, especially those caused by Acinetobacter baumannii complex. We conducted an ecologic study aimed at analyzing the impact of seasons, weather parameters and climate control on the incidence and carbapenem-resistance in A . baumannii complex bloodstream infections (ABBSI) in hospitals from regions with different climates in Brazil. We studied monthly incidence rates (years 2006–2015) of ABBSI from hospitals in cities from different macro-regions in Brazil: Fortaleza (Ceará State, Northeast region), Goiânia (Goiás State, Middle-west) and Botucatu (São Paulo State, Southeast). Box-Jenkins models were fitted to assess seasonality, and the impact of weather parameters was analyzed in Poisson Regression models. Separate analyses were performed for carbapenem-resistant versus carbapenem-susceptible isolates, as well as for infections occurring in climate-controlled intensive care units (ICUs) versus non-climate-controlled wards. Seasonality was identified for ABSSI ICUs in the Hospitals from Botucatu and Goiânia. In the Botucatu hospital, where there was overall seasonality for both resistance groups, as well as for wards without climate control. In that hospital, the overall incidence was associated with higher temperature (incidence rate ratio for each Celsius degree, 1.05; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.01–1.09; P = 0.006). Weather parameters were not associated with ABBSI in the hospitals from Goiânia and Fortaleza. In conclusion, seasonality was found in the hospitals with higher ABBSI incidence and located in regions with greater thermal amplitude. Strict temperature control may be a tool for prevention of A . baumanii infections in healthcare settings."
https://openalex.org/W3194251469,"Intensification of agricultural practices has drastically shaped farmland landscapes and generally caused a decline in spatial and temporal heterogeneity, thus leading to changes in habitat quality and food resources and a decline for most farmland birds Europe-wide. The relationship between complex landscape changes and habitat preferences of animals still remains poorly understood. Particularly, temporal and spatial changes in diversity may affect not only habitat choice but also population sizes. To answer that question, we have looked into a severely declining typical farmland bird species, the grey partridge Perdix perdix in a diverse farmland landscape near Vienna to investigate the specific habitat preferences in respect to the change of agricultural landscape over two decades and geographic scales. Using a dataset collected over 7.64 km² and between 2001 and 2017 around Vienna, we calculated Chesson’s electivity index to study the partridge’s change of habitat selection over time on two scales and between winter and spring in 2017. Although the farmland landscape underwent an ongoing diversification over the two decades, the grey partridges declined in numbers and shifted habitat use to less diverse habitats. During covey period in winter, partridges preferred also human infrastructure reservoirs such as roads and used more diverse areas with smaller fields than during breeding where they selected harvested fields but surprisingly, avoided hedges, fallow land and greening. Known as best partridge habitats, those structures when inappropriately managed might rather function as predator reservoirs. The avoidance behaviour may further be a consequence of increasing landscape structuring and edge effects by civilisation constructions. Besides, the loss in size and quality of partridge farmland is altered by crop choice and pesticides reducing plant and insect food. With declining breeding pairs, the grey partridge does not seem to adjust to these unsustainable landscape changes and farmland practices."
https://openalex.org/W3194726358,"Saliva biomarkers are suitable for monitoring the therapeutic response of canine oral melanoma (COM), because saliva directly contacts the tumor, and saliva collection is non-invasive, convenient and cost effective. The present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers from the salivary proteome of COM treated with surgery and a chemotherapy drug, carboplatin, 1-6 times, using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach. The expression of a potential salivary biomarker, ubiquitin D (UBD), was observed and verified by western blot analysis. A significantly increased ratio of free UBD (fUBD) to conjugated UBD (cUBD) was shown in the pre-surgery stage (PreS) in OM dogs with short-term survival (STS) (less than 12 months after surgery) compared with that with long-term survival (more than 12 months after surgery). In dogs with STS, the ratio was also shown to be augmented in PreS compared with that after surgery, followed by treatment with carboplatin twice, 4 and 5 times [After treatment (AT)2, AT4 and AT5]. In addition, the expression of fUBD was enhanced in PreS compared with that of AT2 in the STS group. In conclusion, this study revealed that a ratio of fUBD to cUBD in PreS was plausibly shown to be a potential prognostic biomarker for survival in dogs with OM."

Given that depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, it could affect the use of healthcare. This study aims to examine the association between the severity of new-onset depression and unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults.Data from 15,588 participants, derived from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were examined. Only individuals who were not diagnosed with depression was included to exclude those who visited hospitals to treat depression or were experiencing unmet healthcare needs due to depression. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and unmet healthcare needs acted as the dependent variable. A multiple/multinomial logistic regression analysis was built to analyze the association between the variables.Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs compared to those without (men: adjusted OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.40-3.00; women: adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.72-2.82). White-collar men with severe depression also had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs (adjusted OR = 9.72, 95% CI = 4.73-20.00). Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs due to economic hardship than those without depression (men: adjusted OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76-5.14, women: adjusted OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.96-4.38).This study identified a significant relationship between the severity of new-onset depression and the risk of having unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults. Our study suggests that having severe depression contributed to a higher risk of unmet healthcare needs. Proper care to manage depression can be promoted through future intervention programs that alleviate the risk of having unmet healthcare needs."
https://openalex.org/W3195852724,"Aim A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide linkage studies (GWLS) has identified multiple genetic regions suggestive of linkage with DN harboring hundreds of genes. Moving this number of genetic loci forward into biological insight is truly the next step. Here, we approach this challenge with a gene ontology (GO) analysis in order to yield biological and functional role to the genes, an over-representation test to find which GO terms are enriched in the gene list, pathway analysis, as well as protein network analysis. Method GO analysis was performed using protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) version 14.0 software and P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. GO analysis was followed by over-representation test for the identification of enriched terms. Statistical significance was calculated by Fisher’s exact test and adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) for correction of multiple tests. Cytoscape with the relevant plugins was used for the construction of the protein network and clustering analysis. Results The GO analysis assign multiple GO terms to the genes regarding the molecular function, the biological process and the cellular component, protein class and pathway analysis. The findings of the over-representation test highlight the contribution of cell adhesion regarding the biological process, integral components of plasma membrane regarding the cellular component, chemokines and cytokines with regard to protein class, while the pathway analysis emphasizes the contribution of Wnt and cadherin signaling pathways. Conclusions Our results suggest that a core feature of the pathogenesis of DN may be a disturbance in Wnt and cadherin signaling pathways, whereas the contribution of chemokines and cytokines need to be studied in additional studies."
https://openalex.org/W3196078627,"Image segmentation is a fundamental task in image processing and is still a challenging problem when processing images with high noise, low resolution and intensity inhomogeneity. In this paper, a weighted region-based level set method, which is based on the techniques of local statistical theory, level set theory and curve evolution, is proposed. Specifically, a new weighted pressure force function (WPF) is first presented to flexibly drive the closed contour to shrink or expand outside and inside of the object. Second, a faster and smoother regularization term is added to ensure the stability of the curve evolution and that there is no need for initialization in curve evolution. Third, the WPF is integrated into the region-based level set framework to accelerate the speed of the curve evolution and improve the accuracy of image segmentation. Experimental results on medical and natural images demonstrate that the proposed segmentation model is more efficient and robust to noise than other state-of-the-art models."
https://openalex.org/W3193524422,"People around the world are currently affected by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite its many aspects, symptoms, manifestations and impacts, efforts have been made to identify the root causes of the disorder. In particular, genetic studies have concentrated on identifying candidate genes for MDD and exploring associations between these genes and some specific group of individuals. The aim of this research was to find out the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in 6 candidate genes linked to the neurobiology of major depressive disorder in the North-Western population of Pakistan. We performed a case-control analysis, with 400 MDD and 232 controls. A trained psychiatrist or clinical psychologists evaluated the patients. Six polymorphisms were genotyped and tested for allele and genotype association with MDD. There were no statistical variations between MDD patients and healthy controls for genotypic and allelic distribution of all the polymorphisms observed. Thus, our analysis does not support the major role of these polymorphisms in contributing to MDD susceptibility, although it does not preclude minor impact. The statistically significant correlation between six polymorphisms and major depressive disorder in the studied population was not observed. There are inconsistencies in investigations around the world. Future research, including GWAS and association analysis on larger scale should be addressed for further validation and replication of the present findings."
https://openalex.org/W3193688561,"Facilitating the identification of extreme inactivity (EI) has the potential to improve morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. Apart from patients with obvious EI, the identification of a such behavior during a real-life consultation is unreliable. We therefore describe a machine learning algorithm to screen for EI, as actimetry measurements are difficult to implement. Complete datasets for 1409 COPD patients were obtained from COLIBRI-COPD, a database of clinicopathological data submitted by French pulmonologists. Patient- and pulmonologist-reported estimates of PA quantity (daily walking time) and intensity (domestic, recreational, or fitness-directed) were first used to assign patients to one of four PA groups (extremely inactive [EI], overtly active [OA], intermediate [INT], inconclusive [INC]). The algorithm was developed by (i) using data from 80% of patients in the EI and OA groups to identify 'phenotype signatures' of non-PA-related clinical variables most closely associated with EI or OA; (ii) testing its predictive validity using data from the remaining 20% of EI and OA patients; and (iii) applying the algorithm to identify EI patients in the INT and INC groups. The algorithm's overall error for predicting EI status among EI and OA patients was 13.7%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% confidence intervals: 0.75-0.92). Of the 577 patients in the INT/INC groups, 306 (53%) were reclassified as EI by the algorithm. Patient- and physician- reported estimation may underestimate EI in a large proportion of COPD patients. This algorithm may assist physicians in identifying patients in urgent need of interventions to promote PA."
https://openalex.org/W3194722752,"Pesticides in Pakistan are abundantly utilized for pest control in agriculture sector. The over and unsafe use of insecticides plus poor handling leads to the development of resistance, outbreak of secondary pests and hazardous impact on environment. The present study was aimed to access the current knowledge, attitude and common practices of farmers about the use of insecticides against pest in industrial triangle of Province Punjab, Pakistan. This study was conducted during October 2019 to February 2020. In this study farmers (n = 300) took part from three localities of Province Punjab (Gujrat, Gujranwala and Sialkot). Farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire to collect data about the knowledge of pest control by use of chemical method, biological method and combination of both to eradicate the pests. The result shows almost all (93%) farmers were male and they did not know about the insecticides mode of action and its chemical composition. They do not have any knowledge about the biological control of pests and did not get any assistance or help from Agriculture Extension Officer. They even did not properly dispose off the empty containers of insecticides. Statistical analysis reveals that lack of education and awareness about biological control of pest depicts development of resistance and outbreak of secondary pest including health hazards and environmental pollution. Poor understanding about pests, abundant use of insecticides, incorrect perception about application of insecticides and negligence regarding biological control shows that there is need to initiate public awareness programs to ensure the application of integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3195497700,"High-resolution melting (HRM) is a post-PCR method that allows to discriminate genotypes based on fluorescence changes during the melting phase. HRM is used to detect mutations or polymorphisms (e.g. microsatellites, SNPs, indels). Here, the (TTTAT)3-5 microsatellite polymorphism within intron 6 of the LDHA gene in pigeons was analysed using the HRM method. Individuals (123 homing pigeons) were genotyped using conventional PCR. Birds were classified into groups based on genotype type and the results were tested by qPCR-HRM and verified using sequencing. Based on the evaluated protocol, five genotypes were identified that vary in the number of TTTAT repeat units (3/3, 4/4, 3/4, 4/5, and 5/5). Sequencing have confirmed the results obtained with qPCR-HRM and verified that HRM is a suitable method for identification of three-allele microsatellite polymorphisms. It can be concluded that the high-resolution melting (HRM) method can be effectively used for rapid (one-step) discrimination of the (TTTAT)3-5 microsatellite polymorphism in the pigeon's LDHA gene."
https://openalex.org/W3194200534,"The growing popularity of big data analysis and cloud computing has created new big data management standards. Sometimes, programmers may interact with a number of heterogeneous data stores depending on the information they are responsible for: SQL and NoSQL data stores. Interacting with heterogeneous data models via numerous APIs and query languages imposes challenging tasks on multi-data processing developers. Indeed, complex queries concerning homogenous data structures cannot currently be performed in a declarative manner when found in single data storage applications and therefore require additional development efforts. Many models were presented in order to address complex queries Via multistore applications. Some of these models implemented a complex unified and fast model, while others’ efficiency is not good enough to solve this type of complex database queries. This paper provides an automated, fast and easy unified architecture to solve simple and complex SQL and NoSQL queries over heterogeneous data stores (CQNS). This proposed framework can be used in cloud environments or for any big data application to automatically help developers to manage basic and complicated database queries. CQNS consists of three layers: matching selector layer, processing layer, and query execution layer. The matching selector layer is the heart of this architecture in which five of the user queries are examined if they are matched with another five queries stored in a single engine stored in the architecture library. This is achieved through a proposed algorithm that directs the query to the right SQL or NoSQL database engine. Furthermore, CQNS deal with many NoSQL Databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, CouchDB, and NOE4J databases. This paper presents a spark framework that can handle both SQL and NoSQL Databases. Four scenarios’ benchmarks datasets are used to evaluate the proposed CQNS for querying different NoSQL Databases in terms of optimization process performance and query execution time. The results show that, the CQNS achieves best latency and throughput in less time among the compared systems."
https://openalex.org/W3194905545,"Patients have ever-increasing access to web-based news about hopeful scientific developments that may or may not cure them in the future. Science communication experts agree that the quality of news provision is not always guaranteed. However, literature does not clarify in what way users are actually affected by typical news characteristics such as the news object (described developmental phase of an innovation), the news source (degree of authority), and the news style (degree of language intensification). An online vignette experiment (N = 259) investigated causal relationships between characteristics of news about diabetes innovations and patients’ perceptions of future success, their interest in the innovation, and attitudes regarding current therapy adherence. Findings show that descriptions of success in mice led to higher estimations of future success chances than earlier and later developmental phases. Furthermore, news from a nonauthoritative source led to an increased interest in the innovation, and a more negative attitude towards current lifestyle advice. Lastly, the intensification of the language used in news messages showed slight adverse effects on the readers’ attitude. These findings, combined with their small effect sizes, support the optimistic view that diabetes patients are generally critical assessors of health news and that future research on this topic should focus on affected fragile subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W3195056360,"The Bicoid (Bcd) protein is a primary determinant of early anterior-posterior (AP) axis specification in Drosophila embryogenesis. This morphogen is spatially distributed in an anterior-high gradient, and affects particular AP cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The early distribution and dynamics of the bicoid ( bcd ) mRNA, the source for the Bcd protein gradient, is not well understood, leaving a number of open questions for how Bcd positional information develops and is regulated. Confocal microscope images of whole early embryos, stained for bcd mRNA or the Staufen (Stau) protein involved in its transport, were processed to extract quantitative AP intensity profiles at two depths (apical—under the embryo surface but above the nuclear layer; and basal–below the nuclei). Each profile was quantified by a two- (or three-) exponential equation. The parameters of these equations were used to analyze the early developmental dynamics of bcd . Analysis of 1D profiles was compared with 2D intensity surfaces from the same images. This approach reveals strong early changes in bcd and Stau, which appear to be coordinated. We can unambiguously discriminate three stages in early development using the exponential parameters: pre-blastoderm (1–9 cleavage cycle, cc), syncytial blastoderm (10–13 cc) and cellularization (from 14A cc). Key features which differ in this period are how fast the first exponential (anterior component) of the apical profile drops with distance and whether it is higher or lower than the basal first exponential. We can further discriminate early and late embryos within the pre-blastoderm stage, depending on how quickly the anterior exponential drops. This relates to the posterior-wards spread of bcd in the first hour of development. Both bcd and Stau show several redistributions in the head cytoplasm, quite probably related to nuclear activity: first shifting inwards towards the core plasm, forming either protrusions (early pre-blastoderm) or round aggregations (early nuclear cleavage cycles, cc, 13 and 14), then moving to the embryo surface and spreading posteriorly. These movements are seen both with the 2D surface study and the 1D profile analysis. The continued spreading of bcd can be tracked from the time of nuclear layer formation (later pre-blastoderm) to the later syncytial blastoderm stages by the progressive loss of steepness of the apical anterior exponential (for both bcd and Stau). Finally, at the beginning of cc14 (cellularization stage) we see a distinctive flip from the basal anterior gradient being higher to the apical gradient being higher (for both bcd and Stau). Quantitative analysis reveals substantial (and correlated) bcd and Stau redistributions during early development, supporting that the distribution and dynamics of bcd mRNA are key factors in the formation and maintenance of the Bcd protein morphogenetic gradient. This analysis reveals the complex and dynamic nature of bcd redistribution, particularly in the head cytoplasm. These resemble observations in oogenesis; their role and significance have yet to be clarified. The observed co-localization during redistribution of bcd and Stau may indicate the involvement of active transport."
https://openalex.org/W3195083115,"Chronic enteropathies are a common problem in dogs, but many aspects of the pathogenesis remain unknown, making the therapeutic approach challenging in some cases. Environmental factors are intimately related to the development and perpetuation of gastrointestinal disease and the gut microbiome has been identified as a contributing factor. Previous studies have identified dysbiosis and reduced bacterial diversity in the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs with chronic enteropathies. In this case-controlled study, we use flow cytometry and 16S rRNA sequencing to characterise bacteria highly coated with IgA or IgG in faecal samples from dogs with chronic enteropathy and evaluated their correlation with disease and resolution of the clinical signs. IgA and IgG-coated faecal bacterial counts were significantly higher during active disease compared to healthy dogs and decreased with the resolution of the clinical signs. Characterisation of taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with IgA and IgG showed marked variation between dogs and disease states, and different patterns of immunoglobulin enrichment were observed in dogs with chronic enteropathy, particularly for Erysipelotrichaceae , Clostridicaceae , Enterobacteriaceae , Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae , families. Although, members of these bacterial groups have been associated with strong immunogenic properties and could potentially constitute important biomarkers of disease, their significance and role need to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3195095995,"Humid coastal dune slacks are an endangered habitat in Northwestern Europe. In the UK, dune slacks are currently classified as being in 'unfavourable' condition, with projected decrease in England of up to 30% by 2036. Studies in mainland Europe suggest that regional factors (e.g. slack area, age, and isolation) are more important than local factors (e.g. soil, pH, soil nutrient and water status) in driving successional vegetation processes in coastal slacks. However, this has never been tested for the UK, where approximately 14% of European slacks occur. We used previously established survey protocols to test whether regional factors are more important than local factors in UK coastal slacks, along the Sefton Coast in NW England. We found that slack area and slack age were more important than local factors in driving plant community composition and species richness. We also showed that higher levels of management, such as active grazing and invasive shrub and tree removal, are effective in increasing soil moisture levels in slacks. Our results suggest that similar successional processes are likely to be important in slacks in the NW of England, compared to mainland Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3195820473,"S100B is frequently elevated in malignant melanoma. A regulatory mechanism was uncovered here in which elevated S100B lowers mRNA and secreted protein levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) and inhibits an autocrine loop whereby IL6 activates STAT3 signaling. Our results showed that S100B affects IL6 expression transcriptionally. S100B was shown to form a calcium-dependent protein complex with the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which in turn sequesters RSK into the cytoplasm. Consistently, S100B inhibition was found to restore phosphorylation of a nuclear located RSK substrate, CREB, which is a potent transcription factor for IL6 expression. Thus, elevated S100B reduces IL6-STAT3 signaling via RSK signaling pathway in malignant melanoma. Indeed, the elevated S100B levels in malignant melanoma cell lines correspond to low levels of IL6 and p-STAT3."
