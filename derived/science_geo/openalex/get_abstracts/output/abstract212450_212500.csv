The production of oxaloacetate in the presence of malate dehydrogenase caused an oxidation of NADH and a decrease in absorption at 340 mp. Absorbance readings were taken every 4 minute, and the rate of NADH oxidation from 1 to 3 minutes was used to calculate the rate of the cleavage reaction. Total amounts of citryl-CoA were measured in a similar system except that only 0.01 to 0.03 pmole of citryl-CoA was added to an excess of citrate cleavage enzyme, and the total decrease in absorbance at 340 rnp was determined. Sulfhydryl was measured according to the method of Ellman (8). Acetyl-CoA was determined enzymatically with citrate- condensing enzyme (9). Hydroxamate was measured by the method of Lipmann and Tuttle (10). Oxaloacetate was deter- mined enzymatically by using malate dehydrogenase and NADH and by measuring the total decrease in absorbance at 340 mp. Citryl-CoA was prepared by adding small aliquots of a tetra- hydrofuran solution of 0.25"

https://openalex.org/W992049084,"SUMMARY The combination of lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit skeletal muscle with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was in- vestigated fluorimetrically with the temperature jump method. Best agreement with the experimental results and the data of Zewe and Fromm is obtained by assuming a fast bimolecular step which is followed by a slow monomolecular interconversion. The dissociation constant of the former is 6 pM equilibrium con- stant of the latter is 0.3, resulting in an over-all dissociation con- stant of 1.4 PM. The bimolecular velocity constant is estimated near log M-’ set-I; the consecutive monomolecular constant is evaluated at 1000 se@. The enthalpy of the bimolecular reac- tion step is near 7 kcal per mole; that of the monomolecular one is nearly one-fifth of the former. The signal height of the chemi- cal change is generally only 10% of the total change, the re- mainder being caused by the change of fluorescence yield with temperature. Acknowledgments-We would like to express our high apprecia- 7 The reasoning for assuming this condition is quite similar to the reasoning outlined in footnote 5."

https://openalex.org/W2068920546,IT was recently reported that the adenylic acid deaminase from human erythrocytes required ammonia or a monovalent metal ion as an essential co-factor1. It has also been reported that ATP activates this enzyme from dog brain2 and beef brain3. In this report the effect of the simultaneous presence of ATP and a monovalent cation on the rabbit brain adenylic acid deaminase is presented.

https://openalex.org/W181224096,"Ustilagic acid is a water-insoluble glycolipid produced by Ustilago may&, the corn smut fungus. It was discovered by Haskins (l), and its structure was elucidated by Lemieux, Thorn, and Bauer (2, 3). Pilot plant quantities are being produced in Japan.’ Ustilagic acid was shown to be a mixture of acylated derivatives of /I-n-cellobiosyl-15u, l&dihydroxy-n-hexadecanoic acid (glucoustilic acid A) and @-D-cellobiosyl-2n, 15~~ 16-trihydroxy-n-hexadecanoic acid (glucoustilic acid B). The major components (Fig. 1) of the mixture were considered to be diesters of the glucoustilic acids with acetic acid and either n-P-hydroxyn-hexanoic or L-P-hydroxy-n-octanoic acid. Minor components may contain n-hexanoyl groups. This work on the digestion of the complex, insoluble ustilagic acids was undertaken to determine the effect of acylation on the degradation of glycosides by fungi."
