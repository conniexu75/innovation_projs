https://openalex.org/W2023714230,"INDIRECT, evidence has suggested that subacute scleros-ing panencephalitis (SSPE, Dawson's encephalitis, van Bogaert's leukoencephalitis)—hardened inflammation of the brain—is associated with measles virus. This association is supported by: (1) the presence of type A inclusion bodies in brain tissue specimens1; (2) specific immuno-fluoresceiice with measles antibody in brain biopsies2; (3) extremely high measles complement fixing (OF) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres in the sera and spinal fluid2; and (4) electron microscopic evidence of paramyxovirus-like particles and nucleocapsids in brain biopsies3. We describe here the successful isolation of the presumed aetiological agent of SSPE."
https://openalex.org/W1575089413,"Studies on the interrelationship of binding sites for estrogens found in cytosol and nuclear fractions of the rat uterus show that 17β-estradiol is first associated with a protein (9 S) present in the cytosol. The estrogen subsequently moves into the nucleus where it is bound to a protein (5 S) which can be extracted from the chromatin. Simultaneously with the movement of the estrogen into the nucleus, the binding protein of the cytosol disappears or loses its ability to bind estrogen. These and other experiments are discussed in terms of a hypothetical model in which estrogen binds to a cytosol receptor protein, bringing about a change in its conformation and its subsequent movement into the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1584860553,"Abstract The mechanism of the conversion of l-cysteine to l-cysteinesulfinic acid in the presence of oxygen, reduced pyridine nucleotide, Fe2+, and an enzyme from rat liver cytoplasm was studied with the aid of 18O2 and H218O. A procedure is described for the isolation of small quantities of cysteinesulfinic acid from enzyme reaction mixtures. Mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatically synthesized cysteinesulfinic acid showed that both oxygen atoms originated from molecular O2. When corrected for nonenzymatic exchange reactions, no oxygen originating from water could be detected in the sulfinyl group. Thus the conversion of cysteine to cysteinesulfinic acid does not involve dehydrogenation steps. Since reduced pyridine nucleotide is not stoichiometrically utilized in the reaction, the reaction appears to be catalyzed by a dioxygenase rather than by two hydroxylases (mixed function oxidases) acting sequentially."
https://openalex.org/W1540898834,"Abstract A reproducible procedure for the large scale purification of pig heart supernatant malate dehydrogenase which yields up to 400 mg of homogeneous protein has been developed. The purity of the isolated enzyme is shown by acrylamide gel electrophoresis over a pH range from 4.9 to 9.2 as well as by detailed analysis of boundary spreading during sedimentation velocity experiments. Three enzymically active zones of enzyme were observed on gel electrophoresis at pH 4.9. Physical properties, including the partial specific volume, s20,w, apparent diffusion coefficient, molar extinction coefficient, and molecular weight, have been evaluated. Chemical determinations include a detailed quantitative amino acid analysis, amino end group analysis, and the preparation of peptide maps of tryptic digests of the enzyme. The results indicate that pig heart supernatant malate dehydrogenase is made up of two identical or very similar subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2027316768,"INSULIN in vitro fails to restore normal rates of glucose uptake, glucolysis and glucose oxidation in the alloxan–diabetic rat heart. This insulin resistance is reversed by hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy, and it may be caused by the inhibition of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase1,2. Similar changes may be induced in hearts from non-diabetic rats by in vitro perfusion with fatty acids, so it has been suggested that these changes in the diabetic heart are a consequence of increased rates of hydrolysis of muscle triglyceride and oxidation of fatty acid2,3. Attempts to substantiate this suggestion by the use of known antilipolytic drugs were frustrated by their low activity in muscle preparations. The effect of fatty acids may depend on their oxidation leading to elevated tissue concentrations of acetyl CoA and citrate which may inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase and hexokinase2. This suggested an alternative approach using inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation and in particular inhibitors of carnitine acyl transferase because of the apparently specific role of this enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. Acyl D-carnitines, which are potent inhibitors of the transferase, were unsuitable because of their toxicity. Tubbs and Chase4 have described inhibition of carnitine acyl transferase and of fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria with coenzyme A derivatives of 2-bromostearate and 2-bromolaurate. Conditions have been defined in which 2-bromostearate can be used as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation in the perfused heart, and these results are described here."

https://openalex.org/W1518581960,"Abstract The addition of 4-pentenoic acid to liver homogenates results in a decrease in long chain fatty acids oxidation and in gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis is not affected, whereas lactate oxidation to CO2 is inhibited. There is an increased formation of alanine and decreased levels of glutamate and aspartate. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis is partially reversed by the addition of short chain fatty acids or of (-)-palmitylcarnitine and totally reversed by addition of coenzyme A and carnitine, but not by either one alone. Only the combination of CoA and carnitine partially reversed the inhibition of lactate oxidation. The formation of pentenoylcarnitine and acrylylcarnitine upon incubation with 4-pentenoate has been shown. The data presented suggest that the metabolic effects produced by 4-pentenoate are caused at least partially by accumulation of nonmetabolizable acyl-CoAs and acylcarnitines derived from the acid, thus making both carnitine and CoA unavailable for normal metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W1489537653,"Abstract Urease catalyzes the degradation of dihydroxyurea (HOHN-CO-NHOH) in aqueous solution. It was shown that the decline in dihydroxyurea was paralleled by the appropriate stoichiometric appearance of hydroxylamine and carbon dioxide, thus eliminating adsorption and contaminant substrates as the responsible factors. The reaction was not elicited by equivalent concentrations of bovine serum albumin, and the dihydroxyurea/urea specific activity ratio was maintained over a 70-fold range of urease purity. The catalysis is thus urease-specific and not due to proteins in general, nor to another enzyme contaminating urease preparations. In Tris-maleate buffers the pH activity curves for dihydroxyurea, (mono)hydroxyurea, and urea all had maxima at pH 7.0, with progressive narrowing of the activity range as hydroxylamine groups replaced amine groups in the substrates. Despite a high Km = 12.5 mm, dihydroxyurea, which has no primary amide bond, was hydrolyzed more rapidly than (mono)hydroxyurea, which has. Like the latter compound, dihydroxyurea also produced marked inhibition of urease. The inhibition was less powerful, however, than that generated by hydroxyurea and the aliphatic hydroxamates, and was kinetically reversible and noncompetitive with Ki = 0.14 mm."

https://openalex.org/W1527528201,"Abstract Analysis by type of the RNA of microsomes and of ribosomes was performed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and by chromatography on Sephadex G-200. Microsomal RNA consists of high molecular weight RNA, 5 S RNA, and transfer RNA in the proportions of 93%, 1.6%, and 5.9%, respectively. RNA of ribosomes of molecular weight less than about 150,000 differed from that of microsomes only in the content of tRNA. Incubation of microsomes at 37° in solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in breakdown of high molecular weight RNA."

Because the interaction of this fraction with sugars resembled in several respects the interactions of taste receptors in vivo, we suggested that it contained the chemoreceptor molecule for sweet-tasting compounds. The active component was subsequently purified and was characterized as a cationic protein of high molecular weight2."

https://openalex.org/W1969505300,"SEASONAL resorption of the penis accompanying regression of the testis has been recorded in some dioecious Proso-branch gastropods. Nassarius obsoletus is said to resorb the penis at the end of the breeding season and regenerate it almost immediately1; a similar phenomenon has been described in the periwinkle Littorina littorea: the penis is said to become reduced in August and September, perhaps disappearing altogether2,3. This reduction has been described histologically3. Reduction of the penis in L. littorea during the summer is a well established phenomenon in current literature4. In L. saxatilis the penis, testes and seminal vesicles have been reported to be much reduced in size during the summer5. In L. obtusata, however, which breeds all the year round, the penis seems to remain constant in size after sexual maturity is reached (ref. 3 and personal communication from D. Guiterman). Tills is also the case ID the Hawaiian species L. pintado and L. picta, where breeding is again continuous6."

Egg yolk, which is a prolific source of cholesterol, is therefore viewed with suspicion in many parts of the world.
