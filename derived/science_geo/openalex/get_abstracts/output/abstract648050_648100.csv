https://openalex.org/W3008458314,"The goal of this exploratory study was to delineate health differences among transgender subpopulations (transgender women/TW, transgender men/TM, gender nonbinary/GNB adults). 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed to compare the health of three groups (TW:N = 369; TM:N = 239; GNB:N = 156). Logistic regression and adjusted odds ratios were used to determine whether health outcomes (fair/poor health, frequent physical and mental unhealthy days, chronic health conditions, and health problems/impairments) are related to group and its interaction with personal characteristics and socioeconomic position. Group was a significant predictor of fair/poor health and frequent mental unhealthy days, revealing significant health differences between the transgender groups. The odds of poor/fair health were approximately 2.5 times higher in TM and GNB adults relative to TW. The odds of frequent mental unhealthy days for TM were approximately 1.5-2 times greater than TW and GNB adults. Among those with health insurance, the odds of fair/poor health for GNB adults was more than 1.5-2 times higher that of TM and TW. Among those without health insurance, TM had over 7 times greater odds of fair/poor health than TW. This study underscores the importance of classifying and examining the health of the transgender population as unique subpopulations, as notable health differences were discovered. TM and GNB adults have significant health concerns, requiring the attention of clinical interventions aimed at promoting health and preventing illness."
https://openalex.org/W3007379062,"Psilocybin, a substance mainly found in mushrooms of the genus psilocybe, has been historically used for ritualistic, recreational and, more recently, medicinal purposes. The scientific literature suggests low toxicity, low risk of addiction, overdose, or other causes of injury commonly caused by substances of abuse, with growing interest in the use of this substance for conditions such as treatment-resistant depression. However, the presence of negative outcomes linked to psilocybin use is not clear yet. The objective of this study is to investigate the negative effects of psilocybin consumption, according to the users' own perception through self-reports extracted from an online platform. 346 reports were analyzed with the assistance of the IRAMUTEQ textual analysis software, adopting the procedures of Descending Hierarchical Classification, Correspondence Factor Analysis and Specificities Analysis. The text segments were grouped in 4 main clusters, describing thinking distortions, emergencies, perceptual alterations and the administration of the substance. Bad trips were more frequent in female users, being associated with thinking distortions. The use of multiple doses of psilocybin in the same session or its combination with other substances was linked to the occurrence of long-term negative outcomes, while the use of mushrooms in single high doses was linked to medical emergencies. These results can be useful for a better understanding of the effects of psilocybin use, guiding harm-reduction initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3007492632,"Hateful commenting, also known as 'toxicity', frequently takes place within news stories in social media. Yet, the relationship between toxicity and news topics is poorly understood. To analyze how news topics relate to the toxicity of user comments, we classify topics of 63,886 online news videos of a large news channel using a neural network and topical tags used by journalists to label content. We score 320,246 user comments from those videos for toxicity and compare how the average toxicity of comments varies by topic. Findings show that topics like Racism, Israel-Palestine, and War & Conflict have more toxicity in the comments, and topics such as Science & Technology, Environment & Weather, and Arts & Culture have less toxic commenting. Qualitative analysis reveals five themes: Graphic videos, Humanistic stories, History and historical facts, Media as a manipulator, and Religion. We also observe cases where a typically more toxic topic becomes non-toxic and where a typically less toxic topic becomes ""toxicified"" when it involves sensitive elements, such as politics and religion. Findings suggest that news comment toxicity can be characterized as topic-driven toxicity that targets topics rather than as vindictive toxicity that targets users or groups. Practical implications suggest that humanistic framing of the news story (i.e., reporting stories through real everyday people) can reduce toxicity in the comments of an otherwise toxic topic."
https://openalex.org/W3007946838,"IgG oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of more than 95% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and are considered to be the immunological hallmark of disease. However, the target specificities of the IgG in MS OCBs have remained undiscovered. Nevertheless, evidence that OCBs are associated with increased levels of disease activity and disability support their probable pathological role in MS. We investigated the antigen specificity of individual MS CSF IgG from 20 OCB-positive patients and identified 40 unique peptides by panning phage-displayed random peptide libraries. Utilizing our unique techniques of phage-mediated real-time Immuno-PCR and phage-probed isoelectric focusing immunoblots, we demonstrated that these peptides were targeted by intrathecal oligoclonal IgG antibodies of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. In addition, we showed that these peptides represent epitopes sharing sequence homologies with proteins of viral origin, and proteins involved in cell stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes. Although homologous peptides were found within individual patients, no shared peptide sequences were found among any of the 42 MS and 13 inflammatory CSF control specimens. The distinct sets of oligoclonal IgG-reactive peptides identified by individual MS CSF suggest that the elevated intrathecal antibodies may target patient-specific antigens."
https://openalex.org/W3007572408,"Venezuela is going through the worst economical, political and social crisis in its modern history. Basic products like food or medicine are scarce and hyperinflation is combined with economic depression. This situation is creating an unprecedented refugee and migrant crisis in the region. Governments and international agencies have not been able to consistently leverage reliable information using traditional methods. Therefore, to organize and deploy any kind of humanitarian response, it is crucial to evaluate new methodologies to measure the number and location of Venezuelan refugees and migrants across Latin America. In this paper, we propose to use Facebook's advertising platform as an additional data source for monitoring the ongoing crisis. We estimate and validate national and sub-national numbers of refugees and migrants and break-down their socio-economic profiles to further understand the complexity of the phenomenon. Although limitations exist, we believe that the presented methodology can be of value for real-time assessment of refugee and migrant crises world-wide."
https://openalex.org/W3008818755,"In this article, we introduce the R package dLagM for the implementation of distributed lag models and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing to explore the short and long-run relationships between dependent and independent time series. Distributed lag models constitute a large class of time series regression models including the ARDL models used for cointegration analysis. The dLagM package provides a user-friendly and flexible environment for the implementation of the finite linear, polynomial, Koyck, and ARDL models and ARDL bounds cointegration test. Particularly, in this article, a new search algorithm to specify the orders of ARDL bounds testing is proposed and implemented by the dLagM package. Main features and input/output structures of the dLagM package and use of the proposed algorithm are illustrated over the datasets included in the package. Features of dLagM package are benchmarked with some mainstream software used to implement distributed lag models and ARDLs."
https://openalex.org/W3008235414,"Introduction There has been a significant increase in the number of body contouring procedures performed worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychosocial effects of these procedures among patients who undergone weight loss surgery and maintained their body mass for a minimum of one year. Material and methods Post-bariatric patients undergoing body contouring procedures were recruited for the study consecutively. Inclusion criteria: BMI < 30 following bariatric surgery, weight maintenance for a minimum of 12 months, and completion of all follow up questionnaires (6 and 12 months). Patients were surveyed 24 hours before, 6-months, and 12-months post-procedure using a Polish validated version of BODY-Q. Results 30 consecutive patients with a mean age of 38 years (SD 5,91) were included in this study. The BODY-Q questionnaire revealed statistically significant improvements in the acceptance of body appearance after 12 months of follow up. In the abdominal area, the rise in scores achieved 90 from the starting level of 13, and the overall body image increased from 24 to 67. Moreover, in patients with postoperative complications (one hematoma and four minor wound dehiscence), the overall score did not differ from uncomplicated patients. Conclusions Body contouring procedures after massive weight loss significantly improve the general perception of personal appearance as well as both the psychological and social aspects of life in patients, already significantly stigmatized by their appearance. Body contouring procedures have essential value and should be widely offered as a step in the treatment of morbidly obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W3007572672,"Development of biodegradable shape memory elastomers (SMEs) is driven by the growing need for materials to address soft tissue pathology using a minimally invasive surgical approach. Composition, chain length and crosslinking of biocompatible polymers like PCL and PLA have been investigated to control mechanical properties, shape recovery and degradation rates. Depending on the primary mechanism of degradation, many of these polymers become considerably stiffer or softer resulting in mechanical properties that are inappropriate to support the regeneration of surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, concerns regarding degradation byproducts or residual organic solvents during synthesis accelerated interest in development of materials from bioavailable monomers. We previously developed a biodegradable SME, poly(glycerol dodecanoate) (PGD), using biologically relevant metabolites and controlled synthesis conditions to tune mechanical properties for soft tissue repair. In this study, we investigate the influence of crosslinking density on the mechanical and thermal properties of PGD during in vitro and in vivo degradation. Results suggest polymer degradation in vivo is predominantly driven by surface erosion, with no significant effects of initial crosslinking density on degradation time under the conditions investigated. Importantly, mechanical integrity is maintained during degradation. Additionally, shifts in melt transitions on thermograms indicate a potential shift in shape memory transition temperatures as the polymers degrade. These findings support the use of PGD for soft tissue repair and warrant further investigation towards tuning the molecular and macromolecular properties of the polymer to tailor degradation rates for specific clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3005001329,"Understanding (patho)physiological phenomena and mechanisms of failure in patients with Fontan circulation—a surgically established circulation for patients born with a functionally single ventricle—remains challenging due to the complex hemodynamics and high inter-patient variations in anatomy and function. In this work, we present a biomechanical model of the heart and circulation to augment the diagnostic evaluation of Fontan patients with early-stage heart failure. The proposed framework employs a reduced-order model of heart coupled with a simplified circulation including venous return, creating a closed-loop system. We deploy this framework to augment the information from data obtained during combined cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance exams (XMR), performed at rest and during dobutamine stress in 9 children with Fontan circulation and 2 biventricular controls. We demonstrate that our modeling framework enables patient-specific investigation of myocardial stiffness, contractility at rest, contractile reserve during stress and changes in vascular resistance. Hereby, the model allows to identify key factors underlying the pathophysiological response to stress in these patients. In addition, the rapid personalization of the model to patient data and fast simulation of cardiac cycles make our framework directly applicable in a clinical workflow. We conclude that the proposed modeling framework is a valuable addition to the current clinical diagnostic XMR exam that helps to explain patient-specific stress hemodynamics and can identify potential mechanisms of failure in patients with Fontan circulation."
https://openalex.org/W3008960587,"Non-healing chronic ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes and are a major healthcare problem. While a host of treatments have been explored to heal or prevent these ulcers from forming, these treatments have not been found to be consistently effective in clinical trials. An understanding of the changes in gene expression in the skin of diabetic patients may provide insight into the processes and mechanisms that precede the formation of non-healing ulcers. In this study, we investigated genome wide changes in gene expression in skin between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic patients using next generation sequencing. We compared the gene expression in skin samples taken from 27 patients (13 with type 2 diabetes and 14 non-diabetic). This information may be useful in identifying the causal factors and potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetic related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3006704976,"Background Among prostate cancer (PC) patients, over 90% of distant metastases occur in the bone. PC treatments may be associated with side effects, including second primary malignancies (SPM). There is limited information on the incidence of SPM among men with bone metastatic PC (mPC) and among men with bone metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC). We estimated overall survival and the incidence of SPM in men with mPC and mCRPC. Methods In the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden, the National Prostate Cancer Register was linked to other national health care registers, 15,953 men with mPC in 1999–2011 were identified. Further, 693 men with mCRPC were identified. Outcomes were evaluated using stratified incidence rates, Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox models. Results The mean age among men with mPC was 73.9 years and in men with mCRPC 70.0 years. The median respective survivals were 1.5 (13,965 deaths) and 1.14 years (599 deaths), and average times since PC diagnosis 1.8 and 4.7 years. We observed 2,669 SPMs in men with mPC and 100 SPMs in men with mCRPC. The incidence rate of SPM per 1,000 person-years was 81.8 (78.8–85.0) for mPC and 115.6 (95.1–140.7) for mCRPC. High age, prior neoplasms, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, diabetes and renal disease were most strongly associated with increased mortality risk. Prior neoplasms and prior use of antineoplastic agents were most strongly associated with increased SPM risk. Several factors associated with increased mortality and SPM risks were more prevalent in the mCRPC cohort. Conclusions Our results on mortality for men with mPC and mCRPC are in line with previous studies from the same time period. Investigation of factors associated with mortality and SPM in men with mPC and mCRPC can help to further understand these outcomes in the era prior to several new treatments have come available."
https://openalex.org/W3008203713,"Low frequency noise (LFS) and infrasound (IS) are controversially discussed as potential causes of annoyance and distress experienced by many people. However, the perception mechanisms for IS in the human auditory system are not completely understood yet. In the present study, sinusoids at 32 Hz (at the lower limit of melodic pitch for tonal stimulation), as well as 8 Hz (IS range) were presented to a group of 20 normal hearing subjects, using monaural stimulation via a loudspeaker sound source coupled to the ear canal by a long silicone rubber tube. Each participant attended two experimental sessions. In the first session, participants performed a categorical loudness scaling procedure as well as an unpleasantness rating task in a sound booth. In the second session, the loudness scaling procedure was repeated while brain activation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subsequently, activation data were collected for the respective stimuli presented at fixed levels adjusted to the individual loudness judgments. Silent trials were included as a baseline condition. Our results indicate that the brain regions involved in processing LFS and IS are similar to those for sounds in the typical audio frequency range, i.e., mainly primary and secondary auditory cortex (AC). In spite of large variation across listeners with respect to judgments of loudness and unpleasantness, neural correlates of these interindividual differences could not yet be identified. Still, for individual listeners, fMRI activation in the AC was more closely related to individual perception than to the physical stimulus level."
https://openalex.org/W4231099214,"Background The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of bronchiolitis in infants and interferon (IFN) α is a commercial antiviral drug. The nebulization of IFN α1b could be a viable treatment method. In this study, the therapeutic effects and safety of IFN α1b delivery via nebulization in infant bronchiolitis were investigated in this multi-center prospective study. Methods and findings Bronchiolitis patients admitted to 22 hospitals who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomly allocated to four groups: control, IFN Intramuscular Injection, IFN Nebulization 1 (1 μg/kg), and IFN Nebulization 2 (2 μg/kg) groups. All patients were observed for 7 days. The therapeutic effects and safety of different IFN delivery doses and delivery modes were evaluated. Coughing severity change, as scored by the researchers and parents, between days 1 and 3 was significantly different between the IFN Nebulization 2 and control groups. Lowell wheezing score change between days 3 and 5 was significantly different between IFN Nebulization 1 and control groups. There were no significant differences among the four groups regarding the number of consecutive days with fever, three-concave sign, fatigue and sleepiness, and loss of appetite. There were no cases of severe complications, no recurrence of fever, and no regression of mental status. Conclusions IFN-α1b could more effectively alleviate coughing and wheezing in bronchiolitis. IFN-α1b nebulization had significant advantages in shortening the duration of wheezing and alleviating coughing."
https://openalex.org/W3007017979,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the etiological agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, which is the most common neoplastic disease of cattle. BLV infects cattle worldwide and causes serious problems for the cattle industry. In this study, we examined the prevalence of BLV infection and the distribution of BLV genotypes in cattle in the northern, central, and southern parts of Myanmar. The prevalence of BLV infection among Myanmar cattle (37.04%) in this study was markedly higher than the prevalence (9.1%) observed in our earlier study in which BLV was detected from the limited number of cattle only from a small area of Myanmar. Phylogenetic analysis of partial env-gp51 sequence of the isolated BLV strains revealed that there are at least three BLV genotypes (genotype-1, genotype-6, and genotype-10) in Myanmar, which have also been detected in the neighboring countries. We performed this study to estimate the BLV proviral load, which is a major diagnosis index for determining the virus transmission risk. The cattle of the three test regions with warm, wet, and humid climatic conditions (upper Sagaing, Yangon, and Kayin) exhibited a high mean proviral load, while cattle of three other regions with low annual rainfall and very high temperature (Mandalay, Magway, and upper Bago) exhibited a low mean proviral load. Further, the level of proviral load and the prevalence of BLV infection in Myanmar native cattle (N = 235) were lower than that in the hybrid cattle (Holstein Friesian × Myanmar native) (N = 62). We also observed that the cattle with high risk for BLV transmission, which have high proviral load, may enhance the BLV infection rate. Hence, to control BLV transmission, it is necessary to eliminate these cattle with high-risk for BLV transmission and to diagnose BLV provirus in cattle in the remaining regions/states of Myanmar sharing a boundary with neighboring countries."
https://openalex.org/W3006773752,"Marsh birds (rallids, bitterns, and grebes) depend on emergent wetlands, and habitat loss and degradation are the primary suspected causes for population declines among many marsh bird species. We evaluated the effect of natural wetland characteristics, wetland management practices, and surrounding landscape characteristics on marsh bird occupancy in Illinois during late spring and early summer 2015-2017. We conducted call-back surveys following the North American Standardized Marsh Bird Survey Protocol three times annually at all sites (2015 n = 49, 2016 n = 57, 2017 n = 55). Across all species and groups, detection probability declined 7.1% ± 2.1 each week during the marsh bird survey period. Wetlands managed for waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) had greater occupancy than reference wetlands. Marsh bird occupancy increased with greater wetland complexity, intermediate levels of waterfowl management intensity, greater proportions of surface water inundation, and greater proportions of persistent emergent vegetation cover. Wetland management practices that retain surface water during the growing season, encourage perennial emergent plants (e.g., Typha sp.), and increase wetland complexity could be used to provide habitat suitable for waterfowl and marsh birds."
https://openalex.org/W3007146897,"The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) transports iodide, which is necessary for thyroid hormone production. NIS also transports other monovalent anions such as tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), pertechnetate (TcO4-), and thiocyanate (SCN-), and is competitively inhibited by perchlorate (ClO4-). However, the mechanisms of substrate selectivity and inhibitor sensitivity are poorly understood. Here, a comparative approach was taken to determine whether naturally evolved NIS proteins exhibit variability in their substrate transport properties. The NIS proteins of thirteen animal species were initially assessed, and three species from environments with differing iodide availability, freshwater species Danio rerio (zebrafish), saltwater species Balaenoptera acutorostrata scammoni (minke whale), and non-aquatic mammalian species Homo sapiens (human) were studied in detail. NIS genes from each of these species were lentivirally transduced into HeLa cells, which were then characterized using radioisotope uptake assays, 125I- competitive substrate uptake assays, and kinetic assays. Homology models of human, minke whale and zebrafish NIS were used to evaluate sequence-dependent impact on the organization of Na+ and I- binding pockets. Whereas each of the three proteins that were analyzed in detail concentrated iodide to a similar degree, their sensitivity to perchlorate inhibition varied significantly: minke whale NIS was the least impacted by perchlorate inhibition (IC50 = 4.599 μM), zebrafish NIS was highly sensitive (IC50 = 0.081 μM), and human NIS showed intermediate sensitivity (IC50 = 1.566 μM). Further studies with fifteen additional substrates and inhibitors revealed similar patterns of iodide uptake inhibition, though the degree of 125I- uptake inhibition varied with each compound. Kinetic analysis revealed whale NIS had the lowest Km-I and the highest Vmax-I. Conversely, zebrafish NIS had the highest Km and lowest Vmax. Again, human NIS was intermediate. Molecular modeling revealed a high degree of conservation in the putative ion binding pockets of NIS proteins from different species, which suggests the residues responsible for the observed differences in substrate selectivity lie elsewhere in the protein. Ongoing studies are focusing on residues in the extracellular loops of NIS as determinants of anion specificity. These data demonstrate significant transport differences between the NIS proteins of different species, which may be influenced by the unique physiological needs of each organism. Our results also identify naturally-existing NIS proteins with significant variability in substrate transport kinetics and inhibitor sensitivity, which suggest that the affinity and selectivity of NIS for certain substrates can be altered for biotechnological and clinical applications. Further examination of interspecies differences may improve understanding of the substrate transport mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3008382950,"Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a major limiting factor to rice productivity worldwide. Genetic control through the identification of novel sources of bacterial blight resistance and their utilization in resistance breeding remains the most effective and economical strategy to manage the disease. Here we report the identification of a novel locus from the wild Oryza species, Oryza latifolia, conferring a race-specific resistance to Philippine Xoo race 9A (PXO339). The locus was identified from two introgression lines i.e. WH12-2252 and WH12-2256 that segregated from O. latifolia monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs). The discrete segregation ratio of susceptible and resistant phenotypes in the F2 (χ2[3:1] = 0.22 at p>0.05) and F3 (χ2[3:1] = 0.36 at p>0.05) populations indicates that PXO339 resistance in the MAAL-derived introgression lines (MDILs) is controlled by a single, recessive gene. Genotyping of a total of 216 F2, 1130 F3 and 288 F4 plants derived from crossing either of the MDILs with the recurrent parent used to generate the MAALs narrowed the candidate region to a 1,817 kb locus that extends from 10,425 to 12,266 kb in chromosome 12. Putative candidate genes that were identified by data mining and comparative sequence analysis can provide targets for further studies on mapping and cloning of the causal gene for PXO339 resistance in the MDILs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetic locus from the allotetraploid wild rice, O. latifolia conferring race-specific resistance to bacterial blight."

https://openalex.org/W3008233257,"Hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (HPND) is a newly emerging disease in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, which has resulted in large economic losses. However, the underlying cause of this disease remains unclear. To better understand the pathogenesis and pathogenic mechanism of HPND, we compared the transcriptome differences of the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis with and without HPND. The analysis yielded > 30 million reads for each sample of three test (with HPND) and three control groups (without HPND). We observed 978 downregulated genes and 644 upregulated genes. Among the gene ontology categories ""biological process,"" ""cellular component,"" and ""molecular function"", the subcategories cellular process, single-organism process, biological regulation, metabolic process, cell part, organelle, organelle part, binding, and catalytic were enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that ""metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450,"" ""drug metabolism-cytochrome P450,"" ""chemical carcinogenesis,"" and ""material metabolism"" were the ""five"" most significantly enriched pathways in the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis with HPND. The results revealed that material metabolic abnormalities and drug effects from the external environment might be associated with HPND in the Chinese mitten crab. Considering the wide use of pyrethroids for pond cleaning in Xinghua city, we speculated that pyrethroids might cause HPND in the Chinese mitten crab. Our study provided useful information about the cause and pathogenetic mechanisms of HPND and could help to prevent this disease in production practice."
https://openalex.org/W3007506957,"Our study revisits the role of cardiac mitochondrial adjustments during the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while considering age and sex as potential confounding factors. We used the Nile Grass rats (NRs) as the animal model. After weaning, animals were fed either a Standard Rodent Chow Diet (SRCD group) or a Mazuri Chinchilla Diet (MCD group) consisting of high-fiber and low-fat content. Both males and females in the SRCD group, exhibited increased body mass, body mass index, and plasma insulin compared to the MCD group animals. However, the females were able to preserve their fasting blood glucose throughout the age range on both diets, while the males showed significant hyperglycemia starting at 6 months in the SRCD group. In the males, a higher citrate synthase activity—a marker of mitochondrial content—was measured at 2 months in the SRCD compared to the MCD group, and this was followed by a decline with age in the SRCD group only. In contrast, females preserved their mitochondrial content throughout the age range. In the males exclusively, the complex IV capacity expressed independently of mitochondrial content varied with age in a diet-specific pattern; the capacity was elevated at 2 months in the SRCD group, and at 6 months in the MCD group. In addition, females, but not males, were able to adjust their capacity to oxidize long-chain fatty acid in accordance with the fat content of the diet. Our results show clear sexual dimorphism in the variation of mitochondrial content and oxidative phosphorylation capacity with diet and age. The SRCD not only leads to T2DM but also exacerbates age-related cardiac mitochondrial defects. These observations, specific to male NRs, might reflect deleterious dietary-induced changes on their metabolism making them more prone to the cardiovascular consequences of aging and T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3007564921,"The objective was to evaluate the effect of the addition of 0, 10, 20, and 30 mg.kg-1 of natural matter of a lignocellulosic enzymatic complex produced by the white rot fungus on the chemical composition, cumulative gas production in vitro, and antioxidant compounds of corn and sugarcane silages. After being chopped and treated with the enzymatic complex, the plants were packed in vacuum-sealed bags. After 60 days, the mini silos were opened and the samples were dried in a forced ventilation oven at 55 °C for analysis of the proposed parameters. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replicates per treatment. In the corn silage, there was a linear reduction in the lignin concentration. In the sugarcane silage showed a reduction of 12% in the lignin concentration, a linear reduction in the hemicellulose content, and a decrease of 8% in the cellulose concentration compared to the control treatment. The lignin monomers had linear increases in the syringyl:guaiacil ratio. This reflected on significant increases in the concentration of the non-fibrous carbohydrates and the A + B1 fraction of the carbohydrates, and a reduction in the C fraction. The in vitro gas production increased, the time of colonization and initiation of in vitro fermentation linearly decreased in both silages. The phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity increased linearly with the addition of the enzymes in both silages. The addition of the lignocellulolytic enzymes to the silages caused changes in the cell wall, resulting in improvements in the in vitro fermentative parameters, besides the additional effect on the antioxidant capacity. There was an effect of the addition of the enzymes on the evaluated fodder, and the best concentration was, on average, 20 mg kg-1 MN for corn silage and 10 mg kg-1 NM for sugarcane silage."

The tree shrew is an alternative laboratory animal widely used for human disease research. However, little is known about the relationship between Proteus spp. and tree shrews. In this study, the complete genome sequencing method was used to analyse the characteristics of Proteus spp. isolated from tree shrews, and comparative genomic analysis was performed to reveal their relationships. The results showed that 36 Proteus spp. bacteria were isolated, including 34 Proteus mirabilis strains and two Proteus vulgaris strains. The effective rate of sequencing was 93.53%±2.73%, with an average GC content of 39.94%±0.25%. Briefly, 3682.89±90.37, 2771.36±36.01 and 2832.06±42.49 genes were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (NR), SwissProt database and KEGG database, respectively. The high proportions of macrolide-, vancomycin-, bacitracin-, and tetracycline-resistance profiles of the strains were annotated in the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB). Flagella, lipooligosaccharides, type 1 fimbriae and P fimbriae were the most abundantly annotated virulence factors in the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). SNP variants indicated high proportions of base transitions (Ts), homozygous mutations (Hom) and non-synonymous mutations (Non-Syn) in Proteus spp. (P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of Proteus spp. and other references revealed high genetic diversity for strains isolated from tree shrews, and host specificity of Proteus spp. bacteria was not found. Overall, this study provided important information on characteristics of genome for Proteus spp. isolated from tree shrews."
https://openalex.org/W3006845500,"Secreted autotransporter toxin (Sat) is a 107-kDa serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) presenting cytotoxic activity in renal and bladder cells. Further studies have detected the Sat-encoding gene (sat) in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and in E. coli strains isolated from neonatal septicemia and meningitis. Here, we investigated the role of Sat as a cytotoxin of EAEC. Sat was purified from a strain of E. coli harboring sat (DEC/Sat+, O126:H2) and used to raise antibodies in rabbit. The presence of Sat was detected by ELISA in the supernatant of 93.7% of EAEC strains harboring sat and in none lacking the gene. The effect of Sat during infection was investigated in polarized Caco-2 cells infected with Sat-producing EAEC (CV323/77, O125ab:H21). This strain induced intense cell detachment, which was inhibited by PMSF or Sat antiserum. Also, sat transcription and Sat production were detected during infection. Here we demonstrate that Sat is internalized in polarized cells leading to F-actin disruption which preceded cell detachment. A comparative study of the toxin action in cell lines corresponding to the infection sites in which bacteria carrying the sat gene have been isolated was performed. Cells originating from the gastrointestinal tract (Caco-2), urinary (LLC-PK1) and endothelium (HUVEC) were incubated with purified Sat. The time required for observation of cell damage differed according to the cell line. HUVEC cells were more sensitive to Sat than cells derived from urinary and intestinal tracts. The intense activity of Sat on the endothelial cells suggests that Sat could also be a virulence factor for the bacteria in the bloodstream. In addition, this is the first work demonstrating that Sat induces cytotoxic effect during EAEC infection in vitro. The cell damage observed during infection indicates that Sat may be another toxin with cytotoxic role in the EAEC pathogenesis."

It serves social-communicative functions, requires the understanding of the speaker's mental state and its comprehension takes place at an advanced stage of language acquisition. In the present study, we investigated 8-year old’s irony comprehension and social skills and asked their parents about their preferred use of irony towards their children. We then compared children with the highest scores in irony comprehension test with those with lower scores. The full sample included 46 families from Poland. Results show positive associations between children’s levels of irony comprehension and levels of mothers irony use. No such relations were found for fathers. No differences were found in ToM scores between proficient and non-proficient irony comprehenders. Our findings provide a base for future studies to study the use of irony in child-parent talk in more diverse culturally and linguistically diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W3007861735,"Objective To describe the presence of practice effects in persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to evaluate how practice effects affect cognitive progression and the outcome of clinical trials. Methods Using data from a meta-database consisting of 18 studies including participants from the Alzheimer disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with ADAS-Cog11 as the primary outcome, we defined practice effects based on the improvement in the first two ADAS-Cog11 scores and then estimated the presence of practice effects and compared the cognitive progression between participants with and without practice effects. The robustness of practice effects was investigated using CDR SB, an outcome independent the definition itself. Furthermore, we evaluated how practice effects can affect sample size estimation. Results The overall percent of practice effects for AD participants was 39.0% and 53.3% for MCI participants. For AD studies, the mean change from baseline to 2 years was 12.8 points for the non-practice effects group vs 7.4 for the practice effects group; whereas for MCI studies, it was 4.1 for non-practice effects group vs 0.2 for the practice effects group. AD participants without practice effects progressed 0.9 points faster than those with practice effects over a period of 2 years in CDR-SB; whereas for MCI participants, the difference is 0.7 points. The sample sizes can be different by over 35% when estimated based on participants with/without practice effects. Conclusion Practice effects were prevalent and robust in persons with AD or MCI and affected the cognitive progression and sample size estimation. Planning of future AD or MCI clinical trials should account for practice effects to avoid underpower or considers target trials or stratification analysis based on practice effects."
https://openalex.org/W3007090068,"To evaluate the image quality of low-dose chest digital radiographic images obtained with a new spatial noise reduction algorithm, compared to a conventional de-noising technique.In 69 patients, the dose reduction protocol was divided into A, B, and C test groups- 60% (n = 22), 50% (n = 23), and 40% (n = 24) of the baseline dose. In each patient, baseline dose radiographs were obtained with conventional image processing while low-dose images were acquired with new image processing. A set of baseline and low-dose radiographic images per patient was evaluated and scored on a 5-point scale over seven anatomical landmarks (radiolucency of unobscured lung, pulmonary vascularity, trachea, edge of rib, heart border, intervertebral disc space, and pulmonary vessels in the retrocardiac area) and three representative abnormal findings (nodule, consolidation, and interstitial marking) by two thoracic radiologists. A comparison of paired baseline and low-dose images was statistically analyzed using a non-inferiority test based on the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.In A, B, and C test groups, the mean dose reduction rate of the baseline radiation dose was 63.4%, 53.9%, and 47.8%, respectively. In all test groups, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was less than the non-inferiority margin of 0.5 every seven anatomical landmarks and three representative abnormal findings, which suggested that the image quality of the low-dose image was not inferior to that of the baseline dose image even if the maximum average dose reduction rate was reduced to 47.8% of the baseline dose.In our study, an image processing technique integrating a new noise reduction algorithm achieved dose reductions of approximately half without compromising image quality for abnormal lung findings and anatomical landmarks seen on chest radiographs. This feature-preserving, noise reduction algorithm adopted in the proposed engine enables a lower radiation dose boundary for the sake of patient's and radiography technologist's radiation safety in routine clinical practice, in compliance with regulatory guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3007899818,"LAT molecules defective in ubiquitination have an increased half-life and induce enhanced signaling when expressed in T cells. In this study, we have examined the role of ubiquitination in regulating LAT endocytosis, recycling, and degradation in resting and stimulated T cells. By tracking and comparing plasma membrane-labeled wild type and ubiquitination-resistant 2KR LAT, we find that ubiquitination promotes the degradation of surface LAT in T cells. Activation of T cells increases LAT ubiquitination and promotes trafficking of internalized LAT to lysosomes for degradation. Ubiquitination of LAT does not change internalization rates from the cell surface, but prevents efficient recycling of LAT to the surface of T cells. Our study demonstrates that surface LAT levels are tightly controlled by ubiquitination. LAT in unstimulated cells lacks ubiquitin allowing for increased LAT stability and efficient T cell activation upon TCR triggering; ubiquitination leads to efficient removal of LAT after activation."
https://openalex.org/W3008125017,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are associated with mental illness. The risk of serious mental illness, including deliberate self-harm (DSH), in these conditions is not well known. We aimed to determine if RA or AS independently increases the risk for DSH.We conducted retrospective, population-based cohort studies using administrative health data for the province of Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2014. Individuals with incident RA (N = 53,240) or AS (N = 13,964) were separately matched 1:4 by age, sex, and year with comparators without RA or AS. The outcome was a first DSH attempt identified using emergency department data. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of DSH in RA and AS versus comparators, adjusting for demographic, clinical and health service utilization variables.Subjects with AS were significantly more likely to self-harm (crude incidence rate [IR] of 0.68/1,000 person years [PY] versus 0.32/1,000 PY in comparators), with an adjusted HR of 1.59 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.21). DSH was increased for RA subjects (IR 0.35/1,000 PY) versus comparators (IR 0.24/1,000 PY) only before (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.74), but not after covariate adjustment (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33).AS carries an increased risk for DSH but no such risk was observed in RA. Further evaluation of at-risk AS subjects is needed, including the longitudinal effects of disease and arthritis therapies on self-harm behaviour. This will inform whether specific risk-reduction strategies for DSH in inflammatory arthritis are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3008302502,"Brain artery velocities (Time-Averaged Maximum Mean Velocity, TAMMV) by Transcranial Doppler (TCD), hematocrit, hemoglobin, Red blood cell (RBC) Distribution Width (RDW) and RBC rigidity index (Ri), when reported together with their correlations, provide a accurate and useful diagnostic picture than blood viscosity measurements alone. Additionally, our study included a sixth parameter provided by TCD, the Gosling Pulsatility Index PI, which is an indicator of CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) resistance. All these parameters are routine in Hematology except for values of Ri. The rigidity (Ri) of the RBC is the main rheological characteristic of the blood of Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) patients and several pathologies. However, its quantification depends on many commercial and experimental techniques, none disseminated and predominant around the World. The difference in absorbance values of the blood, during the process of sedimentation in a microwell of a Microplate Reader, is a straightforward way of semi-quantifying the RBC rigidity Ri, since the fraction of irreversibly sickled red blood cells does not form rouleaux. Erythrocyte Rigidity Index (Ri) was calculated using initial absorbance Ainitial (6 s) and final Afinal (540 s), Ri = 1 / (Ai-Af). The Ri of 119 patients (2-17 y / o, M & F) SCA, SCC (Sickle Cell/hemoglobin C), SCD (Sickle Cell/hemoglobin D), Sβ0thal (Sickle Cell/hemoglobin Beta Zero Thalassemia) and 71 blood donors (20-65 y / o, M & F) were measured in our laboratory while the five parameters (TAMMV and PI by TCD, Hct, Hb and RDW) were obtained from medical records. The in vitro addition of hydroxyurea (HU, 50mg /dl, n = 51 patients, and n = 8 healthy donors) in the samples decreased the rouleaux adhesion strength of both donor and patients' blood samples, leading to extraordinarily high Ri values. The correlation between the studied parameters was especially significant for the direct relationships between Ri, TAMMV, and PI."
https://openalex.org/W3008937184,"The ability to regulate oxygen consumption evolved in ancestral animals and is intrinsically linked to iron metabolism. The iron pathways have been intensively studied in mammals, whereas data on distant invertebrates are limited. Sea sponges represent the oldest animal phylum and have unique structural plasticity and capacity to reaggregate after complete dissociation. We studied iron metabolic factors and their expression during reaggregation in the White Sea cold-water sponges Halichondria panicea and Halisarca dujardini. De novo transcriptomes were assembled using RNA-Seq data, and evolutionary trends were analyzed with bioinformatic tools. Differential expression during reaggregation was studied for H. dujardini. Enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway and transport globins, neuroglobin (NGB) and androglobin (ADGB), were identified in sponges. The globins mutate at higher evolutionary rates than the heme synthesis enzymes. Highly conserved iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) presumably interacts with the iron-responsive elements (IREs) found in mRNAs of ferritin (FTH1) and a putative transferrin receptor NAALAD2. The reaggregation process is accompanied by increased expression of IRP1, the antiapoptotic factor BCL2, the inflammation factor NFκB (p65), FTH1 and NGB, as well as by an increase in mitochondrial density. Our data indicate a complex mechanism of iron regulation in sponge structural plasticity and help to better understand general mechanisms of morphogenetic processes in multicellular species."
https://openalex.org/W3007163615,"Background Maternal and Child health remains at the core of global health priorities transcending the Millennium Development Goals into the current era of Sustainable Development Goals. Most low and middle-income countries including Ghana are yet to achieve the required levels of reduction in child and maternal mortality. This paper analysed the trends and the associated risk factors of stillbirths in a district hospital located in an impoverished and remote region of Ghana. Methods Retrospective hospital maternal records on all deliveries conducted in the Navrongo War Memorial hospital from 2003–2013 were retrieved and analysed. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarise trends in stillbirths while the generalized linear estimation logistic regression is used to determine socio-demographic, maternal and neonatal factors associated with stillbirths. Results A total of 16,670 deliveries were analysed over the study period. Stillbirth rate was 3.4% of all births. There was an overall decline in stillbirth rate over the study period as stillbirths declined from 4.2% in 2003 to 2.1% in 2013. Female neonates were less likely to be stillborn (Adjusted Odds ratio = 0.62 and 95%CI [0.46, 0.84]; p = 0.002) compared to male neonates; neonates with low birth weight (4.02 [2.92, 5.53]) and extreme low birth weight (18.9 [10.9, 32.4]) were at a higher risk of still birth (p<0.001). Mothers who had undergone Female Genital Mutilation had 47% (1.47 [1.04, 2.09]) increase odds of having a stillbirth compared to non FGM mothers (p = 0.031). Mothers giving birth for the first time also had a 40% increase odds of having a stillbirth compared to those who had more than one previous births (p = 0.037). Conclusion Despite the modest reduction in stillbirth rates over the study period, it is evident from the results that stillbirth rate is still relatively high. Primiparous women and preterm deliveries leading to low birth weight are identified factors that result in increased stillbirths. Efforts aimed at impacting on stillbirths should include the elimination of outmoded cultural practices such as FGM."
https://openalex.org/W3007544400,"Ribose-cysteine is a synthetic compound designed to increase glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Low levels of GSH and the GSH-dependent enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both mice and humans. Here we investigate the effect of ribose-cysteine on GSH, GPx, oxidised lipids and atherosclerosis development in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Female 12-week old apoE-/- mice (n = 15) were treated with 4–5 mg/day ribose-cysteine in drinking water for 8 weeks or left untreated. Blood and livers were assessed for GSH, GPx activity and 8-isoprostanes. Plasma alanine transferase (ALT) and lipid levels were measured. Aortae were quantified for atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic sinus and brachiocephalic arch and 8-isoprostanes measured. Ribose-cysteine treatment significantly reduced ALT levels (p<0.0005) in the apoE-/- mice. Treatment promoted a significant increase in GSH concentrations in the liver (p<0.05) and significantly increased GPx activity in the liver and erythrocytes of apoE-/-mice (p<0.005). The level of 8-isoprostanes were significantly reduced in the livers and arteries of apoE-/- mice (p<0.05 and p<0.0005, respectively). Ribose-cysteine treatment showed a significant decrease in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p<0.05) with no effect on other plasma lipids with the LDL reduction likely through upregulation of scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1). Ribose-cysteine treatment significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion area by >50% in both the aortic sinus and brachiocephalic branch (p<0.05). Ribose-cysteine promotes a significant GSH-based antioxidant effect in multiple tissues as well as an LDL-lowering response. These effects are accompanied by a marked reduction in atherosclerosis suggesting that ribose-cysteine might increase protection against CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3007655494,"Current guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with various degrees of cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. This study assessed the need for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with low Child-Pugh scores. We retrospectively screened all patients with cirrhosis who underwent upper endoscopies for UGI bleeding in a referral hospital in Taiwan between 2003 and 2014, from which 913 patients were enrolled after excluding patients with active bacterial infections, recent antibiotic use, early death, and Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis. Among them, 73 (8%) received prophylactic antibiotics, and 45 (4.9%) exhibited 14-day bacterial infection. Neither Child-Pugh score nor model for end stage liver disease score were optimal for predicting bacterial infection because their areas under the curves were 0.610 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.529-0.691) and 0.666 (95% CI: 0.591-0.742), respectively. Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risks of 14-day bacterial infection (relative risk [RR]: 0.932, 95% CI: 0.300-2.891, P = 0.902), 14-day rebleeding (RR: 0.791, 95% CI: 0.287-2.181, P = 0.650), or 42-day mortality (RR: 2.710, 95% CI: 0.769-9.524, P = 0.121). The results remained similar after propensity score adjustment. On-demand antibiotic treatment might suffice for patients with Child-Pugh class A/B cirrhosis and UGI bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W3008021950,"To understand the epidemiological and genetic background of anthrax cases occurring in Vietnam from 2011 to 2015, we surveilled and genetically analyzed Bacillus anthracis isolated in the north of the country. Epidemiological surveillance showed that most human cutaneous anthrax cases occurred in association with animal dissection. Whole-genome sequences were obtained from six B. anthracis strains from human patients with cutaneous anthrax in the endemic area. Comparative genomic analysis showed that the genetic homogeneity among Vietnamese B. anthracis strains was very high. All Vietnamese B. anthracis strains belonged to the canSNP lineage of A.Br.011/009, which mostly consists of strains of the trans-Eurasian (TEA) group, including the most closely related strain, Carbosap. To clarify the genetic diversity of Vietnamese strains and strains belonging to A.Br.011/009 and A.Br.008/011 canSNP lineages, we applied a reference genome-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-by-gene genomic analysis (whole-genome MLST) strategy. The phylogeny from core genome SNPs revealed that the Vietnamese strains were positioned close to each other; moreover, several SNPs specific to Vietnamese B. anthracis were identified. Whole-genome MLST analysis revealed the differences in the number of SNPs between Vietnamese strains, which could enable discrimination at the strain level."

We also explain how requests can be made and provide suggestions to construct effective data-driven requests. We applied for data on hate crime from all police forces and on uptake of maternity leave from all universities.

https://openalex.org/W3001442764,"Periodontitis is associated with increased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activity, which may be one mechanism linking periodontitis with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. As LPS-carrying proteins including lipoproteins modify LPS-activity, we investigated the determinants of serum LPS-neutralizing capacity (LPS-NC) in ischemic stroke. The association of LPS-NC and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a major microbial biomarker in periodontitis, was also investigated.The assay to measure LPS-NC was set up by spiking serum samples with E. coli LPS. The LPS-NC, LPS-binding protein (LBP), soluble CD14 (sCD14), lipoprotein profiles, apo(lipoprotein) A-I, apoB, and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity, were determined in 98 ischemic stroke patients and 100 age- and sex-matched controls. Serum and saliva immune response to A. actinomycetemcomitans, its concentration in saliva, and serotype-distribution were examined.LPS-NC values ranged between 51-83% in the whole population. Although several of the LPS-NC determinants differed significantly between cases and controls (PLTP, sCD14, apoA-I, HDL-cholesterol), the levels did not (p = 0.056). The main determinants of LPS-NC were i) triglycerides (β = -0.68, p<0.001), and ii) HDL cholesterol (0.260, <0.001), LDL cholesterol (-0.265, <0.001), PLTP (-0.196, 0.011), and IgG against A. actinomycetemcomitans (0.174, 0.011). Saliva A. actinomycetemcomitans concentration was higher [log mean (95% CI), 4.39 (2.35-8.19) vs. 10.7 (5.45-21) genomes/ml, p = 0.023) and serotype D more frequent (4 vs. 0%, p = 0.043) in cases than controls. Serotypeablity or serotypes did not, however, relate to the LPS-NC.Serum LPS-NC comprised low PLTP-activity, triglyceride and LDL cholesterol concentrations, as well as high HDL cholesterol and IgG against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The present findings let us to conclude that LPS-NC did not associate with stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3009010867,"Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities display complex patch dynamics at seascape scales that are presently poorly understood as most studies of disturbance on SAV habitats have focused on changes in biomass at small, quadrat-level scales. In this study, analyses of remote sensing imagery and population modelling were applied to understand SAV patch dynamics and forecast the fate of these important communities in Biscayne Bay, Miami, Florida, US. We evaluated how the proximity of freshwater canals influences seagrass-dominated SAV patch dynamics and, in turn, how patch-size structure influences the stability of seagrass seascapes under different salinity scenarios. Seagrass fragmentation rates were higher in sites adjacent to freshwater canals compared to sites distant from the influences of freshwater deliveries. Furthermore, we documented a clear trend in patch mortality rates with respect to patch size, with the smallest patches (50 m2) undergoing 57% annual mortality on average. The combination of higher fragmentation rates and the higher mortality of smaller seagrass patches in habitats exposed to pulses of low salinity raises concern for the long-term persistence of seagrass meadows in nearshore urban habitats of Biscayne Bay that are presently targets of Everglades restoration. Our model scenarios that simulated high fragmentation rates resulted in SAV population collapses, regardless of SAV recruitment rates. The combined remote sensing and population modelling approach used here provides evaluation and predictive tools that can be used by managers to track seagrass status and stress-response at seascape levels not available previously for the seagrasses of South Florida."

They have been identified as belonging to the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Kocuria, Janibacter, Starkeya, Bosea, Mycolicibacterium, and Rhodovarius. Bacillus aryabhattai R1B, S. novella R8b, and M. mucogenicum R8i were able to grow using MtBE as carbon source, exhibiting different growth behavior and contaminant degradation ability. Their biocontrol ability was tested against various fungal pathogens. Both S. novella R8b and B. aryabhattai were effective in reducing the development of necrotic areas on leaves within 48 hours from Botritys cinerea and Alternaria alternata inoculation. Whereas, M. mucogenicum effectively controlled B. cinerea after 72 hours. Similar results were achieved using Pythium ultimum, in which the application of isolated bacteria increased seed germination. Only M. mucogenicum elicited tomato plants resistance against B. cinerea. This is the first report describing the occurrence of bioremediation and biocontrol activities in M. mucogenicum, B. aryabhattai and S. novella species. The production of maculosin and its antibiotic activity against Rhizoctonia solani has been reported for first time from S. novella.

https://openalex.org/W3009035944,"Malaria is a global public health concern and its dynamic transmission is still a complex process. Malaria transmission largely depends on various factors, including demography, geography, vector dynamics, parasite reservoir, and climate. The dynamic behaviour of malaria transmission has been explained using various statistical and mathematical methods. Of them, wavelet analysis is a powerful mathematical technique used in analysing rapidly changing time-series to understand disease processes in a more holistic way. The current study is aimed at identifying the pattern of malaria transmission and its variability with environmental factors in Kataragama, a malaria-endemic dry zone locality of Sri Lanka, using a wavelet approach. Monthly environmental data including total rainfall and mean water flow of the “Menik Ganga” river; mean temperature, mean minimum and maximum temperatures and mean relative humidity; and malaria cases in the Kataragama Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area were obtained from the Department of Irrigation, Department of Meteorology and Malaria Research Unit (MRU) of University of Colombo, respectively, for the period 1990 to 2005. Wavelet theory was applied to analyze these monthly time series data. There were two significant periodicities in malaria cases during the period of 1992–1995 and 1999–2000. The cross-wavelet power spectrums revealed an anti-phase correlation of malaria cases with mean temperature, minimum temperature, and water flow of “Menik Ganga” river during the period 1991–1995, while the in-phase correlation with rainfall is noticeable only during 1991–1992. Relative humidity was similarly associated with malaria cases between 1991–1992. It appears that environmental variables have contributed to a higher incidence of malaria cases in Kataragama in different time periods between 1990 and 2005."
https://openalex.org/W3007023725,"In this paper, a novel 3D roaming algorithm considering collision detection and interaction is proposed that adopts a triangle mesh to organize and manage massive spatial data and uses a customized bounding box intersector to rapidly obtain the potential collided triangles. The proposed algorithm can satisfy the requirements of timeliness and practicability during complicated large 3D scene collision detection. Moreover, we designed a method to calculate the collision point coordinates according to the spatial position relation and distance change between the virtual collision detection sphere and triangles, with the triangle edges and three vertices being considered. Compared to the methods that use the native intersector of OpenSceneGraph (OSG) to obtain the collision point coordinates, the calculation efficiency of the proposed method is greatly improved. Usually, when there is a big split/pit in the scene, the viewpoints will fly off the scene due to the fall of the collision detection sphere, or the region interior cannot be accessed when the entrance of some local region (e.g., internal grotto) of the scene is too small. These problems are solved in this paper through 3D scene-path training and by self-adaptively adjusting the radius of the virtual collision detection sphere. The proposed 3D roaming and collision detection method applicable for massive spatial data overcomes the limitation that the existing roaming and collision detection methods are only applicable to 3D scenes with a small amount of data and simple models. It provides technical supports for freewill browsing and roaming of indoor/outdoor and overground/underground of the 3D scene in cases of massive spatial data."
https://openalex.org/W3008145841,"Animals born with physical impairments may particularly require behavioural flexibility and innovation to survive and carry out social activities, such as grooming. Studies on free-ranging Japanese macaques on Awaji Island, Japan, have shown that individuals with congenital limb malformations exhibited compensatory behaviours while grooming, such as increased mouth and elbow use for removing ectoparasites. The aim of this study is to explore disabled and nondisabled grooming techniques to determine whether and to what extent disabled monkeys develop novel grooming techniques, and if there is disability-associated variation in grooming efficiency. We hypothesized that modified grooming techniques used by disabled monkeys fulfilled the social and relaxing functions of grooming, however, that grooming by manually impaired individuals may still carry a hygienic cost to the recipients. Grooming behavioural data were collected by video in 2007 on 27 adult females (11 with CLMs). With a detailed grooming-related ethogram, we transcribed 216 2-minute continuous grooming video samples. We analyzed the data using generalized linear mixed effects models in R. We found that monkeys with manual impairment were less efficient groomers, as measured by removal and movement efficiency during grooming. However, there were no significant differences associated with the number of grooming movements per sample among the focal animals. Additionally, with a behavioural sequential analysis, we isolated 8 distinct grooming techniques and 3 novel disability-specific movements. Our results indicate that innovation and modification of movement types does not entirely compensate for manual disability, and that manual impairment carries a cost to the hygienic function of grooming. However, for the grooming recipient, the experience of being groomed by a disabled or nondisabled groomer is likely similar, and through movement compensation, disabled monkeys are able to engage in the social aspect of grooming without incurring any disability-associated costs."

Patients hospitalized because of a suspected acute infection and who were able to walk unassisted before this disease episode were included. At hospital presentation, the walking status was graded into: 1) can walk unassisted, 2) can walk assisted only, 3) cannot walk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and two-by-two tables were used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the inability to walk unassisted to predict in-hospital death.One-thousand-sixty-nine patients were included. Two-hundred-one (18.8%), 315 (29.5%), and 553 (51.7%) subjects could walk unassisted, walk assisted or not walk, respectively. Their hospital mortality was 0%, 3.8% and 6.3%, respectively. The inability to walk unassisted had a low specificity (20%) but was 100% sensitive (CI95%, 90-100%) to predict in-hospital death (p = 0.00007). The value of the inability to walk unassisted to predict in-hospital mortality (AUC ROC, 0.636; CI95%, 0.564-0.707) was comparable to that of the qSOFA score (AUC ROC, 0.622; CI95% 0.524-0.728). Fifteen (7.5%), 34 (10.8%) and 167 (30.2%) patients who could walk unassisted, walk assisted or not walk presented with a qSOFA score count ≥2 points, respectively (p<0.001). The inability to walk unassisted correlated with the presence of risk factors for death and danger signs, vital parameters, laboratory values, length of hospital stay, and costs of care.Our results suggest that the inability to walk unassisted at hospital admission is a highly sensitive predictor of in-hospital mortality in Rwandese patients with a suspected acute infection. The walking status at hospital admission appears to be a crude indicator of disease severity."

Aim(s)/Objectives To examine differences in STI diagnoses among UK- and Caribbean-born BC people. Methods Data on STI diagnoses in BC people attending specialist sexual health services (SHSs) during 2015 and living in England were obtained from the GUMCAD STI surveillance system, the national surveillance system for STIs in England. Associations between being UK- or Caribbean-born and each of several STI diagnoses were examined, using univariate and multivariable generalised estimated equations logistic regression models adjusted for sexual orientation, place of residence (London vs. non-London), HIV status, area-level deprivation, and STI diagnosis in the last year. All analyses were stratified by age (<25 vs. ≥25 years). Results In 2015, 63,568 BC people made 108,881 attendances at specialist SHSs; 81.9% of these attendances were made by UK-born BCs. The median age (years) was 26 for UK-born and 35 for Caribbean-born people (p≤0.001). Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and non-specific genital infection (NSGI) were the most commonly diagnosed STIs among UK- (5.8%, 2.1% and 2.8%) and Caribbean-born people (4.5%, 1.7% and 3.5%) respectively. Among BCs aged under 25, no significant differences in STIs were found between UK- and Caribbean-born people. Among BCs aged ≥25, compared to Caribbean-born people, those who were UK-born were more likely to be diagnosed with chlamydia (AOR 1.15 [95%C.I. 1.04–1.27]); gonorrhoea (AOR 1.23 [95%C.I. 1.06–1.45]) and genital herpes (AOR 1.23 [95% C.I. 1.10–1.56]) and less likely to be diagnosed with NSGI (AOR 0.89 [95% C.I. 0.80–0.99]) and Trichomoniasis (AOR 0.84 [95% C.I. 0.71–0.99]). Discussion/Conclusion STI diagnoses in BC people aged ≥25 attending specialist SHSs vary by region of birth. Country of birth may have an influence on social and sexual networks and therefore transmission of STIs."
https://openalex.org/W3006748387,"High beat-to-beat morphological variation (divergence) on the ventricular electrogram during programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) is associated with increased risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF), with unclear mechanisms. We hypothesized that ventricular divergence is associated with epicardial wavebreaks during PVS, and that it predicts VF occurrence.Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 10) underwent 30-min therapeutic hypothermia (TH, 30°C), followed by a 20-min treatment with rotigaptide (300 nM), a gap junction modifier. VF inducibility was tested using burst ventricular pacing at the shortest pacing cycle length achieving 1:1 ventricular capture. Pseudo-ECG (p-ECG) and epicardial activation maps were simultaneously recorded for divergence and wavebreaks analysis, respectively. A total of 112 optical and p-ECG recordings (62 at TH, 50 at TH treated with rotigaptide) were analyzed. Adding rotigaptide reduced ventricular divergence, from 0.13±0.10 at TH to 0.09±0.07 (p = 0.018). Similarly, rotigaptide reduced the number of epicardial wavebreaks, from 0.59±0.73 at TH to 0.30±0.49 (p = 0.036). VF inducibility decreased, from 48±31% at TH to 22±32% after rotigaptide infusion (p = 0.032). Linear regression models showed that ventricular divergence correlated with epicardial wavebreaks during TH (p<0.001).Ventricular divergence correlated with, and might be predictive of epicardial wavebreaks during PVS at TH. Rotigaptide decreased both the ventricular divergence and epicardial wavebreaks, and reduced the probability of pacing-induced VF during TH."
https://openalex.org/W3007052763,"A wireless photovoltaic retinal prosthesis is currently being studied with the aim of providing prosthetic vision to patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The major challenge of a photovoltaic device is its limited power efficiency. Our retinal prosthetic design implements a unique divisional power supply scheme (DPSS) system that provides the electrical power generated by all of the solar cells to only a subset of electrodes at any moment in time. The aim of the present study was to systematically characterize the spatiotemporal integration performance of the system under various DPSS conditions using human subjects and a psychophysical approach. A 16x16 pixels LED array controlled by Arduino was used to simulate the output signal of the DPSS design, and human performance under different visual stimulations at various update frequencies was then used to assess the spatiotemporal capability of retinal prostheses. The results showed that the contrast polarity of the image, image brightness, and division number influenced the lower limit of the update frequency of the DPSS system, while, on the other hand, visual angle, ambient light level, and stimulation order did not affect performance significantly. Pattern recognition by visual persistence with spatiotemporal integration of multiple frames of sparse dots is a feasible approach in retinal prosthesis design. These findings provide an insight into how to optimize a photovoltaic retinal prosthesis using a DPSS design with an appropriate update frequency for reliable pattern recognition. This will help the development of a wireless device able to restore vision to RP and AMD patients in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3007478731,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the second-largest and most contentious public assistance program administered by the United States government. The media forums where SNAP discourse occurs have changed with the advent of social and web-based media. We used machine learning techniques to characterize media coverage of SNAP over time (1990-2017), between outlets with national readership and those with narrower scopes, and, for a subset of web-based media, by the outlet's political leaning. We applied structural topic models, a machine learning methodology that categorizes and summarizes large bodies of text that have document-level covariates or metadata, to a corpus of print media retrieved via LexisNexis (n = 76,634). For comparison, we complied a separate corpus via web-scrape algorithm of the Google News API (2012-2017), and assigned political alignment metadata to a subset documents according to a recent study of partisanship on social media. A similar procedure was used on a subset of the print media documents that could be matched to the same alignment index. Using linear regression models, we found some, but not all, topics to vary significantly with time, between large and small media outlets, and by political leaning. Our findings offer insights into the polarized and partisan nature of a major social welfare program in the United States, and the possible effects of new media environments on the state of this discourse."
https://openalex.org/W3008301129,"Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) has been the focus of increased research because of its important role as an antioxidant and in reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced damage repair. Studies on GPxs have relevance with Macrobrachium nipponense because it has poor tolerance to hypoxia in Macrobrachium nipponense. The two subunits named as MnGPx-3 and MnGPx-4 according to the glutathione peroxidase nomenclature system. Both full-length cDNAs were cloned from the hepatopancreas. In this study, we analyzed the expression of two GPxs in Macrobrachium nipponense in response to changes in environmental oxygen. Expression levels of MnGPx-3 and MnGPx-4 indicated that both have strong responses to hypoxia. In situ hybridization showed that MnGPx-3 and MnGPx-4 were located in secretory and storage cells in hepatopancreas. These results suggest that GPx gene is expressed and released by secretory cells and released response to hypoxia. In the gill tissue, however, GPxs are located in blood cells, suggesting that they perform different functions in different tissues or organs. The results of in situ hybridization were consistent with those of quantitative Real-time PCR. This study provides a basis for understanding the oxidative stress response in M. nipponense under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3008582058,"This study aimed to identify factors influencing mothers' and their partners' perceptions of care quality, and to identify associated clinical factors.Questionnaires were developed based on eight interviews with couples after emergency Cesarean Sections (ECS). The internal structure of the questionnaires was examined using Rasch analysis. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to evaluate internal consistency of questionnaire items. Finally, associations between questionnaire scores and ECS characteristics were determined.Thematic analysis of interview data demonstrated that team-dynamics, professionalism, information, safety, leadership and mother-child continuity of care are important to patient- perceived quality of care. Questionnaire responses from 119 women and 95 partners were included in the validation and demonstrated satisfying fit to the Rasch model. The questionnaires had acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha 0.8 and 0.7 for mothers and partners, respectively. Perceived quality of care was negatively associated with increasing urgency of the CS. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were -0.34 (p <0.001) and -0.32 (p = 0.004) for mothers and partners, respectively. Perceived quality of care differed significantly across CS indications for both mothers (p = 0.0006) and their partners (p<0.0001).Team-dynamics, professionalism, information, safety, leadership and mother-child-continuity affect patients' perceptions of care. Perceptions of care were highly influenced by CS indications and urgency."
https://openalex.org/W3006912317,"ChronoMID—neural networks for temporally-varying, hence Chrono, Medical Imaging Data—makes the novel application of cross-modal convolutional neural networks (X-CNNs) to the medical domain. In this paper, we present multiple approaches for incorporating temporal information into X-CNNs and compare their performance in a case study on the classification of abnormal bone remodelling in mice. Previous work developing medical models has predominantly focused on either spatial or temporal aspects, but rarely both. Our models seek to unify these complementary sources of information and derive insights in a bottom-up, data-driven approach. As with many medical datasets, the case study herein exhibits deep rather than wide data; we apply various techniques, including extensive regularisation, to account for this. After training on a balanced set of approximately 70000 images, two of the models—those using difference maps from known reference points—outperformed a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network baseline by over 30pp (> 99% vs. 68.26%) on an unseen, balanced validation set comprising around 20000 images. These models are expected to perform well with sparse data sets based on both previous findings with X-CNNs and the representations of time used, which permit arbitrarily large and irregular gaps between data points. Our results highlight the importance of identifying a suitable description of time for a problem domain, as unsuitable descriptors may not only fail to improve a model, they may in fact confound it."
