https://openalex.org/W2143609607,"Mammals respond to reduced food availability by becoming more wakeful and active, yet the central pathways regulating arousal and instinctual motor programs (such as food seeking) according to homeostatic need are not well understood. We demonstrate that hypothalamic orexin neurons monitor indicators of energy balance and mediate adaptive augmentation of arousal in response to fasting. Activity of isolated orexin neurons is inhibited by glucose and leptin and stimulated by ghrelin. Orexin expression of normal and ob/ob mice correlates negatively with changes in blood glucose, leptin, and food intake. Transgenic mice, in which orexin neurons are ablated, fail to respond to fasting with increased wakefulness and activity. These findings indicate that orexin neurons provide a crucial link between energy balance and arousal."

We now studied the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction and nuclear import of IN in living cells using fusions of IN and LEDGF/p75 with enhanced green fluorescent protein and far-red fluorescent protein HcRed1. We show that both the N-terminal zinc binding domain and the central core domains of IN are involved in the interaction with LEDGF/p75. Both domains are essential for nuclear localization of IN as well as for the association of IN with condensed chromosomes during mitosis. However, upon overexpression of LEDGF/p75, the core domain fragment of IN was recruited to the nuclei and mitotic chromosomes with a distribution pattern characteristic of the full-length protein, indicating that it harbors the main determinant for interaction with LEDGF/p75. Although the C-terminal domain of IN was dispensable for nuclear/chromosomal localization, a fusion of the C-terminal IN fragment with enhanced green fluorescent protein was found exclusively in the nucleus, with a diffuse nuclear/nucleolar distribution, suggesting that the C-terminal domain may also play a role in the nuclear import of IN. In contrast to LEDGF/p75, its alternative splice variant, p52, did not interact with HIV-1 IN in vitro and in living cells. Finally, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of endogenous LEDGF/p75 expression abolished nuclear/chromosomal localization of IN. We conclude, therefore, that the interaction with LEDGF/p75 accounts for the karyophilic properties and chromosomal targeting of HIV-1 IN.

The early steps of HIV replication include reverse transcription of the diploid viral RNA genome into a double-stranded linear DNA replica and integration into a host cell chromosome. Reverse transcription takes place in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and results in the formation of a compact and stable preintegration complex (PIC), containing the viral reverse-transcribed genome and a number of virion-derived and cellular proteins. HIV and other lentiviruses are able to productively infect non-dividing, terminally differentiated cells, a feature distinguishing them from oncoretroviruses, which require cell division for productive infection (1Gartner S.

Emerman M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has characterized the nuclear import of HIV-1 PICs as an active, energy-dependent process (5Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. Dempsey M.P. Stanwick T.L. Bukrinskaya A.G. Haggerty S. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6580-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), yet its mechanism has remained a puzzle. The determinants of HIV nuclear import that have been suggested so far are: the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of the viral matrix (MA), Vpr, and integrase (IN) proteins, and the central DNA flap (for reviews see Refs. 6Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 275-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vodicka M.A. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 2001; 26: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Sherman M.P. Greene W.C. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The latter has been reported to be essential for nuclear import of HIV PICs and viral replication (9Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Although the effect of the central DNA flap appears to be viral strain- and host cell-dependent (10Limon A. Nakajima N. Lu R. Ghory H.Z. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12078-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Dvorin J.D. Bell P. Maul G.G. Yamashita M. Emerman M. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12087-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), its insertion in HIV-derived lentiviral vectors clearly augments transduction efficiency (12Follenzi A. Ailles L.E. Bakovic S. Geuna M. Naldini L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and nuclear import (13Van Maele B. De Rijck J. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The karyophilic properties of MA and its role in HIV nuclear import (14Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N. Adzhubel A. Spitz L. Lewis P. Goldfarb D. Emerman M. Stevenson M. Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) are unclear (15Reil H. Bukovsky A.A. Gelderblom H.R. Gottlinger H.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Malim M.H.

Cell Res. 2000; 260: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Vpr is also not strictly required for HIV replication and DNA integration in non-dividing cells (15Reil H. Bukovsky A.A. Gelderblom H.R. Gottlinger H.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Bouyac-Bertoia M. Dvorin J.D. Fouchier R.A. Jenkins Y. Meyer B.E. Wu L.I. Emerman M.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that the DNA flap, MA, and Vpr, albeit redundant, exert additive and/or inter-dependent effects on HIV nuclear import. IN, on the other hand, is an attractive candidate for the role of the PIC import factor. (i) It is essential for the viral replication and spread of infection in primary cells and most T-cell lines (20Nakajima N. Lu R. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7944-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); (ii) it is present in the PIC; (iii) its karyophilic properties have been demonstrated by many groups (for references see below). Unfortunately, mutations in IN have pleiotropic effects on viral replication, including alterations in viral particle morphology, defects in reverse transcription and integration (21Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confounding a detailed genetic analysis of its functions. HIV-1 IN is a 32-kDa protein, initially produced as part of the Gag-Pol precursor polyprotein and released after cleavage by the viral protease during maturation of the virion. IN is responsible for the catalysis of the insertion of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome (for reviews see Refs. 22Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Huges S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar, 23Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Like all retroviral INs, HIV-1 IN is composed of three domains. The N-terminal domain harbors an HHCC-type zinc binding domain and has been implicated in the multimerization of the protein (25Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The core domain contains the catalytic site and possesses structural elements necessary for sequence-specific recognition of the viral long terminal repeat (26Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The arginine/lysine-rich C-terminal domain of IN also contributes to the multimerization of the protein (27Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and is thought to be involved in DNA binding. In addition, binding to DNA has been shown to induce oligomerization of HIV-1 IN in vitro (28Vercammen J. Maertens G. Gerard M. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38045-38052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When expressed in or microinjected into human cells, HIV-1 IN accumulates in the nuclei (17Depienne C. Roques P. Creminon C. Fritsch L. Casseron R. Dormont D. Dargemont C. Benichou S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Pluymers W. Cherepanov P. Schols D.

A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). During mitosis, IN stably associates with condensed chromosomes (30Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies with digitonin-permeabilized cells have shown that nuclear import of HIV-1 IN can occur in the absence of cytosolic extracts, requires ATP hydrolysis, and is GTPase Ran-independent (34Depienne C. Mousnier A. Leh H. Le Rouzic E. Dormont D. Benichou S. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18102-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made on the nuclear import of the NLS receptor, importin α (35Miyamoto Y. Hieda M. Harreman M.T. Fukumoto M. Saiwaki T. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5833-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, the virus either does not rely on the classical importin- and Ran-dependent nuclear import mechanism or is able to take advantage of an alternative pathway. Recently, we have shown that in human cells HIV-1 IN forms a specific nuclear complex with lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription co-activator p75 (LEDGF/p75) (36Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Recombinant LEDGF/p75 protein effectively promoted HIV-1 IN strand transfer activity in vitro. Of note, LEDGF/p75 was found to be up-regulated in HIV-infected cells (37Schroder A.R. Shinn P. Chen H. Berry C. Ecker J.R. Bushman F. Cell. 2002; 110: 521-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). All these observations suggested that LEDGF/p75 could play a role in retroviral DNA integration. Although its precise cellular function remains elusive, several reports have implicated LEDGF/p75 in gene expression and cellular stress response (38Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 39Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48899-48907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 has been reported to be a DNA-binding protein, with specificity for stress response DNA elements (40Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to the abundant mouse and human LEDGF/p75 mRNA-derived expressed sequence tags in GenBank™, LEDGF/p75 is expressed at all stages of development in a variety of organs and tissues, including skin, bone, thymus, brain, mammary gland, testis, and embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells. A second protein product, p52, can be produced from the same gene as LEDGF/p75 as a result of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA (38Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 41Singh D.P. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Gene. 2000; 242: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At least in vitro, p52 was found to be a more general and stronger transcriptional co-activator than LEDGF/p75. In addition, the in vitro interaction of p52 with the ASF/SF2 splicing factor suggests that p52 might play a role in both transcription and splicing (42Ge H. Si Y. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 are intimate binding partners in human cells and that LEDGF/p75 is crucial for targeting IN to the nucleus and the chromosomes. We also show that both the N-terminal zinc binding and the catalytic core domains of IN are involved in the interaction with LEDGF/p75, whereby the core domain plays the dominant role. EGFP and HcRed1 Fusion Constructs—The full-length IN synthetic gene (INs) (30Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar) or its fragments were PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and an appropriate pair of primers (see below). Each primer contained either a recognition site for XhoI (sense primers) or for HindIII (antisense primers). In-frame stop codons were included in the antisense primers. The primers used were: Cs, 5′-GGGGGCTCGAGCAGACTGCAGAAGCAGATCACC; Cas, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGGACTTAGTCCTC; Ns, 5′-GGGGGCTCGAGCAGATTCCTGGACGGCATTGAC; Nas, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTACATAGCCTCGCC; Cores, 5′-GGGGGCTCGAGCAGACACGGGCAGGTTGATTGC; Coreas, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTACTCTTTGGTCTGG. The PCR fragments were subcloned between the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites of the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). A series of EGFP fusion constructs were made: pEGFP-INs, coding full-length HIV-1 IN, using the primers Ns and Cas; pEGFP-INs/ΔC, expressing IN with a deletion of the C-terminal domain, using the primers Ns and Coreas; pEGFP-INs/ΔN, expressing IN without the N-terminal zinc binding domain, using the primers Cores and Cas; pEGFP-INs/Nt (using the primers Ns and Nas), pEGFP-INs/Core (using Cores and Coreas), pEGFP-INs/Ct (using Cs and Cas) coding the N-terminal, the central, and the C-terminal IN domain, respectively. The H12N mutant of the synthetic gene was engineered by PCR with the primers H12N (5′-GACGGCATTGACAAGGCTCAGGAGGAGAACGAGAAGTACCACTC) and T3 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG) using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and pINs (30Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar) as the template. The second PCR was performed on the resulting amplicon with the primers Ns and T3; the final PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned into pEGFP-C2 to obtain pEGFP-INs(H12N). To obtain pHcRed1-INs, for expression of HIV-1 IN fused to the C terminus of the far-red fluorescent protein, HcRed1 (43Fradkov A.F. Verkhusha V.V. Staroverov D.B. Bulina M.E. Yanushevich Y.G. Martynov V.I. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the XcmI/EcoRI restriction fragment of pINs (30Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pHcRed1-C1 (Clontech) after treatment of the XcmI and the XhoI termini of the DNA fragments with T4 DNA polymerase. To generate HcRed1-labeled LEDGF/p75, the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of pCP6H75 (36Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), spanning the LEDGF/p75 open reading frame, was subcloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites of pHcRed1-C1. The coding sequences of HcRed1 and LEDGF/p75 were placed into frame via BspEI restriction and mung bean nuclease (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) digestion followed by re-ligation to obtain the plasmid pHcRed1-p75. To generate an analogous fusion between p52 and HcRed1, the XhoI/EcoRI fragment of pHcRed1-p75 was replaced by the XhoI/EcoRI fragment of pKB-Nat52 (see below), resulting in pHcRed1-p52. The plasmid pEGFP-p75 expressing EGFP-tagged human LEDGF/p75 protein was obtained by inserting the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of pCP6H75 (36Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) between the BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C2. Prior to ligation the BamHI and BglII termini of the DNA fragments were filled in, using T4 DNA polymerase. All plasmid constructs used in this work were verified via sequence analysis to confirm absence of mutations. Plasmids for Bacterial Expression of LEDGF/p75, p52, HIV-1 IN, and HIV-1 INH12N—The plasmid pKB-IN6H was used for the expression of the C-terminally tagged form of HIV-1 IN. To obtain pKB-IN6H, the IN gene (derived from the NL4–3 HIV-1 clone) was PCR-amplified from pINSD (44Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGG (T7 promoter primer) and 5′-GCGCGTCGACATCCTCATCCTGTCTAC (INSalI primer); the resulting PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and SalI and subcloned into the pET-20b(+) vector (Novagen). To create pGM-INH12N-6H, for bacterial expression of the C-terminally His6-tagged INH12N mutant, a DNA fragment containing the HIV-1 IN open reading frame with the mutation was engineered in two consecutive PCR reactions. First, pKB-IN6H was used as the template and a PCR was performed with the forward primer 5′-GATAAGGCCCAAGAAGAAAATGAGAAATATCACAG and the INSalI primer (see above). The resulting amplicon was used as template in the second reaction with the primer 5′-ATATACATATGTTTTTAGATGGAATAGATAAGGCCCAAG and the INSalI primer. The final PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and SalI and cloned into the pET-20b(+) vector. The constructs pCP-Nat75 and pKB-Nat52 were used for bacterial expression of non-tagged LEDGF/p75 and p52 proteins, respectively. A DNA fragment, containing the LEDGF/p75 open reading frame, was amplified using pCP-6H75 (36Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) as a template and 5′-TGACTCGCGATTTCAAACC and 5′-CCGCGAATTCTAGTTATCTAGTGTAGAATCCTTC as the primers. To obtain the pCP-Nat75 plasmid, this PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and inserted between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pRSETB vector (Invitrogen). Prior to ligation, the NdeI terminus of the vector DNA was filled in using T4 DNA polymerase. To produce pKB-Nat52, a DNA fragment containing the p52 open reading frame was constructed by PCR using the primers 5′-TGACTCGCGATTTCAAACC and 5′-GGCGAATTCTACTGTAGATTACATGTTGTTGGTGCTCAGTTTCCATTTGTTCC. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned between the EcoRI and NdeI sites of pRSETB. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GlutaMAX™, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.02 mg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were seeded the day before transfection in 8-well LabTek chambered coverglass cuvettes (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium). Transfection of HeLa cells was performed at ∼80% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.36 μg of plasmid, following the instructions from the manufacturer. Double transfections were accomplished following the same protocol except that transfections were performed with 0.18 μg of each plasmid. For transient LEDGF/p75 knock-down experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) synthetic duplexes using the Gene Silencer transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) or co-transfected with siRNA plus the pEGFP-INs plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to established protocols (45Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Fetal calf serum was added to the medium at 5 h after transfection. The effect of the RNA interference was studied 48–60 h after transfection. Western Blotting and Indirect Immunofluorescence—For Western blot detection, protein extracts separated in 11% SDS-PAGE gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium). The polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Invitrogen; the mouse anti-LEDGF p75/p52 antibody was from BD Biosciences (Erembodegem, Belgium). The polyclonal rabbit anti-HIV-1 IN antibody has been described previously (30Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Dako Diagnostics (Leuven, Belgium). Detection was carried out using ECL+ chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Amersham Biosciences) or with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chromogenic substrate for alkaline phosphatase. The broad range prestained protein marker mix (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) was used for estimation of the molecular weights. Indirect immunofluorescent detection of endogenous LEDGF/p75 was performed as previously described (36Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E.

Cells grown in LabTek II glass chamber slides (VWR International) were fixed by incubation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized/fixed with ice-cold methanol. The cells were then blocked in 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm ammonium chloride, and PBS for 30 min and incubated with monoclonal anti-LEDGF p75/p52 antibodies (used at a dilution of 1:300), followed by Alexa-488- or Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The nuclear DNA was stained with 5 μm ToPro3 iodide (Molecular Probes). Laser Scanning Microscopy and Image Analysis—Confocal microscopy was performed using an LSM 510 unit (Zeiss, Zaventem, Belgium). SYTO 17 (Molecular Probes) was used to stain DNA of live cells. Prior to image acquisition, cells were washed with serum-free OptiMEM (Invitrogen). All two- and three-color images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels were acquired in the multi-track mode. EGFP was excited at 488 nm (AI laser), HcRed1 at 543 nm (HeNe laser), and SYTO 17 at 633 nm (HeNe laser). After the main dichroic beam splitter (HFT 488/543 for EGFP and HcRed1, HFT 488/543/633 for EGFP and SYTO 17) the fluorescence signal was divided by a secondary dichroic beam splitter (NFT 635 VIS or NFT 543) and detected in the separate channels using the appropriate filters: BP 505–530 (for EGFP), LP560 (for HcRed1), and LP650 (for SYTO 17). In this set-up, no cross-talk between the green and red channels was observed. The colocalization of fluorescently-tagged proteins in the nucleus was quantified using the Image-Pro Plus version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA) and expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient (rp) (same as Pearson's r correlation) (46Gonzalez R.C. Woods R.E. Digital Image Processing. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ2002: 693-753Google Scholar). rp=∑i((S1i-〈S1〉)·(S2i-〈S2〉))∑i(S1i-〈S1〉)2·∑i(S2i-〈S2〉)2(Eq. 1) S1 and S2 represent the signal intensities of pixels in the first and second channel, respectively; 〈S1〉 and 〈S2〉 are the average intensity of the first channel and second channel, respectively. The correlation coefficient is a value between –1 and +1, with –1 corresponding to negative correlation between images and +1 corresponding to a total overlap of the images from the two channels. It reflects similarity of image patterns and does not depend on intensities of the images. Recombinant Proteins—Non-tagged LEDGF/p75 and p52 proteins were produced from the plasmids pCP-Nat75 and pKB-Nat52, respectively, in the Endo I-free PC1 Escherichia coli host strain (E. coli B, BL21(DE3), ΔendA::TcR, pLysS) (47Cherepanov P. Surratt D. Toelen J. Pluymers W. Griffith J. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2202-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression was induced in LB medium at 29 °C by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells harvested 3 h after induction were disrupted using a French press in 450 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the lysate was passed through a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) to capture LEDGF/p75 or p52, and the protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl concentration in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The fractions containing LEDGF/p75 or p52 were pooled and further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a 1-ml HiTrap SP Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). To produce C-terminally His6-tagged wild type HIV-1 IN, PC1 E. coli cells harboring pKB-IN6H were grown in LB medium to an optical density of 0.8 and induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, at 29 °C for 3 h. The protein was purified essentially as described for N-terminally tagged HIV-1 IN (48Cherepanov P. Este J.A. Rando R.F. Ojwang J.O. Reekmans G. Steinfeld R. David G. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed using a French press in 1 m NaCl, 7.5 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the soluble His6-tagged IN protein was enriched by batch adsorption to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Protein eluted with 200 mm imidazole, 1 m NaCl, 7.5 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4 was further purified on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). The His6-tagged H12N mutant was induced in PC1 cells from pGM-INH12N-6H and purified in a similar way. Purified recombinant LEDGF/p75, p52, IN, and INH12N proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 (Millipore, Brussels, Belgium), supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol plus 10% glycerol, and kept frozen at –80 °C. His6 Tag Integrase Pull-down Assay—Binding of IN to LEDGF/p75 or p52 was assayed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm imidazole containing 100 or 400 mm NaCl, in the presence or absence of 1 mm MgCl2 (binding buffer). 1 μg of recombinant His6-tagged HIV-1 IN or His6-INH12N was incubated with 1–3 μg of LEDGF/p75 or p52 in 200 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 2 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA).

https://openalex.org/W2020857138,"Most errors that arise during DNA replication can be corrected by DNA polymerase proofreading or by post-replication mismatch repair (MMR). Inactivation of both mutation-avoidance systems results in extremely high mutability that can lead to error catastrophe. High mutability and the likelihood of cancer can be caused by mutations and epigenetic changes that reduce MMR. Hypermutability can also be caused by external factors that directly inhibit MMR. Identifying such factors has important implications for understanding the role of the environment in genome stability. We found that chronic exposure of yeast to environmentally relevant concentrations of cadmium, a known human carcinogen, can result in extreme hypermutability. The mutation specificity along with responses in proofreading-deficient and MMR-deficient mutants indicate that cadmium reduces the capacity for MMR of small misalignments and base-base mismatches. In extracts of human cells, cadmium inhibited at least one step leading to mismatch removal. Together, our data show that a high level of genetic instability can result from environmental impediment of a mutation-avoidance system."
https://openalex.org/W2038084705,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a critical, negative regulator of diverse signaling pathways. Lithium is a direct inhibitor of GSK-3 and has been widely used to test the putative role of GSK-3 in multiple settings. However, lithium also inhibits other targets, including inositol monophosphatase and structurally related phosphomonoesterases, and thus additional approaches are needed to attribute a given biological effect of lithium to a specific target. For example, lithium is known to increase the inhibitory N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3, but the target of lithium responsible for this indirect regulation has not been identified. We have characterized a short peptide derived from the GSK-3 interaction domain of Axin that potently inhibits GSK-3 activity in vitro and in mammalian cells and robustly activates Wnt-dependent transcription, mimicking lithium action. We show here, using the GSK-3 interaction domain peptide, as well as small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3, that lithium induces GSK-3 N-terminal phosphorylation through direct inhibition of GSK-3 itself. Reduction of GSK-3 protein levels, either by RNA interference or by disruption of the mouse GSK-3β gene, causes increased N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3, confirming that GSK-3 regulates its own phosphorylation status. Finally, evidence is presented that N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3 can be regulated by the GSK-3-dependent protein phosphatase-1·inhibitor-2 complex."

https://openalex.org/W1970794606,"Inductive signaling leads to the coactivation of regulatory pathways for specifying general neuronal traits in parallel with instructions for neuronal subtype specification. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that ensure that these pathways are synchronized have not been defined. To address this, we examined how bHLH proteins Ngn2 and NeuroM controlling neurogenesis functionally converge with LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) factors Isl1 and Lhx3 involved in motor neuron subtype specification. We found that Ngn2 and NeuroM transcriptionally synergize with Isl1 and Lhx3 to specify motor neurons in the embryonic spinal cord and in P19 stem cells. The mechanism underlying this cooperativity is based on interactions that directly couple the activity of the bHLH and LIM-HD proteins, mediated by the adaptor protein NLI. This functional link acts to synchronize neuronal subtype specification with neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2088904029,"Dystroglycan is a central component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuromuscular diseases. Although dystroglycan is expressed by Schwann cells, its normal peripheral nerve functions are unknown. Here we show that selective deletion of Schwann cell dystroglycan results in slowed nerve conduction and nodal changes including reduced sodium channel density and disorganized microvilli. Additional features of mutant mice include deficits in rotorod performance, aberrant pain responses, and abnormal myelin sheath folding. These data indicate that dystroglycan is crucial for both myelination and nodal architecture. Dystroglycan may be required for the normal maintenance of voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier, possibly by mediating trans interactions between Schwann cell microvilli and the nodal axolemma."
https://openalex.org/W1968413329,"DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in tissues with higher order biological functions such as the testis and brain. DJ-1 is related to male fertility, and its level in sperm decreases in response to exposure to sperm toxicants. DJ-1 has also been identified as a hydroperoxide-responsive protein. Recently, a mutation of DJ-1 was found to be responsible for familial Parkinson's disease. Here, we present the crystal structure of DJ-1 refined to 1.95-Å resolution. DJ-1 forms a dimer in the crystal, and the monomer takes a flavodoxin-like Rossmann-fold. DJ-1 is structurally most similar to the monomer subunit of protease I, the intracellular cysteine protease from Pyrococcus horikoshii, and belongs to the Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like superfamily. However, DJ-1 contains an additional α-helix at the C-terminal region, which blocks the putative catalytic site of DJ-1 and appears to regulate the enzymatic activity.

DJ-1 may induce conformational changes to acquire catalytic activity in response to oxidative stress. DJ-1 was initially identified as a novel oncogene product that transforms mouse NIH3T3 cells in cooperation with activated Ras. DJ-1 is an ∼20-kDa protein comprising 189 amino acid residues ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and with a particularly high level of expression in the testes (1Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar).

Laskey J.W. Ferrell J. Suarez J.D. Riberts N.L. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 139-150PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wagenfeld A. Gromoll J. Cooper T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

With the exception of DJ-1, no other protein decreased in response to exposure to sperm toxicants, supporting the close relationship between DJ-1 function and male fertility. Recently, Klinefelter et al. (5Klinefelter G.R. Welch J.E. Perreault S.D. Moore H.D. Zucker R.M. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. Bobseine K. Jeffay S. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) revealed that DJ-1/CAP1/SP22 was located on the equatorial segment of the matured sperm head and anti-SP22 Ig significantly inhibited the in vitro fertilization of hamster oocytes. Thus, DJ-1 may play a role in both zona penetration and membrane fusion steps of fertilization (5Klinefelter G.R. Welch J.E. Perreault S.D. Moore H.D. Zucker R.M. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. Bobseine K.

Bull. 2002; 25: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PIASxα was isolated as a DJ-1-binding protein, which is specifically expressed in the testes and down-regulates the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor. DJ-1 directly binds to the androgen receptor binding site of PIASxα and absorbs PIASxα from the androgen receptor-PIASxα complex. Thus, DJ-1 is considered to be a positive regulator of androgen receptor-dependent transcriptional activity (7Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a highly conserved amino acid residue Leu-166 in DJ-1 was recently reported to be replaced by Pro in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, PARK7, and thus, this mutation was considered to be responsible for Parkinsonism (8Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). DJ-1 was also identified as a hydroperoxide-responsive protein, which is converted into a pI variant in response to oxidative stress as with H2O2 or paraquat, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, DJ-1 functions as a sensor for oxidative stress (9Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Since oxidative stress is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases, there is a great demand for the clarification of the relationship between the DJ-1 mutation and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (11Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although DJ-1 is a small protein of ∼20 kDa, it is related to cell transformation, male fertility, oxidative stress response, and Parkinson's disease. However, the molecular mechanism by which DJ-1 exerts these multiple functions remains elusive. Here, we report the first x-ray crystal structure of DJ-1 to get an insight into its functional properties. Data Collection—Protein expression, purification, and crystallization will be described elsewhere. All of the diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a RAXIS IV imaging plate detector (Rigaku) using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode x-ray generator. The data collection was performed at a total oscillation range of 142° with a step of 2° for each exposure time of 60 min. The camera distance was 130 mm. The crystal was found to diffract to a resolution of up to 1.95 Å and belong to space group P31 with unit-cell parameters of a = b = 75.04 and c = 74.88 Å. The crystal contains two molecules in an asymmetric unit and has a solvent content of 59%. Iridium and mercury derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in a reservoir solution containing heavy atom reagents at 293 K. Selenomethionine derivative was expressed in Escherichia coli B834(DE3) using an amino acid medium (12LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) containing selenomethionine instead of methionine. The diffraction data of those derivatives were collected in the same conditions as the native one with the exception that the oscillation range was 180°. All of the data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination of DJ-1—The initial phasing was performed by multiple isomorphous replacement method using the crystals of the three derivatives. All of the programs used were attached to the CNS program suite (14Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). After scaling was applied to the data sets of the derivatives, the heavy atom parameters were refined and the multiple isomorphous replacement phases were calculated using the data between resolution of 50 and 2.8 Å. After density modification (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) was applied to the multiple isomorphous replacement map, an initial model consisting of one DJ-1 molecule was placed on the modified electron density map. The other monomer was then generated through non-crystallographic symmetry operations. Initial refinement was performed by the torsion angle molecular dynamic simulated annealing method and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood amplitude target. For each cycle, the model was rebuilt manually using the molecular modeling program Turbo-Frodo (16Cambillau C. Roussel A. Turbo-Frodo, version OpenGL 1. Université Aix-Marseille II, Marseille, France1997Google Scholar). Throughout the initial refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were imposed on all of the residues. After the resolution was extended to 2.5 Å, the constraints were lifted and refinement was performed by energy minimization, individual isotropic B factor refinement, and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood amplitude target. Characterization of DJ-1—DJ-1 was cloned into a pGEX6P vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The protein was excised by trypsin and purified by gel exclusion chromatographies. Molecular weight analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the purified protein was intact DJ-1(1–189). The molecular weight in solution was estimated to be 44 kDa by gel exclusion chromatography, suggesting that DJ-1 exists as a dimer in aqueous solution. Overall Structure of DJ-1—The crystal structure of DJ-1 was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement. The electron density map after density modification was of sufficient quality to allow tracing of most residues in the structure. The model was subsequently refined to 1.95 Å with R = 17.1% and R free = 19.4%, respectively. All of the data collection and phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model contains two DJ-1 molecules in an asymmetric unit that form a face-to-face dimer with a 2-fold axis (Fig. 1) and 323 water molecules. The C-terminal Asp-189 is missing because of structural disorder. The dimer formation in the crystal is consistent with the result of gel exclusion chromatography, supporting the notion that the dimer form in the crystal is not due to crystal packing but is physiologically relevant. The overall structure of the DJ-1 dimer is globular with dimensions of 56.1 × 49.5 × 59.6 Å. Structure of the DJ-1 Monomer—The DJ-1 monomer takes a flavodoxin-like Rossmann-fold, which contains a parallel β-sheet arranged in the order of β2-β1-β4-β5-β7 as a core (17Horvath M.M. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2001; 42: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The β-sheet is flanked by α-helices so that DJ-1 has a three-layered structure (Fig. 2a). In addition, there are several secondary structural elements associated with the core, β3, α3, α6, α7, β6, and α9. In particular, β6 forms an anti-parallel β-sheet with β7. The DJ-1 monomer contains seven β-strands and nine α-helices in total (Fig. 2, a and b). Structure-based sequence alignment was made using human, mouse, Xenopus, nematoda, and Drosophila DJ-1 and CAP1/SP22, a rat homologue of DJ-1. Most of the conserved residues are involved in the structural core. Dimer Interface of DJ-1—The dimer interface and the opposite surface of DJ-1 are shown in an electrostatic surface potential presentation (Fig. 3, a and b). The total area of the buried surface is ∼2,600 Å2. The dimer interface comprises β3, α1, α8, and α9 (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the intermolecular β-sheet is formed among the Val-51, Ile-52, and Cys-53 located on each β3 strand. The distance between the sulfur atoms of Cys-53 is 3.1 Å, slightly far apart to form a disulfide bridge. The interaction between α-helices is mainly hydrophobic but there are several hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. A number of hydrophobic interactions including the following residues, Met-17, Val-20, Ile-21, Val-23, Val-50, Ile-52, His-126, Phe-162, Pro-184, Leu-185, and Val-186, were observed where half of them (Met-17, Ile-21, His-126, Pro-127, Pro-158, and Phe-162) were completely conserved in human, mouse, rat, Xenopus, Drosophila, and nematoda DJ-1. In particular, Met-17 and Phe-162 are the core of the hydrophobic interactions and are essential for dimer formation. The conserved (red) and type-conserved (yellow) residues are mapped on the surface of DJ-1. Notably, the dimer interface consists of the conserved and the type-conserved residues (Fig. 3c, encircled with a solid line) in contrast to the opposite surface (Fig. 3d), suggesting that the dimer formation of DJ-1 is correlated with its biological functions. Structural Similarity of DJ-1 to Other Proteins—Comparison of the DJ-1 structure with the Protein Data Bank (18Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8136) Google Scholar) data base using the DALI search engine (19Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) revealed that DJ-1 is structurally most similar to the monomer unit of protease I, an intracellular cysteine protease from Pyrococcus horikoshii with a Z score of 26.3 and a root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å for 166 residues (Fig. 4, a and b) (20Du X.

The catalytic cysteine residue is structurally well conserved in the GAT superfamily and is located on the short kinked loop connecting an α-helix and a β-strand characterized as the “nucleophile elbow” in α/β-hydrolases (25Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). As a result, the catalytic cysteine residue falls in an unfavorably allowed region in the Ramachandran plot (25Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Actually, in DJ-1, the connecting loop between β5 and α5 was found to form the nucleophile elbow similar to protease I (Fig. 4, c and d). Cys-106 is located on the loop and has an unfavorable main chain conformation. His-126 is the putative catalytic residue located in close proximity to Cys-106. The residues around the putative catalytic site in DJ-1 are also well conserved in DJ-1 homologues (Fig. 3c, residues encircled with a dotted line). However, there are no acidic residues around His-126 in DJ-1 monomer, whereas in protease I, the neighboring molecule provides Glu-74 to form the catalytic triad (Fig. 4d). Thus, we searched for the possibility to form the catalytic triad in the DJ-1 dimer but did not find any acidic residues. Structural comparison between DJ-1 and protease I revealed that DJ-1 contains an additional α9 at the C terminus, which distinguishes DJ-1 from the rest of the GAT superfamily proteins. α9 and the C-terminal region appear to block the catalytic site of the DJ-1 counterpart and are endowed with regulatory roles (Fig. 4c). His-126 is involved in the dimer formation through hydrogen bond interaction with Pro-184 and the hydrophocbic interaction with Val-186 of the counterpart, which imposes an unfavorable orientation on the His-126 imidazole ring to form the catalytic dyad and inhibits substrate binding (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, α9 may prevent the possible formation of the catalytic triad with an acidic residue on the counterpart as in protease I (Fig. 4d). We propose that in the crystal form, DJ-1 does not have any catalytic activity due to blockage by α9 and the C-terminal region but may have a catalytic function after conformational change induced by specific signals or protease digestion. Although we tested the protease activity of DJ-1 using synthetic substrates, we observed only negligible protease activity in its intact form (data not shown). DJ-1 is localized on the equatorial segment of the sperm head where the sperm fuses with oocytes as the sperm matures. In addition, anti-SP22 Ig significantly inhibited in vitro fertilization of hamster oocytes (5Klinefelter G.R. Welch J.E. Perreault S.D. Moore H.D. Zucker R.M. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. Bobseine K. Jeffay S. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results led us to speculate that DJ-1 plays an essential role in zona penetration and in promoting the fusion steps of fertilization where the protease activity of DJ-1 may be tightly regulated.Table IIStructural homologues to DJ-1aThe structures were compared to that of DJ-1 using the DALI program.ProteinCαbNumber of C atoms superimposed between the two structures.Z-scoreR.m.s.d.cR.m.s.d., root mean square deviation of superimposed C atoms.IdentitydThe sequence identity is given between the number of Cα toms superimposed.PDB codeÅ%Protease I16626.31.6221g2i-ACatalase HPII13616.52.0111cf9-AAnthranilate synthase (TrpG-subunit)1227.93.2121qdl-BGMP synthetase1227.23.1101gpm-Aa The structures were compared to that of DJ-1 using the DALI program.b Number of C atoms superimposed between the two structures.c R.m.s.d., root mean square deviation of superimposed C atoms.d The sequence identity is given between the number of Cα toms superimposed. Open table in a new tab Structural Implication for Parkinson's Disease—A DJ-1 mutation at Leu-166 to Pro was recently found to be associated with PARK7, a monogenic form of human Parkinsonism. Leu-166 is located at the middle of α8, and the mutation appears to break the α-helix. Leu-166 forms a hydrophobic interaction with Val-181, Lys-182, and Leu-187 on α9 and the C-terminal tail (Fig. 4c) so that the proline mutation would disrupt the hydrophobic interaction between α8 and α9, destabilizing the dimer interface of DJ-1. Notably, DJ-1 expression is induced by oxidative stress as with H2O2 or paraquat and is regarded as an oxidative stress-responsive protein (9Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because reactive oxygen species produced in normal dopamine metabolism have been implicated in neuronal death, oxidative stress in the brain is closely related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (11Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this context, it is reasonable to assume that DJ-1 functions as an antioxidant protein and any defects may be the cause of Parkinson's disease. DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein and plays essential roles in tissues with higher order biological functions such as the testes and brain. Anti-DJ-1 Ig inhibited the fusion of sperm with an oocyte. Moreover, DJ-1 levels in sperm decreased upon exposure to sperm toxicants and is thought to be responsible for male fertilization. Considering the structural similarity between DJ-1 and the GAT superfamily proteins, we speculate that DJ-1 has protease activity that is inactive in the dimer structure but becomes active by conformation change or protease digestion at the C-terminal region. DJ-1 was also identified as an oxidative stress responsive protein and was found to be associated with Parkinsonism, a neurodegenerative disease, supporting the notion that DJ-1 is responsible for the quality control of proteins under oxidative stress. Upon oxidative stress, pI of DJ-1 was reported to change from 6.2 to 5.8, suggesting that DJ-1 might adsorb the reactive oxygen species and is modified to acquire a slightly lower pI. Oxidative conversion of sulfhydryl group(s) at a cysteine residue(s) to a cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) is the most plausible candidate responsible for the pI shifts of hydroperoxide-responsive proteins (9Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-53 to Ala actually abolished the formation of the pI variant, confirming that Cys-53 is responsible for oxidative stimuli. 2T. Taira, manuscript in preparation. Since Cys-53 is located on β3 of the dimer interface, the conversion of Cys to Cys-SO2H in β3 may destabilize the dimer interface and the DJ-1-specific C-terminal region may be displaced, thus removing the inhibition of protease activity. Proline mutation may abolish the conformation change required for protease activity. The crystal structure of a heat shock protein, E. coli Hsp31, was recently reported (26Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its structure is quite similar to that of DJ-1, although an additional domain donates the acidic residues, resulting in the formation of the catalytic triad. However, the catalytic site is completely covered by the inserted domain, which develops a fused hydrophobic surface on the Hsp31 dimer. Thus, Hsp31 appears to sense and digest misfolded proteins, whereas DJ-1 appears to sense oxidative stress and gains the protease activity to digest oxidative damaged proteins. Although further studies are required to elucidate the relationship of DJ-1 with male fertility, oxidative stress, and Parkinson's disease, the crystal structure of DJ-1 has shed light on the structure-function relationship of DJ-1."

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 2Basu A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Specific isoforms play pivotal roles in several signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular growth, transformation, and differentiation (3Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Grunicke H.H. Uberall F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar). The isoforms are classified into three groups, based on their structure and cofactor requirement: (i) classic PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or calcium, (ii) novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, θ, and μ), which are activated by DAG but not by calcium, and (iii) atypical PKCs (ζ and ι), which are not responsive to either DAG or calcium. Each of these isoforms contains an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. The regulatory domains contain a pseudosubstrate domain, an autoinhibitory domain with substrate-like sequences that maintain the enzyme in an inactive state presumably by interacting with the substrate binding site in the catalytic domain. PKC activators like DAG, phorbol esters, and calcium are thought to relieve this intramolecular inhibition, resulting in a conformational change that liberates the substrate binding domain from the pseudosubstrate domain, thereby activating the enzyme. In previous studies we obtained evidence that in NIH3T3 fibroblasts PKC-α and PKC-ϵ can enhance the activities of at least three signaling pathways that converge on the serum response element (SRE): c-Raf-MEK1-ERK-TCF, MEKK1-SEK1-JNK-TCF, and rhoA-SRF (5Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The SRE is a transcriptional control element that plays an important role in the transcription of c-fos and other genes involved in cell proliferation. These findings suggest that specific isoforms of PKC integrate complex networks of signal transduction pathways that control gene expression. Cyclin D1 plays a critical role in the progression of mammalian cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Amplification and/or overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene is often seen in several types of human cancer (6Jiang W. Zhang Y.J. Kahn S.M. Hollstein M.C. Santella R.M. Lu S.H. Harris C.C. Montesano R. Weinstein I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9026-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1 promoter is one of the major targets for several growth stimulatory signaling pathways (7Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 8Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study we examined the possible roles of specific isoforms of PKC in the transcriptional control of cyclin D1, using serum-starved NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts as a model system. We present evidence that, among the nine isoforms of PKC we examined, constitutively active mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ were the most potent activators of the cyclin D1 promoter. We found that the AP-1 enhancer element in the cyclin D1 promoter is required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α and PKC-ϵ, because activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α or PKC-ϵ was abolished by either deletion of the AP-1 site or expression of a dominant negative c-Jun. Constitutively active mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ also activated the promoters for c-fos, c-jun, and cyclin E and when stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells stimulated cell growth. Thus, these findings provide evidence that in murine fibroblasts PKC-α and PKC-ϵ play important roles in enhancing cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was used to generate plasmids that encode WT or PKC mutants with a C-terminal HA tag (see Fig. 1A and Table I). pHACE-PKC-WT expression plasmids were generated by ligating full-length open reading frames of different PKC isoforms into pHACE digested with EcoRI. pHACE-PKC-DN expression plasmids were generated by ligating full-length open reading frames of PKC isoforms with a dominant negative (DN) (K→ R or K→ M) point mutation at the ATP binding site into pHACE digested with EcoRI. pHACE-PKC-ΔNPS expression plasmids were generated by ligating cDNA fragments encoding pseudosubstrate deletion (ΔNPS) mutants of PKC isoforms into pHACE digested with EcoRI. pHACE-PKC-CAT expression plasmids were generated by ligating cDNA fragments encoding only the catalytic domains (CAT) of PKC isoforms into pHACE digested with EcoRI. All of the cDNA fragments of these PKC mutants were generated by PCR and were analyzed to confirm their sequences, using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

For reporter assays, triplicate samples of 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.05–5 μg of various expression vectors, and 1 μg of the control plasmid pCMV-β-gal. The pcDNA3 plasmid DNA was added to the transfections to achieve the same total amount of plasmid DNA per transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and luciferase assays were done using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to parallel β-galactosidase activities, to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega). Western Blot Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, and COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. With both cell types, 2 × 105 cells in 60-mm plates were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of the indicated expression vectors or the control vector pcDNA3. Six hours after transfection, the cells were fed with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. The cells were then trypsinized and transferred to 10-cm plates and grown for 24 h before protein extraction. Cellular proteins were extracted by cell lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) that contained protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). 50 μg of total cell extract protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane at 60 V for 3 h at 4 °C. The membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then probed with the indicated antibody. The immunoblots were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-HA antibody (Covance), anti-cyclin D1 antibody (BD Pharmingen), and anti-cyclin E antibody (BD Pharmingen) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. PKC Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors or the control vector pcDNA3, as described earlier (5Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and cellular proteins were extracted by cell lysis in PKC extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) that contained protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). HA-tagged PKC proteins were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell extract protein using 3 μg of the anti-HA antibody and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose, after a 3-h incubation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with PKC extraction buffer and then twice with IP kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and resuspended in 20 μl of IP kinase buffer. The kinase assay was initiated by adding 40 μl of IP kinase buffer containing 10 μg of a GST-MARCKS substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The reaction products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Recombinant GST-MARCKS proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/LysS and purified to homogeneity using glutathione S-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The experiments were repeated three times and gave similar results. Generation and Characterization of NIH3T3 Cell Lines That Stably Express the ΔNPS Mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the control vector pcDNA3, pHACE-PKC-α-ΔNPS, or pHACE-PKC-ϵ-ΔNPS, using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were transferred to DMEM containing 10% calf serum and neomycin (600 μg/ml, Invitrogen) to select for cells that stably expressed the transfected plasmids. Neomycin-resistant clones were pooled and passaged in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and neomycin (200 μg/ml). For growth curve analysis, cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well in 6-well (35 mm) plates with 2 ml of DMEM medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were refed with fresh medium every 3 days. The number of cells per well was counted using a Coulter counter, every day for the subsequent 7 days. Generation of Constitutively Active and Dominant Negative Mutants of Specific Isoforms of PKC—The presence of multiple PKC isoforms in mammalian cells and the paucity of low molecular weight isoform-specific inhibitors of PKC, or a comprehensive series of isoform-specific PKC mutants, have made it difficult to determine the specific roles of individual isoforms in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Therefore, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A and Table I), we developed a series of expression vectors that encode HA-tagged wild type (WT), dominant negative (DN), constitutively active pseudosubstrate deleted (ΔNPS) and constitutively active catalytic domain fragments (CAT) of PKCs α, β1, β2, γ, δ, ϵ, η, ζ, and ι. Some of the mutants of PKCs α, δ, ϵ, and ζ were developed and described in one of our previous publications (5Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This series of expression vectors was transfected into COS-7 cells to characterize the proteins encoded by each of these constructs. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) indicated that all but one of these constructs (PKC-δ-ΔNPS) expressed significant amounts of the related HA-tagged proteins and that all of the major bands for these proteins were of the expected sizes. PKC-δ-ΔNPS was expressed at a much lower level than the other proteins (Fig. 1B), perhaps due to its instability or toxicity (as discussed below). It was also of interest to examine the in vitro kinase activities of these proteins. Therefore, immunoprecipitates of the same COS-7 cell extracts were prepared using an anti-HA antibody, and these immunoprecipitates were added to an in vitro kinase assay that contained a GST-MARCKS-(96–184) fusion protein (5Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as the substrate. Western blot analysis showed that equal amounts of HA-tagged PKC proteins were immunoprecipitated (data not shown). We found that all of the PKC-WT, PKC-ΔNPS, and PKC-CAT constructs but none of the PKC-DN constructs displayed kinase activities with this substrate (Fig. 1C). Most of the ΔNPS mutants had slightly higher kinase activities than the corresponding WT proteins, and the CAT mutants had much higher kinase activities than the corresponding WT or ΔNPS proteins, except for PKC-ι-ΔNPS, which had higher kinase activity than PKC-ι-CAT. The fact that for most of the isoforms the CAT mutants had higher activity than the ΔNPS mutants suggests that the N-terminal regulatory domains of PKCs may contain kinase inhibitory sequences in addition to the pseudosubstrate domain. We found that the PKC-δ-ΔNPS mutant had a relatively high level of kinase activity (Fig. 1C) even though this protein was only expressed at a low level (Fig. 1B). Activation of Cyclin D1 Promoter by Specific Isoforms of PKC—The ability of specific isoforms of PKC to activate the cyclin D1 promoter, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, was studied by using transient transfection reporter assays. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with the control plasmid, PKC-WT, PKC-ΔNPS, or PKC-CAT constructs together with the –1745CD1-luciferase reporter plasmid, which contains the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). Among the nine PKC-WT constructs tested, only PKC-ϵ-WT was able to cause a statistically significant activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (about 3-fold). However, when we transfected the PKC-ΔNPS constructs, which lack the pseudosubstrate sequences, the PKC-ΔNPS mutants of PKC-α and -ϵ caused significant activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (6- to 7-fold) and the PKC-ΔNPS mutants of PKCs β1, β2, γ, η, ζ, and ι caused moderate activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (2- to 4-fold). When we transfected the constitutively active PKC-CAT constructs, the CAT mutants of PKCs α, β1, β2, γ, ϵ, η, ζ, and ι caused significant activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (3-to 12-fold). Of these constructs, PKC-α-CAT and PKC-ϵ-CAT were the most potent, because they caused about a 12-fold activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. In contrast to the stimulation seen with other CAT mutants, the PKC-δ-CAT mutant inhibited cyclin D1 promoter activity (by about 40%), which is consistent with evidence that PKC-δ can inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis (17Mishima K. Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of endogenous cyclin D1 expression by PKC-δ has been reported in rat fat pad epididymal endothelial cells and rat smooth muscle cells (19Ashton A.W. Watanabe G. Albanese C.

The v-src expression vector was used as a positive control and showed strong activation of the cyclin D1 promoter, as described previously (22Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines 3rd, G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7341-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In general the CAT mutants gave higher activity than the corresponding ΔNPS mutants (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with our in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1C) and provide further evidence that there are inhibitory sequences in the N-terminal regions of these isoforms of PKC in addition to the pseudosubstrate region. The fact that the CAT mutants for these nine isoforms of PKC differed considerably in their activities (Fig. 2A) provides evidence that even though they lack the N-terminal regulatory domain they retain specificity. This is especially evident with PKC-ϵ, because both the WT and CAT constructs of this isoform had high activity and with PKC-δ, because both the WT and CAT constructs of this isoform had no or actually an inhibitory effect on cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the relatively high activities of the CAT mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ are not simply a result of their expression at higher levels than the other CAT mutants (Fig. 1B). We found that the ΔNPS and CAT mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ also activate the cyclin D1 promoter in human epithelial cells, including HeLa, MCF-7, and SW480 cells. 2J.-W. Soh and I. B. Weinstein, unpublished data. Therefore, these findings are not confined to mouse fibroblasts. To confirm the roles of PKC isoforms in the transcriptional control of cyclin D1, we examined the effects of dominant negative mutants (DN) of the same PKC isoforms on serum-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with either the control plasmid or PKC-DN constructs together with the cyclin D1-luciferase reporter plasmid. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h, treated with or without 20% serum for 24 h to induce cyclin D1 promoter activity, and assayed for luciferase activity. Fig. 2B shows that activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by serum was strongly inhibited by the DN mutants of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ (by about 80%), and partially by the DN mutants of PKCs β1, β2, γ, η, ζ, or ι (by 10–30%). The DN mutants of PKC-δ did not cause significant inhibition of the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by serum, which is consistent with our finding that the activated mutants of PKC-δ did not activate the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that PKC-α and PKC-ϵ are the two major PKC isoforms among the nine PKC isoforms examined in our studies that activate signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. Involvement of AP-1 in Activation of the Cyclin D1 Promoter by Specific Isoforms of PKC—To map the region of the cyclin D1 promoter required for activation by specific isoforms of PKC, a series of cyclin D1 promoter truncation mutants (Fig. 3A) were transfected in the presence or absence of the constitutively active mutant of PKC-α (PKC-α-ΔNPS). The cyclin D1 promoter mutants, which lack the AP-1, SP1, and CRE transcriptional response elements, were also used to map the response elements required for activation by specific isoforms of PKC. As shown in Fig. 3B, transient transfection studies with a series of 5′-deleted cyclin D1 promoter constructs showed that the proximal 964-base region, which contains AP-1, SP1, and CRE enhancer elements, is required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α. Deletion of the AP-1 enhancer element located at the –954 position upstream from the initiation site completely abolished PKC-α-dependent activation of cyclin D1 expression. However, deletion of the SP1 or CRE enhancer elements did not have any effect on PKC-α-dependent activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. Similar results were obtained with the constitutively active mutant of PKC-ϵ (PKC-ϵ-ΔNPS) (data not shown). To confirm the important role of the AP-1 site in activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α, an increasing amount (0, 0.5, 1, or 2 μg) of a plasmid containing a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun (c-Jun-N138), which lacks the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (Δ2–138) (7Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 23Baichwal V.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), was transfected together with the activated mutant of PKC-α (PKC-α-ΔNPS) and the –1745CD1-luciferase reporter plasmid. The dominant negative mutant of c-Jun (c-Jun-N138) inhibited activation of cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α-ΔNPS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). The dominant negative mutant of c-Jun (c-Jun-N138) also inhibited activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-ϵ-ΔNPS in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Taken together with the studies described in Fig. 3B, these results indicate that AP-1 activity is required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-α and PKC-ϵ in these cells. Activation of c-fos, c-jun, and Cyclin E Promoters by Specific Isoforms of PKC—We also examined the effects of these isoforms of PKC on the expression of other genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression using transient transfection assays with promoter-luciferase constructs of c-fos, c-jun, and cyclin E. c-fos and c-jun are immediate early response genes and are targets of several growth factors and oncogenes. Cyclin E is an important regulator of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, together with cyclin D1. These studies focused on PKC-α and PKC-ϵ, because, as described above, they were the most potent activators of the cyclin D1 promoter. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either the c-fos, c-jun, or cyclin E promoter reporter plasmid together with either the control plasmid or PKC-α-WT, PKC-α-ΔNPS, PKC-α-CAT, PKC-α-DN, PKC-ϵ-WT, PKC-ϵ-ΔNPS, PKC-ϵ-CAT, or PKC-ϵ-DN constructs. Again, the v-src expression vector was used as a positive control. Twenty-four hours after growing the transfected cells in serum-free medium, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. We found that the ΔNPS and CAT mutants of both PKC-α and PKC-ϵ"

The heme-iron atom of Ngb and Cygb is hexacoordinated, showing a His-Fe-His binding scheme, both histidines being the proximal and the distal histidine, respectively (13Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B.

Ngb has a high recombination rate (k on) and a slow dissociation rate (k off), indicating a high intrinsic affinity for the ligands (O2/CO). Before binding, the external ligands must compete with the internal sixth ligand, resulting in an observed O2 affinity of the recombinant proteins similar to that of Mb (1 torr at 37 °C).The function of Ngb and Cygb is a matter of debate. In response to hypoxia, Ngb is up-regulated in vivo and in vitro and protects the neurons against hypoxic damage (18Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Except for the omission of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, cells were grown and harvested as described for mNgb (17Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T.

Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm dithiotreitol. After suspension, 0.10 volume of 10% Triton X-100, 10% deoxycholic acid, 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA was added, and the cells were exposed to three freeze-thaw cycles and sonication until complete lysis. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in and washed three times with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol during 1 h at 0 °C. After elimination of the insoluble material by centrifugation (10 min 10,000 × g), hCYGB was reconstructed by adding a 1.4 m excess of hemin and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 4 °C. The reconstructed hCYGB was further purified as described for mNgb.Immunohistochemistry—Polyclonal antibodies against purified recombinant mNgb and hCYGB were raised in rabbits and monitored by ELISA using standard protocols. The anti-mNgb and anti-hCYGB antibodies were purified from sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography using the corresponding immobilized antigen coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose™ 4b (Amersham Biosciences) as matrix (22Gonyea L.M. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Adult Swiss mice (n = 6) were used for immunohistochemistry. All procedures were approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Antwerp and conformed to European Community regulations. After lethal injection with Nembutal (sodium pentobarbital) mice were transcardially perfused with physiological saline, followed by Zamboni's fixative (30 ml for 10 min). Tissues (brain, liver, heart, striated muscle, lung, kidney, and small bowel) were removed and post-fixed in Zamboni's fixative for 30 min at room temperature, after which they were treated for improving the immunocytochemical conditions according to Llewellyn-Smith et al. (23Llewellyn-Smith I.J. Costa M. Furness J.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After being stored overnight in 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, tissues were mounted in Tissue Tek (Sakura Finettek). Twenty-μm-thick cryostat sections were thaw-mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides and dried for 2 h at 37 °C. All primary and secondary antisera were diluted in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Dako X 0907, Carpinteria, CA) 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% thimerosal, and 0.01% NaN3 (PBS). All incubations were carried out at room temperature. After preincubation with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, sections were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mNgb (diluted 1:2,000) or hCYGB (diluted 1:1,000), followed by incubation with fluororescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Fab fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG heavy and light chains (H+L) (diluted 1:200; 1 h; Jackson ImmunoResearch number 111-097-003, West Grove, PA). Double labeling studies for these globins and specific markers were performed to determine the nature of mNgb- or hCYGB-immunoreactive cells.

Briefly, an incubation with primary antibodies raised against mNgb or hCYGB was performed overnight, after which the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated Fab fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (diluted 1:200) for 6 h, followed by a 2-h incubation with unlabeled Fab fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch number 111-007-003) to block all possible remaining binding sites of the first primary antibody. The sections were then incubated overnight with the second primary antibody, which was directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP, rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Dako Z334), calretinin (rabbit polyclonal, 1:5,000, Swant 7696, Bellinzona, Switzerland) or calbindin (rabbit polyclonal, 1:2,000, Swant CB-38). These antibodies were detected with a Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (GAR-Cy3; diluted 1:4,000, 1 h, Jackson ImmunoResearch number 111-165-144). Negative controls were performed by substitution of non-immune sera for the primary or secondary antisera and antibody specificity was checked by preabsorption of the mNgb and hCYGB antisera with the antigen. To this end, antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 in PBS and incubated overnight at room temperature with 1–10 μg of protein/100 μl.For the detection of Ngb and Cygb in mouse pancreas, the tissue was fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4 μm were immunostained with anti-mNgb (1:1,000) or anti-hCYGB (1:1,000) following the same procedures as described above. To determine the immunoreactive endocrine cells co-localizing with Ngb expression, the following markers were used: insulin (guinea pig polyclonal, 1:10,000, Dako A564), somatostatin (rat monoclonal, 1:100, Biogenesis 8330-0009, Poole, UK), and glucagon (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Affiniti GA 1181, Exeter, UK). The antibodies were detected with Cy3-labeled donkey anti guinea pig IgG (H+L) (diluted 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch number 706-165-148), a Cy3-labeled donkey anti rat IgG (H+L) (diluted 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch number 712-165-153) or GAR-Cy3, respectively.Sections were cross-explored using fluorescence (Olympus BX50 or Zeiss Axiophot) microscopy. Fluorescence micrographs of 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained tissues were made on the Olympus Microscope with a Sony 9100 VID CAM and processed with AnalySIS software. To obtain detailed images of labeled neurons, a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 410) equipped with image reconstruction facilities (Imaris 2.7 software; Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland; Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 work station) was used. Excitation of the FITC-fluorophore and the Cy3-fluorophore was achieved with an argon laser (488 nm) and a helium/neon laser (543 nm), respectively.Western Blotting—mCygb was isolated from a nuclear extract of mouse liver. The nuclei were isolated according to the method of Blobbel and Potter as cited by Tata (26Tata J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and mCygb was isolated by affinity chromatography on a matrix-immobilized anti-hCYGB antibody column. Extracts of the nuclear and the cytosolic fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunodetection the anti-hCYGB antibody (1:1,000) was used.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONELISA and Western blotting confirmed the specificity of the antibodies against mNgb and hCYGB, which did not cross-react or produce any reaction against recombinant Mb and Hb, and no cross-reaction was seen between mNGB and hCYGB (see Supplemental Material).Immunoreactivity of mCygb was detected in all studied tissues (Fig. 1). Within the brain, mCygb immunoreactivity was uniformly distributed over the different brain regions. No co-localization of mCygb and GFAP immunoreactivity was observed but some mCygb immunoreactivity-positive cells also displayed immunoreactive for calbindin, a calcium-binding protein known to be present in neurons within the central nervous system (Fig. 1), and calretinin, corroborating that, mCygb immunoreactivity is limited to neurons within the brain. In all mCygb-positive cells the immunoreactivity was specifically confined to the cell nucleus, as evidenced by combined detection of mCygb-immunoreactivity and DAPI, a specific nuclear staining (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Fluorescence micrograph of mouse liver stained with mCygb (green FITC fluorescence) and DAPI, a marker for cell nuclei.

Detection was done with anti-hCYGB antibodies. In lanes 2 and 3 similar protein concentrations (10 μg) of an affinity-purified nuclear extract (lane 2) and a cytosolic extract (lane 3) were analyzed, whereas in lane 1 recombinant mCygb is used as a positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, mNgb was expressed in distinct tissues: no immunoreactivity was detected in liver, heart, striated muscle, lung, small bowel, or kidney. In pancreas, mNgb immunoreactivity was restricted to the islets of Langerhans. It was visible in the brain, as such confirming the results of Mammen et al. (27Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Reuss et al. (28Reuss S. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Weich B. Wystub S. Reuss M.H. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Within the brain, mNgb immunoreactivity was found focally having different staining intensities. The most intense mNgb immunoreactivity was found in the medial vestibular nucleus (Fig. 4) and the paraolivary nucleus, and less intense reactivity was seen in the thalamic and subthalamic regions and in the cortex, whereas none was detected in the hippocampus and corpus callosum. These results mainly confirm previous in situ hybridization data (27Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem.

Hankeln T. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) who claimed a more uniform distribution of mNgb throughout the distinct brain regions, found a more focal distribution pattern of mNgb. This difference could be the result of the used techniques: with in situ hybridization the distribution of the mRNA was studied, whereas the present study detected the distribution of the protein. Combined detection of mNgb and GFAP and calretinin and calbindin revealed the absence of GFAP and calretinin immunoreactivity from mNgb-immunopositive cells. These mNgb immunoreactive cells clearly resembled a neuronal morphology. Single staining (Fig. 4) as well as double labeling with an antibody raised against calbindin revealed the cytosolic localization of mNgb both at the level of the perikaryon and neurites.Fig. 4Maximum value projections of confocal optical sections of mNgb-containing cells in mouse brain. mNgb-containing neurons in the medial ventricular nuclei of the mouse brain are shown.

This hypothesis was substantiated the presence of both mNgb and mCygb immunoreactivity cultured HN33 cells (data not shown) and by PCR experiments on neuronal cells in vitro. 2E. Fordel, E. Geuens, S. Dewilde, P. Rottier, P. Carmeliet, J. Grooten, and L. Moens, manuscript in preparation.Despite their different embryological origin, pancreatic β-cells and neuronal cells share the expression of similar proteins such as glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and neurofilament proteins. The expression of the same genes in two different cell types could be explained either by the presence of specific transcriptional activators (Islet-1, Pax-6, Beta-2, etc.) or by the absence of specific transcriptional repressors (example NRSF = neuron-restrictive silencing factor). mNgb was shown to be expressed in the endocrine pancreatic islets of Langerhans. This was confirmed by double labeling experiments with specific markers for the different types of islet cells: insulin, which is only present in β-cells; glucagon, an α-cell specific protein; and somatostatin, a δ-cell marker (29Baetens D. Malaisse-Lagae F. Perrelet A. Orci L. Science. 1979; 206: 1323-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). No specific co-localization was observed with glucagon or somatostatin; mNgb immunoreactivity was present in the β-cells in the center of the islet (Fig. 5). However, the immunoreactivity intensities of mNgb in the β-cells was quite variable, especially when comparing with that of insulin. Nevertheless, mNGB immunoreactivity was observed in each islet of the studied sections.Fig. 5Single confocal optical sections of mNgb (green, FITC fluorescence) immunoreactivity in mouse pancreas.

A precedent has been described in plants, i.e. in cultured alfalfa cells, where a hypoxia-inducible non-symbiotic Hb was localized in the nucleus by immuno-electron microscopy methods (30Seregelyes C. Mustardy L. Ayaydin F. Sass L. Kovacs L. Endre G. Lukacs N. Kovacs I. Vass I. Kiss G.B. Horvath G.V. Dudits D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).How globin-like molecules enter the nucleus is unclear, since no known nuclear transport signal could be detected in Cygb or the non-symbiotic alfalfa Hb. However, given the small size and mass of these molecules (44 × 44 × 25 Å and M r ∼17,000–21,000), simple diffusion cannot be excluded (31Quadrini K.J. Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Heme-based sensors represent an important class of signal-transducing proteins, reacting on the binding of diatomic molecules, such as NO, O2, and CO (33Spiro T.G. Jarzecki A.A. Curr. Opin. Chem.

They may exist as a single molecule containing a heme-based sensor domain and an effector domain with enzymatic activity. This is the case for FixL and EcDos, where a PAS-folded heme-based sensor domain is covalently linked to a kinase and a phosphodiesterase domain, respectively (38Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CooA, a homodimer, consists of a heme-containing cAMP receptor protein linked to a small DNA-binding domain with a typical helix-turn-helix motif (42Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V.

In contrast, NPAS2 is part of a non-covalent tetrameric complex, containing two NPAS2 subunits and two BMAL1 subunits, the latter allowing specific DNA binding (39Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R.

We describe our findings showing that TWEAK mediated the differentiation of RAW264.7 (RAW) monocyte/macrophage cells into multinuclear, functional osteoclasts. The effect of TWEAK was direct and not mediated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) as shown by the use of TWEAK- or RANKL-neutralizing antibodies and by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL. Recently, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) was suggested to be a receptor for TWEAK. We show that the Fn14/TWEAK receptor (TweakR) was not responsible for the osteoclastic effect of TWEAK on RAW cells. Flow cytometry analysis did not reveal the expression of Fn14/TweakR on RAW cells. Moreover, Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies did not block TWEAK-induced RAW cell differentiation into osteoclasts. This indicated that a second TweakR, TweakR2, exists on RAW cells and is responsible for mediating TWEAK-induced differentiation. We next compared the signaling pathways that are activated by the two receptors. TWEAK binding to TweakR2 activated the NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascades in RAW cells. In contrast, TWEAK binding to Fn14/TweakR activated the NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways but induced only a weak activation of MAPK in HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells expressing endogenous Fn14/TweakR. We propose that the biological effects of TWEAK are mediated by binding to one of at least two distinct receptors that induce differential activation of downstream signaling pathways.

Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). The receptors in this family usually share homology in the cysteine-rich repeats found in their extracellular domains. However, no significant homology is found in their cytoplasmic domains, with the exception of death domains within some receptors that are involved in apoptotic signaling. TNFRs thus can be categorized into three classes: transmembrane receptors without death domains, transmembrane receptors with death domains, and decoy receptors that either have truncated cytoplasmic domains or are soluble secreted receptors. TNFRs themselves do not possess intrinsic kinase activity; instead, they transmit signals by recruiting various adaptor molecules that bind to their cytoplasmic domains (2Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B.

The types of adaptor molecules recruited and the signaling pathways activated differ, depending on the specific receptor involved and the context of the target cell. Receptors with death domains generally recruit adaptor proteins such as the TNFR-associated death domain, Fas-associated death domain, and receptor interactive protein 1, ultimately leading to the recruitment of caspases that cause apoptotic cell death. A second major group of adaptor proteins is the TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs), which generally activate kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (2Darnay B.G.

The classification of Fn14 as a member of the TNF family was not considered at first because of its lack of homology with other TNFRs. Retrospectively, however, a limited homology was found with a single cysteine-rich repeat in the extracellular domain and a putative TRAF-binding motif in the intracellular domain. Little progress had been made in studying TWEAK-induced signal transduction pathways and the role that Fn14/TweakR plays in mediating TWEAK-generated signals. The ability of Fn14/TweakR to serve as a receptor for TWEAK was confirmed when it was shown to stimulate NF-κB activation upon TWEAK treatment and to mediate the pro-inflammatory and cell death effects of TWEAK (9Nakayama M.

The cytoplasmic domain of Fn14/TweakR, which is only 28 amino acids long, was shown to interact with various TRAF molecules (TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5) (19Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T.

Moreover, dominant-negative TRAF2 or TRAF5 molecules were shown to inhibit NF-κB activation in response to TWEAK (14Harada N. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Fukuchi Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys.

In addition, TWEAK was shown to activate caspases 3 and 8 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC3 cells and human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells that undergo TWEAK-induced apoptosis, although the receptor mediating this effect was not addressed (6Nakayama M.

In the present study, we discovered a novel function of TWEAK: the differentiation of RAW264.7 (RAW) monocyte/macrophage cells into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive, multinuclear osteoclasts. Interestingly, we also found evidence that Fn14/TweakR is not responsible for mediating this biological function. Thus, we propose that a second TWEAK receptor, TweakR2, exists. Moreover, we show that TweakR2 and Fn14/TweakR induce differential activation of signaling pathways. Cells and Antibodies—Cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. RAW264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen). HT-29 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics. We purchased anti-inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα) and anti-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK from Cell Signaling Technology; TWEAK-neutralizing antibodies from Cell Sciences, Inc.; and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-neutralizing antibodies from Leinco Technologies (St. Louis, MO). Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-Fn14/TweakR antibodies (PE-ITEM-4) and unlabeled ITEM-4 (Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies) were purchased from eBiosciences. Chromatographically purified mouse IgG was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Fn14:Fc (Fn14 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1) was purchased from Alexis Corporation; and recombinant human osteoprotegerin (OPG) was purchased from R&D Systems. Construct Generation and Fusion Protein Purification—A plasmid containing the cDNA of human TWEAK was generously provided by Dr. B. Aggarwal (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). To generate GST-TWEAK, a cDNA fragment of TWEAK (amino acids 97–250) was amplified by PCR and was inserted into pGEX-KG, in frame with GST, using the XbaI/XhoI sites. To purify GST-TWEAK, pGEX-KG-TWEAK was transformed into BL-21 Escherichia coli cells (Novagen). Cells were grown for 2 h at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced by exposure to 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μm aprotinin, and 10 μm leupeptin) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) were used to pull down GST-TWEAK. Beads were washed in lysis buffer, next with a high-salt buffer (lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl), and finally with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. GST-fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Purified GST-proteins were stored in small aliquots at –30 °C in 10% glycerol. pcDNA3.1-RANKL, an expression vector with full-length murine RANK, was generously provided by Y. Choi (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). To generate a bacterial expression vector for His-RANKL, mRANK (amino acids 157–316) was amplified from pcDNA3.1-RANKL; the resulting PCR product was digested with Hin-dIII/NotI and was finally ligated in-frame with hemagglutinin (N-terminal) and histidine (C-terminal) tags into the expression vector pHB6 (Roche Applied Science). His-RANKL was purified using nickel-affinity chromatography, essentially using the same procedure as described for the purification of GST-fusion proteins (23Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). RAW Cell Differentiation Assay—RAW cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate or 3,500 cells per well in a 48-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Ligands were added the next day, and cells were allowed to differentiate for 4 days. Cells were then stained for TRAP, an osteoclast-specific marker, using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Osteoclasts were defined as large cells that contained more than five nuclei and were TRAP-positive. Bone Resorption Assay—RAW cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells per well on an artificial bone slide (BD Biosciences) and allowed to attach overnight. Ligands and/or OPG were added the next day. After 6 days, the medium was removed, the slide was fixed in bleach solution containing 5.2% NaCl for 5 min at room temperature, and washed in distilled H2O before examination by light microscopy. Kinase Assay—JNK activity was analyzed using GST-Jun (amino acids 1–79) as a substrate as described previously (24Haridas V. Darnay B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well dish and treated as indicated. Cells were harvested and washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were lysed for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were spun for 25 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the amount of protein in each sample was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated using anti-JNK antibodies. Beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer and once in a low-salt buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 25 mm NaCl. The kinase assay was performed in a 2× reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 40 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 μg of GST-Jun (amino acids 1–79), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. Samples were analyzed using a 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-Jun was detected using autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min on ice and spun at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 25 min at 4 °C. To prepare cytosolic extracts, cells were suspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 30 min, after which 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 3%. Samples were vortexed for 3 s, centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C, and supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a clean tube. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with the appropriate antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendation and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence analysis. Flow Cytometry—Samples of 1 × 106 RAW or HT-29 cells were incubated in 0.1 ml of PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum together with 0.5 μg of either PE-ITEM-4 or its isotype control (PE-mIgG2b/κ; BD Pharmingen) for 2 h on ice in the dark. Samples were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with Cell Quest software. TWEAK Induces Differentiation of RAW Cells into Osteoclasts—To study TWEAK-induced signal transduction, we screened for cells that responded to TWEAK. We found that treatment of RAW cells with TWEAK resulted in a dose-dependent differentiation of RAW cells into large, multi-nucleated, TRAP-positive osteoclasts (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether TWEAK-induced osteoclasts were functional and able to resorb bone, RAW cells were plated on an artificial bone matrix and treated with either RANKL or TWEAK. TWEAK-induced osteoclast activation, like that of RANKL, resulted in pit formation in the artificial bone matrix (Fig. 1C). Hence, TWEAK induced the differentiation of RAW cells into functional, bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The differentiation induced by TWEAK was very similar to that induced by the osteoclastic factor RANKL (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm that the osteoclastic effect of TWEAK was direct and not mediated by RANKL, TWEAK was combined with OPG, a decoy receptor for RANKL that inhibits its activity. TWEAK induced both RAW cell differentiation into osteoclasts and bone resorption in the presence of OPG, whereas the osteoclastic effect of RANKL was blocked completely by OPG (Figs. 1C and 2A). No inhibition of TWEAK-induced osteoclasts was observed even when a higher concentration of OPG was used (500 ng/ml OPG; Fig. 1C and data not shown). In addition, TWEAK-neutralizing antibodies, but not RANKL-neutralizing antibodies, inhibited TWEAK-induced osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Conversely, RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis was blocked by RANKL-neutralizing antibodies but not by TWEAK-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2B). These assays confirmed that TWEAK induced the differentiation of RAW cells into TRAP-positive osteoclasts in a RANKL-independent manner. Fn14/TweakR was recently identified as a receptor for TWEAK (19Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 837-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We confirmed the interaction between TWEAK and Fn14/TweakR using both full-length Fn14/TweakR and the soluble extracellular domain of Fn14/TweakR, Fn14:Fc (data not shown). Fn14:Fc was previously used to confirm the involvement of TWEAK in several other biological processes, including the migration of endothelial cells, astrocyte proliferation, and fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated angiogenesis (17Desplat-Jego S. Varriale S. Creidy R. Terra R. Bernard D. Khrestchatisky M. Izui S. Chicheportiche Y. Boucraut J. J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 133: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 837-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the ability of Fn14:Fc to inhibit TWEAK-induced osteoclast differentiation in RAW cells. RAW cells were treated with either TWEAK or RANKL in the presence of increasing concentrations of Fn14:Fc and were stained for TRAP expression after 4 days. Fn14:Fc inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the formation of osteoclasts induced by TWEAK but not those induced by RANKL. Because Fn14:Fc acts by binding to TWEAK and inhibiting it from interacting with its receptor, this confirmed that the differentiation of RAW cells into osteoclasts was mediated by TWEAK (Fig. 2C). RAW Cells Do Not Express Fn14/TweakR—Next, we tested whether RAW cells expressed Fn14/TweakR. HT-29 cells were used as a positive control (9Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kojima Y. Harada N. Kominami E. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and expressed Fn14/TweakR as determined by cell surface staining with PE-ITEM-4, a monoclonal anti-Fn14/TweakR antibody (Fig. 3A, top histograms). In addition, expression of Fn14/TweakR was detected on mouse NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that ITEM-4 antibodies recognize both mouse and human Fn14/TweakR (data not shown). Interestingly, no expression of Fn14/TweakR was detected on RAW cells by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3A, bottom histograms)or by Western blot analysis with anti-Fn14/TweakR antibodies (data not shown). Consistent with the lack of Fn14/TweakR expression on RAW cells, Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies (ITEM-4) did not inhibit TWEAK-induced differentiation of RAW cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that a second receptor for TWEAK, other than Fn14/TweakR, exists on RAW cells. We hereafter refer to this receptor as TweakR2. Differential Activation of Signaling Pathways by Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2—To examine the signaling pathways that are activated by Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2, we compared stimulation of the NF-κB, MAPK, and JNK pathways both in HT-29 cells, which express endogenous Fn14/TweakR, and in RAW cells, which express TweakR2. NF-κB activation was monitored by the degradation of IκBα, an NF-κB inhibitor. Once IκBα is degraded, NF-κB is free to pass into the nucleus and bind to its specific response elements (25Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, TWEAK stimulated IκBα degradation in both HT-29 and RAW cells, indicating that both Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2 activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. To verify that each of the cell lines express only one of the receptors and not both, we used Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing ITEM-4 antibodies. Indeed, ITEM-4, but not control mouse IgG antibodies, completely inhibited TWEAK-induced IκBα degradation in HT-29 cells. These results confirmed that in HT-29 cells TWEAK-induced signaling was mediated only via Fn14/TweakR and not through TweakR2. In contrast, ITEM-4 antibodies had no effect on TWEAK-induced MAPK activation in RAW cells, suggesting that the signaling in these cells was not mediated via Fn14/ TweakR. Hence, this indicated that each cell line expresses only one type of receptor and not both. To determine whether MAPK is activated by Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2, we monitored activation of the p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2) proteins by Western blotting with phospho-specific anti-p42/p44 antibodies. A time-course analysis with antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated forms of these proteins revealed that TWEAK induced the phosphorylation of MAPK after 10–15 min of stimulation in RAW cells (Fig. 4B). ITEM-4 antibodies did not inhibit MAPK activation, verifying that Fn14/TweakR is not responsible for mediating the response in RAW cells. In contrast, TWEAK treatment of HT-29 cells expressing endogenous Fn14/TweakR resulted in only a weak activation of MAPK (Fig. 4B). We have repeated these experiments numerous times and got either weak activation or no activation of MAPK in HT-29 cells. To confirm that low TWEAK concentrations were not preventing us from detecting significant MAPK activation in HT-29 cells, we increased the concentrations from 500 to 1500 ng/ml. However, even at the higher TWEAK concentration, the activation of MAPK was still minimal (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Treatment of HT-29 cells with epidermal growth factor induced MAPK activation within 5 min, confirming that the MAPK pathway was intact in these cells. We next examined the ability of TWEAK to activate the JNK signaling pathway in RAW and HT-29 cells. TWEAK treatment resulted in JNK activation within 10–15 min in both cell lines, as detected by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-Jun as a substrate (Fig. 4C). This suggested that both Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2 activate the JNK pathway. Our findings have revealed the presence of a second receptor for TWEAK, which we refer to as TweakR2, that mediated the differentiation of RAW cells into osteoclasts. Considering the wide range of TWEAK's biological effects and the short (28 amino acids) cytoplasmic domain of Fn14/TweakR, it is conceivable that at least one additional receptor is involved in TWEAK signaling. The ability to bind to more than one receptor and elicit diverse responses is common among members of the TNF family and previously has been shown for numerous TNF ligands, including TNF, TRAIL, BLYS, APRIL, LTα, and LIGHT (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence supports a role for Fn14/TweakR in mediating TWEAK's effects (9Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kojima Y. Harada N. Kominami E. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Harada N. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Fukuchi Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Brown S.A. Richards C.M. Hanscom H.N. Feng S.L. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, the involvement of Fn14/TweakR in cell death and inflammatory processes was shown by the use of Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies (9Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kojima Y. Harada N. Kominami E. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Harada N. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Fukuchi Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In other TWEAK-induced responses, such as angiogenesis, there is no direct evidence to suggest the involvement of Fn14/TweakR. In fact, the involvement of Fn14/TweakR in angiogenesis was based on indirect experiments using Fn14/TweakR:Fc, which blocks TWEAK's action, but not Fn14/TweakR itself. However, Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies that specifically block Fn14/TweakR were not tested (19Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 837-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We present two lines of evidence to support the existence of TweakR2. First, in the absence of Fn14/TweakR, TWEAK activated signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, MAPK, and JNK, and caused RAW cells to differentiate into functional osteoclasts. Second, Fn14/TweakR-neutralizing antibodies did not inhibit RAW cell differentiation. Hence, our data strongly support the hypothesis of an additional TWEAK receptor. Based on our results, both Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2 activated NF-κB, MAPK, and JNK, although Fn14/TweakR only weakly activated MAPK (Fig. 4). In support of our findings, TWEAK weakly induced MAPK activation in 293 cells transiently transfected with Fn14/TweakR (data not shown). However, in a series of reporter assays using MAPK family responsive elements (activator protein 1, cAMP response element, and serum response element), transfection of Fn14/TweakR into NIH3T3 cells did not induce activation of MAPK, JNK, or p38 MAPK (21Brown S.A. Richards C.M. Hanscom H.N. Feng S.L. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In light of the interaction between Fn14/TweakR and TRAFs and the paradigm of TRAF-mediated activation of NF-κB and the MAPK family (26Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is surprising that Fn14/TweakR only weakly activated the MAPK pathway in HT-29 cells (Fig. 4) and did not activate it in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Fn14/TweakR (21Brown S.A. Richards C.M. Hanscom H.N. Feng S.L. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The ability of Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2 to differently stimulate signaling pathways may suggest that the two receptors use distinct intracellular adaptor/signaling molecules to transmit their signals. Alternatively, it is possible that the recruitment of specific signaling molecules depends on their presence or concentration in a certain cell type. We believe it is unlikely that the differential activation of signaling pathways stems from the amount of receptors expressed because both receptors were able to induce NF-κB activation to a similar extent. The differential activation of signaling pathways by Fn14/TweakR and TweakR2 probably reflects the various roles that these receptors play in mediating TWEAK's effects. TWEAK previously has been found to induce a wide array of cellular responses, including proliferation, migration, and induction of cell death. Our findings suggest that TWEAK is a potentially novel osteoclastic factor that is independent of RANKL. Although TWEAK and RANKL were similar in terms of their osteoclastic effects in RAW cells, we did not find that TWEAK induced the differentiation of osteoclasts from a primary human monocyte precursor (data not shown). Perhaps RAW cells, which are further down the differentiation pathway, can differentiate more easily than human monocytes. Although RAW cells require only RANKL (or only TWEAK) for their differentiation (27Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), primary human monocytes also require macrophage-colony stimulating factor (28Quinn J.M. Elliott J. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that factors other than macrophage-colony stimulating factor are required to drive the TWEAK-induced differentiation of human monocytes. The finding that knockout mice deficient in RANK or RANKL expression lack osteoclasts argues against a role for TWEAK in this model system (29Kong Y.Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Van G. Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M.

However, TNF-α, another TNF family member with potential osteoclastic effects, also was unable to substitute for RANK/RANKL in knockout mice (32Kobayashi K. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Udagawa N. Takami M. Kotake S. Nakagawa N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Shima N. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Martin T.J. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 33Azuma Y.

Hence, it is possible that factors such as TWEAK and TNF-α exert their osteoclastic effects only under certain pathological conditions. Interestingly, TWEAK and RANKL exhibited additive osteoclastic effects when used in combination in RAW cells (data not shown) and not synergistic effects, as seen with TNF-α and RANKL (34Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). This additive response is supported by our findings that TWEAK activated downstream signaling pathways in RAW cells similar to those activated by RANKL, including MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB (35Lee S.E.

Here, we present a novel finding that the stable TXA2 analogue, U46619, induces two waves of platelet secretion, each of which precedes a distinct wave of platelet aggregation. ADP released from platelets during the first wave of secretion played a major role in augmenting the first wave of platelet aggregation. The second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation required the first wave of both ADP secretion and aggregation and were blocked by either the integrin inhibitor RGDS or a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, indicating a requirement for both the integrin outside-in signal and ADP-activated Gi pathway. U46619 stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, which was augmented by ADP but did not require integrin outside-in signaling. Platelets from PI3Kγ knock-out mice or PI3K inhibitor-treated platelets showed an impaired second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation. However, the second wave of platelet aggregation was restored by addition of exogenous ADP to PI3Kγ deficient or PI3K inhibitor-treated platelets. Thus, our data indicate that PI3K, together with the integrin outside-in signaling, play a central role in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion, which leads to the second wave of irreversible platelet aggregation.

Platelets play a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis and help maintain the integrity of the vessel wall. At sites of vascular injury, platelets are activated by various soluble and immobilized agonists, leading to shape change, aggregation, and secretion of granule contents. Platelet activation includes a series of rapid positive feedback loops that greatly amplify the activation signals and enable robust platelet recruitment at the site of vascular injury. An important mechanism of this response amplification is the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) 1The abbreviations used are: TXA2, thromboxane A2; TP, thromboxane-prostanoid; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; LY294002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; A3P5P, adenosine-3′-phosphate-5′-phosphate; 2MeSAMP, 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-monophosphate triethylammonium salt. via the cyclooxygenase-mediated arachidonic metabolic pathway (1Samuelsson B.

In addition, dissociation of Gα subunits from Gβγ subunits induced by receptor occupancy allows Gβγ subunits to activate phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), resulting in increases in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and activation of Akt (20Kucera G.L.

However, the specific role of PI3K in signaling platelet activation and, in particular, in TXA2-induced platelet activation remains unclear. Among the unresolved issues in TXA2-induced platelet activation pathway is the relationship between the TXA2-induced platelet secretion and aggregation. Previous studies showed evidence that TXA2-induced secretion follows initial wave of platelet aggregation, and the initial wave of platelet aggregation is independent of platelet secretion (32Charo I.F. Feinman R.D. Detwilter T.C. Smith J.B. Ingerman C.M. Silver M.J. Nature. 1977; 269: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that ADP and ADP-induced P2Y12-dependent Gαi pathway are important in TXA2-induced initial platelet aggregation (19Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb.

To resolve the discrepancy, and to understand the specific role of PI3Ks in TXA2-induced platelet activation, we present a new finding that TXA2 receptor induces two waves of platelet secretion. ADP from the first wave of secretion is important in augmenting the first wave of platelet aggregation, which in turn is important in the triggering the second wave of platelet secretion, and thus the second wave of platelet aggregation. Furthermore, we present novel evidence that PI3K, by cooperating with the integrin outside-in signal, plays a critical role in signaling the induction of second wave of platelet secretion. These results suggest a novel response amplification mechanism in TXA2-induced platelet activation.

Whole blood from homozygous PI3Kγ knockout and wild type mice was collected from the inferior vena cava using 17 volume of ACD (85 mm trisodium citrate, 83 mm dextrose, and 21 mm citric acid) as anticoagulant.

Platelets were then washed twice with CGS (0.12 m sodium chloride, 0.0129 m trisodium citrate, and 0.03 m d-glucose, pH 6.5), resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (36Du X.P. Plow E.F.

Platelet Aggregation and Secretion—Platelet aggregation was measured by detecting changes in light transmission. Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of ATP using luciferin/luciferase reagent (Chrono-lume) (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA). Luciferin/luciferase (12 μl) was added to 238 μl of washed platelet suspension within 2 min before stimulation. Platelet aggregation and secretion were recorded in real time in a Chrono-Log lumi-aggregometer at 37 °C with stirring (1000 rpm). To examine the effects of PI3K inhibitors, platelets were preincubated with wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (20 μm) for 5 min prior to the addition of U46619. Assessment of Fibrinogen Binding—Washed mouse platelets (200 μl, 2 × 108/ml in Tyrode's buffer) were preincubated with LY294002 (20 μm), Me2SO, or RGDS (2 mm) at room temperature for 5 min. Platelets were then incubated with Oregon Green 488-labeled fibrinogen (30 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of U46619 (1 μm) at 37 °C in the aggregometer for various lengths of time and then analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScalibur. Western Blot Analysis of Akt Phosphorylation in Platelets—Washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2 h before use. Platelets were stimulated with U46619 (1 μm) in a platelet aggregometer at 37° for 5 min and then solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Platelet lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gel and electrotransfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated with a polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (Santa Cruz) or a polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated Ser473 of Akt (New England Biolabs) at 22 °C for 2 h. After three washes in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.5 μg/ml) for 45 min. After further washing, reactions were visualized using an Amersham-Pharmacia enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Human Platelet Preparation and Aggregation—Fresh blood from healthy volunteers was anticoagulated with 17 volume of ACD (36Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Platelets were washed with CGS buffer, resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h as described previously (37Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol.

Platelet aggregation and secretion was measured in a Chrono-Log lumi-aggregometer as described above for mouse platelets.

U46619 Induces Two Waves of Secretion and Two Waves of Aggregation in Mouse and Human Platelets—To determine the roles of platelet secretion in TXA2-induced platelet aggregation, we examined platelet secretion and aggregation induced by a stable TXA2 analog, U46619, using washed platelets from wild type C57BL/6 mice and healthy human donors. Platelet aggregation and ATP release as a marker for secretion from dense granules were monitored in a lumi-aggregometer in real time. Using this method, we found that U46619 induced two waves of secretion and two waves of aggregation in mouse (Fig. 1) and human platelets (Fig. 2). The first wave of platelet secretion occurred very quickly following addition of U46619, which is followed sequentially by the first wave of platelet aggregation, the second wave of platelet secretion, and the second wave of platelet aggregation. Both waves of secretion and platelet aggregation were abolished by TXA2 receptor antagonists, SQ29548 and BMS180291, indicating that they were induced via the platelet TP receptor (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A).Fig. 2U46619-induced two waves of secretion and aggregation in human platelets. Washed platelets from healthy donors (3 × 108/ml) in modified Tyrode's buffer were preincubated with buffer (Control) or 1 μm SQ29548 (SQ) (A) or buffer (Control), 10 μm 2MeSAMP, 1 unit/ml apyrase, or 0.5 mm A3P5P at 37 °C for 5 min (B). Luciferin/luciferase reagent and then 1 μm U46619 were added to platelets to induce aggregation and secretion, which were recorded in real time using the lumi-aggregometer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the causal links between the two waves of secretion and aggregation, we examined the role of secreted ADP and integrin outside-in signaling in U46619-induced platelet secretion and aggregation using an ADP scavenger, apyrase, antagonists of two different ADP receptors (P2Y1 and P2Y12) and an integrin inhibitor, RGDS. We found that the first wave of secretion was not affected by 2MeSAMP, a selective antagonist of ADP P2Y12 receptor (Gi-coupled) (Figs. 1C and 2B) or by A3P5P, a selective ADP P2Y1 receptor antagonist (Fig. 2B). The first wave of platelet secretion also occurred when platelet aggregation was inhibited by RGDS (Fig. 1E) or in the absence of stirring (not shown), indicating that the first wave of platelet secretion does not require integrin outside-in signaling. On the other hand, the first wave of platelet aggregation induced by U46619 was significantly inhibited by 2MeSAMP or apyrase (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2B), but not by A3P5P (Fig. 2B). However, inhibition of the first wave of platelet aggregation by 2MeSAMP or apyrase appeared to be incomplete as a small change in the light transmission was still visible (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2B) and was more obvious at a higher U46619 concentration (data not shown). Thus, ADP from the first wave secretion, by activating Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor pathway, plays important roles in augmenting TP receptor-mediated first wave platelet aggregation. In addition to its effect on the first wave of platelet aggregation, the first wave of platelet ADP secretion was also required for the U46619-induced second wave of platelet secretion, as the second wave of platelet secretion was completely inhibited by 2MeSAMP (Figs. 1C and 2B). The second wave of secretion was not only inhibited by ADP receptor antagonists, but also abolished by an inhibitor of integrin, RGDS peptide (Fig. 1E). Thus, both the ADP released during the first wave of secretion and the integrin outside-in signaling during the first wave of platelet aggregation are required for the U46619-induced second wave of secretion. It is important to note that the second wave of platelet secretion induced by U46619, unlike that induced by other agonists such as ADP, does not require endogenous TXA2 synthesis as aspirin-treated platelets also showed two waves of secretion and aggregation in response to U46619 (cf. Fig. 6). As expected, the second wave of platelet aggregation was dependent on platelet secretion, because it was inhibited by 2MeSAMP and apyrase (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2B). U46619-induced, PI3K-dependent Akt Phosphorylation—The data presented above indicate that the secreted ADP plays important roles in TXA2-induced platelet secretion and aggregation. As previous studies showed that the ADP-induced platelet activation involved PI3-Kγ, we examined whether and how PI3Kγ is involved in TXA2-induced platelet activation. To do this, we first examined the U46619-induced Akt phosphorylation, which is a known marker of PI3K activity. Phosphorylation of Akt was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Akt antibody recognizing the phosphorylated Ser473 site of Akt. As shown in Fig. 3, Akt was phosphorylated in U46619- or ADP-stimulated wild type mouse platelets. Phosphorylation of Akt induced by ADP was completely inhibited by the ADP scavenger, apyrase (Fig. 3A). U46619-induced Akt phosphorylation, however, was only partially inhibited by apyrase (Fig. 3A), indicating that U46619-induced PI3K activation was augmented by ADP secretion, but was not totally ADP-dependent. The P2Y12 inhibitor, 2MeSAMP, but not P2Y1 inhibitor, A3P5P, also partially inhibited U46619-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Thus, ADP augments PI3K activation and subsequent Akt phosphorylation via P2Y12-coupled pathway. Akt phosphorylation induced by either ADP or U46619 was not inhibited by RGDS (Fig. 3A), indicating that activation of PI3K by ADP or U46619 was independent of integrin outside-in signaling. U46619-induced phosphorylation of Akt was markedly inhibited in PI3Kγ-deficient platelets (Fig. 3C) and completely inhibited by PI3K inhibitors. Thus, U46619-induced Akt phosphorylation indicates PI3K activation, and PI3K is activated during U46619-induced platelet activation. U46619-stimulated Second Wave of Secretion and Aggregation Is Inhibited in PI3Kγ-deficient Platelets—To determine whether PI3Kγ is important in TXA2-induced platelet secretion and aggregation, we examined U46619-induced aggregation and secretion of platelets from PI3Kγ knock-out mice and control wild type mice. As shown in Fig. 4, U46619, at lower concentrations (250–500 nm), induced a typical two-wave platelet secretion in wild type mice, which preceded the onset of two-waves of platelet aggregation (Fig. 4, A and B). The first wave of secretion of PI3Kγ knock-out mouse platelets induced by low concentrations of U46619 was not significantly different from the wild type platelets, but the second wave of platelet secretion was abolished in PI3Kγ knock-out mouse platelets (Fig. 4, A and B). The low dose U46619-induced second wave of platelet aggregation in PI3Kγ-deficient platelets was also reduced (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that PI3Kγ plays an important role in the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation induced by low dose U46619. At higher U46619 concentrations, however, the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation in PI3Kγ knock-out platelets became increasing similar to wild type platelets (Fig. 4C), suggesting that there might be alternative pathways or other PI3K isoforms that were also involved in platelet activation under these conditions. Effects of PI3K Inhibitors on U46619-induced Platelet Secretion and Aggregation in Mice—To determine whether other isoforms of PI3K such as class IA PI3K may also play roles in TXA2-induced platelet aggregation, we examined the effects of PI3K inhibitors, Wortmannin (Fig. 5) and LY294002 (not shown), on U46619-induced aggregation and secretion of mouse platelets. These inhibitors have been shown to inhibit not only PI3Kγ, but also class IA PI3Ks. Wortmannin (and LY294002, data not shown) completely abolished U46619-induced second wave of secretion, but had no significant effect on the first wave of secretion (Fig. 5). At a low U46619 concentration, wild type platelets treated with wortmannin (Fig. 5A) were similar to PI3Kγ knock-out platelets in secretion and aggregation (see Fig. 4), suggesting that, at low U46619 concentrations, PI3Kγ is the major enzyme responsible for the role of PI3K in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation. In contrast to the PI3Kγ knock-out, PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, also blocked the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation induced by high concentrations of U46619 (>1 μm) (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, these inhibitors inhibited high dose U46619-induced second wave of secretion and aggregation in PI3Kγ knock-out platelets (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that at high concentrations of U46619, the isoforms of PI3K other than PI3Kγ can substitute the role of PI3Kγ in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation. Effects of PI3K Inhibitors on U46619-induced Integrin Activation—It is known that platelet aggregation is the consequence of activation of fibrinogen binding function of integrin αIIbβ3. Thus we also examined the effects of PI3K inhibitors on integrin-dependent fibrinogen binding to platelets at 1, 2, and 5 min time points following addition of U46619. As shown in Fig. 5A, at the 1-min time point, the first wave, but not the second wave, of platelet secretion and aggregation occurred. At this time, there is an increase in fibrinogen binding to platelets, which is minimally affected by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5D). At the 2-min time point, just after onset of the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation, fibrinogen binding is only partially inhibited by LY294002. At 5 min after the peak of the second wave of platelet secretion, however, fibrinogen binding to platelets was dramatically increased, which was inhibited by LY294002 to the level equivalent to before the onset of the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation. These results indicate that the PI3K inhibitor only affects the second wave secretion-dependent integrin activation. These data indicate that integrin activation that coincides with the second wave of platelet aggregation is subsequent to the second wave of platelet secretion. These data also indicate that PI3K plays a minimal role in the first wave of integrin activation and aggregation, but plays an important role in the second wave secretion-dependent amplification of integrin activation. The Effects of PI3K Inhibitors in U46619-induced Platelet Activation in Human Platelets—The above results showed that PI3K plays important roles in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation in mouse platelets. To determine the role of PI3K in TXA2-induced human platelet activation, washed human platelets were preincubated with PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and then exposed to U46619 to induce platelet aggregation and secretion. Both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited the U46619-induced second wave of secretion and aggregation (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, human platelets treated with aspirin also showed two waves of platelet secretion and aggregation (Fig. 6C), and the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation was inhibited by PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 6D), indicating that PI3K-dependent second wave platelet secretion and aggregation were independent of endogenous TXA2 synthesis pathway. These results indicate that PI3K plays an important role in U46619-induced second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation in human platelets. PI3Kγ Knock-out and PI3K Inhibitors Inhibit Platelet Aggregation Indirectly by Abolishing the Second Wave of ADP Secretion—As shown above, PI3K plays important roles in the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of PI3K deficiency on the second wave of platelet aggregation resulted from its inhibitory effect on secretion, we examined whether exogenous ADP could induce the second wave of aggregation in PI3Kγ knock-out mouse platelets and wortmannin-treated human platelets. Fig. 7A shows that wild type platelets showed a typical two-wave platelet aggregation, and PI3Kγ knock-out platelets showed a significantly reduced second wave of platelet aggregation. Adding exogenous ADP to PI3Kγ knock-out platelets completely reversed the inhibitory effect of PI3Kγ deficiency and restored full scale platelet aggregation. This effect of exogenous ADP was only slightly affected by the P2Y1 ADP receptor inhibitor, A3P5P, but was totally blocked by a P2Y12 ADP receptor inhibitor, 2MeSAMP, which is similar to U46619-induced wild type platelet aggregation in the absence of exogenous ADP. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, was also reversed by addition of exogenous ADP, and this effect of exogenous ADP was completely inhibited by P2Y12 antagonist, 2MeSAMP (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that diminished second wave of platelet aggregation in PI3Kγ knock-out or wortmannin-treated platelets results from inhibition of the second wave secretion of ADP and ADP-induced P2Y12 signaling pathway. Thus, the second wave of platelet secretion is required for the second wave of platelet aggregation. PI3Ks play important roles in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion and thus are indirectly involved in the second wave of platelet aggregation. In this study, we present the new finding that TXA2-mediated platelet activation involves two waves of platelet secretion which, respectively, precede two waves of platelet aggregation. We have identified the sequential relationship between the two waves of secretion and aggregation. More importantly, we present novel evidence that PI3K plays a critical role in signaling the induction of second wave of platelet secretion. These data allow us to propose a new concept in the TXA2-induced platelet activation mechanism as depicted in Fig. 7C. Previous studies on the TXA2-induced platelet secretion using platelet-rich plasma or radiolabeled serotonin showed evidence of platelet secretion following the first wave of platelet aggregation and that the first wave of platelet aggregation occurred in the absence of detectable secretion (32Charo I.F. Feinman R.D. Detwilter T.C. Smith J.B. Ingerman C.M. Silver M.J. Nature. 1977; 269: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using newly developed ADP receptor antagonists suggested that the ADP receptor- and P2Y12-mediated and Gαi-dependent signaling pathway may also play a role in the first wave of platelet aggregation induced by low dose U46619 (19Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether P2Y12 receptor is activated by ADP secreted prior to the first wave of platelet aggregation, since platelet secretion was believed to follow the first wave of platelet aggregation. By detecting real time platelet secretion using the more sensitive luciferase assay in washed platelets, we show that TXA2 receptor induces two waves of platelet secretion and that the first wave of platelet secretion occurs almost immediately after addition of the agonist and precedes the first wave of platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the first wave platelet aggregation induced by low dose U46619 is significantly inhibited by P2Y12 antagonists and by apyrase. Thus, our data explain a previous discrepancy on the roles of ADP secretion in TXA2-induced platelet activation and suggest that ADP released from the TXA2-induced first wave secretion plays a critical role in augmenting the first wave platelet aggregation induced by TXA2. Furthermore, these data demonstrate a previously unknown kinetics of platelet secretion induced by TXA2 pathway, which allows further dissection of the different mechanisms associated with different waves of platelet secretion. ADP is important not only in augmenting first wave of platelet aggregation, but also in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion. This new role of ADP in TXA2-induced platelet activation is shown by the data that the second wave of U46619-induced platelet secretion is abolished by the P2Y12 antagonist. One may argue that this role of ADP is secondary to the effects of ADP on the first wave of platelet aggregation, because the integrin antagonist, RGDS, also prevented the second wave of platelet secretion. However, we found that ADP plays an important role in augmenting the TXA2-induced activation of PI3Ks, which is independent of first wave of platelet aggregation but is necessary for the induction of the second wave of platelet secretion (Figs. 3 and 4). It should be noted that it has been well established that PI3K can be activated by the Gβγ-coupled signaling pathway (23Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J.

Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of G protein-coupled agonist, TXA2, in combination of secreted ADP (also G protein-coupled) is sufficient to activate PI3Ks, although this does not exclude that integrin outside-in signaling may also be involved in PI3K activation as indicated previously (28Kovacsovics T.J.

Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since we show that the integrin inhibitor RGDS had no effect on PI3K activation induced by U46619, it appears that in U46619-stimulated platelets, PI3K activation is independent of integrin outside-in signaling. Thus our finding suggests a novel mechanism of induction of the second wave of platelet secretion, in which both the G protein-coupled PI3K activation (augmented by ADP) and integrin outside-in signaling are required in parallel to induce the second wave of platelet secretion. As the aggregation-dependent secretion of granule contents occurs in response to not only TXA2 but also many other agonists, our finding may be a general mechanism of aggregation-dependent platelet secretion. In this regard, previous data have shown that aggregation of PI3Kγ knock-out platelets in response to ADP was decreased in a manner consistent with the loss of the secondary wave of platelet aggregation (22Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PI3K has been previously known to be important in platelet activation (21Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M.

Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how PI3K is involved in platelet activation is not clear. We conclude that PI3K is important in mediating the second wave of platelet secretion, which augments integrin activation and thus induces the second wave of platelet aggregation. In support of this conclusion, we have shown that 1) PI3Kγ knock-out or PI3K inhibitors diminished the second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation, but had minimal effects on the first wave of platelet secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation; 2) PI3K inhibitors inhibited the dramatic increase in the second wave secretion-dependent fibrinogen binding to platelets to the level before the onset of the second wave of platelet secretion; and 3) the effects of PI3Kγ knock-out or PI3K inhibitors on the second wave of aggregation was reversed by exogenous ADP. Thus PI3K provides the necessary signal cooperating with the integrin outside-in signals to induce platelet secretion. The effect of PI3K in augmenting integrin activation, and thus platelet aggregation, is the consequence of the role of PI3K in inducing the second wave of platelet secretion of ADP. Platelets express both type IA (PI3Kα and PI3Kβ) and IB (PI3Kγ) classes of PI3K (21Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is known that PI3Kγ can be activated by G protein-coupled receptors by binding to the Gβγ subunits (23Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J.

Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We conclude here that PI3Kγ is the major isoform responsible for the PI3K signaling function particularly at low U46619 concentrations, because PI3Kγ knock-out mice showed a prominent defective second wave of platelet secretion and the consequent second wave of platelet aggregation. This conclusion is consistent with a recent report that PI3K IA knock-out did not affect platelet activation induced by G protein-coupled agonists, but only affected the GPIV/Fc receptor γ pathway (39Watanabe N. Nakajima H. Suzuki H. Oda A. Matsubara Y. Moroi M. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Ikeda Y. Handa M. Blood. 2003; 102: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PI3K activation is significantly augmented by ADP secretion via the P2Y12-coupled Gi pathway, but is not totally ADP-dependent, suggesting that TXA2 induces PI3K activation via ADP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Thus, it is possible that TXA2, by activating the TXA2 receptor-coupled G proteins, and more importantly by activating P2Y12-coupled G protein pathway, induces release of Gβγ subunits, which in turn activate PI3Kγ. PI3Kγ by cooperating with the integrin outside-in signal pathway induces the second wave of platelet secretion. At higher U46619 concentrations, however, the second wave of platelet secretion is not inhibited in PI3Kγ knock-out platelets, but is prevented by PI3K inhibitors that also block PI3K IA. Thus, TXA2-induced activation of PI3K IA isoforms is likely to be important under these conditions or to be able to compensate for PI3Kγ. This is consistent with previous reports that PI3K IA is important in platelet activation induced by other agonists such as thrombin (40Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not clear how PI3K IA can be activated by the TXA2 receptor. Although a classic pathway of activation of those PI3K isoforms is the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, it has been shown that PI3K IA can also be activated by via G protein pathways (26Kurosu H.

https://openalex.org/W1979323699,"Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) is a copper-transporting ATPase essential for normal distribution of copper in human cells. Recent studies demonstrate that copper regulates WNDP through several mechanisms. Six metal-binding sites (MBS) at the N terminus of WNDP are predicted to be involved in copper-dependent regulation of WNDP; however, specific roles of MBS remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated WNDP variants with mutations or truncation in the N-terminal region and characterized their functional properties. We show that copper cooperatively stimulates catalytic activity of WNDP and that this effect requires the presence of both MBS5 and MBS6. Mutations of MBS6 or MBS1–5 result in non-cooperative activation of the enzyme by copper, whereas the deletion of MBS1–4 does not abolish cooperativity. Our data further suggest that MBS5 and MBS6 together regulate the affinity of the intramembrane-binding site(s) for copper. Analysis of the copper-dependent stimulation of catalytic phosphorylation demonstrate that the MBS6 and MBS1–5 mutants have a 7–8-fold lower EC50 for copper activation, suggesting that their affinity for copper is increased. This conclusion is confirmed by a markedly decreased inhibition of these mutants by a copper chelator bathocuproine disulphonate. In contrast, deletion of MBS1–4 does not affect the affinity of sites important for catalytic phosphorylation. Rather, the MBS1–4 region appears to control access of copper to the functionally important metal-binding sites. The implications of these findings for intracellular regulation of WNDP are discussed.

The major functional activity of WNDP is to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis with transport of copper from cytosol across cell membranes (1Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Voskoboinik I. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 123-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During ATP hydrolysis, WNDP becomes transiently phosphorylated at the invariant residue Asp-1027; catalytic phosphorylation from ATP is specifically stimulated by copper (3Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Following copper translocation across the cell membrane, WNDP is dephosphorylated. In vitro, catalytic phosphorylation can also be achieved using inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the presence of Mg2+; this reaction reflects the reversibility of the dephosphorylation step (4Tsivkovskii R. Efremov R.G. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13302-13308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly to other P-type ATPases, WNDP is thought to cycle between two major conformations: E1, in which WNDP binds copper and ATP with high affinity and becomes phosphorylated, and E2, in which the affinity for copper and ATP is low but WNDP can still be phosphorylated using inorganic phosphate. WNDP has multiple copper-binding sites located at two different regions of the protein (Fig. 1A). In the N-terminal portion of WNDP, there are six metal-binding sites (MBS) formed by cysteine residues of the sequence motifs GMXCXXC. Each motif belongs to a repetitive 70 amino acid sequence and binds one copper in the reduced Cu+1 form (5Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Gilliam T.C. Kaplan J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Sarkar B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 448: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In addition to six cytosolic copper-binding sites, there is at least one site in the membrane portion of the protein. The structure of this site is unknown, but it is likely to be formed by a sequence motif CPC and other conserved intramembrane residues. By analogy with other P-type ATPases, it is believed that binding of copper to the intramembrane site is essential for copper-dependent catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP by ATP. In agreement with this assumption, mutations of the CPC motif abolish catalytic activity of copper-transporting ATPases (7Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the role of the CPC-based metal-binding sites seems clear, the function of multiple N-terminal MBS is poorly understood and is a subject of considerable interest. The bacterial and yeast orthologues of WNDP have one or two N-terminal MBS, suggesting that not all six MBS of WNDP are necessary for its function. This prediction was confirmed by experiments using a yeast complementation assay, which demonstrated that only MBS5 or MBS6 of WNDP are necessary for functional activity of WNDP (11Forbes J.R. Hsi G.

Additional N-terminal MBS were proposed to be involved in WNDP regulation, which may include fine-tuning of WNDP activity in response to copper and/or regulation of such posttranslational events as a kinase-mediated phosphorylation and protein trafficking (13Vanderwerf S.M.

To begin dissecting specific roles of the N-terminal MBS, we generated truncated and mutated variants of WNDP (Fig. 1B) and examined the effect of these modifications on catalytic activity of WNDP. Our results indicate that the N-terminal MBS have distinct regulatory functions. MBS5 and MBS6 appear to control affinity of the intramembrane site(s) for copper and are responsible for the cooperative effect of copper on WNDP activity. The MBS1–4 region is not involved in regulation of affinity of the intramembrane site(s). However, this region appears to affect the access of copper to other MBS. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus and Protein Expression in Insect Cells—The generation of the plasmid encoding the full-length 4.4-kb WNDP cDNA (pFastBacDual-wild-type (WT) WNDP) and the catalytically inactive D1027A mutant of WNDP has been described previously (3Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The WNDP variants with various changes in the N-terminal MBS (Fig. 1) were generated using PCR and the pFastBac-Dual-WND plasmid as a template. To delete MBS1–4, the fragments adjacent to the deleted N-terminal region (nucleotide 169–1458 of the coding region) were amplified by PCR using primers with a partly overlapping sequence (bold face). Fragment I was generated using forward primer 5′-CGCGGAATTCGGTGTCCGTGCGGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGAGAAGAAGGGCCCAGGCC-3′. Fragment II was obtained with forward primer 5′-GGCCCTTCTTCTCAGCCGCAGAAGTGCTTCTTACAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACCAAAATCGATAAAACCGATTACAATCC-3′. The generated fragments were then joined by overlap PCR using forward primer for fragment I and reverse primer for fragment II. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen), excised using EcoR1 and ClaI restriction nucleases, and swapped with the EcoRI-ClaI fragment from original pFastBac-Dual-WNDP plasmid. To inactivate various MBS, both cysteines within the metal-binding motifs GMT/HCXXC (1–5 and 6, respectively) were substituted for alanine. The WNDP variant with mutated MBS6 (mMBS6) was generated using flanking primers (forward) 5′-ATTGAAGGCAAGGTCCG GAA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-ACCAAAATCGATAAAACCGATTACAATCC-3′ along with mutagenesis primers for MBS6 (forward) 5′-GGATGACCGCCGCGTCCGCTGTCCACAACATAGAGTC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGACAGCGGACGCGGCGGTCATCCCTGTGATTGTCAG-3′. The generated PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector, and following cleavage with AflII and ClaI restriction endonucleases, the fragment was inserted into the AflII-ClaI-digested pFastBac-Dual-WNDP plasmid. To generate the mMBS1–5 mutant, a multistep overlap PCR was performed using flanking primer (forward) 5′-CTGGGCCCTT CTTCTCAGGT-3′ and (reverse) 5′-ACCAAAATCGATAAAACCGATTACAATCC-3′ with the following mutagenesis primers: (MBS1) 5′-GCATGACTGCCCAGTCAGCTGTGAAGTCCATTGAGG-3′, and 5′-GGACTTCACAGCTGACTGGGCAGTCATGCCCAAGATCC-3′; (MBS2) 5′-GCATGACCGCCCAGTCCGCTGTCAGCTCCATTGAAGG-3′, and 5′-CTGACAGCGGACTGGGCGGTCATGCCCTCCACCC-3′; (MBS3) 5′-GGAATGCATGCTAAGTCTGCCGTCTTGAATATTG-3′, and 5′-CAAGACGGCAGACTTAGCATGCATTCCATCTATTC-3′; (MBS4), 5′-GGCATGACCGCTGCATCCGCTGTCCATTCCATTGAAGGC-3′, and 5′-GAATGGACAGCGGATGCAGCGGTCATGCCGGCAATGG-3′; (MBS5) 5′-GGCATGACCGCTGCATCCGCTGTGTCTAACATAGAAAGG-3′ and 5′-GACACAGCGGATGCAGCGGTCATGCCTTTGATCTG-3′. The fragment was cloned into pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector, digested with the ApaI and ClaI restriction endonucleases, and then exchanged with the ApaI-ClaI fragment of original pFastBacDual-WNDP plasmid. The presence of anticipated mutations as well as the absence of fortuitous mutations was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The generated constructs were utilized to transform the DH10Bac strain of Escherichia coli and produce bacmids using the commercially available Bac-to-Bac™ kit (Invitrogen) and previously described protocols (3Tsivkovskii R.

Bacmids were then transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) to produce baculovirus expressing corresponding WNDP variants. Baculovirus was amplified as described in the Bac-to-Bac™ manual and in Ref. 18Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

WNDP Expression in Insect Cells and Preparation of Membrane Fractions—Maintenance, infection, harvesting of Sf9 insect cells, and isolation of membrane fractions were carried out as described previously (3Tsivkovskii R.

Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of WT and mutant WNDP was analyzed by separation of 50 μg of total membrane protein on a 7.5% Laemmli gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie staining and Western blotting with polyclonal antibody a-ABD (1:20,000) as described previously (21Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of WNDP Using [γ-32P]ATP—50 μg of total membrane protein was resuspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer: 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 6.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 25 mCi/μmol) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 4 min or for various time periods when the kinetics of phosphorylation were measured. All additional treatments were performed as described in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of ice-cold 1 mm NaH2PO4 in 50% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The protein pellet was washed once with ice-cold water and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 5% SDS) and loaded on the acidic 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (22Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min and dried on a blotting paper. The dried gels were exposed either overnight to the Molecular Imaging Screen CS (Bio-Rad) or for several hours at –80 °C to the Kodak BioMax MS film, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager GS-525 or Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer GS-700, respectively. Then, the dried gels were rehydrated and stained with Coomassie Blue R250, and the amount of protein in the WNDP-related bands was determined by densitometry. The 32P incorporation into WNDP was then normalized to the WNDP protein levels. The number of experiments is given in the figure legends. The data were analyzed by a non-linear regression using SigmaPlot software. WNDP Phosphorylation from 32P i Inorganic Phosphate—50 μg of membrane protein preparation was resuspended in 200 μl of the following buffer: 50 mm MES-Tris (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% Me2SO (PI buffer) containing 100 μm ascorbate and 100 μm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Sigma). To initiate phosphorylation, 32Pi (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol) was added to the mixture and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 1 mm NaH2PO4. Separation of precipitated protein and analysis of 32P-incorporation into WNDP was carried out as described above. Treatment with Bathocuproine Disulfonate (BCS)—Membrane preparations from Sf9 cells expressing WT or mutant WNDPs were resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer, containing 100 μm TCEP, to a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and then incubated on ice with the increasing concentrations of copper chelator BCS (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) for 30 min. Analysis of phosphorylation from ATP was carried out as described above. The Effect of Copper on Phosphorylation—The membrane-bound WT or mutant WNDPs were resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer to a 0.25 mg/ml protein concentration and incubated with 250 μm BCS on ice for 30 min. The chelator was then removed by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed with the phosphorylation buffer. The membrane pellets were resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer containing 100 μm ascorbate, 100 μm TCEP, and increasing concentrations of CuCl2. Following 10 min of incubation on ice, radioactive ATP was added, and the phosphorylation reaction and analysis of 32P incorporation were carried out as described above. To determine the effect of BCS and copper on phosphorylation from inorganic 32P, the protein samples were resuspended in the Pi buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 250 μm BCS alone or with 250 μm BCS and 135 μm copper (to produce 10 μm excess copper over the chelator). The phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 32Pi and was carried out in the presence of BCS. Generation, Expression, and Catalytic Activity of the WNDP Variants—To elucidate the role of the N-terminal MBS, three constructs were generated and characterized in detail (Fig. 1B). The mMBS1–5 construct encodes protein in which Cys residues in the first 5 CXXC motifs are substituted with Ala yielding WNDP with only the sixth N-terminal MBS available for copper binding. In contrast, in mMBS6, the sixth metal-binding site is inactivated by a Cys → Ala substitution, whereas the other sites remain intact. The ΔMBS1–4 variant lacks a part of the N-terminal region (430 residues), including MBS1–4, but has functional MBS5 and MBS6. The corresponding proteins were expressed using the baculovirus-mediated infection of Sf9 cells and analyzed in the membrane-bound form. As shown in Fig. 2A, both truncated and mutated WNDPs were expressed at levels similar to WT WNDP. The functional activity of generated proteins was verified by measuring their ability to form a phosphorylated intermediate following incubation with [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation levels of ΔMBS1–4 and mMBS1–5 were undistinguishable from that of WT WNDP (Fig. 2B), whereas mMBS6 had slightly lower level of phosphorylation (69.6 ± 9.1% of WT WNDP). Functional Consequences of the Cys → Ala Substitutions in the First Five MBS—Studies on WNDP homologue (Menkes disease protein, MNKP) led to the suggestion that the N-terminal MBS of human copper-transporting ATPases were required for the ATPase function when concentration of copper was very low (23Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that in low copper, the mMBS1–5 mutant is likely to be less active than WT WNDP because the sites necessary for efficient copper binding are missing in this mutant. To test this prediction, we compared catalytic phosphorylation of WT WNDP and mMBS1–5 at different copper concentrations. For these experiments, WT WNDP and mMBS1–5 were first inhibited by addition of the specific copper chelator BCS as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then increasing concentrations of copper were added to reactivate the enzymes. As shown in Fig. 3A, the effect of copper on activity of WT WNDP and mMBS1–5 is indeed strikingly different. However, contrary to the prediction, copper activated the mMBS1–5 mutant with an EC50 that was ∼7.6-fold lower (0.60 ± 0.16 μm) than the EC50 for the WT WNDP (4.6 ± 0.3 μm). In the P-type ATPases, phosphorylation by ATP depends on binding of the exported ions to the intramembrane site(s). Therefore, in WNDP, the change in copper dependence of catalytic phosphorylation caused by mutations is likely to reflect changes in the intramembrane copper-binding site(s). The decrease in the EC50 for copper, observed for the mMBS1–5 mutant, suggests that the affinity of the intramembrane site(s) for copper is increased as a result of the Cys → Ala substitutions in the N-terminal domain. Alternatively, the changes caused by the removal of the five functional MBS could have facilitated access of copper to the intramembrane sites without changing their affinity. To determine which of these explanations is correct, we compared the effect of the copper chelator BCS on the catalytic activity of WNDP and mMBS1–5. BCS inhibits WNDP, presumably by competing with WNDP for the metal; the inhibitory effect of BCS can be reversed by subsequent addition of copper to the protein (3Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If mMBS1–5 has a higher affinity for copper than WNDP, then higher concentrations of BCS would be necessary to inactivate the mutant. If the affinity of mMBS1–5 for copper is unaltered, but sites became more exposed, the effect of BCS on MBS1–5 would be similar to its effect on WT WNDP or stronger. The measurements of catalytic phosphorylation in the presence of increasing concentrations of BCS demonstrate that BCS is a significantly less effective inhibitor of mMBS1–5 as compared with the WT WNDP (Fig. 3B). To obtain 50% inhibition of mMBS1–5, ∼250 μm BCS was necessary as compared with 10 μm BCS required for similar inhibition of WT WNDP. This result is consistent with the increased affinity of the catalytically important copper-binding sites in the mMBS1–5 mutant. Experiments shown in Fig. 3 revealed another interesting difference between the mMBS1–5 mutant and WT WNDP. The copper-dependent activation curve for WT WNDP is clearly cooperative, whereas for the mutant, it is not (Fig. 3A). The loss of cooperativity for mMBS1–5 indicates that one or several MBS located in the MBS1–5 region contributed to this process. To better understand the role of different MBS in cooperative activation of catalytic phosphorylation, we generated and characterized the ΔMBS1–4 mutant. We reasoned that MBS5 is the part of the “core structure,” which is common for most copper-transporting ATPases and which is likely to be sufficient for their catalytic function. The metal-binding sites MBS1–4 are the “extra” sites in the mammalian ATPases, and their deletion should not have an effect on functional activity but may affect cooperativity. The Functional Properties of the ΔMBS1–4 WNDP—The experiments on copper-dependent stimulation of catalytic phosphorylation demonstrate that the deletion of the first four metal-binding sites does not have a significant effect on the final level of catalytic activity (Fig. 4A). The effect of copper remains cooperative, and the slope of the curve becomes steeper. These results suggested that MBS1–4 did not play a key role in stimulation of WNDP activity and could even hinder effective interactions between remaining copper-binding sites, making the activation curve more shallow. At the same time, the EC50 value for copper-dependent activation of the ΔMBS1–4 mutant is 3-fold lower than that of WT WNDP (1.5 ± 0.1 μm versus 4.6 ± 0.3 μm). This observation was somewhat puzzling. If MBS1–4 are not important for stimulation of catalytic activity, one would expect to see no effect on affinity of the intramembrane site(s) from the deletion. However, the deletion may affect EC50 if MBS1–4 regulate the access of copper to other sites. To clarify this issue, the experiments on BCS inactivation were carried out. These experiments demonstrate that the concentration of BCS necessary to obtain 50% inhibition of phosphorylation is essentially identical for WT WNDP and the ΔMBS1–4 mutant (both ∼10 μm, Fig. 4B), indicating that the affinity of sites important for catalytic phosphorylation is indeed unaffected by the deletion. Thus, in the case of ΔMBS1–4, the decrease in the EC50 value for copper activation is likely due to better access of copper to the remaining metal-binding sites and not due to change in the affinity of the intramembrane sites. If this hypothesis is correct, one may see the effect of the deletion on the kinetic of catalytic phosphorylation. To test this prediction, we compared the time dependence of the acyl-phosphate formation for WT WNDP and ΔMBS1–4. As shown in Fig. 5, the τ½ value for the ΔMBS1–4 mutant is lower than the τ½ value for WT WNDP (9.6 ± 3.1 s versus 24.2 ± 5.2 s). Assuming that copper delivery to the intramembrane sites is the rate-limiting step of the reaction, the decrease in the τ½ for catalytic phosphorylation is consistent with the proposed removal of sterical hindrances. The results shown in previous figures suggest that MBS5 and MBS6 work together to stimulate catalytic activity of WNDP, whereas MBS1–4 do not play a significant role in this process. If this hypothesis is correct, then the mutation of MBS6 alone should have consequences similar to the MBS1–5 mutation. Specifically, the inactivation of MBS6 should abolish the cooperative effect of copper and increase the apparent affinity of the intramembrane site(s), even if all other MBS remain intact. To test this prediction, we characterized the functional properties of mMBS6. The Functional Consequences of MBS6 Inactivation—As shown in Fig. 2, the MBS6 mutant had somewhat decreased catalytic phosphorylation (∼70% of the WT level). This lower level of phosphorylation from ATP could be due to conformational shift toward the E2-like form, which is less favorable for ATP-dependent phosphorylation, or due to diminished ability of the mutant to undergo conformational transitions in response to copper binding. Such consequences of the mutation would complicate interpretation of the experiments on copper-dependent activation of the enzyme. Consequently, we examined the functional properties of mMBS6 in more detail. The ability of this mutant to undergo E1 → E2 conformational transitions was evaluated by comparing phosphorylation of WT WNDP and mMBS6 in the presence of Pi and Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 6, the levels of the Pi-mediated phosphorylation of WNDP and the mutant are similar. Moreover, incubation of mMBS6 and WT WNDP with BCS results in a comparable increase in the Pi phosphorylation. Subsequent addition of copper prevents phosphorylation from Pi for both WT WNDP and the mutant. Thus, the MBS6 mutation does not seem to alter the ability of WNDP to undergo E1 → E2 transition. Additional experiments on limited proteolysis revealed that the tryptic patterns of the digested mMBS6 and WT WNDP were essentially identical, arguing against major effects of the mutation on protein folding (data not shown). The effect of the MBS6 mutation on copper binding affinity and cooperativity was examined by measuring the copper dependence of catalytic phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7A, activation of mMBS6 by copper is non-cooperative despite the presence of five other functional N-terminal MBS. Furthermore, the EC50 value for mMBS6 (0.60 ± 0.17 μm) suggests that mMBS6 has an increased apparent affinity for copper, which is essentially identical to the apparent affinity of mMBS1–5 (0.60 ± 0.16 μm). For comparison, the EC50 value for WT WNDP is 4.6 ± 0.3 μm (Fig. 3). In addition to important similarities between mMBS1–5 and mMBS6, there are some differences in their functional properties. The maximum phosphorylation of mMBS6 after activation with copper is ∼2-fold lower than that of mMBS1–5 and remained at this level even at 20 μm copper. Further experiments on inactivation of mMBS6 by BCS confirmed the effect of the mutation on apparent affinity of the intramembrane sites for copper (Fig. 7B). The concentration of BCS required for 50% inhibition of mMBS6 is markedly increased as compared with WT WNDP (∼250 μm versus 10 μm), indicating that in mMBS6, copper essential for catalytic phosphorylation is poorly exchangeable. Since the discovery of the human copper-transporting ATPases, the role of their multiple metal-binding sites has been a subject of considerable interest. The work from several laboratories yielded information about copper binding properties of MBS (5Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Gilliam T.C. Kaplan J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and their relative importance for overall function of MNKP and WNDP (11Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, specific functions of the N-terminal MBS are yet to be understood. In this report, we provide experimental evidence that MBS5 and MBS6 play an important role in regulation of enzymatic properties of WNDP. Our data suggest that MBS5 and MBS6 work together to control affinity of the catalytically essential intramembrane sites for copper, whereas the more N-terminal MBS are not involved in this process. These results support conclusions of earlier yeast complementation experiments, which suggested the importance of MBS5 and MBS6 for WNDP function (11Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The biochemical assays recently developed by our group enabled us to further dissect the functional role of these MBS. We demonstrate that mutations of either MBS1–5 or MBS6 result in a 7–8-fold increase in sensitivity of WNDP for copper. Since catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP depends on binding of the transported ions within the transmembrane domain, the changes in MBS1–5 or MBS6 must be transmitted to the intramembrane domain either through direct contact of these sites with the membrane portion or indirectly through interactions with other WNDP domains. To better understand these events, it is useful to review the changes that occur in the individual MBS in response to copper binding and in response to Cys → Ala mutation. The solution structures of individual MBS from human and yeast copper-transporting ATPases in their apo- and metal-bound states have been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (26Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8415-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These structures yielded a very important conclusion, namely that upon copper binding the overall structure of individual MBS remains essentially unaltered. The only significant change occurs in the metal-binding loop where a Cys, exposed previously at the surface, binds copper and rotates toward the protein core (Fig. 8). Although this change is small, it has significant consequences at the level of the full-length WNDP, suggesting that the copper-induced rotation of cysteine alters interactions of the loop with other part(s) of the protein. It seems likely that mutations of Cys residue for Ala may have similar consequences since they eliminate the exposed SH groups (Fig. 8). The mutations in the CXXC motifs of MBS6 and MBS1–5 increase an apparent affinity for copper, suggesting the possible role of free SH groups in maintaining a low affinity state of WNDP for the metal. The deletion of the first four MBS does not seem to have an effect on sites important for catalytic phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Consequently, we propose that non-mutated MBS5 and MBS6 in their apo form stabilize WNDP in a state with low affinity for copper. This effect could be mediated through hydrogen bond interactions of cysteines in the CXXC motif with other domains of WNDP. Elimination of free SH groups by copper binding to MBS or by mutagenesis alters the intradomain interactions, resulting in increased affinity of the WNDP intramembrane sites for copper and subsequent stimulation of catalytic activity. Further experiments with substitution of individual Cys in various MBS will test this model. It is particularly interesting that similar consequences of the mutations in the N-terminal MBS on copper binding affinity were recently reported for the bacterial copper-transporting ATPase CopA from E. coli (28Fan B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46987-46992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CopA has only two MBS; the Cys → Ala mutations in both MBS result in a 3-fold increase in the apparent affinity of CopA for copper. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in the copper-transporting ATPases, the two MBS closest to the membrane have an important functional role regulating the affinity of the intramembrane sites. It could be that this regulatory role is common for all P-type ATPases involved in transport of transition metals (P1-type or CPx-ATPases). This conclusion is supported by recent studies using the cadmium-transporting ATPase CadA, which demonstrated that the deletion of the N-terminal MBS increased affinity of the intramembrane sites for cadmium (29Bal N. Wu C.C. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our model also suggests that specific consequences of the Cys → Ser substitutions, which preserve the ability to form hydrogen bonds, could be quite different from the effect of the Cys → Ala mutations. Recent work on functional analysis of MBS in MNKP, which is homologous to WNDP, illustrates this point. The Cys → Ser substitutions in all six N-terminal MBS of MNKP result in a mutant, which is stabilized in the low affinity state (18Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This mutant is more sensitive to inhibition by copper chelator BCS than WT MNKP, in contrast to our mMBS6 and mMBS1–5 mutants, which are significantly more resistant to the chelator when compared with the WT WNDP (Figs. 3B and 7B). This difference could be due to the presence of at least one functional MBS in our mMBS1–5 mutant. However, a more likely explanation for the difference between our results and the data on MNKP is that the Cys → Ser mutant of MNKP is stabilized in the apo form, i.e. in the low affinity state for copper, whereas our Cys → Ala mutants mimic the high affinity copper-bound state. Cooperative Effect of Copper—The cooperative activation of WT WNDP by copper indicates that transition of WNDP from a low affinity state to a high affinity state involves binding of copper to more than one site. Our data suggest that both MBS5 and MBS6 are required for this process, whereas MBS1–4 are not important. The essentially identical change in apparent affinity for copper induced by the mMBS1–5 and mMBS6 mutations implies that MBS5 and MBS6 occupy very similar positions within WNDP and that binding of copper to one of these MBS allows metal binding to the other. The yeast complementation studies demonstrating that either MBS5 or MBS6, but not other N-terminal MBS, could support transport function of WNDP (11Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) are consistent with the idea that metal-binding loops of MBS5 and MBS6 are spatially very close. Despite important similarities between mMBS1–5 and mMBS6, the properties of these mutants are not identical. The mMBS1–5 mutant has a WT catalytic activity in a wide range of copper concentrations, whereas mMBS6 phosphorylation does not reach the WT level even at copper concentration as high as 20 μm (Fig. 7A). Considering that the Cys → Ala mutation affects residues in a flexible loop, one has to conclude that the precise structure of this loop and/or interactions of this loop with the rest of the protein are important for the optimal catalytic activity of WNDP. The involvement of MBS5 and MBS6 in cooperative stimulation of catalytic activity further clarifies the role of these two MBS in WNDP function. Cooperative binding permits a much more sensitive response to copper concentration. This property would enable WNDP to capture copper, which is scarcely available in the cytosol, and would provide efficient transport even when intracellular copper is low. The Functional Role of the N-terminal MBS1–4 —Our results demonstrate that independently of whether MBS1–4 are present in their normal form (in WT WNDP), mutated to Ala (in mMBS1–5), or deleted (in ΔMBS1–4), the level of catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP remains the same. Furthermore, the deletion of the first four MBS does not eliminate the sigmoidal character of the copper-dependent activation of WNDP. Therefore, we conclude that MBS1–4 are not important for copper-dependent stimulation of catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP and do not modulate the copper binding affinity of the intramembrane site(s). At the same time, the deletion of MBS1–4 has several interesting consequences. It shifts the sensitivity of WNDP for copper, makes the copper-dependent curve steeper, and increases the rate of phosphorylation from ATP. These results suggest that the presence of MBS1–4 may affect access of copper to the functionally important metal-binding site(s) and/or may regulate the WNDP turnover. As we have shown recently, the N-terminal domain of WNDP interacts with the ATP-binding domain in a copper-dependent manner, and this interaction alters the conformation of the ATP-binding domain (21Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This result let us to hypothesize that the copper-dependent domain-domain dissociation may stimulate catalytic activity of WNDP. Although more experimental evidence is needed, our current results are consistent with the role of the N-terminal MBS in regulating the enzyme turnover. In a cell, the potential effect of the first four MBS on WNDP function is likely to be coupled to other regulatory events. Elevated copper induces phosphorylation of WNDP by a kinase (13Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2017361929,"The affinity of maltose-binding protein (MBP) for maltose and related carbohydrates was greatly increased by removal of groups in the interface opposite the ligand binding cleft. The wild-type protein has a KD of 1200 nm for maltose; mutation of residues Met-321 and Gln-325, both to alanine, resulted in a KD for maltose of 70 nm; deletion of 4 residues, Glu-172, Asn-173, Lys-175, and Tyr-176, which are part of a poorly ordered loop, results in a KD for maltose of 110 nm. Combining the mutations yields an increased affinity for maltodextrins and a KD of 6 nm for maltotriose. Comparison of ligand binding by the mutants, using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, indicates that decreases in the off-rate are responsible for the increased affinity. Small-angle x-ray scattering was used to demonstrate that the mutations do not significantly affect the solution conformation of MBP in either the presence or absence of maltose. The crystal structures of selected mutants showed that the mutations do not cause significant structural changes in either the closed or open conformation of MBP. These studies show that interactions in the interface opposite the ligand binding cleft, which we term the “balancing interface,” are responsible for modulating the affinity of MBP for its ligand. Our results are consistent with a model in which the ligand-bound protein alternates between the closed and open conformations, and removal of interactions in the balancing interface decreases the stability of the open conformation, without affecting the closed conformation.

ATP binding cassette transporters couple ATP hydrolysis to the transmembrane transport of a diverse range of compounds. Members of the ATP binding cassette transporter superfamily are characterized by two membrane-integral domains that each contain 6 or more membrane spanning helices, but are otherwise poorly conserved, and two peripheral ATP binding cassette domains that display sequence conservation across the entire superfamily (1Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane complex, ATP binding cassette systems that catalyze nutrient uptake have primary receptors (binding proteins) that serve two functions: they provide a high affinity binding site for the transported molecule and they regulate the ATPase activity of the integral membrane complex. We are interested in the function of the primary receptors in the transport process. As a group, these proteins have been intensively studied by x-ray crystallography and other biophysical techniques (for a review, see Ref. 2Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). They typically contain two domains separated by a hinge region; the substrate binds in the cleft between the two domains, and the protein undergoes a large conformational change, leading to closure of the cleft. With respect to the maltose transport system, domain closure in the binding protein is thought to be the first step toward molecular shape recognition by the membrane complex (3Davidson A.L.

To investigate the role of binding protein affinity on the transport process, our goal was to engineer MBP molecules with greater affinity for maltose, without changing residues in either the maltose binding site or in regions thought to interact with MalFGK2. Crystal structures of MBP in both the closed and open conformations have been solved (9Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and they show that binding of maltose results in a large conformational change of the protein, bringing the two domains together such that the substrate is buried inside the cleft. In solution, unliganded MBP is in the open conformation (11Shilton B.H. Flocco M.M. Nilsson M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); however, there is no obvious energetic barrier to closure of the ligand binding cleft, either in the hinge or in the interface surrounding the ligand binding site. Rather, an interface on the opposite side of the hinge from the ligand binding site appears to maintain the protein in an open conformation (Fig. 1): in the closed conformation, this interface is broken and becomes solvent exposed. Changes to this interface should affect the open-closed equilibrium, and consequently the maltose affinity of the protein. This idea is supported by a study by Marvin and Hellinga (12Marvin J.S. Hellinga H.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), in which they demonstrated that introduction of large, branched groups into the interface (either as natural amino acids or by site-specific chemical modification) increased the affinity of the protein for maltose. We have found that by simply removing certain interactions in this interface, we could increase the affinity for maltose by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. On this basis, the interface is postulated to play an active role in maintaining the open conformation of MBP, and we have therefore called this region the “balancing interface” (Fig. 1). In an effort to understand how removal of interactions in the balancing interface effects such a pronounced change in ligand affinity, we have characterized the binding properties, solution conformations, and crystal structures of MBP molecules harboring mutations in the balancing interface. The results from these studies are consistent with the idea that the mutations have increased ligand affinity by destabilizing the open conformation. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant MBP molecules MBP-Ala (M321A/Q325A) and MBP-Del (Δ172–173 and Δ175–176) were produced using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. This was carried out by two rounds of PCR, following standard methods (13Cormack B. Chanda V.B. Series ed A usubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The first round of PCR consisted of two reactions, each including either a 5′ or 3′ mutagenic primer and a corresponding non-mutagenic flanking primer. The PCR products obtained from this first round were pooled together and used as template for the second round to obtain the full-length mutagenized product. PCR products were then subcloned back into the parent plasmid pLH1 (4Hor L. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to yield the mutant plasmids as follows: pLH1-Ala was made by insertion of a BglII/NdeI fragment from the PCR product into pLH1, whereas pLH1-Del was made by insertion of a BglII/NcoI fragment from the PCR product into pLH1. To make plasmid pLH1-DM, which harbors the combined mutations, a BglII/Eco47III fragment from pLH1-Del was subcloned into pLH1-Ala. All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of MBP—All chromatographic media were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmids containing wild-type or mutant MalE coding regions were transformed into Escherichia coli strain HS3309, which does not produce MBP (14Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 16–18 h. Periplasmic proteins were extracted by osmotic shock (15Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, prior to ion exchange chromatography. The extract was applied onto a 2.6 × 15-cm column packed with Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing MBP were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and further purified on DEAE-Sephacel resin, 2.6 × 30 cm, using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. The DEAE-Sephacel step was not effective for purification of MBP-DM. In this case, fractions from the Q-Sepharose column were applied to a 1.6 × 15-cm column of amylose affinity resin (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mm maltose. Preparation of Maltose-free Protein—To prepare maltose-free binding protein, the MBP was concentrated by ion-exchange chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and then denatured by adding guanidine HCl to a concentration of 6 m. The concentrated and denatured protein was loaded onto a 2.6 × 60-cm column of Superdex 200 Prep Grade gel filtration resin, which had been previously equilibrated with 6 m guanidine HCl. This column was developed with 6 m guanidine HCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; fractions containing denatured protein were pooled and dialyzed exhaustively against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. To remove aggregates, the refolded MBP was again concentrated and applied to a 2.6 × 60-cm column of Superdex 200 Prep Grade gel filtration resin, previously equilibrated with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA. Fluorescence Titrations—Fluorescence titrations were carried out at protein concentrations of 10–100 nm, in 3 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaN3, pH 7.5, using a Flourolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (ISA Instruments). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 349 nm, respectively, with 0.25 nm excitation and 15 nm emission slit widths. The value for relative minimum fluorescence (F min) was obtained using Equation 1 (16Lakiwicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). F0-FF0=Fmin[ligand][ligand+c(Eq. 1) Where F 0 is the starting fluorescence, F is the fluorescence after addition(s) of ligand (maltose or maltotriose, both from Sigma), and c is a constant. The KD was then calculated using the following equation (17Miller D.M. Olson J.S. Pflugrath J.W. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13665-13672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the KD as the single variable. F0-FF0-Fmin=KD+[ligand]+[MBP]-KD+[ligand]+[MBP])2-4[ligand][MBP]2[MBP](Eq. 2) The “solver” function in Microsoft Excel was used to fit the data to the equations and obtain values for the relevant parameters. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of Maltodextrin Binding—Surface plasmon resonance analyses were performed using a BIAcore X instrument. A CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) was derivatized with either amylose or pullulan as follows. Amylose (Sigma) was dissolved in 1 m NaOH to yield a concentration of 50 mg/ml, and then diluted with 0.1 m NaOH, and the pH adjusted to 5.5 with acetic acid to yield a final amylose concentration of 1 mg/ml. 1 ml of the 1 mg/ml amylose solution was treated with NaIO4 at a concentration of 0.2 mm. The solution was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C to effect periodate cleavage of the amylose, and then 400 μl of the amylose solution was desalted on a 2-ml column of Sephadex G-25, equilibrated, and developed with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Prior to derivatization, the CM5 chip was equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.4. The periodate-oxidized amylose was coupled to the surface in flow cell 2 by sequential injection of the following solutions at a flow rate of 5 μl/min: 28 μl of a solution of 200 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 50 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 35 μl of 5 mm hydrazine, 2× 100-μl injections of the oxidized amylose solution, 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Finally, the chip was stabilized with 40 μl of 0.1 m NaCNBH3 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. A total of 1300 response units (RU) of amylose was immobilized to flow cell 2, whereas flow cell 1 was left unmodified for use as a reference cell. Derivatization of a CM5 chip with pullulan followed essentially the same procedure, except that the pullulan, which is highly soluble, could be dissolved directly in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Samples of wild-type and engineered MBP molecules were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaN3, pH 7.4, and serially diluted to yield concentrations ranging from 4 nm to 4 μm. To minimize changes in bulk refractive index, the running buffer for the SPR experiments was exactly the same as the dialysis buffer, with the exception that for some experiments the SPR running buffer contained 100 μm maltose to abrogate rebinding effects. For experiments with the amylose-coupled chip, the flow rate was 50 μl/min, and the injection volumes were 100 μl; for the pullulan-coupled chip, the flow rate was 25 μl/min and the injection volume was 40 μl. For both the amylose and pullulan chips, the response from flow cell 1 (the flow cell with a non-derivatized surface) was subtracted from the response from flow cell 2. Small Angle x-ray Scattering—To remove aggregates prior to SAXS analysis, concentrated protein samples were purified using a 2.6 × 65-cm Superdex 200 Prep Grade gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and developed with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. Samples for SAXS were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaN3, pH 8.0. The dialysis buffers were reserved for background measurements. Measurements of MBP-WT, MBP-Ala, and MBP-Del were made at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany), beamline X33 (18Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instr. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Measurements of MBP-WT and MBP-DM proteins were made at BioCAT (beamline 18ID) of the Advanced Photon Source. Details of SAXS measurements and data processing have been described previously (19Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Dempsey B.R. Economou A. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Crystal Structure Determination—MBP was crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method; equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions were mixed to yield drop sizes of 2 to 4 μl. For maltose-bound MBP-DM, the reservoir solution was comprised of 18–24% PEG 5K monomethyl ether (Hampton Research), 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.2, 200 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm zinc acetate, 5 mm NaN3, and 1 mm maltose. For unliganded and liganded MBP-Del, the reservoir contained 10 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 18 mm zinc acetate, and either 20% PEG 8K (Fluka) or 24% PEG 4K, and 1 mm maltose. All data were collected using a rotating anode source (Rigaku RUH3R) with graded-multilayer optics (Osmic; λ = 1.5418 Å), and a MAR345 image plate detector (MAR Research). Data for the maltose-bound conformations of MBP-Del and MBP-DM were collected at 100 K; the crystals were soaked briefly in 30% PEG 400, 200 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 m cacodylate, 1 mm maltose, pH 6.2, and then frozen in a stream of N2 gas at 100 K. Data processing and reduction were carried out with DENZO and Scalepack (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement solutions were found using the open and closed conformations of wild-type MBP (9Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol.

The crystallographic model was manipulated using the program O (24Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C.E. Ealick S.E. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Crossref Google Scholar), and refinement and map calculations were carried out with CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Rationale for Mutations—As discussed in the Introduction, we believe that interactions between the two domains of MBP, on the side of the hinge opposite the ligand binding cleft, provide an energetic barrier to closure of the ligand binding cleft, and thereby stabilize the open conformation (Fig. 1A). This region of domain contacts will be termed the balancing interface because the present work, and that of another group (12Marvin J.S. Hellinga H.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), demonstrates that it plays a role in modulating the maltose binding affinity. It has been demonstrated that introduction of larger groups into the balancing interface, by either mutagenesis or chemical modification, results in an increase in maltose affinity (12Marvin J.S. Hellinga H.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of bulky groups in the balancing interface may affect the overall structure of the open conformation of the protein, and therefore our strategy to increase the affinity of MBP for maltose was to remove important contacts in the balancing interface (Fig. 1B). The assumption here was that the interface has an active role in stabilizing the open conformation. We located two potentially important interactions in the balancing interface; in both cases, these interactions only take place when the protein is in the open conformation. The first interaction occurs between the side chains of Met-321 on the C-terminal domain, and Tyr-90, Phe-92, Glu-308, and Ala-301 on the N-terminal domain: in the ligand-free conformation, the Met-321 SD and CE atoms are projected into a pocket formed by the hydrophobic parts of the other four side chains, resembling a ball-and-socket joint. In addition, the side chain of Gln-325 sits over the side chain of Met-321, protecting the assembly from solvent. In the ligand-bound conformation, this interaction is disrupted: the Met-321 side chain, the “ball,” moves almost 4 Å of the “socket” formed by Tyr-90, Phe-92, Glu-308, and Ala-301, and the hydrophobic surfaces that were buried become solvent exposed. Further evidence for important structural changes in this region comes from an analysis of the temperature factors, which provide an indication of atomic mobility. Temperature factors for the side chain atoms of Met-321 and Gln-325 are greater in the ligand-bound conformation (Table I), indicating an increase in mobility for these atoms when the protein binds maltose. These observations suggested that Met-321 and Gln-325 mediate important stabilizing interactions in the ligand-free, but not the ligand-bound, conformation. We mutated both residues to alanine to abrogate these interactions and selectively destabilize the open conformation. The M321A/Q325A mutant will be referred to as MBP-Ala.Table ITemperature factor analysis of ligand-free and ligand-bound MBPGroupAverage B-factorLigand-freeMaltose-boundMet-321 side chain atoms16.726.3Gln-325 side chain atoms33.760.6Residues 171-17743.459.2Whole protein25.922.1 Open table in a new tab The loop containing residues 171 to 177 was also identified as a potential stabilizing factor for the open conformation. In various crystal structures of MBP, this loop appears in different conformations with relatively high temperature factors, indicating that it is probably not important for the overall structure or fold of MBP. Nevertheless, this loop is retained with moderate sequence conservation in MBP molecules from various organisms, suggesting that it may have an important function. This loop is part of the C-terminal domain, but in the ligand-free conformation it makes a number of contacts with the N-terminal domain; these contacts are broken when the protein binds ligand. As with the side chains of Met-321 and Gln-325, the temperature factors of residues 171–177 are greater for the ligand-bound conformation (Table I), indicating that the loop becomes more mobile when the protein binds maltose. Note that the loop does not participate in crystal contacts in the structures analyzed. Based on reasoning similar to that given for the MBP-Ala mutant, we decided to shorten this loop to selectively destabilize the ligand-free, open conformation of MBP. Residue 174, a glycine, is located in the middle of the β-turn of the loop, and given its unique properties, we decided to shorten the loop by removing two residues on either side of Glu-174, namely Glu-172, Asn-173, Lys-175, and Tyr-176. This deletion mutant will be referred to as MBP-Del. The mutations in MBP-Ala and MBP-Del caused an increase in affinity for maltose (see below). Because the mutations in MBP-Ala and MBP-Del are completely independent, we decided to combine them in an attempt to further increase the affinity for maltose. The MBP molecule produced by combining the mutations in MBP-Ala with the deletions in MBP-Del will be referred to as MBP-DM (for “double mutant”). Functional Characteristics of MBP and Engineered Mutants—MBP molecules that cannot bind maltose, or interact productively with MalFGK2, will not function in transport, and we first tested the mutants for their ability to participate in maltose transport. The MBP mutants were put into a background, E. coli HS3309 (14Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which has a disruption of the maltose operon such that there is no chromosomally encoded MBP present. In this background, all of the mutants were able to support growth on minimal maltose media, indicating that they are fully functional. We monitored binding of maltose to both MBP-WT and the engineered mutants MBP-Ala and MBP-Del by changes in intrinsic fluorescence. To ensure that the proteins were absolutely free from maltose, they were unfolded in 6 m guanidine HCl, purified by gel filtration chromatography, and refolded (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutations attenuated the fluorescence quenching normally caused by maltose binding: upon addition of a saturating concentration of maltose, wild-type MBP exhibited a decrease in fluorescence of 14%, whereas the decrease for MBP-Ala and MBP-Del, under exactly the same conditions, was 8% (Table II). The change in fluorescence for MBP-Ala and MBP-Del, although modest, was still sufficient to carry out fluorescence titrations to determine the KD for maltose binding (Fig. 2). The KD values obtained from these experiments are listed in Table II.Table IIAffinity of MBP molecules for maltose and maltotrioseProteinMaltoseMaltotrioseQuenchingaAverage ± S.D. for three determinations.KD aAverage ± S.D. for three determinations.QuenchingaAverage ± S.D. for three determinations.KD aAverage ± S.D. for three determinations.%nm%nmMBP-WT14 ± 11200 ± 20022 ± 2660 ± 60MBP-Ala8 ± 270 ± 1016 ± 2120 ± 10MBP-Del8 ± 3110 ± 2018 ± 2100 ± 10MBP-DM<2ND12 ± 36 ± 1a Average ± S.D. for three determinations. Open table in a new tab The MBP-DM showed no significant change in fluorescence upon addition of maltose, but there was an 11–14% decrease in fluorescence upon addition of a saturating concentration of maltotriose (Table II). This change in fluorescence allowed us to carry out titrations with maltotriose and determine that the KD for this sugar is 6 ± 1 nm, approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than the KD for the wild-type protein (Table II). The mutations produced an additive attenuation in the ligand-induced quenching of tryptophan fluorescence (Table II). None of the mutations produced an observable change in structure in the region of any tryptophan residue (see crystal structure analysis, below), and therefore it would appear that the strategy of destabilizing the open conformation of the protein has also had a general effect on ligand-induced fluorescence quenching. Of the eight tryptophan residues in MBP, three residues, Trp-10, Trp-94, and Trp-129, are located away from both the balancing interface and the ligand binding cleft, and show no change in structure or environment in the open and closed forms of the protein. Four residues are located in the ligand binding cleft; three of these, Trp-62, Trp-230, and Trp-340, make direct interactions with bound maltose, whereas the fourth, Trp-232, does not, but all experience a change in environment as a result of ligand binding. The eighth tryptophan residue, Trp-158, is part of the C-terminal domain, but is located close to the balancing interface. The contributions of the various tryptophan residues to maltose-induced fluorescence quenching were assessed previously in a site-directed mutagenesis study, where each tryptophan was mutated to an alanine and the binding and fluorescence properties of the resulting proteins were measured (26Martineau P. Szmelcman S. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In that study, the two most striking changes in tryptophan fluorescence were produced by the W230A and W158A mutants: the W230A mutation caused an increase in maltose-induced quenching to 30%, whereas the W158A mutation resulted in a complete loss of maltose-induced quenching. Given the location of Trp-158 near to the balancing interface, and the fact that mutation to alanine results in a loss of maltose-induced quenching (similar to what we have observed for MBP-DM) Trp-158 is most likely the source of the attenuated lig"

It is involved in several processes relevant to immunomodulation and inflammation. Among these processes, the production of extracellular interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays a major role in the activation of the cytokine network. We have investigated the role of P2X7 receptor and of an associated calcium-activated potassium conductance (BK channels) in IL-1β maturation and releasing processes by Schwann cells. Lipopolysaccharide-primed Schwann cells synthesized large amounts of pro-IL-1β but did not release detectable amounts of pro or mature IL-1β. ATP on its own had no effect on the synthesis of pro-IL-1β, but a co-treatment with lipopolysaccharide and ATP led to the maturation and the release of IL-1β by Schwann cells. Both mechanisms were blocked by oxidized ATP. IL-1β-converting enzyme (ICE), the caspase responsible for the maturation of pro-IL-1β in IL-1β, was activated by P2X7 receptor stimulation. The specific inhibition of ICE by the caspase inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde blocked the maturation of IL-1β. In searching for a link between the P2X7 receptor and the activation of ICE, we found that enhancing potassium efflux from Schwann cells upregulated the production of IL-1β, while strongly reducing potassium efflux led to opposite effects. Blocking BK channels actually modulated IL-1β release. Taken together, these results show that P2X7 receptor stimulation and associated BK channels, through the activation of ICE, leads to the maturation and the release of IL-1β by immune-challenged Schwann cells.

Interleukin-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates part of the host defense response to injury and infection. It is produced by activated monocytes and macrophages (1Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1998; 2: 108-115Crossref Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), but also by microglia in the central nervous system (2Hanish U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar).

While IL-1α is biologically active in both forms (pro-IL-1α and mature IL-1α), IL-1β is only active when converted in its mature form. The conversion of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β is achieved by a cysteine protease belonging to the caspase family, the IL-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) (3Kostura M.J. Tocci M.J. Limjuco G. Chin J.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), also termed caspase-1 (5Thornberry N.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One striking feature of IL-1β is its lack of signal sequence, which normally targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum to be exported in the extracellular compartment (6Lomedico P.T. Gubler U. Hellmann C.P. Dukovich M. Giri J.G. Pan Y.C. Collier K. Semionow R. Chua A.O. Mizel S.B. Nature. 1984; 312: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 7March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A.

Grabstein K. et al.Nature. 1985; 315: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar).Despite numerous studies, the mechanisms of IL-β posttranslational processing, are still ill defined. Because of the lack of signal peptide, it was first proposed that apoptosis of IL-1β-producing cells could be responsible for the release of IL-β (8Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and this theory is still largely accepted (for review, see Ref. 9DiVirgilio F. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Sanz J.M. Venketaraman V. Baricordi O.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, macrophages and monocytes can release IL-1β without obvious signs of cell death (10Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1451-1458PubMed Google Scholar, 11MacKenzie A. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). This non-cytolytic production of IL-1β led to the proposal of other mechanisms like the exportation by specific transporters (12Hamon Y. Luciani M.F. Becq F. Verrier B. Rubartelli A. Chimini G. Blood. 1997; 90: 2911-2915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the release from endosomal vesicles (13Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) or by microvesicle shedding (11MacKenzie A. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In most cases, the sole antigenic stimulation is poorly effective to release IL-1β. Indeed in generic macrophages or monocytes, pro-IL-1β tends to accumulate into the cytosol instead of being secreted, whereas mature IL-1β is absent from the intracellular compartment. It seems therefore that maturation and release processes are structurally and/or timely linked, possibly through the association of ICE subunits with the plasma membrane (14Singer I.I. Scott S. Chin J. Bayne E.K. Limjuco G. Weidner J. Miller D.K. Chapman K. Kostura M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Perregaux and Gabel (15Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were first to demonstrate that nigericin, a potassium ionophore, or ATP potentiated greatly the release of IL-1β from LPS-primed macrophages. Since this pioneer work, in vitro but also in vivo studies (16Griffiths R.J. Stam E.J. Downs J.T. Otterness I.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2821-2828PubMed Google Scholar, 17Solle M. Labasi J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) have shown that extracellular ATP acting on the P2X7 receptor, an ionotropic receptor that plays a pivotal role in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses (9DiVirgilio F. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Sanz J.M. Venketaraman V. Baricordi O.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), was a very potent agent to stimulate the production of large quantities of extracellular mature IL-1β.To unravel the mechanisms occurring downstream the P2X7 receptor activation and triggering the production and the release of IL-1β, we have chosen to study mouse Schwann cells for two main reasons: 1) their importance as partially immunecompetent cells within the peripheral nervous system and 2) the peculiarity of their P2X7 receptors. Indeed, in addition to their well documented roles in myelination, trophic, and metabolic support of the neuronal network, Schwann cells are able to present antigens to immunocompetent cells by expressing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules under inflammatory conditions both in vitro (18Armati P.J. Pollard J.D. Gatenby P. Muscle Nerve. 1990; 13: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in vivo (19Bergsteindottir K. Brennan A. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9054-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They produce chemokines (macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α); Ref. 20Taskinen H.S. Roytta M. J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2002; 5: 75-81Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cytokines (both pro- and anti-inflammatory, for review see Ref. 21Gold R. Archelos J.J. Hartung H.P. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Ref. 22Colomar, A., Marty, V., Combe, C., Médina, C., Parnet, P., and Amédée, T. (2003) J. Soc.

Jessen K.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 34: 15-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In vivo, Schwann cells in the course of experimental autoimmune neuritis the murine model for the human Guillain-Barre syndrome (24Skundric D.S. Lisak R.P. Rouhi M. Kieseier BC. Jung S. Hartung H.P. J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 116: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or Wallerian degeneration following an axonal injury (25Shamash S. Reichert F. Rotshenker S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3052-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are producing IL-1β. A specific feature of P2X7 receptors expressed by cultured mouse Schwann cells are there association with a calcium-activated potassium conductance and a chloride conductance (26Colomar A. Amédée T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 927-936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This intriguing phenotype makes the study of P2X7 receptors expressed by Schwann cells particularly interesting as the different conductances activated by extracellular ATP could participate to an integrated regulation of inflammatory processes occuring in the peripheral nervous system.The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of the P2X7 receptor and the associated conductances in IL-1β posttranslational processing in LPS-primed Schwann cells. We found that P2X7 receptor activation, through the activation of ICE, was essential to the production and the release of IL-1β. Potassium fluxes, through the P2X7 receptor itself and through calcium-activated potassium channels, were linking the P2X7 receptor activation to IL-1β processing. These results provide new insights on IL-1β processing mechanisms and on how Schwann cells, the main glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, can sense an immune stimulation and respond to it by activating the cytokine network.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGlial Cell Cultures—Schwann cells were cultured from excised dorsal root ganglia from OF1 mouse embryos (E19) as described previously (27Amédée T. Ellie E. Dupouy B. Vincent J.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 35-56Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by decapitation, and dorsal root ganglia were aseptically removed from embryos and plated onto 35-mm Petri dishes (Nunc, Strasbourg, France) coated with rat tail collagen type 1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Cells were cultured for the first 3 days in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) containing nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml, Alomone, Jerusalem, Israël) and a mixture of uridine (10 μm) and fluorodeoxyuridine (10 μm) to suppress dividing fibroblasts. Then, cells were cultured with α-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing nerve growth factor (20 ng/ml). The medium was changed twice a week, and cells were used between 4 and 6 weeks of culture. In some experimental conditions, ganglia were excised before measuring intracellular and extracellular IL-1β to eliminate an eventual neuronal source of IL-1β.Primary glial cells from mouse brain were used as a positive control for the expression of Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4). They were cultured from newborn mice as previously described in detail (28Pousset F. Palin K. Verrier D. Poole S. Dantzer R. Parnet P. Lestage J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11: 682-689PubMed Google Scholar) and were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/dish into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; <10 pg ml–1 endotoxins). Under these conditions, neurons do not survive the mechanical dissociation, and the low plating density prevents oligodendrocyte proliferation.Cell Treatments—Schwann cell cultures were primed for 6 h with LPS (10 μg/ml, Escherichia coli, serotype 0127B8, batch 63H4010, Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) with or without ATP (5 mm) during the last 30 min of stimulation. In some experiments, oxidized ATP (oATP) (300 μm), a P2X7 receptor antagonist, was used during the last 90 min of stimulation. High external potassium solution (90 mm K+) was obtained by adding 85 mm K+ to the culture medium during the last 30 min, while K+-free condition was obtained by replacing the culture medium by a nominal K+-free α-modified Eagle's medium medium during the last 30 min of the protocol. In some experiments, a specific inhibitor of caspase 1 (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO (YVAD-CHO)) (50–100 μm; Bachem, Voisins-les-Bretonneux, France) was added to block IL-1β maturation.Detection of Intracellular and Extracellular IL-1β by ELISA—The concentrations of IL-1β (both pro and mature forms) released in the culture medium and present in cell lysates (i.e. intracellularly) were quantified by specific mouse IL-1β sandwich ELISAs. ELISA reagents were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Poole (National Institute for Biological Standard and Controls, Potters Bar, UK). Assay detection limits were <2 pg/ml. Following stimulation by LPS and ATP, media were collected, and a mixture of antiproteases was added to avoid protein degradation (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 0.2 mm; EDTA, 0.1 mm; bestatin, 13 μm; E64 0.14 μm; leupeptin, 0.1 μm; aprotinin, 0.03 μm). Extracellular protein contents were concentrated 20 times with Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter units with a molecular mass cutoff of 4000 Da (Millipore, St. Quentin en Yvelines, France). Cell lysates were obtained by scratching cell cultures in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Cell debris and organelles were removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were assayed for intracellular IL-1β content. A sheep anti-mouse IL-1β antibody was used as a coating antibody, and a biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IL-1β antibody was used to sandwich the protein. Revelation was performed with horseradish peroxidase and o-phenylenediamine and read on a spectrophotometer. Both anti-IL1β antibodies recognize, without distinction, pro-IL-1β and mature IL-1β.Immunoblot Analysis—Because IL-1β antibodies recognized both pro and mature forms of IL-1β, Western blot analysis were performed to differentiate them according to their molecular weight. After appropriate stimulation, media were collected using the same protocol than for ELISA assays and concentrated 100 times. Cell lysates were obtained by scratching cell cultures in a lysate buffer containing (in mm): Tris-HCl, 20; EDTA, 1; MgCl2, 5; dithiothreitol, 1; aprotinin, 0.003; AEBSF, 1; sodium orthovanadate, 2 (pH 7.5) followed by mechanical trituration. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (80 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay using bicinchoninate (MicroBCAssay, Interchim, Montluçon, France). 50 μg of protein were loaded into wells of a 13% acryl/bisacrylamide gel, and after separation, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After saturation in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (0.1%) containing 1% milk, the membrane was probed with a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse IL-1β (R&D Systems, Abingdon Oxon, UK) at 1:200 dilution and was incubated overnight at 4 °C and followed by 2-h incubation in a peroxidase-conjugated antibody-sheep IgG (1:8000). Revelation was obtained by chemoluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France).In Situ Detection of Caspase Activity—Caspase activity was revealed by FITC-VAD-FMK assay (Promega, Charbonnières, France). FITC-VAD-FMK is a fluorogenic substrate of caspases that binds only active caspases. FITC-VAD-FMK (10 μm) was added to treated cell cultures during 45 min, and cell cultures were fixed with PFA 4% during 10 min. Fluorescence was monitored using an excitation filter (wavelength: 400–440 nm) and a barrier filter (wavelength: 480 nm).Electrophysiology—Currents were recorded from Schwann cells using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (GF 150 TF-10, Clarck Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) and filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): KCl, 120; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 2; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 10; glucose, 11; NaOH, 2; KOH, 33; (pH 7.4). In control conditions, the bathing solution (PSS) was (in mm): NaCl, 140; CaCl2, 5; MgCl2, 2; HEPES, 10; glucose, 11 and NaOH, 4 (pH 7.4). Voltage clamp protocols were applied from a holding potential of –70 mV by using a L/M-EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany). Signals were stored on a digital audio tape recorder (DTR-1200, Biologic, Grenoble, France). Acute application of ATP was achieved to Schwann cells by a perfusion system based on electromagnetic valves controlling gravity flow (29Amédée T. Despeyroux S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 259: 277-284Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Cell Viability—Cell death was assessed by colorimetric assay (Sigma), which measures the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by dying cells. Cell viability was estimated as the inverse ratio to LDH release for each experimental condition divided by total LDH release obtained by membrane permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.01%, 15 min).RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total cytoplasmic RNA of mouse Schwann cells was extracted using 500 μl of RNAnow-TC extraction kit (Biogentex) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RT-PCR was performed as follows: cDNA synthesis was carried out in a 20-μl reaction volume containing the total cytoplasmic RNA, 2.5 μm random primer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals SA, Meylan, France), 250 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Paris, France), and 200 units of SuperScript™II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). After incubation overnight at 37 °C, samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and kept at –80 °C. 4 μl of cDNA were amplified in a final reaction volume of 50 μl consisting of 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) supplemented with a 50 μm concentration of each dNTP, a 0.2 μm concentration of each 5′ and 3′ specific primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Primer sequences were designed from Mus musculus P2X7 receptor sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM011027) and purchased from Genset (Paris, France). Primer sequences were: sense P2X7, 5′-CACATTTGGATGGTGGACCA-3′ and antisense P2X7, 5′-ACTTGAAGCCACTGTACTGC-3′. Primer sequences were designed from M. musculus TLR4 sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM021297) and purchased from Genset (Paris, France). Primer sequences were: sense TLR4, 5′-GAATTAAGCTCCATGAACTG-3′ and antisense TLR4, 5′-TCTAGATAGCTGAGACTTGG-3′. The β2-microglobulin (β2mgl) was used as an internal control and was detected using the following primers: sense β2mgl, 5′-TGACCGGCTTGTATGCTATC-3′ and antisense β2mgl, 5′-CAGTGTGAGCCAGGATATAG-3′. PCR was performed in a Mastercycler personal (Eppendorf France, Le Pecq, France) with the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 61 °C for P2X7, 60 °C for TLR4, 65 °C for β2mgl, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min each step (35 cycles for P2X7, 30 cycles for TLR4, 29 cycles for β2mgl). The PCR products were separated by 13% acryl/bisacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amplicons were revealed by UV illumination using ethidium bromide. The incorporation of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Les Ullis, France) during PCR allowed for the detection of the amplified product using a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences, Bondoufle, France). The signal intensities of RT-PCR products were quantified by calculating the integrated volume of the band with a computing laser densitometer equipped with ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences) normalized to the values for β2mgl for each experiment. The selected primers generated a predicted single PCR product of 556 bp for P2X7, 459 bp for TLR4, and 234 bp for β2mgl.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were submitted to a normality test, and significance was tested by means of Student's paired t test and assessed at p < 0.05. When mentionned, data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's method and assessed at p < 0.05.RESULTSProduction of IL-1β by Mouse Schwann Cells in Organotypic Cultures—Because LPS is described to act specifically through TLR4, we investigated first whether cultured mouse Schwann cells were expressing these receptors by looking at the mRNA level. As shown in Fig. 1, cultured Schwann cells expressed constitutively TLR4 mRNA. Then we studied the effectiveness of a co-treatment with LPS and ATP to induce the production of extracellular IL-1β by investigating the time of ATP treatment required to obtain a steady state level of IL-1β production. Organotypic cultures were primed with LPS during 6 h and with ATP during the last 5, 10, 15, 30, or 45 min of LPS priming. Fig. 2 shows that 5 min of stimulation by ATP led to the production of IL-1β around detection limits. The production of IL-1β became really appreciable after 10 min of stimulation by ATP and increased for longer stimulation to plateau after 30 min. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, when culture media were collected 25 min after a brief application of ATP (5 min), the concentration of IL-1β was not significantly different from that produced by 30 min of stimulation by ATP. This result suggests that if 5 min of stimulation of the P2X7 receptor is long enough to trigger IL-1β processing, mechanisms leading to the release of IL-1β need at least 10 min to yield extracellular detectable amounts of the cytokine.Fig. 2Production of IL-1b by organotypic cultures of mouse Schwann cells. Organotypic cultures were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml, 6 h) and with ATP (5 mm) during the indicated times. Extracellular media were collected, and IL-1β was measured by ELISA. A, the experimental protocol is described in the upper panel. Release of IL-1β became sizeable after 5 min of ATP stimulation and reached a plateau after 30 min. This time course is representative of profiles obtained in three different experiments. B, the experimental protocol is described in the upper panel. Extracellular medium was collected after 5 or 30 min of ATP stimulation or after 5 min of ATP stimulation followed by a washout of ATP and an incubation in a control medium during 25 min. Note that the concentration of IL-1β produced by a challenge with ATP of 5 min was not significantly different from that produced by 30 min ([IL-1β]5 min+25 min = 113 ± 7.8 pg/ml, n = 3; [IL-1β]30 min = 108 ± 51.5 pg/ml, n = 5; p > 0.05).

Cultures were either treated with ATP alone for 30 min or primed by LPS for 6 h and treated with ATP during the last 30 min of the protocol. Intracellular IL-1β was assayed in cell lysates by ELISA. Fig. 3A shows that intracellular IL-1β was barely detectable in control conditions or after the sole stimulation by ATP. In contrast, LPS priming of cultures for 6 h led to the synthesis of noticeable amounts of IL-1β. Intracellular IL-1β synthesis induced by LPS priming was not significantly altered by neither a co-treatment with ATP nor the addition of oATP, a potent P2X7 antagonist. As organotypic cultures of dorsal root ganglia contain neurons and Schwann cells, we were led to consider which cell type was synthesizing IL-1β. Therefore we excised dorsal root ganglia to remove the neuronal population before assaying intracellular IL-1β content. In these conditions, IL-1β content of restricted Schwann cells lysate did not significantly differ from IL-1β content of total cells lysate (Fig. 3B). These results suggest first, that intracellular IL-1β measured in organotypic cultures was mainly, if not entirely, synthesized by Schwann cells and second, that Schwann cells did synthesize IL-1β only when challenged by an immune stimulus.Fig. 3LPS stimulates the synthesis of IL-1β in Schwann cells. Cultured dorsal root ganglia were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml, 6 h) and/or with ATP (5 mm, 30 min). Intracellular IL-1β contents were measured by ELISA performed on cell lysates. A, LPS triggered the synthesis of IL-1β ([IL-1β]control = 5.2 ± 2.6 pg/ml, n = 17; [IL-1β]LPS = 229.7 ± 30.4 pg/ml, n = 16; p < 0.001), whereas ATP did not ([IL-1β]ATP = 5.8 ± 1.8 pg/ml, n = 8). The co-treatment with LPS and ATP did not significantly modify IL-1β synthesis induced by LPS alone ([IL-1β]LPS = 229.7 ± 30.4 pg/ml, n = 16; [IL-1β]LPS+ATP = 221.8 ± 28.3 pg/ml, n = 18; p > 0.05). oATP (a specific P2X7 antagonist, 300 μm, 90 min) did not affect IL-1β synthesis induced by the co-treatment with LPS and ATP ([IL-1β]LPS+ATP = 221.8 ± 28.3 pg/ml, n = 18; [IL-1β]LPS+ATP+oATP = 117.9 ± 18.9 pg/ml, n = 7; p > 0.05) or by LPS alone ([IL-1β]LPS = 229.7 ± 30.4 pg/ml, n = 16; [IL-1β]LPS+ATP+oATP = 117.9 ± 18.9 pg/ml, n = 7; p > 0.05). B, excision of dorsal root ganglia from organotypic cultures before the co-treatment LPS + ATP did not change significantly IL-1β synthesis by remaining Schwann cells ([IL-1β]LPS+ATP = 116 ± 31 pg/ml; [IL-1β]LPS+ATP/EXC = 114 ± 14.5 pg/ml, p > 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2037440777,"Smad4 is an essential signal transducer of all transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation, and it becomes inactivated in human cancers. Receptor-activated (R-) Smads can be poly-ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, and this regulates their steady state levels or shutdown of the signaling pathway. Oncogenic mutations in Smad4 and other Smads have been linked to protein destabilization and proteasomal degradation. We analyzed a panel of missense mutants derived from human cancers that map in the N-terminal Mad homology (MH) 1 domain of Smad4 and result in protein instability. We demonstrate that all mutants exhibit enhanced poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In contrast, wild type Smad4 is a relatively stable protein that undergoes mono- or oligo-ubiquitination, a modification not linked to protein degradation. Analysis of Smad4 deletion mutants indicated efficient mono- or oligo-ubiquitination of the C-terminal MH2 domain. Mass spectrometric analysis of mono-ubiquitinated Smad4 MH2 domain identified lysine 507 as a major target for ubiquitination. Lysine 507 resides in the conserved L3 loop of Smad4 and participates in R-Smad C-terminal phosphoserine recognition. Mono- or oligo-ubiquitinated Smad4 exhibited enhanced ability to oligomerize with R-Smads, whereas mutagenesis of lysine 507 led to inefficient Smad4/R-Smad hetero-oligomerization and defective transcriptional activity. Finally, overexpression of a mutant ubiquitin that only leads to mono-ubiquitination of Smad4 enhanced Smad transcriptional activity. These data suggest that oligo-ubiquitination positively regulates Smad4 function, whereas poly-ubiquitination primarily occurs in unstable cancer mutants and leads to protein degradation.

Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are phosphorylated by the type I receptor serine/threonine kinase of the heteromeric (type I/type II) cell surface receptor complex. Activated R-Smads oligomerize with a common effector Smad4 (also called Co-Smad), and translocate to the nucleus. After nuclear accumulation, Smads engage in transcriptional complexes by binding to DNA and by interacting with various transcription factors to regulate gene expression (1Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Itoh S. Itoh F.

Another class of Smad proteins, the inhibitory (I) Smads, participate in negative feedback loops whereby their genes are direct targets of the Smad pathway and their induced expression leads to inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation by the type I receptors (5Nakao A. Okumura K. Ogawa H. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 361-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple intracellular effectors that mediate signals from alternative signaling cascades can regulate the Smad pathway (1Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 6ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated R-Smads has been reported to be important for the maintenance of their steady state levels and for the shutdown of the activated Smad pathway after execution of its transcriptional roles (reviewed in Ref. 2Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, I-Smads act as adaptor proteins that mediate ubiquitination and degradation of the type I receptors (7Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 8Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Much of the evidence on the role of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Smad proteins depends on the identification of two related Hect domain E3 ligases, named Smurf1 and Smurf2, that interact specifically with R-Smads and I-Smads but not with Smad4 and catalyze their specific poly-ubiquitination (7Kavsak P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the precise physiological role of such ubiquitination events remains unclear and controversial to a certain extent (2Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether ubiquitination of R-Smads is a necessary event to regulate the signaling capacity of the pathway or whether it could serve some alternative functions remains an open question. Ubiquitination of the Co-Smad, Smad4, has been reported to occur only in cancer cells and is thought to be associated with oncogenic mutations that lead to Smad4 inactivation (1Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Thus, point mutants isolated from human cancer cells and mapping in the N-terminal MH1 domain were shown to be unstable compared with wild type Smad4 (12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). One such Smad4 mutant was analyzed in more detail, as was the homologous mutant of the R-Smad Smad2; both were found to be proteasomally degraded after poly-ubiquitination (13Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a C-terminally truncated mutant of Smad4 also exhibits protein instability and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (14Maurice D. Pierreux C.E. Howell M. Wilentz R.E. Owen M.J. Hill C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43175-43181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mutant was demonstrated to be able to affect the stability of Smad2 with which Smad4 normally forms functional signaling complexes. These studies suggested that degradation of Smad4 is a prevalent mechanism of inactivation of TGF-β pathways in cancer cells. Finally, two other factors, oncogenic Ras overexpression and one subunit of the COP9 signalosome, CSN5/Jab1, could both mediate Smad4 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (15Saha D. Datta P.K. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29531-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, although ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Smad4 has been established as a mechanism of inactivation of this tumor suppressor in human cancers, the importance of Smad4 ubiquitination under non-tumorigenic conditions has not yet been addressed. Many of the mechanistic details of Smad ubiquitination in general also remain largely unexplored. We therefore set up to investigate some of the aspects of Smad4 ubiquitination by focusing on a comparative analysis of wild type Smad4 versus a panel of missense MH1 domain mutants, the functional properties of which we reported previously (12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We also attempted to map lysine residues in Smad4 that are prominent sites of ubiquitination. We show that all MH1 domain mutants are poly-ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes, thus extending the paradigm reviewed above to a larger group of cancer mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wild type Smad4 is preferentially mono- or oligo-ubiquitinated, which is in agreement with its apparent stability. This difference is also clear when a panel of dominant negative E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes was studied for their effects on wild type and mutant Smad4 stability. Mono- or oligo-ubiquitination of wild type Smad4 maps to and/or requires the MH2 domain. We have identified lysine 507 as one prevalent site of ubiquitination in the MH2 domain. This residue affects R-Smad/Co-Smad oligomerization and transcriptional activity, and based on these findings we postulate that ubiquitination of Smad4 may serve two alternative purposes, i.e. positive regulation of Smad oligomerization and signaling strength, and protein degradation of mutants associated with human carcinogenesis. Cell Culture, Ligands, Proteins, Antibodies, and Plasmids—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, mammary carcinoma MCF7 and MDA-MB-468, hepatoma HepG2, and colorectal carcinoma SW480 cells were obtained and cultured according to protocols from American Type Culture Collection.

Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2 and M5) antibodies were purchased from Sigma, mouse monoclonal anti-HA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, mouse monoclonal anti-Smad4 was from BD Transduction Laboratories, and rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad4 (DPC4) and mouse monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) antibodies were produced in house. The promoter-reporter constructs 9xCAGA-luc 12xCAGA-luc (17Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

The mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 encoding constitutively active ALK5, 6myc-tagged Smad3 and Smad2, FLAG-tagged Smad4, Smad4ΔMH1, and Smad4ΔMH2, have been previously described (18Kurisaki A.

The FLAG-tagged Smad4 linker (amino acids 142–321) construct was produced by PCR amplification from the full-length human Smad4 cDNA and subcloning to pcDNA3. The point mutants K507R and K507A of human Smad4, epitope-tagged with FLAG at their N termini, were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. The FLAG-tagged, human dominant-negative E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UbcH(CS)s, were constructed by replacement of the active site cysteine with serine by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach. The K48R mutant ubiquitin was also constructed by a PCR-based approach. All mutations and sequences of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The missense Smad4 mutants have been described previously (12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HA-tagged ubiquitin was a gift from D. Bohmann (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Transfections and Gene Reporter Assays—Transient transfections of cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or calcium phosphate coprecipitation were performed according to protocol from the manufacturer and as previously described (12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the enhanced luciferase assay kit from BD Pharmingen Inc., according to the protocol from the manufacturer. All promoter-reporter experiments included triplicate determinations from independently transfected plates within each experiment and were repeated at least twice. The data presented in figures represent average values and standard deviations from representative single experiments with triplicate transfections. Analysis of Smad4 Protein Expression and Stability—Transiently transfected or non-transfected cell monolayers were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After Bradford analysis of total protein levels, the lysates were adjusted prior to subsequent immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Endogenous Smad4 was either directly immunoblotted using the mouse anti-Smad4 antibody (Fig. 1A) or immunoprecipitated with rabbit DPC4 antibody before immunoblotting with mouse anti-Smad4 antibody (Fig. 1B). Transfected FLAG-tagged Smad4 was detected by direct immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Immunoblotted proteins were detected by ECL, scanning on a CCD camera (Fuji LAS-1000), and densitometry was performed using the AIDA program of the scanner (Fuji). For Smad4 stability measurements, transfected HEK-293T cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) for the last 2–12 h of the transfection and prior to cell lysis and anti-FLAG immunoblotting. Alternatively, pulse-chase experiments were performed in transfected HEK-293T cells by starving cells in methionine/cysteine-free MCDB 104 medium for 4 h, labeling cells with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, and chasing in MCDB 104 supplemented with cold 50 μg/ml methionine and cysteine. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations with FLAG M2 antibody were followed, and after washing the immunocomplexes with lysis buffer four times, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried and autoradiographed on a phosphorimager (Fujix BAS 2000, Fuji). Relative protein expression levels were quantified using the scanning densitometric software (AIDA) of the phosphorimager. For Smad4 analysis after proteasomal inhibition, transfected HEK-293T cells were treated with 20 μm MG-132 inhibitor (Calbiochem) for 16 h. A second pulse of inhibitor was added for additional 2 h, and then cells were lysed. All control cell treatments included equal volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent of MG-132. Ubiquitination Assays—HEK-293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad4 and HA-ubiquitin or HA-ubiquitin K48R; 48 h after transfection cells were lysed by boiling in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% SDS until the pellet was dissolved, after which 1.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin) were added. Smad4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2; after four washes with lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody for ubiquitin. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Mono-ubiquitinated Smad4 —HEK-293T cells were transfected, and ubiquitination assays were performed as described above. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were boiled in 100 μl of 1% SDS for 5 min, 1 ml of lysis buffer was added, and a second anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed. The proteins obtained after the second immunoprecipitation were resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The non-ubiquitinated and mono-ubiquitinated bands (Fig. 6A) were cut out and digested in the gel (22Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In brief, the protein bands were destained, washed, and treated with ammonium bicarbonate. After complete drying under nitrogen, trypsin (porcine, modified sequence grade from Promega) was allowed to absorb into the gel piece. After overnight digestion, the peptides were extracted and then desalted and concentrated on a handmade microcolumn, POROS R2 20, packed in a gel loader tip (23Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The peptides were eluted with acetonitrile-containing matrix (4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid) directly onto the target, and spectra were taken using a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF-MS from Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). The search for ubiquitinated peptides was accomplished by GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark), by scanning for the expected addition of either of the two most C-terminal tryptic peptides of human ubiquitin (GG or LRGG, of 114.05 or 383.22 Da, respectively) onto a Lys residue in the tryptic digest of human Smad4. Smad4/R-Smad Complex Formation Assays—Association of transfected FLAG- or 6myc-tagged Smad4 with 6myc- or FLAG-tagged Smad2 or Smad3 was monitored by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Transfected HEK-293T cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibodies as described above, prior to immunoblotting with the reciprocal antibody and ECL detection. To evaluate Smad4/R-Smad complexes more stringently, lysates of transfected HEK-293T cells were first immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma), the immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the bound Smad proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating for 2 h with FLAG peptide (10 μg/ml) in lysis buffer. The eluted proteins were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-Smad4 antibody, and the final immunocomplexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Smad4 Is a Widely Expressed Protein with Slow Turnover in Human Epithelial Cells—We screened a large panel of human epithelial cell types for the expression pattern of Smad4 using direct immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Fig. 1A shows representative data from five such cell lines, one of which, the mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-468, was used as negative control because it lacks both Smad4 alleles (24de Winter J.P. Roelen B.A. ten Dijke P. van der Burg B. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In all cell lines tested, we identified rather comparable levels of endogenous Smad4 expression, whereas MDA-MB-468 cells (and SW480 cells 2A. Morén and A. Moustakas, unpublished observation.; Ref. 25Calonge M.J. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33637-33643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) completely lacked Smad4 expression. The endogenous levels of Smad4 expression in human epithelial cells were roughly 20% of the levels of epitope-tagged Smad4 overexpressed in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1C), as assessed using the same anti-Smad4 antibody. 2A. Morén and A. Moustakas, unpublished observation. We also examined the influence of several growth factor stimuli on the steady state levels of endogenous Smad4 (Fig. 1, A and B). In HepG2 and HEK-293T cells, stimulation with high doses of TGF-β1 or BMP-7 for up to 24 h did not lead to any measurable effects on Smad4 levels. Stimulation of HEK-293T cells by a constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor over the course of a 2–3-day transfection, or stimulation of porcine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β by platelet-derived growth factor receptor BB, 2A. Morén and A. Moustakas, unpublished observation. neither had any measurable effects on endogenous Smad4 levels. Finally, high and low serum levels in the absence or presence of recombinant TGF-β1 showed no appreciable effects on Smad4 protein expression in immortalized normal human keratinocytes HaCaT. 2A. Morén and A. Moustakas, unpublished observation. The expression of transfected Smad4 in HEK-293T cells after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment remained rather robust and roughly equal to the non-treated control over a 12-h time period (Fig. 1, C and E). Similarly, metabolic labeling of transfected Smad4 in HEK-293T cells for 2 h followed by a cold amino acid chase for up to 12 h did not reveal any appreciable change in the Smad4 levels (Fig. 1, D and E). From all these experiments, we conclude that human Smad4 exhibits rather stable expression patterns and that mitogenic or anti-proliferative growth factors do not appreciably change this pattern. Missense Smad4 Cancer Mutants Are Unstable and Degraded by Proteasomes—We have previously characterized biochemical phenotypes of a group of missense mutants mapping in the MH1 domain of Smad4 that were originally described in human cancers, including pancreatic and colon cancers (12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One common feature of the four mutants analyzed in this previous study was their relative low levels of expression compared with wild type Smad4. The Smad4(L43S) mutation maps in a region close to the nuclear localization signal of Smad4 and exhibits the strongest phenotype in terms of protein instability (Fig. 2D and Ref. 12Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We analyzed the stability of this mutant after transfection in HEK-293T cells and blockade of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (Fig. 2A), and after metabolic labeling and chasing with cold amino acids (Fig. 2B). We observed a dramatic and rapid down-regulation of the Smad4(L43S) protein levels in both experiments (Fig. 2, A–C) that strongly contrasted with the behavior of the wild type protein (Fig. 1). The half-life of this mutant was estimated at 4.5 h in transfected HEK-293T cells. The Smad4(L43S) mutant represents one of the most unstable Smad4 protein mutants described so far. We also analyzed the other three MH1 mutants, G65V, R100T, and P130S, using similar assays and measured their half-life (Fig. 2D). Smad4(P130S) exhibited intermediate phenotype and a half-life of 11 h, Smad4(G65V) showed biphasic kinetics with a rapid down-regulation phase during the first 2 h followed by steady levels up to 12 h, and R100T showed very similar kinetics to L43S and a half-life of 5 h. To investigate whether the observed decreased levels of Smad4(L43S) and the other three MH1 domain mutants (G65V, R100T, and P130S) are the result of proteasomal degradation, we measured their levels of expression after transfection in HEK-293T cells in the absence and presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2E). Whereas inhibition of proteasomal activities had small effects on wild type Smad4 levels, it dramatically enhanced the levels of all missense MH1 domain mutants. Thus, the apparent instability of the missense mutants is likely to be the result of proteasomal degradation. To further confirm that ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation was the mechanism responsible for the apparent instability of the missense cancer mutants of Smad4, we coexpressed the various mutants together with enzymatically inactive mutants of human E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc) that are known to act as dominant negative inhibitors of endogenous ubiquitination pathways (26Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). The effects of such dominant negative E2 Ubcs on wild type Smad4 protein levels were measurable but modest (Fig. 3). However, UbcH3(CS), and to a lesser extent UbcH6(CS) and UbcH7(CS), rescued the weak or undetectable expression of the missense Smad4 mutants. We therefore conclude that the missense MH1 mutants are indeed heavily degraded via an ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway, and furthermore, that UbcH3 appears to play a selective role in this mechanism. In contrast, the low degree of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of wild type Smad4 may be catalyzed by several E2 Ubcs, as we did not observe any specificity in the weak effects of dominant negative Ubcs. Wild Type Smad4 Is Mono- or Oligo-ubiquitinated, Whereas Missense Smad4 Mutants Are Additionally Poly-ubiquitinated—We then examined whether Smad4 and its mutants could undergo ubiquitination in intact cells (Fig. 4). We coexpressed in HEK-293T cells wild type or missense mutant Smad4, tagged with a FLAG epitope, alone or together with ubiquitin tagged with an HA epitope, and performed immunoprecipitations of denatured proteins from the cell extract with the anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotting of the resolved proteins with the anti-HA antibody. To make sure that we were not identifying coprecipitating ubiquitinated proteins, the primary immunoprecipitates were boiled in the presence of SDS and reprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody prior to immunoblotting (see Fig. 6). Such analyses showed that wild type Smad4 exhibited ubiquitinated products of low molecular weight that could correspond to mono-, di-, and possibly tri-ubiquitinated Smad4 (Fig. 4A). Very low levels of high molecular weight poly-ubiquitinated chains were detected. In contrast, all missense mutants, and especially Smad4(L43S), exhibited significant levels of poly-ubiquitination and a different pattern of oligo-ubiquitinated protein bands. The presence of the oligo-ubiquitinated Smad4 species was detectable even by plain immunoblotting of total cell lysates (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). To obtain more direct evidence about the degree of Smad4 oligo-ubiquitination, we repeated the ubiquitination assays for wild type and L43S mutant Smad4 in the presence of wild type ubiquitin or mutant K48R ubiquitin (Fig. 4B). Lysine 48 of ubiquitin is one of the most commonly used residues for the creation of branched polymers of ubiquitin that are added on protein substrates tha"

Fc fusion decoy receptors, BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc, are therapeutic candidates for blocking BAFF. While studying their interactions with BAFF, we found that BAFF-R-Fc is more effective than BCMA-Fc for blocking BAFF binding to its receptors. We also found that a trimeric BAFF can bind more than one BAFF-R-Fc but only one BCMA-Fc. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to monovalent BAFF-R-Fc, monovalent BCMA does not form stable complexes with BAFF. Differences in their interaction with BAFF predict BAFF-R-Fc would be a better inhibitor. Indeed, we show BAFF-R-Fc is 10-fold more efficacious than BCMA-Fc for blocking BAFF-induced B cell proliferation in vitro and for blocking BAFF-mediated survival of mouse splenic B lymphocytes in vivo.

The TNF homologous regions can be proteolytically released as soluble trimeric proteins that, in many cases, are fully capable of interacting with their receptors. BAFF was identified as a TNF family member by searching the expressed sequence tag data base for homology in amino acid sequence to the extracellular domain of TNF (3Shu H.B. Hu W.H. Johnson H. J.

The lack of peripheral B cells in BAFF null mice clearly demonstrated that BAFF is indispensable for maintaining the survival of peripheral B lymphocytes (6Mackay F. Browning J.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of human BAFF was crystallized and shown to exist as a homotrimer (7Liu Y. Xu L. Opalka N. Kappler J.

The unusually long loop between the D and E β-strands that is present in each subunit of BAFF was reported to be responsible for assembly of 20 BAFF trimers into a virus-like cluster (7Liu Y. Xu L. Opalka N. Kappler J. Shu H.B. Zhang G. Cell. 2002; 108: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this loop was noted by the observation that the deletion of this loop in BAFF leads to loss of its activity to activate NFκB and to stimulate B cell proliferation (7Liu Y. Xu L. Opalka N. Kappler J. Shu H.B. Zhang G. Cell. 2002; 108: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of BAFF-receptor complexes revealed that the extracellular domain of BCMA or BAFF-R binds to the BAFF in a 3:3 molar ratio (10Kim H.M. Yu K.S. Lee M.E. Shin D.R. Kim Y.S. Paik S.G.

Receptors of the TNF superfamily are mostly type I membrane proteins that share 2–4 characteristic cysteine-rich domain repeats in their extracellular domains (12Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem.

Among these receptors, BCMA and TACI also interact with APRIL (18Yu G. Boone T. Delaney J. Hawkins N. Kelley M. Ramakrishnan M. McCabe S. Qiu W.R. Kornuc M. Xia X.Z. Guo J. Stolina M. Boyle W.J. Sarosi I. Hsu H. Senaldi G. Theill L.E. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 252-256Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar), a TNF ligand family member sharing significant sequence homology with BAFF (19Hahne M.

BCMA was initially identified as part of a translocation event in a T cell lymphoma (20Gras M.P. Laabi Y. Linares-Cruz G. Blondel M.O. Rigaut J.P. Brouet J.C. Leca G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Tsapis A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1093-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The physiological role of BCMA is unclear because its distribution is primarily restricted to the Golgi apparatus in mature B cells (20Gras M.P. Laabi Y. Linares-Cruz G. Blondel M.O. Rigaut J.P. Brouet J.C. Leca G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Tsapis A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1093-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the deficiency of this gene in mice has no apparent impact on B cell development (21Schiemann B. Gommerman J.L. Vora K.

Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), is expressed in mature B cells and activated T cells. TACI has been implicated as a negative regulator for the homeostasis of B lymphocytes (24von Bulow G.U. van Deursen J.M. Bram R.J.

BAFF-R was identified via expression cloning for BAFF binding in the absence of BCMA and TACI and was shown to be expressed primarily on B cells (17Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F. Vora K. Scott M.L. Cachero T.G. Hession C. Schneider P. Sizing I.D. Mullen C. Strauch K. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Ambrose C. Science. 2001; 293: 2108-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of this gene is disrupted in A/WySnJ mice, a strain that displays a B cell phenotype similar to BAFF-deficient mice that lack the majority of peripheral B cells (17Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F. Vora K. Scott M.L. Cachero T.G. Hession C. Schneider P. Sizing I.D. Mullen C. Strauch K. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Ambrose C.

In contrast to most TNF receptor family members, whose extracellular domains usually contain several cysteine-rich domain modules, BCMA and BAFF-R have only one such module and TACI has only two. The extracellular domains of TNF receptors have been shown to be sufficient for interaction with their respective ligands. In fact, several soluble decoy receptors devoid of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains have been shown to be able to block the biological activity of the respective ligands (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The IgG1 Fc fusion proteins of BCMA and TACI, BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc, are capable of inhibiting B cell proliferation and antigen-specific antibody production (18Yu G. Boone T. Delaney J. Hawkins N.

Wang H. Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 37-41Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), presumably by blocking the activity of BAFF. This is consistent with the similar effect of BAFF-R-Fc in blocking the tri-nitro-phenol-specific IgG1 production (25Yan M. Brady J.R. Chan B. Lee W.P. Hsu B. Harless S. Cancro M. Grewal I.S.

Thus, soluble decoy forms of all three BAFF receptors are viable therapeutic candidates for intervening in immunological disorders caused by dysregulated BAFF. Here we compare the activities of BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc fusion proteins as BAFF inhibitors, and we show that BAFF-R-Fc is a more effective BAFF inhibitor.

BAFF-R-Fc contains the first 70 amino acids of human BAFF-R extracellular domain, carrying Val20 → Asn and Leu27 → Pro mutations, fused with a human IgG1 Fc domain that is shared with BCMA-Fc and was purified as described previously (29Thompson J.S.

Similarly, CD40-Fc was generated by fusing the extracellular domain of human CD40 (Glu21 to Arg193) with the IgG1 Fc domain. Monovalent BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc were generated using the “knob and hole” technology (33Ridgway J.B. Presta L.G. Carter P. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric receptor fusion was bound to Protein A in PBS and eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 2.8, into 1/20 volume of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.6. This fraction was then purified on a nickel HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions, and the heterodimer was eluted around 250 mm imidazole. The heterodimer was further purified on Superose 6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. BJAB cells were a gift from Drs. G. Mosialos and E. Keiff of Harvard Medical School. CHO cells stably transfected with full-length human BAFF (BAFF-CHO) were generated by transfection of DG44 CHO cells with cDNA encoding full-length human BAFF carrying Lys132 → Ala and Arg133 → Ala mutations to minimize the proteolytic cleavage at this site. The polyclonal anti-BAFF antibody was purchased from MoBiTec (Goettingen, Germany). The mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2, and the M2-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. The peroxidase- and PE-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-human, and anti-rabbit antibodies, F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgM, with and without streptavidin conjugated, were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Human IgG1 was purchased from Protos ImmunoResearch (Burlingame, CA). The fluorescent probe 2′, 7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc were biotin-labeled at 1 mg/ml protein and 1 mg/ml EZ link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotin-labeled fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind to BAFF in immunoprecipitation reactions and were found to have no loss in BAFF binding activity. The substrate for alkaline phosphatase, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, was purchased from Sigma. ELISA of BAFF-R-Fc Binding to FLAG-BAFF and FLAG-APRIL—M2 was coated onto CoStar 96-well plates (number 3369) at 5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. The antibody solution was shaken out, and the plate was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. The plate was washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and FLAG-tagged BAFF and FLAG-tagged APRIL were captured at 20 ng/ml for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed; varying concentrations of BAFF-R-Fc were added in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The plate was washed, and bound BAFF-R-Fc was detected with anti-human Fcγ alkaline phosphatase. Positive signal was revealed with 5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamine, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, pH 9.0, and the absorbance was determined at 405 nm. Blocking of BAFF Binding to Wild-type and Variant BAFF-R by BAFF-R-Fc—EBNA293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding full-length wild-type BAFF-R (17Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F.

After 24 h, cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA, aliquoted (5 × 106 cells/ml), and washed with FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 5% FBS and 0.02% NaN3). Three serially diluted BAFF-R-Fc solutions ranging from 1.4 ng/ml to 9 μg/ml were added to the pelleted cells followed by addition of biotin-BAFF at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h, washed, and stained with streptavidin-PE for 30 min on ice and washed. Stained samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software. The mean fluorescence intensity for BAFF binding to BAFF-R cells was normalized to the ratio of mean fluorescence values for anti-BAFF-R binding to BAFF-R proteins. Blocking of BAFF Binding to Immobilized Receptor-Fc Fusion Proteins—BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc was covalently derivatized onto Seize IP beads from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. The receptor-coated beads were mixed with varying concentrations of BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc, to which FLAG-BAFF was then added, and rocked at 4 °C overnight followed by washing three times with 5% FBS in PBS. These beads were then treated with Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting with M2 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse to detect FLAG-BAFF. Self-competition of Receptor-Fc Fusion Proteins Bound to BAFF-CHO Cells—BAFF-CHO cells were grown to 70–90% confluence prior to harvesting with 5 mm EDTA in PBS. The cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer to 3 × 106 cells/ml, and biotin-labeled receptor Fc protein was added to 0.5 μg/ml. Approximately 6 × 105 cells were aliquoted into a well in a V-bottom 96-well plate and incubated on ice for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with 200 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer and incubated with varying concentrations of unlabeled”self“-receptor fusion (BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc, respectively) on ice for 30 min, washed, and stained with streptavidin-conjugated PE. The biotin-labeled receptor-Fc protein associated with BAFF-CHO cells was quantified by FACS analysis using CellQuest from BD Biosciences. Sandwich Analysis of the BAFF-Receptor Ternary Complexes—Seize IP beads covalently derivatized with either BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc were mixed with varying concentrations of biotin-labeled BCMA-Fc or biotin-labeled BAFF-R-Fc in 5% FBS in PBS. To this mixture, FLAG-BAFF was added and rocked at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 5% FBS in PBS, beads were treated with Laemmli sample buffer, and the biotin-labeled receptor Fc protein was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin on a Western blot. The detection of FLAG-BAFF was as described above. ELISA of FLAG-BAFF Binding to Monovalent BAFF-R-Fc and BCMA-Fc—ELISA was done similarly to the procedure outlined above. Anti-human IgG Fc antibody was coated onto ELISA plates. Monovalent BAFF-R-Fc and BCMA-Fc were captured at 2 μg/ml, and varying concentrations of FLAG-BAFF were added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Bound FLAG-BAFF was detected with M2 antibody followed by anti-murine antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Blocking of BAFF Binding to BJAB Cells by Receptor-Fc Fusion Proteins—BJAB cells were harvested and resuspended in FACS buffer at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Using V-bottom 96-well plates, 200 μl of cells were mixed with various concentrations of BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc, to which 1 μg/ml of FLAG-BAFF was added, incubated for an hour at 4 °C, washed with cold FACS buffer, and stained with M2 antibody followed by PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG (H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment to detect the bound BAFF, as quantified by FACS as above. Parallel experiments were performed by incubating 5 × 105 BJAB cells with 0.25 μg/ml FLAG-BAFF, washing off the unbound BAFF, before adding various concentrations of BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc to compete off the bound BAFF. Blocking of BJAB Cells Binding to BAFF Expressing CHO Cells by Receptor-Fc Proteins—CHO cells stably transfected with human BAFF lacking the furin cleavage site (5Schneider P. MacKay F. Steiner V. Hofmann K. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Ambrose C. Lawton P. Bixler S. Acha-Orbea H. Valmori D. Romero P. Werner-Favre C. Zubler R.H. Browning J.L. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) (BAFF-CHO) were grown in flat-bottom 96-well plates to ∼75–95% confluence. BJAB cells were harvested and resuspended at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml and loaded with 2 μg/ml BCECF. The cells were washed, pelleted, and resuspended to 4 × 106 cells/ml in FACS buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml huIgG1 and 5% normal rabbit serum. BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc, at 2 μg/ml, was added to wells containing BAFF-CHO cells 30 min prior to addition of BCECF-labeled BJAB cells. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for an hour, the unbound BCECF-labeled BJAB cells were washed off, and the bound BJAB cells were quantified by a fluorescence plate reader at 485ex/530em. Parallel experiments were also done by mixing receptor-Fc protein to BCECF-labeled BJAB cells prior to adding to BAFF-CHO cells. Blocking of BAFF-induced B Cell Proliferation—Mouse B cells were isolated from spleens of 2–3-month-old BALB/c mice using a B cell recovery column (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada). B cells were incubated in 96-well flat-bottom plates (105 cells/well in 100 μl of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS) for 72 h in the presence of myc-BAFF (75 ng/ml), F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgM (2 μg/ml), and varying amounts of BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc as indicated. Cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) for 18 h prior to harvest. The [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting on a Wallac Microbeta counter. Reduction of Splenic B Cells in Mice Treated with Receptor-Fc Fusion Proteins—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were maintained in the Biogen animal facility under barrier conditions. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Biogen Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 3–6 animals per group were treated intraperitoneally with different amounts of normal human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), BAFF-R-Fc, or BCMA-Fc on day 1 and day 5. Mice were sacrificed on day 8, and single cell suspension was prepared by grinding spleen between frosted glass slides. Total nucleated cells were counted using Coulter Counter Z2 (Coulter, FL), and percent of B cells was determined by FACS on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) after staining with fluorescence-labeled anti-B220 antibody (Pharmingen). Percent of B cell depletion in the spleens following BCMA-Fc or BAFF-R-Fc treatment was calculated as shown in Equation 1, x0026;&x0025;Bcelldepletion=100&x0025;·((totalnumberofB220+cellsincontrolx0026;IgGtreatedgroup)-(totalnumberofB220+cellsinreceptor-Fcx0026;treatedgroup))/(totalnumberofB220+cellsincontrolIgGtreatedx0026;group)(Eq. 1) Engineering of the Receptor Fc Fusion Proteins—During the process of engineering the soluble decoy forms of BAFF receptors fused with human IgG1 Fc region, we found that purified human BCMA-Fc fusion protein contained very little, if any, aggregated products. In contrast, human BAFF-R-Fc and human TACI-Fc fusion proteins produced by the mammalian cell expression system were mostly aggregated. Because no aggregates were detected in the similarly engineered mouse BAFF-R-Fc (data not shown), we systematically replaced the residues of the human receptor with those of the murine receptor and found that introduction of Val20 → Asn and Leu27 → Pro mutations in the human BAFF-R-Fc is sufficient to eliminate the aggregated products. Unfortunately, we were unable to engineer and produce TACI-Fc fusion protein with similar homogeneity, which prevented us from including this decoy receptor in this study. To determine whether the introduction of the murine residues alters the biochemical properties of the BAFF-R, we tested its ability to interact with either BAFF or APRIL by ELISA. Fig. 1A shows that the variant form of BAFF-R-Fc retains its ligand specificity by interacting with BAFF and not APRIL. We also investigated if BAFF binding affinity of the variant BAFF-R is different from that of wild-type BAFF-R. To minimize the potential avidity factor associated with ligand binding to surface-expressed receptor that may mask differences in intrinsic affinity, we set up an assay in which the variant BAFF-R-Fc competed with surface-expressed wild-type or variant BAFFR for BAFF binding. Fig. 1B shows that the ability of variant BAFF-R-Fc to compete for BAFF binding with full-length BAFF-R, wild-type or variant, is quite comparable, indicating that the cell surface-expressing variant BAFF-R and wild-type BAFF-R bind equally well to BAFF. These results show that the introduction of these two murine residues did not change the ligand specificity of this protein nor did it grossly alter the affinity of BAFF-R to interact with BAFF. For the sake of simplicity, we call this non-aggregated human variant BAFF-R Ig fusion protein BAFF-R-Fc. BAFF-R-Fc Disrupts BAFF-BCMA-Fc Complexes but BCMA-Fc Has No Effect on BAFF-BAFF-R-Fc Complexes—To investigate possible differences between BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc in their ability to bind to BAFF, we performed a competitive immunoprecipitation in which soluble BAFF was competed for by a mixture of soluble receptor-Fc protein and solid phase receptor Fc derivatized on beads. In the absence of soluble receptor-Fc protein, comparable amounts of BAFF were bound to BCMA-Fc beads and BAFF-R-Fc beads (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 8). Addition of soluble BCMA-Fc led to a reduced amount of BAFF bound to BCMA-Fc beads (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4). Similarly, soluble BAFF-R-Fc decreased the amount of BAFF associated with BAFF-R-Fc beads (Fig. 2, lanes 12–14). It should be noted that the ability of each soluble receptor to compete for BAFF bound to the same receptor Fc fusion on the beads is essentially identical. Interestingly, no BAFF was bound to BCMA-Fc beads when soluble BAFF-R-Fc was introduced (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7). In contrast, the amount of BAFF associated with BAFF-R-Fc was not diminished by the presence of soluble BCMA-Fc (Fig. 2, lanes 9–11). These results show that even though BAFF-BAFF-R-Fc and BAFF-BCMA-Fc interactions appear to be quite comparable, these interactions must be intrinsically different because BAFF-R-Fc is fully capable of disrupting the BAFF-BCMA-Fc complexes, but BCMA-Fc has no effect on BAFF-BAFF-R-Fc complexes. BAFF-BCMA-Fc Complexes Have a Faster Off-rate Than BAFF-BAFF-R-Fc Complexes—Both BCMA and BAFF-R exhibit a nanomolar affinity for their interactions with BAFF (18Yu G. Boone T. Delaney J. Hawkins N. Kelley M. Ramakrishnan M. McCabe S. Qiu W.R. Kornuc M. Xia X.Z. Guo J. Stolina M. Boyle W.J. Sarosi I. Hsu H. Senaldi G. Theill L.E. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 252-256Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One possibility that may account for the different abilities of BAFF-R-Fc and BCMA-Fc to compete for BAFF is a difference in the dissociation rates. To investigate this, biotin-labeled receptor-Fc protein was pre-bound to CHO cells expressing surface BAFF, and then competed by increasing concentrations of unlabeled receptor-Fc protein. Fig. 3 shows that BCMA-Fc bound to BAFF-CHO cells can be readily displaced by BCMA-Fc with an IC50 of 1 μg/ml. In contrast, when BAFF-R-Fc was bound to the BAFF-CHO cells, it was only marginally displaced by soluble BAFF-R-Fc, with an IC25 of ∼20 μg/ml. This result shows that the BAFF-BCMA-Fc complexes have a much faster off-rate than the BAFF-BAFF-R-Fc complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2069314342,"Protein scaffolds are essential for specific and efficient downstream signaling at synapses. Though nicotinic receptors are widely expressed in the nervous system and influence numerous cellular events due in part to their calcium permeability, no scaffolds have yet been identified for the receptors in neurons. Here we show that specific members of the PSD-95 family of PDZ-containing proteins are associated with specific nicotinic receptor subtypes. At postsynaptic sites, the PDZ scaffolds are essential for maturation of functional nicotinic synapses on neurons. They also help mediate downstream signaling as exemplified by activation of transcription factors. By tethering components to postsynaptic nicotinic receptors, PDZ scaffolds can organize synaptic structure and determine which calcium-dependent processes will be subject to nicotinic modulation."

In this report, we have replicated this increased potency of 2MD in vitro using osteoblastic cells and explored its underlying molecular mechanism. 2MD stimulates the expression of several vitamin D-sensitive genes including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24 hydroxylase (Cyp24), osteopontin and receptor activator of NFκB ligand and suppresses osteoprotegerin at concentrations two logs lower than that for 1,25(OH)2D3. 2MD is also more potent in stimulating transfected chimeric reporter genes under either Cyp24 or the osteocalcin promoter control. Enhanced potency is retained regardless of medium serum content. Interestingly, the uptake of both 1,25(OH)2D3 and 2MD into cells is similar, as is their rapid association with the VDR. This indicates that comparable levels of occupied VDR do not elicit equivalent levels of transactivation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), however, we observed a strong correlation between DNA-bound receptor and the level of induced transcription suggesting a 2MD-induced increase in affinity of the VDR for DNA. Additional studies using a mammalian two-hybrid system and ChIP indicate that 2MD is also more potent in promoting interaction with RXR and the coactivators SRC-1 and DRIP205. Finally, protease digestion studies revealed a unique VDR conformation in the presence of 2MD. These studies suggest that the molecular mechanism of 2MD potency is due to its ability to promote enhanced levels of specific DNA binding by the VDR and could suggest possible explanations for the tissue- and gene-selective actions of 2MD. 2-Methylene-19-nor-(20S)-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (2MD) is a highly potent analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) whose actions are mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR).

Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). This predominantly nuclear protein is a member of the steroid receptor gene family of transcription factors and functions like other nuclear receptors to regulate the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. The major role of 1,25(OH)2D3 is to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis through its direct actions on gene expression in the intestine, kidney, and bone (2Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This hormone also regulates proliferation, differentiation, activity, and survival of a number of cell types, many of which are not involved in mineral homeostasis (3Beckman M.J. Deluca H.F. Prog. Med. Chem. 1998; 35: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of these latter actions remains to be determined, however, given the largely skeletal phenotype associated with null mutations of the VDR gene in both humans and in mice (4Hughes M.R. Malloy P.J. Kieback D.G. Kesterson R.A. Pike J.W. Feldman D. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1988; 242: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 5Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Ligand association with the VDR leads to rapid activation and subsequent accumulation of the receptor on vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located within the promoter regions of specific genes (1Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). VDRE binding is facilitated by the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which functions both as a heterodimeric DNA binding partner as well as a participant in transactivation (6Thompson P.D. Remus L.S. Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Whitfield G.K. Galligan M.A. Encinas Dominguez.C. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The role of RXR in VDR-mediated gene repression is unclear and appears to be somewhat controversial (7Mackey S.L. Heymont J.L. Kronenberg H.M. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Regardless, these initial molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor are essential to the subsequent alteration in the expression of genes involved in a variety of highly pleiotropic cellular responses. A number of steroid hormone analogs, including those for 1,25(OH)2D3 have been synthesized and characterized (8Pike J.W. Yamamoto H. Shevde N.K. Adv. Ren. Replace Ther. 2002; 9: 168-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). With respect to vitamin D3 analogs, many of these are highly potent activators of gene transcription despite the fact that their affinities for VDR are not different from that of the native hormone. While enhanced potency can arise in vivo as a result of an analog's pharmacokinetic properties, recent studies in vitro have suggested that at least for some analogs increased potency may be due to their ability to induce unique VDR conformations that favor enhanced interaction with either RXR or coactivators such as SRC-1 or DRIP205 (9Peleg S.

Interestingly, while altered receptor conformations are supported through proteolytic digestion studies in vitro, they are not supported by three-dimensional structural analyses (12Rochel N.

Other 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs display disparate actions, exerting highly potent effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation or to suppress parathyroid hormone gene expression, yet demonstrating a restricted ability to induce calcium mobilization from bone or calcium uptake from the gut (14Bikle D.D. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 765-788PubMed Google Scholar, 15Norman A.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 22: S218-S222Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since increased serum calcium promotes soft tissue degeneration and other equally detrimental effects, compounds with a low hypercalcemic potential are highly desirable therapeutically. The underlying mechanism(s) for this selectivity is not known, but is likely to be complex given the diverse molecular mechanisms that drive bone resorption, intestinal absorption, and renal reabsorption of calcium. 2-Methylene-19-nor-(20S)-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (2MD) is a highly potent 1,25(OH)2D3 analog that exhibits tissue-selective as well as gene-selective actions in vitro and in vivo (16Sicinski R.R. Prahl J.M. Smith C.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4662-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This compound binds to the VDR with a K d that is similar to that for 1,25(OH)2D3, although its interaction with serum vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is exceedingly weak (Ref. 16Sicinski R.R. Prahl J.M. Smith C.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4662-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 2H. F. DeLuca, unpublished observations. In vivo studies suggest that this analog appears to localize selectively to bone relative to intestine (16Sicinski R.R. Prahl J.M. Smith C.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4662-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 2MD strongly induces calcium resorption from bone in vivo, an activity that is likely due to its ability to induce receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) from supportive stromal cells and osteoblasts. RANKL is a key regulator of osteoclast formation, activity and survival (18Hofbauer L.C. Khosla S. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 19Morony S. Capparelli C. Lee R. Shimamoto G. Boone T. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1478-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and is potently induced by both 1,25(OH)2D3 and 2MD in cultured cells (17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of ovariectomized adult rats with low doses of 2MD leads to a dramatic increase in bone mineral density (BMD) in aged, ovariectomized rats (17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). While the mechanism of this dramatic anabolic activity of 2MD is not yet understood, in vitro studies suggest that 2MD exhibits an exceptionally potent and unique ability to enhance VDR-mediated osteoblast activity that leads to increased mineralization (17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this article, we explore the underlying molecular basis for the increased potency of 2MD using osteoblast cell models. We find that 1,25(OH)2D3 and 2MD bind equivalently to the VDR under serum-free conditions. Despite this, localization of the receptor to VDREs lying adjacent to 1,25(OH)2D3-inducible promoters in intact cells occurs at concentrations of 2MD that are much lower than that for 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR DNA-binding correlates directly with the ability of the two ligands to activate transcription. A 2MD-mediated increase in VDR DNA affinity may result from enhanced VDR interaction with RXR and with coactivators such as SRC-1 and DRIP205, both of which could enhance the stability of the VDR on DNA.

Gal4-(1–147) DBD fusion vector pBIND (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to create pBIND-mRXRα (residues 292–467) and pBIND-hDRIP205NR (residues 527–970). pET-hVDR comprised of the full-length VDR containing a C-terminal His6 tag was constructed from the pET-29b vector obtained from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). pGEX-SRC-1NR (residues 621–765), pGEX-GRIP-NR (residues 629–760), pGEX-mRXRα (residues 203–467), and pGEX-DRIP205-NR (residues 527–970) were constructed using the pGEX parent plasmid obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 cells and ST2 cells were cultured in α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from BioWhittaker (Walkerville, MD). Vitamin D3 ligands were added in ethanol (0.1% maximum final concentration). Osteoclast Formation—Spleen cells were obtained from 6-week-old C57B6 mice (Harlan-Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN), treated with lysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA) and prepared as previously described (17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Coculture assays were carried out by plating ST2 cells (5 × 104/well) together with freshly isolated spleen cells (1 × 106/well) in 48-well plates. Cells were cultured in phenol red-free α-MEM with 10% charcoal dextran-treated FBS in the presence or absence of indicated compounds and the medium replaced on day 4 and day 7. Cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity on day 8–10 as previously described (24Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Osteoclast number was determined by counting the total number of multinucleated (>3 nuclei), TRAP-positive cells/well. Transfection Analysis—MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected 16–24 h later using LipofectAMINE Plus as described (23Pathrose P. Barmina O. Chang C.Y. McDonnell D.P. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Individual wells received 300 ng of DNA comprised of 250 ng of phOC-3900-luc or phCyp24-luc plasmid and 50 ng of pCH110-β-gal. In the two-hybrid system, cells received 250 ng of pGal4(5×)-luc, 50 ng of pVDR-VP16, 50 ng of either pBIND-mRXRα, pM-SRC-1NR, pM-GRIP-NR, or pBIND-hDRIP205NR and 50 ng of pCH110-β-gal. After transfection, the cells were normally cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h with or without the indicated ligands. Cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation and lysates assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activities using standard methods. In some experiments, cells were transfected as above and treated with the indicated ligands in the absence of FBS for periods ranging from 15 min to 8 h. The medium was then changed to ligand-free medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and analyzed as above. Luciferase units were normalized in all cases to β-gal activity. RNA Isolation and Analysis—MC3T3-E1 or ST2 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS at densities of 5 × 105/ml and treated for up to 24 h with dexamethasone (10–7m) without or with the indicated concentration of either 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD. Total RNA was isolated using the Triazol reagent from MRC (Cincinnati, OH), resolved using denaturing gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Double-stranded cDNA fragments encoding mouse RANKL (+270 to +940), mouse OPG (+346 to +1206), mouse Cyp24 (+435 to +707), mouse OPN (full-length cDNA), or mouse β-actin (+806 to +1155) were labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used as probes. Radioactive images were analyzed with a phosphorimager. Total RNA was also reverse transcribed using the SuperScript II RNase H Reverse transcriptase kit from Invitrogen and subjected to PCR analysis using standard methods (see also ChIP method). Cell Uptake Assays—MC3T3-E1 cells (1 × 106/ml) were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured overnight in normal FBS-supplemented α-MEM. The medium was then replaced with medium containing the indicated concentration of FBS and either 0.1 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 (166 Ci/mmol) or 2MD (174 Ci/mmol) for periods ranging from 5 min to 2 h. Following removal of the medium, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in scintillation fluid, and evaluated for ligand uptake using a Packard Tricarb 2900TR Scintillation Spectrometer. Hormone Binding Analysis—MC3T3-E1 cells (1 × 106/ml) were seeded into 100-mm plates and cultured overnight in normal FBS-supplemented α-MEM. The medium was then replaced with FBS-free medium, and 1,25(OH)2D3 (166 Ci/mmol) or 2MD (174 Ci/mmol) was added with or without a 100-fold molar excess of radioinert ligand for an additional 30 min. Following incubation, cells were washed, lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the soluble fraction subjected to hydroxylapatite (HAP) assay to assess total and nonspecific 1,25(OH)2D3- or 2MD-binding as previously described (25Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8554-8560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between total binding and nonspecific binding represents specific VDR binding. Total cellular uptake of both ligands in these experiments was also assessed as described above. GST Pull-down Assays—pET-VDR was transformed into BL21(DE3) codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene). Transformed cells were cultured with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 23 °C for 6 h and soluble VDR protein purified to homogeneity from lysates using sequential Ni-NTA and SP-Sepharose column chromatography. Lysates from pGST-RXRα-, pGST-SRC-1NR-, pGST-GRIP-NR-, and pGST-DRIP205-NR-transformed Escherichia coli were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4 C, and then washed extensively to prepare an immobilized GST fusion reagent of mRXRα, hSRC-1, hGRIP, or hDRIP205. Purified VDR and immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10–8 to 10–12m 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. After five washes, dissolved samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and subjected to Western blot analysis as previously described (20Jin C.H. Kerner S.A. Hong M.H. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using the anti-VDR monoclonal antibody 9A7 (26Pike J.W. Marion S.L. Donaldson C.A. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1289-1296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using the ECL method. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (27Weinman A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Briefly, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in FBS-free α-MEM and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD for the times or concentrations indicated. Following a wash with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were subjected to cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde. Cells were extracted in 5 mm Pipes pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then in 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. Chromatin pellets were sonicated to an average of 300–500-bp fragments of DNA, centrifuged, and then diluted into ChIP buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies and then collected following a 1-h incubation with salmon sperm DNA-and bovine serum albumin-pretreated Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Precipitates were then washed sequentially and the cross-links reversed with a 6-h incubation at 65 °C in 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen QIAquick Spin Kits (Valencia, CA) and subjected to PCR techniques using primers designed to amplify fragments of murine Cyp24 promoter region (–236 to –51) and murine OPN promoter region (–854 to –658). All PCR analyses for each primer set were carried out in a predetermined linear range of DNA amplification. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. Protease Digestion Studies—The plasmids pcDNA-hVDR or pcDNA-hVDR(R417A/R420A) were utilized to prepared in vitro-translated, [35S]methionine-labeled hVDR or hVDR(R417A/R420A) using the TnT/T7-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System from Promega (Madison, WI). Appropriate aliquots were treated with the indicated concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD for 10 min and then digested with trypsin (0.12 μg/sample) at room temperature for the indicated time periods as described (9Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Digestion was terminated with denaturing buffer, whereupon the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. 2MD Is a 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -like Superagonist in Cell Culture— Previous studies revealed that 2MD is a highly potent compound that exhibits both tissue and gene selectivity in vivo (16Sicinski R.R. Prahl J.M. Smith C.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4662-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Several of these characteristics have also been demonstrated in cell culture (17Shevde N.K. Plum L.A. Clagett-Dame M. Yamamoto H. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13487-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For example, 2MD is at least 100-fold more active than 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing a collection of vitamin d-sensitive genes in the mouse osteoblastic cell line ST2, including Cyp24, OPN, and RANKL, and in suppressing the expression of OPG (Fig. 1A). Separate additional experiments indicated that while peak activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 2MD was reached at 10–7m and 10–9m, respectively, there was no increase in the efficacy of 2MD over that of 1,25(OH)2D3. Importantly, this increased potency of 2MD over 1,25(OH)2D3 extends to its ability to stimulate osteoclast formation in cocultures of ST2 cells and mouse osteoclast precursors (Fig. 1B), an effect due to increased expression of RANKL and decreased expression of OPG (19Morony S. Capparelli C. Lee R. Shimamoto G. Boone T. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1478-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These observations verify that 2MD is a highly potent 1,25(OH)2D3 agonist in cultured bone cells. This is an intriguing finding in view of the fact that the affinity of the VDR for 2MD (K d) is not different from that of the native hormone (16Sicinski R.R. Prahl J.M. Smith C.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4662-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Transcriptional Models Recapitulate 2MD Potency—To establish a functional model for evaluating the potency of 2MD, we introduced vitamin d-sensitive Cyp24 and OC promoter-reporter gene plasmids into pre-osteoblastic ST2 or MC3T3-E1 cells by transient transfection and assessed dose-dependent transcriptional activity in response to 2MD or 1,25(OH)2D3. As can be seen in Fig. 2, both 1,25(OH)2D3 and 2MD dose-dependently induced transcriptional activation of each reporter gene in MC3T3-E1 cells; similar results were obtained in ST2 cells (data not shown). The transcriptional potency of 2MD was at least two logs greater than for 1,25(OH)2D3, however, reflecting that observed for endogenous gene expression. These results suggest that the enhanced potency of 2MD is transcriptional in nature and provide a model for determining the underlying molecular basis for this increased potency. Enhanced Potency of 2MD Is Not Due to Serum—Ligand-induced transcriptional responses in cells are influenced by cell culture conditions and can be significantly affected by serum. Serum also contains DBP, an avid binder of and presumed primary although not exclusive carrier in the blood for most vitamin D metabolites (24Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In contrast to 1,25(OH)2D3, 2MD binds only weakly to DBP, an effect that could lead to an increase in its functional concentration relative to 1,25(OH)2D3. We explored this possibility by transfecting the OC promoter into MC3T3-E1 cells and then treating the cells with increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD for 1 h in serum-free medium. The medium was then replaced with ligand-free medium supplemented with 10% FBS and transcriptional activity assessed ∼24 h later. The results indicate that 2MD continues to exhibit an approximately two-log increase in potency (Fig. 3A), revealing that its superagonist activity is not due to serum. Similar results were obtained with the hCyp24 promoter (data not shown). Interestingly, the level of transcription induced under serum-free conditions in 1 h or less exposure to functionally equivalent levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10–7m) and 2MD (10–9m) is at least 50% of that achieved following continual treatment with the two ligands for 24 h in the presence of serum (Fig. 3B). Irrespective of this, the data suggest that the potency of 2MD is not derived from its lack of interaction with serum components. Cellular Uptake of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and 2MD Does Not Determine Potency—We next tested the possibility that 2MD might enter cells more readily than 1,25(OH)2D3 and thus saturate intracellular VDR at much lower medium ligand concentrations. Cells were incubated with 0.1 nm tritiated 1,25(OH)2D3 or 2MD (a concentration which leads to transcriptional activation with 2MD but not with 1,25(OH)2D3) under various serum conditions for periods ranging from 0 to 15 min, then washed, and the cellular content of ligand determined by scintillation counting. As seen in Fig. 4A, incubation of cells in the absence of FBS leads to a rapid and equivalent accumulation of both ligands within the cells. Surprisingly, this accumulation peaked within 10 min (Fig. 4A)"

Hints of a sub-complex between the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunits have been reported in the literature, but the complex was not isolated and thus the protein stoichiometry could not be determined. We report isolation of the BC·BCCP complex. By use of affinity chromatography using two different affinity tags it was shown that the complex consists of a two BCCP molecules per BC molecule. The molar ratio in the complex is the same as the ratio of the subunit proteins synthesized in vivo. We conclude that the complex consists of a dimer of BC plus four BCCP molecules instead of the 2BC·2BCCP complex previously assumed. This subunit ratio allows two conflicting models of the ACC mechanism to be rectified. We also report that the N-terminal 30 or so residues of BCCP are responsible for the interaction of BCCP with BC and that the BC·BCCP complex is a substrate for biotinylation in vitro.

Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall reaction consists of two distinct half-reactions (Scheme 1) the carboxylation of biotin with bicarbonate followed by transfer of CO2 group from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA (2Polakis S.E.

A. 1968; 59: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To carry out this two-step reaction, ACC requires two different protein subassemblies, biotin carboxylase (BC), and carboxyltransferase (CT). A third protein, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), carries the essential biotin cofactor covalently bound to a lysine residue located 35 residues from the carboxyl terminus. In mammals, fungi, and plant cytosols, all three ACC components reside on one polypeptide chain (4Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, in the E. coli form of the enzyme, which has been the subject of most mechanistic investigations, the components are a series of individual proteins that form a complex. The component proteins can be isolated from one another with the BC and CT components retaining enzymatic activity in their respective half-reactions (3Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Intermediate between these two extreme forms of ACC is the mitochondrial propionyl-CoA carboxylase (which also carboxylates acetyl-CoA), which is composed of two subunits. One subunit contains the CT sequences, whereas the other consists of the BC sequence followed by BCCP sequence (8Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6461-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli ACC seems to be a markedly unstable enzyme complex. It is thought to dissociate into sub-complexes upon undergoing the dilution that invariably accompanies cell lysis (6Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd. Ed. Vol. 6.

The N-terminal and C-terminal domains are connected by a proline plus alanine-rich sequence that acts as a mobile linker (18Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

BC, a protein of 49.4 kDa, has purified to homogeneity and shown to be a dimeric protein in solution (5Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Indeed, the Pseudomonas citronellolis enzyme was stabilized by high salt concentrations, purified, and reported to contain two copies of each of the four subunits (9Fall R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 450: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although this has long been considered to be the correct stoichiometry, the data are based on the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining, which varies significantly among proteins. Moreover, some variation in stoichiometry was mentioned. Therefore, the subunit stoichiometry of the active complex, which is required to understand the mechanism of the enzyme reaction, needed to be addressed.In this report, we demonstrate the purified BC plus BCCP complex for the first time. The BC·BCCP complex has been purified by avidin plus immobilized nickel affinity chromatographic steps. Our data show that the molar ratio of BC to BCCP in the intact complex is 1:2 rather than the 2BCCP·2BC complex previously supposed. We also have identified the domain of BCCP required to form the BC·BCCP complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—ImmunoPure Immobilized Monomeric Avidin resin, Immobilized NeutrAvidin from Pierce, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) were used for column chromatography.

Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cut with EcoRI plus BamHI and ligated to plasmid pQE-60 from Qiagen cut with the same enzymes to give pER2. pER2 was then cut with EcoRI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase plus the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates to blunt the ends, followed by cutting with BamHI to obtain a 3.6-kb fragment containing the accB (encoding BCCP) and accC (encoding BC) genes. This fragment was ligated to pET-14b from Novagen, which had been cut with XbaI treated with DNA polymerase as above, and then digested with BamHI. This gave pER18, the plasmid used in the radioactive labeling experiments. The accC gene was amplified by PCR using pER18 as a template with primers BC-1 and BC-2 (Table I) and subcloned into pCR-2.1 from Invitrogen, resulting in pER23. Plasmid pER23 was cut with SacII plus BamHI and ligated to pER18 cut with the same enzymes to obtain plasmid pER24, which has a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of AccC. Two complementary oligonucleotides, BC-N-his-F and BC-N-his-R (Table I), were combined in ligase buffer, heated to 100 °C, and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature to anneal the single strands to give a double-stranded oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide was ligated to pER24 cut with AgeI and SacII (the oligonucleotide cassette was designed such that complementary ends would result upon annealing) to obtain pER27, in which the hexahistidine tag was added to the N terminus of AccC.Construction of Plasmids for Deletion Analysis—Plasmid pER2 was amplified with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase from Stratagene using two specially designed primers to construct deletion mutants of BCCP, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for each construct are given in Table I. The odd-numbered oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and ATP before use. Each PCR reaction was treated with DpnI to digest the template DNA, circularized by ligation, and transformed into strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen). The constructs were first analyzed by colony PCR to screen for the 12-bp deletions. Strains carrying those constructs showing the expected deletions were then induced with IPTG to allow assay of BC and BCCP expression. The constructs that survived these screens were then confirmed by DNA sequence analysis performed by the Keck Center of the University of Illinois. For the production of BCCP without concomitant overexpression of BC, the plasmids were digested with SacII and then re-circularized by ligation resulting in the removal of the 2-kb accC fragment encoding BC.Expression and Purification of the BC Plus BCCP Complex—Plasmid pCY216 (21Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) carrying the birA gene and plasmid pLS182 carrying the accBC operon were introduced into E. coli strain BMH71-18. Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 2 μm biotin to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 0.5 mm and allowed to proceed for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer A, which consisted of 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol for the avidin column. For the nickel chelate column lysis buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) was used. The cells were lysed by sonication. Monomeric avidin resin was treated according to manufacturer's instructions to block the “nonreversible” biotin binding sites and then added to the extract and incubated overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation. After washing with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A, the BC plus BCCP complex was eluted by incubating with 2 mm biotin in lysis buffer A at room temperature for 4 h. For deletion analysis of the BCCP N terminus, each plasmid encoding a deletion construct was introduced together with pCY216 into TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) for expression of BC and BCCP proteins. Complex formation was assayed by passage through a NeutrAvidin column (Pierce Chemical Co). When NeutrAvidin was used, the incubation period was shortened to 1 h, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 1% Nonidet P-40 in lysis buffer, and elution was accomplished by boiling the resin in SDS sample buffer. For the consecutive column purification protocol the nickel-chelateagarose was added to the extract and incubated 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing the resin with 10 volumes of 25 mm imidazole in lysis buffer B, the protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The eluate was concentrated with a Centrifugal Filter unit (Millipore) having a 5000 molecular weight cut-off. Buffer A was then added, and this solution was incubated with either monomeric avidin resin or NeutrAvidin resin, and the complex was purified as described above.Expression and Purification of the l-[35S]Methionine-labeled BC·BCCP Complex—E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS from Novagen carrying pER27 and pCY216 was grown in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 2 μm biotin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG followed by incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then 0.2 μg/ml rifampicin and l-[35S]methionine (3 μCi/ml) were added to the culture followed by incubation for another 30 min. The cells were then harvested, and the BC·BCCP complex was purified with the nickel chelate column and/or NeutrAvidin column as described above.Expression and Purification of d-[8,9-3H]Biotin-labeled BCCPs— E. coli strain TOP10F′ from Invitrogen carrying accB plasmids encoding the WT, Δ4, and Δ7 BCCPs plus pCY216 were grown in Rich Broth (RB) media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100 nm biotin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. The cells were harvested and resuspended in RB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, d-[8,9-3H]biotin (2 μCi/ml), and 0.5 mm IPTG. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 2 μm biotin was added to the culture and growth was continued for 2 more h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, and the BCCP proteins were purified with monomeric avidin resin as described above. After concentrated to 50 μl with a Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore) having a 5000 molecular weight cut off, the eluates were mixed with hemoglobin, and cytochrome c (both from Sigma) as molecular weight standards each was applied to a column (1 × 33 cm) of Sephadex G-75 equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 0.15 m NaCl. The flow rate was ∼7 ml/h, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for radioactivity using LS 6500 Multi-Purpose Scintillation Counter from Beckman Coulter. It should be noted that much of the biotinylated protein was lost before the gel filtration step presumably due to aggregation (1Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification of the BC·BCCP Complex—It should be noted that, although E. coli BCCP is a protein of 16.7 kDa, it migrates as a protein of ∼22 kDa in the standard Tris-glycine SDS electrophoresis system. This anomalous migration has been attributed to the long proline plus alanine-rich linker that lies between residues 34 and 101 (17Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, small alterations of the linker have been shown to markedly alter the electrophoretic mobility of BCCP (18Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22520-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, BC has an electrophoretic mobility consistent with its molecular mass of 49.4 kDa.The E. coli BCCP and BC proteins were co-expressed from the accBC operon of plasmid pLS182 (17Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the 3.6-kb NsiI-BamHI accBC genomic DNA fragment located downstream of the tac promoter. In this and our other constructs the accB and accC genes retain their native ribosome binding sites, and thus the ratio of protein expression from the two genes should be the same as when the proteins are expressed from the bacterial chromosome. Because BCCP has a natural affinity tag, the biotin moiety, and is the sole biotinylated protein of E. coli (12Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we first chose an avidin column to demonstrate and purify the putative BC·BCCP complex. If BC formed a sufficiently strong complex with BCCP and the BCCP was fully biotinylated, we expected that the complex would bind to an avidin column and hopefully would survive the washing required to elute unbiotinylated cellular proteins. Native tetrameric avidin binds biotin with very high affinity (K d of 10–15m), and thus strongly denaturing conditions are required to elute bound materials. Because such conditions were incompatible with purification of protein complexes, we used monomeric avidin, which binds biotin with a K d of 10–7m thereby allowing reversible binding of biotinylated proteins under mild conditions. Indeed, elution was accomplished with 2 mm biotin, conditions sufficiently mild to protect protein complexes from dissociation. It should be noted that the successful purification of the BC plus BCCP complex with avidin columns depends on the degree of biotinylation of BCCP. To achieve maximum biotinylation we overproduced E. coli biotin protein ligase (BirA) protein (which attaches biotin to lysine 122 of BCCP) in the E. coli strain used for BCCP and BC protein expression. Biotin (2 μm) was added to the growth medium to ensure that excess biotin was available. The level of biotinylated BCCP was essentially quantitative upon overexpression of BirA and biotin supplementation as shown by in vitro assay of cell extracts for residual biotin accepting activity (data not shown).E. coli extracts were incubated with a monomeric avidin resin overnight with gentle agitation, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 mm biotin. This single-step purification procedure was successful in purification of a BC·BCCP complex. Two bands comprising the BC and BCCP proteins were detected in the biotin eluate, and the purity of these proteins was <95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). The purified BC·BCCP complex was also analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. A band of about 160 kDa plus several small protein bands thought to be formed from dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis were observed. Finally, each of the major bands was excised from the native gel and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Under these denaturing conditions the bands were found to contain both BC and BCCP confirming that a BC·BCCP complex had been purified by monomeric avidin column chromatography (data not shown). However, as estimated by staining with Coomassie Blue only about 5–10% of the BC and BCCP proteins were present in the complex, consistent with instability of the complex. Similar results were obtained when proteins biosynthetically labeled with l-[35S]methionine were examined (see below).Fig. 1Expression and purification of BC·BCCP complex through a monomeric avidin column. BC and BCCP were co-expressed in E. coli strain BMH71-18 carrying the accBC plasmid (pLS182) and the birA plasmid (pCY216). The cell extract was purified by elution from a monomeric avidin column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crude extract (lane 1) and the biotin eluate (lane 2) were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The BC, BCCP, and BirA protein bands are indicated. The slight difference in motilities of BC and BCCP is due to the differing protein loads of the two lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stoichiometry of BC and BCCP within the Complex—The accB-accC genomic DNA fragment used for co-expression of the BCCP and BC proteins was placed under control of a phage T7 promoter to allow specific labeling of the proteins. An E. coli strain carrying this construct and a phage T7 RNA polymerase gene was grown until mid-log phase, and IPTG was added to induce T7 RNA polymerase synthesis. After 30 min of incubation rifampicin was added to inhibit E. coli polymerase activity and thereby block all protein synthesis encoded by chromosomal genes. The culture was then labeled with l-[35S]methionine. This protocol was designed such that only those genes transcribed from a T7 promoter (accB and accC) would be expressed during the time that the culture was exposed to l-[35S]methionine (22Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled BC·BCCP complex was then purified through monomeric avidin column, and the eluate was loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel. As shown, in Fig. 2, two bands representing BC and BCCP were detected. The radioactivity of each band was quantitated by use of a phosphorimaging device (Fuji FLA-3000). After correction for the number of methionine residues of the two proteins (14 for BC and 9 for BCCP) the molar ratio of the two proteins was calculated. (Note that the N-terminal methionine residues of both proteins are known to be retained (17Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) We obtained different ratios for the relative amounts of BC and BCCP in the crude extract and in the purified fraction. The ratio of BC to BCCP was 1:2.1 in the crude extract, whereas it was 1:2.8 in the purified fraction. We then analyzed the crude extract by native gel electrophoresis where two major bands were detected: a top band that failed to enter the separating gel and a middle band of about 160 kDa, plus smaller bands (Fig. 2). The top and the middle bands were excised and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The ratio of BC to BCCP was 1:1.95 in the top band, whereas it was 1:3.1 in the middle band. These data suggested that the 1:2 complex was the native species and the 1:3 species was a mixture of breakdown products that had decreased BC content. Therefore, the BC·BCCP complex behaved as an unstable structure, and it seemed that there might be interactions of varying stabilities within the complex.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of BC·BCCP complex labeled with l-[35S]methionine. A, BC and BCCP were co-expressed and labeled with l-[35S]methionine in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying pER18 and pCY216 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by electrophoresis by 7.5% native PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to the x-ray film overnight. B, the next day bands 1–3 from the gel of A were excised and rehydrated in SDS loading buffer, and the gel slices were inserted into the wells of a 12% SDS-PAGE. (The proteins were eluted from the gel slice. They were then stacked in the stacking gels and separated as usual.) The SDS-PAGE gel was then dried and analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (Fuji FLA-3000). Lane 1 is the crude extract, which had a BC to BCCP molar ratio of 1:2.1. Lane 2 is band 1 from the native gel, which had a BC to BCCP molar ratio of 1:1.95, essentially the same BC to BCCP ratio as the crude extract. Lane 3 is band 2 from the native gel"

In this study we demonstrate the anti-mitogenic, pro-apoptotic role of the zinc finger transcription factor Sp1 in vascular SMCs and define the underlying molecular mechanism via its capacity to repress the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 at the level of transcription, mRNA, and protein. SMC proliferation inducible by a dominant-negative mutant form of Sp1 was abrogated by antisense strategies targeting p21WAF1/Cip1. Conversely, antisense p21WAF1/Cip1 induced apoptosis in SMCs overexpressing dominant-negative-Sp1. p21WAF1/Cip1 overexpression alone stimulated proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Sp1 down-regulated p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in SMCs. Sp1 blocked assembly of cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation whose integrity is critical for G1->S transition. Moreover, Rb phosphorylation, which lies immediately downstream of the cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex, was blocked either by Sp1 overexpression or antisense p21WAF1/Cip1.

A permissive role for p21WAF1/Cip1 in cell cycle progression has emerged via its capacity to cooperate with cyclin D-dependent kinases (11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

In this study, we demonstrate that the anti-mitogenic, pro-apoptotic influence of Sp1 in vascular SMCs is mediated via its capacity to repress the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 at the level of transcription, mRNA, and protein. Sp1 inhibition of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression blocks assembly of cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation whose integrity is critical for G1->S transition, and Rb phosphorylation, which lies immediately downstream of this complex. Sp1 repression of p21WAF1/Cip1 and its effects on complex assembly and cell phenotype have not previously been described. Cell Culture and Transfections—WKY12–22 SMCs, WKY3M-22 SMCs, and primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were maintained in Waymouth's medium (Invitrogen), pH 7.4, and bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with penicillin 10 units/ml, streptomycin 10 μg/ml, 1 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed at 60% confluency together with indicated constructs using FuGENE6 transfection agent (Roche Applied Science). For luciferase assays, 1 μg of the internal control plasmid, pRL-TK, was used. Luciferase activity was quantified 24 h after transfection using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega), and activity was normalized with data generated from pRL-TK. For antisense (AS) and scrambled (SCR) p21WAF1/Cip1 treatment, cells were starved 6 h in serum-free medium prior to initial transfection. The cells were allowed to arrest for a further 18 h. The following day, a second transfection with AS/SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 was performed in media with 5% fetal bovine serum. For Western analysis, cells were harvested 24 h after the second transfection. AS p21WAF1/Cip1 sequence is as follows: 5′-GACATCACCAGGATCGGACAT-3′ (17Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 sequence is as follows: 5′-AAGCGTACTACGCTAGCACGA-3′. Plasmids—0-Luc was kindly provided by Dr. Wafik El-Deiry (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania). pEBGNLS and pEBGSp1 were obtained from Gerald Thiel (Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne), CMV-Sp1 was obtained from Robert Tjian (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles). pCEP-WAF1 was obtained from Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). pCEP was generated by restriction enzyme digest (NotI) of pCEP-WAF1. Proliferation and BrdUrd Incorporation Assays—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized prior to seeding into 6-well titer plates. Transfections were conducted at ∼40% confluence with indicated constructs and at various time points. Cells were lifted and total cell counts were performed using a Coulter counter. For AS proliferation assays, 3000 cells/well of RASMC or bovine aortic endothelial cells were used. At ∼30–40% confluence, cells were serum-deprived for 6 h prior to initial transfection with indicated concentrations of AS p21WAF1/Cip1 and SCR p21WAF1/Cip1. Eighteen hours later, a second transfection was performed in 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were counted after 72 h of treatment. For BrdUrd incorporation studies, we used the cell proliferation ELISA system Version 2 (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to SMCs for 6 h prior to harvest at 24 h. Cells were fixed, incubated with anti-BrdUrd for 90 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Immune complexes were detected by subsequent substrate reaction and A450. The absorbance rate correlates directly with DNA synthesis. Western Blot Analysis—RASMCs were transfected with indicated constructs for 24 h prior to harvest. Cells were lysed and freeze-thawed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) together with protease inhibitors (1% aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were resolved by 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. p21WAF1/Cip1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1: 500), Sp1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000), cyclin D1 was detected with a mouse polyclonal antibody (1:500; BD Phar-Mingen), Cdk4 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, and YY1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Unless indicated, all antibodies used were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation Studies—RASMCs were transfected with indicated overexpression constructs for 24 h. Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer and incubated with prewashed protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h, prior to incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Prewashed Sepharose beads were further incubated with lysate/antibody mixture for 1–2 h. Beads were washed twice in 200 mm NaCl/1× RIPA, followed by a final wash in 1× RIPA. Proteins were resolved by 12–15% SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. Cdk2 Kinase Assay—SMCs transfected with pCEP, pCEP-WAF1 (20 μg), or treatment with etoposide (10 μm) for 6 h were harvested for total protein using RIPA. Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to Cdk2 (Cell Signaling) as described above. The final wash was performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl, with 40 μl of beads (+ kinase buffer), 30 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μg of Histone 1 (Sigma). The reaction proceeded at 30 °C for 30 min and was inactivated by boiling for 5 min following addition of loading buffer. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Quantitative Assessment of Apoptosis—The cell detection ELISAPLUS was used to quantify levels of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. Briefly, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min at 22 °C in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were transferred into fresh Eppendorf tubes, and 20 μl of the supernatant was used in the ELISA. Following substrate addition, a colorimetric change was detected and absorbance values were assessed at A490. Absorbance values were normalized to total cell number for each cohort measured using a Coulter counter. Results are expressed as total DNA fragmentation (absorbance) as a proportion of the total cell population. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from WKY12–22 and WKY3M-22 SMC using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using 5 μg of total RNA and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) together with oligo(dT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of the primers for rat p21WAF1/Cip1 are as follows: Frp21, 5′-CCAGGAGGCCCGAGAACGG-3′, and Rrp21, 5′-CGAGGGGAGGGGCAGGC-3′. The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are: forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 1 unit of platinum Taq, 1 μl of cDNA, and 5 μm p21WAF1/Cip1 and GAPDH primers using a PerkinElmer thermocycler. Amplification was performed by denaturing the sample at 94 °C for 30 s, then cycling at 91 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and an extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The number of PCR cycles for p21WAF1/Cip1 amplification was 30. Following amplification, the reaction was visualized on 1.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining. DN-Sp1 Inhibits Apoptosis and Stimulates Vascular SMC Proliferation—Overexpression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of Sp1, pEBGSp1 (18Petersohn D. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) bearing the DNA-binding but not the transactivation domain of Sp1 (amino acids 592–758), decreased levels of apoptosis (cytoplasmic histone-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation) 24 h after transfection in primary vascular SMCs relative to the corresponding backbone control, pEBGNLS (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with our previous demonstration that overexpression of wild-type Sp1 stimulates apoptosis in SMCs (2Kavurma M.M. Santiago F.S. Bonfoco E. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4964-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To correlate these data with SMC proliferation, we transfected SMCs with pEBGSp1 or pEBGNLS and quantitated cell numbers in each cohort after 24 and 48 h. Fig. 1B (left panel) demonstrates that DN-Sp1 doubled the rate of SMC proliferation compared with the empty expression vector after 24 h and tripled SMC growth after 48 h. Increased proliferation upon overexpression of DN-Sp1 after 24 h was also evident in BrdUrd incorporation studies (Fig. 1B, right panel). Fluorescence microscopy of cells transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven GFP expression plasmid (pEGFP-C1) revealed that 72.9 ± 4.0% of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-hydrochloride positive (DAPI+) SMCs transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 expressed GFP after 12 h (data not shown). These data suggest a dual role for Sp1 as an inhibitor of proliferation and an inducer of apoptosis. Sp1 Down-regulates p21WAF1 / Cip1 Transcription, mRNA, and Protein in SMCs—We initially hypothesized that the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of Sp1 might be related to its capacity to up-regulate the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1, which can induce cell cycle arrest (reviewed in Refs. 3Arellano M. Moreno S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 6Vidal A. Koff A. Gene. 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been shown to positively regulate p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression in numerous other cell types (7Koutsodontis G. Tentes I. Papakosta P. Moustakas A. Kardassis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2911-2925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 9575-9580Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We first compared spontaneous p21WAF1/Cip1 expression between two phenotypically distinct SMC subtypes previously shown by our group to differentially express Sp1 (19Rafty L. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Basal Sp1 levels are greater in WKY12–22 cells (derived originally from the aortae of pup rats) compared with those in WKY3M-22 cells (derived from adult rats). We expected, therefore, that p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA expression would be higher in the WKY12–22 SMC sub-type. Fig. 2 illustrates, however, that p21WAF1/Cip1 transcript levels are greater in WKY3M-22 cells. Based on these unexpected observations, we next investigated the direct influence of Sp1 on p21WAF1/Cip1. We performed transient transfection analysis in SMCs using construct 0-Luc, a firefly luciferase-based reporter vector driven by 2.3 kb of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (20Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of 0-Luc with cytomegalovirus-driven Sp1 repressed p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-dependent luciferase expression within 24 h in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Sp1 up-regulated p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity in vascular ECs (Fig. 3A). Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that cytomegalovirus-driven Sp1 abrogated endogenous p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA expression compared with pcDNA3, the backbone control (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis provided confirmatory evidence that Sp1 can repress p21WAF1/Cip1 expression without affecting levels of β-actin (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Conversely, overexpression of DN-Sp1 (pEBGSp1) induced p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Time course analysis revealed that exogenous Sp1 is expressed within 6 h following transfection (Fig. 3D). In contrast, there was no increase in levels of the zinc finger protein YY1 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time negative regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression by Sp1. p21WAF1 / Cip1 Stimulates Proliferation in SMCs—The preceding results revealed, first, that Sp1 has opposite and complementary effects on proliferation and apoptosis and, second, that Sp1 represses rather than activates p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in SMCs. This led us to investigate the permissive role of p21WAF1/Cip1 on proliferation and its inhibitory role in apoptosis. SMCs were transiently transfected with the p21WAF1/Cip1 expression vector, pCEP-WAF1, or its backbone control, pCEP, for 24 h. Fig. 4A demonstrates that p21WAF1/Cip1 reduced levels of histone-associated DNA fragmentation at a concentration of 0.75 μg. Conversely, the same concentration of p21WAF1/Cip1 stimulated both total cell counts and BrdUrd incorporation after 24 h (Fig. 4B, left and right panels, respectively). Western blot analysis confirmed the generation of p21WAF1/Cip1 from pCEP-WAF1 within 12 h of transfection (Fig. 4C). Antisense oligonucleotides targeting p21WAF1/Cip1 (AS p21WAF1/Cip1) blocked serum-inducible SMC proliferation compared with the scrambled (SCR p21WAF1/Cip1) or sense (SEN p21WAF1/Cip1) counterparts in a dose-dependent manner (0.1–0.8 μm, Fig. 5A). In addition, serum-inducible p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression was completely inhibited by AS p21WAF1/Cip1 but not by SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 at 0.8 μm (Fig. 5B), consistent with our previous observation that AS p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibits Ets-1-induced proliferation of SMCs (21Zhang C. Kavurma M.M. Lai A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), indicating a pro-mitogenic role for p21WAF1/Cip1 in SMCs.Fig. 5AS p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibits serum-inducible SMC proliferation. A, antisense (AS) p21WAF1/Cip1 treatment inhibits SMC proliferation stimulated by serum. SCR (scrambled) p21WAF1/Cip1 has no effect on serum-stimulated SMC proliferation. A Coulter counter was used to count total cell numbers. B, AS p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibits serum-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression. SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 has no effect on p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression. Oligonucleotides were used at 0.8 μm. Actin expression demonstrates unbiased loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p21WAF1 / Cip1 Rescues SMC from Influence of Sp1 on Apoptosis and Proliferation—We next explored the fidelity of the Sp1/p21WAF1/Cip1 system on apoptosis and proliferation. SMCs were co-transfected with both CMV-Sp1 and pCEP-WAF1 in efforts to reverse the pro-apoptotic effect of Sp1. Sp1 induced apoptosis within 24 h (Fig. 6A), as previously observed (2Kavurma M.M. Santiago F.S. Bonfoco E. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4964-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic effect of Sp1 was abolished by the presence of p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 6A). Greater amounts of p21WAF1/Cip1 in the presence of a fixed amount of Sp1 inhibited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). In support of these data, SMC proliferation stimulated by DN-Sp1 was virtually abolished by treatment with AS p21WAF1/Cip1, whereas DN-Sp1-induced growth was not affected by SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 6B, left panel). Conversely, DN-Sp1 inhibition of apoptosis was reversed by AS p21WAF1/Cip1 but not by SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 6B, right panel). These results demonstrate that p21WAF1/Cip1 stimulation of cell cycle progression can be inhibited by Sp1 via its capacity to repress p21WAF1/Cip1. Because in ECs Sp1 activates p21WAF1/Cip1, we next assessed the effect of Sp1 on EC growth. Sp1 overexpression in these cells increased, rather than decreased, EC proliferation after 24 h (Fig. 6C). This positive effect of Sp1 on proliferation was inhibited by AS p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 6C) p21WAF1 / Cip1 Overexpression Inhibits Cdk2 Kinase Activity— Cell cycle progression requires the assembly of higher order complexes consisting of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p21WAF1/Cip1. Once assembled, cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 can phosphorylate Rb. This is followed by cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, which complete Rb phosphorylation late in G1, thereby facilitating the increased expression of genes involved in cellular growth (reviewed in Ref. 11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5069) Google Scholar). p21WAF1/Cip1 levels can influence whether a cell undergoes proliferation or arrest. For example, low levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 are required for cyclin D-Cdk4 complex assembly and subsequent Rb phosphorylation (12LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In contrast, high p21WAF1/Cip1 levels can inhibit the formation of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, inhibiting Rb phosphorylation, which can result in cycle arrest (12LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 achieved upon p21WAF1/Cip1 overexpression in our system were lower than those produced upon DNA damage, which can induce growth arrest. We used etoposide, an agent well known to inhibit cell cycle progression and induce levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 (22Tang D. Wu D. Hirao A. Lahti J.M. Liu L. Mazza B. Kidd V.J. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). SMCs treated with etoposide strongly induced p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression relative to levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 generated by pCEP-WAF1 (Fig. 7A). Since high levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 may not completely sequester cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes and in turn may bind and inactivate cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes to induce cell cycle arrest, we assessed the effect of either etoposide or p21WAF1/Cip1 overexpression on Cdk2 kinase activity. Etoposide failed to activate the kinase (Fig. 7B). In contrast, p21WAF1/Cip1 overexpression increased Cdk2 activity (Fig. 7B). These findings demonstrate that plasmid-based expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 generated moderate levels of p21WAF1/Cip1, consistent with the positive effect of p21WAF1/Cip1 on proliferation. p21WAF1 / Cip1 Promotes Rb Phosphorylation by Facilitating the Assembly of a p21WAF1 / Cip1-Cyclin D1-Cdk4 Complex in an Sp1-dependent Manner—Protein:protein interactions between cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can facilitate G1->S phase transition (reviewed in Ref. 11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5069) Google Scholar), with p21WAF1/Cip1 serving as a third component in this complex (12LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 14Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Because our data demonstrate that Sp1 down-regulates p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription, mRNA, and protein expression, we hypothesized that Sp1 inhibition of cell growth may be due to the disruption of the assembly of the cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex. To address this, we performed a series of pull-down experiments with Cdk4 antibodies followed by immunoblotting for either p21WAF1/Cip1 or cyclin D1. Serum augmented cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation. Assembly of this complex, however, was completely abrogated by AS p21WAF1/Cip1, but not by SCR p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 8A). In complementary experiments, cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation was abolished upon Sp1 overexpression (which inhibits p21 WAF1/Cip1) (Fig. 8B). Immediately downstream of the cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex lies the tumor suppressor and cyclin D-Cdk complex substrate Rb (15Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J.-Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 16Pan W. Cox S. Hoess R.H. Grafstrom R.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2885-2891PubMed Google Scholar) whose phosphorylation status performs a gatekeeper role in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation renders Rb inactive as a transcriptional repressor, thereby facilitating the activation of genes required for cell cycle progression (reviewed in Ref. 5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Sp1 on Rb phosphorylation using antibodies uniquely recognizing the phosphorylated (Ser249/Thr252) form of Rb. Serum, as expected, increased Rb phosphorylation in SMCs (Fig. 8C). AS p21WAF1/Cip1 abrogated this effect. SCR p21WAF1/Cip1, on the other hand, had no influence on levels of phospho-Rb (Fig. 8C). Sp1, which suppresses p21WAF1/Cip1 expression, but not the backbone control, also blocked Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 8C). These results, taken together, demonstrate that Sp1 represses p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription and inhibits SMC growth by blocking assembly of cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation. Using complementary approaches, the present study demonstrates the anti-mitogenic, pro-apoptotic role of the zinc finger transcription factor Sp1 in SMCs by repressing the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 at the level of transcription, mRNA, and protein. We show that Sp1 suppression of p21WAF1/Cip1 blocks cyclin D1-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex formation and prevents phosphorylation of the checkpoint tumor suppressor Rb. p21WAF1/Cip1 induction of cell proliferation is also blocked by Sp1 (which down-regulates p21WAF1/Cip1) and by gene-specific targeting strategies that reduce levels of p21WAF1/Cip1. Conversely, dominant-negative Sp1 up-regulated p21WAF1/Cip1 expression, stimulated proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis. These findings have particular significance in light of the traditional view of p21WAF1/Cip1 as a cell cycle inhibitor. Other multiple studies that have demonstrated the positive influence of Sp1 on p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression in non-SMC types (reviewed in Ref. 23Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) include tumor cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes (10Santini M.P. Talora C. Seki T. Bolgan L. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and in the present study, vascular endothelial cells. Here, we have demonstrated for the first time the repressive effect of Sp1 on p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in SMCs. The cyclin D-Cdk4-p21WAF1/Cip1 complex is ubiquitous between cell types, and it is well established that p21WAF1/Cip1 promotes assembly of this complex. It is therefore highly unlikely that the cell type-specific growth regulatory effects of p21WAF1/Cip1 are mediated at the level of this complex. We assert, however, that it is the effect of Sp1 on levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 that influences cell phenotype. Low levels of p21WAF1/Cip1, which occur in SMCs when Sp1 is overexpressed, perturb complex formation, block Rb phosphorylation and cell proliferation, and stimulate apoptosis. Overexpression of Sp1 in ECs activates p21WAF1/Cip1 and stimulates EC proliferation. Moreover, Sp1-inducible EC growth is p21WAF1/Cip1-dependent. This contrasts with the effects of Sp1 in SMCs, where p21WAF1/Cip1 rescues these cells from apoptosis induced by Sp1 and AS p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibits DN-Sp1-inducible proliferation. Thus, the influence of p21WAF1/Cip1 on phenotype is governed by its differential regulation by Sp1 in the two cell types. p21WAF1/Cip1 was cloned independently by two laboratories in 1993 using different screening strategies, first as a CDK-binding protein by two-hybrid analysis (thus Cip1 for CDK-interacting protein-1) (27Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5198) Google Scholar), then as a gene activated by wild-type p53 (hence WAF1 for wild type p53-activated factor) (4El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

The present study demonstrates that p21WAF1/Cip1 is negatively regulated by Sp1 and stimulates proliferation. Although still somewhat controversial, a pro-mitogenic role for this CKI is suggested by several lines of evidence. For example, mice deficient in p21WAF1/Cip1 develop normally with no evidence of tumor growth (28Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). p21WAF1/Cip1 expression is induced by mitogenic stimuli (29Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Mandigo C.E. Miglarese M.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2489-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a finding that supports our present demonstration of increased p21WAF1/Cip1 expression and complex formation in SMCs by serum. Moreover, p21WAF1/Cip1 activates certain growth factor genes (30Chang B.-D. Watanabe K. Broude E.V. Fang J.J. Poole J.C. Kalinichenko T.V. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The positive or negative regulatory effect of p21WAF1/Cip1 on the cell cycle is also dependent upon stable interactions between cyclins and Cdks (12LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F.

G1->S transition is compromised by low levels of p21WAF1/Cip1 (wherein the complex fails to form) or, indeed, high levels of the CKI (wherein the complex forms but p21WAF1/Cip1 is not fully sequestered). The present study shows that Sp1, like AS p21WAF1/Cip1, blocks p21WAF1/Cip1 expression, complex formation, and Rb phosphorylation. Previous studies that have demonstrated p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibition of SMC growth have been confined to adenoviral delivery of the exogenous transgene into the balloon-injured rat artery wall (31Chang M.W. Barr E. Lu M.M. Barton K. Leiden J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It is likely that in this system, excess (unsequestered) p21WAF1/Cip1 levels blocked Cdk2 activity. That excessive SMC proliferation is involved in many common vascular occlusive disorders, including atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis, implies a therapeutic application of high p21WAF1/Cip1 expression levels. However, our present demonstration of a mitogenic role for p21WAF1/Cip1 in a moderate overexpression (transient transfection) system suggests that the therapeutic application of exogenous p21WAF1/Cip1 needs to proceed with caution, given its threshold influence on cell cycle progression.

https://openalex.org/W2154007637,"We previously reported that exogenously added human group V phospholipase A2 (hVPLA2) could elicit leukotriene B4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils through the activation of group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Kim, Y. J., Kim, K. P., Han, S. K., Munoz, N. M., Zhu, X., Sano, H., Leff, A. R., and Cho, W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 36479-36488). In this study, we determined the functional significance and mechanism of the exogenous hVPLA2-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthesis in isolated human peripheral blood eosinophils. As low a concentration as 10 nm exogenous hVPLA2 was able to elicit the significant release of AA and LTC4 from unstimulated eosinophils, which depended on its ability to act on phosphatidylcholine membranes. hVPLA2 also augmented the release of AA and LTC4 from eosinophils activated with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe + cytochalasin B. A cellular fluorescent PLA2 assay showed that hVPLA2 had a lipolytic action first on the outer plasma membrane and then on the perinuclear region. hVPLA2 also caused the translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane and a 2-fold increase in 5-lipoxygenase activity. However, hVPLA2 induced neither the increase in intracellular calcium concentration nor cPLA2 phosphorylation; consequently, cPLA2 activity was not affected by hVPLA2. Pharmacological inhibition of cPLA2 and the hVPLA2-induced activation of eosinophils derived from the cPLA2-deficient mouse corroborated that hVPLA2 mediates the release of AA and leukotriene in a cPLA2-independent manner. As such, this study represents a unique example in which a secretory phospholipase induces the eicosanoid formation in inflammatory cells, completely independent of cPLA2 activation. We previously reported that exogenously added human group V phospholipase A2 (hVPLA2) could elicit leukotriene B4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils through the activation of group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Kim, Y.

For example, it was recently reported that exogenously added human group V PLA2 (hVPLA2) could elicit the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from human neutrophils by activating cPLA2 via an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cPLA2 phosphorylation (13Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Kim Y.J. Kim K.P.

As part of our continuing effort to understand the physiological functions and regulation of sPLA2s, we investigated the effects of exogenously added hVPLA2 on the activation of human eosinophils. Eosinophils play a key role in airway inflammation and hypersensitivity. Prior investigations have indicated that cPLA2 is critically involved in the biosynthesis of bronchoactive eicosanoids, eosinophil infiltration, and airway hyperresponsiveness (15Zhu X. Sano H.

This study was undertaken to investigate the role of hVPLA2 in effecting the biosynthesis of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), a highly potent bronchoactive eicosanoid, in human eosinophils. Results indicate that hVPLA2 induces the LTC4 biosynthesis in intact and primed human eosinophils by a novel cPLA2-independent mechanism. Materials—Arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antibodies directed against cPLA2, ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). The Ser505-phosphorylated cPLA2-specific antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). 1-Stearoyl-2-[14C]-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and [3H]AA were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

The purity of enzymes assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis was consistently higher than 90%. Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Eosinophils—Mildly atopic, nonsmoking donors were recruited for eosinophil donation. Atopy was defined by criteria used in the University of Chicago Asthma Research Center for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Human Cooperative Asthma Genetics Project (22Leff A.R.

Donors demonstrating >1.5% peripheral blood eosinophils (PBE) were used in this study. PBE were isolated by the negative immunomagnetic selection technique as previously described (15Zhu X. Sano H.

The purity of cells was assessed by differential cell counts from a Wright-Giemsa air-dried smear, and viability of cells was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion analysis. Isolation of Eosinophils from Murine Bone Marrow—Bone marrow cells from femurs of mice were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml interleukin-5, and 5 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. Refeeding was performed by the addition of the same medium in the absence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor at days 3, 6, and 8. Matured eosinophils were harvested at day 13, and cultured cells were activated with buffer control, 100 nm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) plus 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B (CB), or 100 nm hVPLA2. Measurement of sPLA 2 by Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Purified hVPLA2 was used as the standard protein. Microplate wells were coated with equivalent concentrations of MCL-1B7 and MCL-2A5 (2.5 μg/ml each) (23Munoz N.M. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Kim K.P. Meliton A.Y. Zhu X. Lambertino A. Cho W.

The samples were added to the microplates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 0.5 μg/ml of biotinylated MCL-3G1 (23Munoz N.M.

After washing with deionized water and three times with PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, extravidin was added onto the wells and incubated for additional 60 min. Again, the treated wells were washed with PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 followed by the addition of 50 μl of p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a Thermomax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Protein quantitation was performed as described (23Munoz N.M. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Kim K.P. Meliton A.Y. Zhu X. Lambertino A. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 262: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All of the assays were performed in duplicate, and the amounts of protein are expressed in pg/106 cells. Measurement of AA, LTB 4 , and LTC 4 Release—Isolated PBE (106 cells/group) were labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]AA overnight at 37 °C. The unincorporated AA was washed three times with the Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Radiolabeled cells (106) were resuspended in 90 μl of the same buffer, preincubated with a selected inhibitor for 30 min at 37 °C if necessary (and washed three times with the same buffer to remove the residual inhibitor), and then stimulated with hVPLA2, hVPLA2/W31A, hVPLA2/R100E/K101E, or hIIaPLA2. As a positive control, PBE were also activated with 100 nm fMLP and 5 μg/ml CB. The reaction was quenched by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet and the supernatant was separately measured by a two-channel liquid scintillation counter. LTB4 and LTC4 levels (pg/106 cells) in the supernatant were determined using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Measurement of Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP Kinase and cPLA 2 by Immunoblotting Analysis—To determine whether the hVPLA2-induced LTC4 secretion is mediated via ERK1/2 MAP kinase and subsequent cPLA2 phosphorylation, PBE were stimulated with 100 nm hVPLA2 for different periods, and the phosphorylation was monitored as follows. Treated cells were lysed in a cell disruption buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors tablet) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclear and cellular debris (15Zhu X. Sano H. Kim K.P. Sano A. Boetticher E. Munoz N.M. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The prepared samples were loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel for ERK1/2 MAP kinase and a 7.5% gel for cPLA2, and the electrophoresis was run under reducing conditions as described previously (15Zhu X. Sano H. Kim K.P. Sano A. Boetticher E. Munoz N.M. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Western blot was probed with the antibodies specific for ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and Ser505-phosphorylated cPLA2, respectively, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of cPLA 2 Activity—PBE (2 × 106 cells/group) were incubated with the HBSS control, 100 nm hVPLA2, or 100 nm fMLP with 5 μg/ml CB for 20 min at 37 °C. The stimulation was quenched by adding 1 ml of ice-cold water, and the cell mixture was centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm of Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated briefly. The resulting cell lysate was pretreated with 10 μl of dithiothreitol (final concentration, 10 mm) on ice for 5 min to inactivate sPLA2, and 10 μl of 1 mm CaCl2 (final concentration, 0.1 mm) was then added to each sample. The cPLA2 substrate solution was prepared by drying chloroform solution of [14C]1-strearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine solution under a stream of N2 and suspending the film in 100 μl of 10% aqueous ethanol by vortexing. The reaction was initiated by adding a 10-μl portion of the substrate solution (final concentration, 9 μm) to each cell lysate. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and was quenched by adding 560 μl of Dole's reagent (heptane, 2-propanol, and 1 n H2SO4 (400:390:10, v/v/v)), followed by the addition of 110 μl of H2O, and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g. The 180 μl of upper layer was transferred to 800 μl of hexane mixed with 25 mg of silica gel. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged, 800 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of scintillation fluids, and then the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The cPLA2 activity was expressed in terms of pmol AA/min/106 cells. Measurement of 5-LO Activity—The 5-LO activity in PBE lysate (from 2 × 106 cells; see above) was measured as described previously (25Coffey M.J. Phare S.M. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3592-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Brock T.G. Anderson J.A. Fries F.P. Peters-Golden M. Sporn P.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1669-1676PubMed Google Scholar). The relative 5-LO activity was then expressed in terms of the percentage of increase over the control (unstimulated) value. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i )—Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester as indicator. PBE (107 cells/ml) were incubated in HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 μm Fluo-4 for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were seeded into each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass filled with 400 μl of HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+ and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10 min. After washing once with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 100 nm hVPLA2 (or 10 μm ionomycin as a positive control and the buffer as a negative control) was added, and the fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4 was monitored with a 488-nm Argon/Krypton laser and a 530-nm line pass filter. A 63× (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all of the experiments. The images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. [Ca2+]i was calibrated as described previously using the reported calcium dissociation constant value (i.e. 345 nm) of Fluo-4 (27Gee K.R. Brown K.A. Chen W.N. Bishop-Stewart J. Gray D. Johnson I. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In Vivo Assay of hVPLA 2 Activity—The cellular PLA2 assay was performed as described previously (28Kim Y.J. Kim K.P.

Briefly, PBE (106 cells/ml) were seeded into each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass filled with 400 μl of HBSS and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10 min. After the cells were washed once with HBSS, they were overlaid with 10 μl of PED6 vesicle solution (0.75 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine/cholesterol/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol/PED6 (107:31:20:1 in mole ratio) mixed vesicles in HBSS) and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After rinsing the labeled cells six times with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, hVPLA2 was added to cells. Imaging was done with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate the background autofluorescence. The BODIPY™ signal from the hydrolyzed PED6 was visualized with a 488-nm argon/krypton laser and a 530-nm band pass filter. A 63× (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all of the experiments. The images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Immunocytostaining—Cytoslides of treated cells were prepared and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in PBS. After three washes with PBS, the fixed cells were blocked sequentially with 2% bovine serum albumin and permeabilized with 1% saponin in PBS for 1 h. For 5-LO, the 5-LO antibody was added to samples, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and then further incubated with fluorescein goat anti-rabbit immunoglobin G for another 60 min. After six washes with PBS, the treated cells were covered with glass slips using Perma Fluor, and the 5-LO signal was visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscopy. For cPLA2, the prepared slides were stained with the cPLA2-specific antibody and processed using the Vecstatin ABC kit (VECTOR Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The color reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were examined by light microscopy to determine the localization of cPLA2. Data Analysis—The Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. for each group. Individual statistical comparisons of paired data were assessed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Where multiple comparisons were made, differences among the populations were evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction. Release of AA and LTC 4 by Exogenous hVPLA 2 in Eosinophils—It has been shown that human eosinophils contain cPLA2 (29Zhu X. Munoz N.M. Rubio N. Herrnreiter A. Mayer D. Douglas I. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and hIIaPLA2 (30Blom M. Tool A.T. Wever P.C. Wolbink G.J. Brouwer M.C. Calafat J. Egesten A. Knol E.F. Hack C.E. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 3037-3043PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether other forms of sPLA2s are present in eosinophils. We thus measured the cellular content of endogenous hVPLA2 in PBE activated with fMLP (100 nm)/CB (5 μg/ml) by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hVPLA2 (23Munoz N.M. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Kim K.P. Meliton A.Y. Zhu X. Lambertino A. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 262: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). hVPLA2 was detected neither in resting PBE nor in fMLP/CB-activated PBE for 2 h after stimulation. The lack of hVPLA2 was not due to proteolytic degradation of hVPLA2, because the amount of exogenous hVPLA2 added to the cell lysates of eosinophils (data not shown) and other cells (23Munoz N.M. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Kim K.P. Meliton A.Y. Zhu X. Lambertino A. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 262: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) could be accurately determined. Estimated from the sensitivity limit of our sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (23Munoz N.M. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Kim K.P. Meliton A.Y. Zhu X. Lambertino A. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 262: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), hVPLA2 should exist in less than 2 ng/106 PBE cells. Because PBEs lack endogenous hVPLA2, we measured the effect of exogenously added hVPLA2 on PBE. First, we measured the release of [3H]AA from intact PBE treated with hVPLA2. The exogenous hVPLA2 caused time-dependent (Fig. 1A) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B) release of AA. The AA release caused by 100 nm hVPLA2 was twice greater than the background (p < 0.02) at 15 min and gradually decreased (Fig. 1A). The AA release was significantly greater than the background with ≥10 nm hVPLA2 (Fig. 1B). This AA releasing activity was dependent on the activity of hVPLA2 on phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes, because hIIaPLA2 (20Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the W31A mutant of hVPLA2 (21Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which have much lower activity on and lower affinity for PC vesicles, respectively, did not significantly induce the AA release. Furthermore, the R100E/K101E mutant of hVPLA2, which has wild type-like activity on PC membranes but has much reduced affinity for cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (13Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), caused considerably less AA release than the wild type (∼60%) under the same conditions. This suggests that both activity toward PC and affinity for HSPG are important for the AA releasing activity of hVPLA2 on unstimulated PBE. As was the case with human neutrophils (13Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and HEK 293 cells (28Kim Y.J. Kim K.P. Rhee H.J. Das S. Rafter J.D. Oh Y.S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9358-9365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), HSPG binding of hVPLA2 was required for its internalization to PBE, because the immunoblotting analysis of the cell lysate showed that treatment of PBE with 1 unit/ml of heparinase I for 30 min at 37 °C abrogated the internalization of hVPLA2 (data not shown). This, in conjunction with the reduced AA release by R100E/K101E, implies that a significant portion of AA released by the wild type hVPLA2 derives from intracellular membranes. We then measured the effect of exogenous hVPLA2 on the LTC4 release from intact PBE. As was the case with the AA release, hVPLA2 induced the LTC4 release from PBE in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The LTC4 release caused by 100 nm hVPLA2 was comparable with that caused by 100 nm fMLP with 5 μg/ml CB. Again, hIIaPLA2 and hVPLA2/W31A (data not shown) did not significantly induce LTC4 release. Interestingly, hVPLA2/R100E/K101E produced LTC4 at a basal level, suggesting that AA released at the outer plasma membrane by this enzyme is not conducive to LTC4 synthesis. We also measured the effect of exogenous hVPLA2 on PBE activated with 100 nm fMLP with 5 μg/ml CB. Incubation of fMLP/CB-treated PBE with 100 nm hVPLA2 greatly augmented the release of AA (Fig. 3A) and LTC4 (Fig. 3B) from these cells.Fig. 3Effect of hVPLA 2 on the AA and LTC 4 secretion from fMLP/CB-activated eosinophils. Eosinophils were treated for 20 min with HBSS alone, 100 nm of hVPLA2, 100 nm fMLP with 5 μg/ml CB, or 100 nm of hVPLA2 plus 100 nm fMLP and 5 μg/ml CB, and the AA (A) and LTC4 (B) release was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether cPLA2 is involved in the hVPLA2-induced AA and LTC4 release, we treated PBE with AACOCF3, which inhibits both cPLA2 and group VI calcium-independent PLA2 (31Street I.P. Lin H.K. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weech P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), prior to the addition of hVPLA2. AACOCF3 up to 30 μm had a negligible effect on the release of AA (Fig. 4A) and LTC4 (Fig. 4B) from intact PBE. By contrast, pretreatment of PBE with 10 μm of a sPLA2 inhibitor, LY311727 (15Zhu X. Sano H. Kim K.P. Sano A. Boetticher E. Munoz N.M. Cho W. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), attenuated the release of AA and LTC4 to a nearly base-line level. Taken together, these results indicate that hVPLA2 can induce the release of AA and LTC4 from both intact and activated PBE and that this activity depends not on the activities of cPLA2 but on the catalytic activity of sPLA2, most likely exogenously added hVPLA2. Effects of hVPLA 2 on cPLA 2 and 5-LO Activities—To understand how hVPLA2 stimulates PBE without activating cPLA2, we measured the effect of exogenously added hVPLA2 on [Ca2+]i, cPLA2 activity, cPLA2 phosphorylation, and cPLA2 translocation. We previously reported that the lipolytic action of hVPLA2 on the outer plasma membrane of human neutrophils resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i and cPLA2 phosphorylation, both of which led to cPLA2 activation ("

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Later on, MIF was rediscovered as a pituitary factor with hormone-like properties (2Bernhagen J.

Today, MIF is known as a widely expressed pleiotropic cytokine exhibiting a broad range of immune and inflammatory activities, including induction of inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and superoxide anion, and regulation of macrophage and lymphocyte proliferation. The immuno-regulatory activities of MIF are based upon transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene products, modulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis, and on a number of metabolic effects (summarized in Refs. 4Bucala R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Lue H. Kleemann R.

MIF plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of a number of immune and inflammatory conditions such as septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and lung diseases. Consequently, MIF-based therapeutic approaches have become of major interest (2Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracey K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R.

In particular, a membrane receptor for MIF has not been identified. MIF modulates the phosphorylation and activity of protein kinases (13Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and interacts with and regulates the activity of the transcriptional co-activator JAB1/CSN5 (14Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Brunner H. Bernhagen J.

Circulation. 2002; 105: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear what the upstream molecular events of these effects are. It has been considered that an observed catalytic thiol-protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) activity of MIF could be responsible, at least in part, for the cellular functions of MIF.The TPOR family of proteins encompasses enzymes such as thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin (Grx), protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), or the disulfide bond proteins, with Trx being the prototype member of the family. TPORs catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides in a cysteine-based dithiol/disulfide-dependent process, and some family members also serve as potent protein folding catalysts. TPOR proteins share a common Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (CXXC) consensus motif within a homologous so-called Trx-fold, where the CXXC motif is located at the N terminus of an α-helix. MIF contains a CXXC TPOR consensus motif, with the residues Ala and Leu placed between the cysteines and also contains additional conserved residues that are frequently found N-terminally of the CXXC region (16Ellis L.B.M. Saurugger P. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the overall three-dimensional structure of the MIF monomer shows a remote resemblance to the Trx monomer, MIF is not structurally homologous to the TPOR proteins, and the Cys-Ala-Leu-Cys (CALC) redox motif of MIF lies at the N terminus of a β-strand element with Cys57 located in the preceding loop (17Sun H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) rather than in a Trx-like fold. MIF exhibits TPOR activity in vitro being able to catalyze the reduction of both insulin and small molecular weight compound disulfides (19Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R.

Mutation of the CXXC cysteines of MIF results in partly or fully immunologically inactive MIF protein, an observation that has led to the suggestion that the TPOR activity of MIF is responsible in part for its immunological and cellular activities (14Kleemann R.

In addition, an involvement of MIF in the regulation of cellular redox processes is likely, as in addition to the above-mentioned findings, MIF was found to bind to and regulate the peroxiredoxin (24Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.Z. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and to inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (25Nguyen M.

It has been speculated that the enzymatic activity of MIF could serve to bypass a potential receptor mediated signaling pathway, to assist in MHC II antigen processing, or to mediate additional intracellular activities of MIF (6Lue H. Kleemann R. Calandra T. Roger T. Bernhagen J. Microb. Infect. 2002; 4: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 21Potolicchio I. Santambrogio L. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, MIF shares additional intriguing properties with Trx. Trx or adult T cell leukemia-derived factor plays a role in the regulation of cellular redox stress (27Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A.

Also, Trx, although originally discovered as a TPOR and ribonucleotide reductase enzyme, has recently been re-defined as a cytokine and immune mediator (29Bertini R. Howard O.M.Z. Dong H.-F. Oppenheim J.J. Bizzarri C. Caselli G. Pagliei S. Romines B. Wilshire J.A. Mengozzi M. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Pekkari K. Gurunath R. Holmgren A. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Ghezzi P. J. Exp.

Short peptide fragments derived from TPORs that span the CXXC region and artificial mimetics thereof have therefore been investigated to correlate the sequence requirements with the redox potentials of the corresponding enzymes and to assess the influence of three-dimensional structural constraints (34Zhang R.

Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Of note, some of these small peptides were recently shown to function as catalysts of protein folding processes (35Cabrele C. Flori S. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).As the three-dimensional structure of the CXXC region of MIF only has minor similarities to the CXXC/Trx-fold structure of the TPORs but MIF nevertheless exhibits TPOR-like activity, we surmised that during catalysis, the structure of MIF may be partially unfolded or changed. In this respect, it is noteworthy of mentioning that it has been suggested that a mono- or dimeric structure, possibly with slightly different conformational properties, but not the MIF trimer, may be the predominant MIF species under physiological conditions (38Mischke R. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thioredoxin reductase (Trr), a member of the TPOR family, also does not contain an apparent Trx fold structure but otherwise shares similar redox properties with the TPOR proteins, indicating that it may undergo a marked conformational change during catalysis (39Waksman G. Krishna T.S. Williams C.H.J. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 800-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Computer-based secondary structure predictions had shown previously (19Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Jüttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) that the CXXC sequence region of MIF has a high β-turn-forming propensity that is comparable with that of the TPOR enzymes. If altered conformational elements were involved in MIF-mediated redox catalysis and biological activity, it thus appeared possible that MIF-derived peptides featuring such properties could function as MIF mimetics.Here we elected a 16-residue MIF peptide fragment spanning the CALC motif of MIF and encompassing the residues that are part of the predicted β-turn. The peptide ranged from residue Phe-50 to Ile-65 and was termed MIF-(50–65). It contained additional turn-stabilizing residues flanking the CXXC motif and covered the aromatic residue (Phe-50) which is part of extended CXXC sequence patterns according to Ellis et al. (16Ellis L.B.M. Saurugger P. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The peptide and its C57S/C60S bis-serine, biotinylated, and fluorescein-modified variants as well as a peptide analog covalently cyclized by a lactam bridge were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc chemistry, HPLC-purified, and investigated for their conformational, redox, and in vitro TPOR catalytic properties. Applying a variety of immunological and cellular assays that are characteristic of the immunological, inflammatory, and cellular functions of MIF in vivo, we then asked whether the 16-meric peptide may have retained MIF-like functional properties and could serve to mimic cellular MIF activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals, Buffers, Recombinant MIF, and General Cell Culture Reagents—Protected amino acids were purchased from Rapp Polymer (Tübingen, Germany). All other peptide synthesis reagents were obtained from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (CFSE) was from Roche Diagnostics. Analytical grade acetonitrile was from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and from Merck. Trifluoroacetic acid, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG), l-cysteine and l-cystine, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), insulin, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-disulfide (HED), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form, NADPH), glutathione reductase, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester, sodium peroxidate, lipopolysaccharide O111:B4 (LPS), and dexamethasone (DEX) were obtained from Sigma. All general cell culture reagents such as media, supplements, antibiotics, and serum (for the latter, see below) were from Invitrogen. NIH 3T3 and THP-1 cells were bought from the German Society for Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were cultured by routine protocols at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin) were bought from Dynal Biotec ASA (Oslo, Norway). Streptavidin-coupled nanoparticles were a kind gift from Dr. G. Tovar (Fraunhofer IGB, Stuttgart, Germany). Biologically active recombinant human MIF (rMIF) was expressed, purified, and refolded as described previously (40Mischke R. Gessner A. Kapurniotu A. Jüttner S. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was purchased from REALITech (Braunschweig, Germany), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was bought from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Crude endothelial cell growth factor was prepared from bovine hypothalamus as described by Maciag et al. (41Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine was from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (E4, sc-7383) and anti-ERK1/2 (C16, sc-93) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Miscellaneous chemicals, solvents, and salts were from Sigma. All reagents were of the highest grade commercially available.Synthesis and Purification of the MIF-derived Peptides MIF-(50–65) and C57S/C60S-MIF-(50–65) and Their Biotinylated, Fluoresceinated, Lactam-bridged Derivatives, and Control Peptides—Peptide synthesis was performed by solid phase synthetic protocols (SPPS) as described by us previously (42Kazantzis A. Waldner M. Taylor J.W. Kapurniotu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the peptides was acetylated and the C terminus amidated. For synthesis of C57S/C60S-MIF-(50–65), serine residues were coupled at positions 57 and 60 instead of the active site cysteines. Biotinylation of MIF-(50–65) and C57S/C60S-MIF-(50–65) was performed at the N terminus of the fully protected and resin-bound peptides using normal coupling protocols in a mixture (2/1) of dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and an aminocaproate residue was also incorporated as a spacer between biotin and the peptide. N-terminal fluorescein-labeled forms of MIF-(50–65) and C57S/C60S-MIF-(50–65) were obtained by reaction of the side chain-protected, resin-bound peptides with CFSE which was applied in 1.7–2.3 molar excess. Reactions with CFSE were carried out for 3 h in a mixture (3/1) of dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Synthesis and side chain-to-side chain cyclization of cyclo57,60-[Asp57,Dap60]MIF-(50–65) and the linear control peptide [Asp57,Dap60]MIF-(50–65) was performed according to a procedure published previously (42Kazantzis A. Waldner M. Taylor J.W. Kapurniotu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Briefly, as to the SPPS procedure in general, synthesis was performed on Rink resin applying the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group for temporary protection of the α-amino function. Side chains of trifunctional amino acids were protected with t-butyl (Ser), trityl (Cys), Trt (His), and t-butyl (Glu). Deprotection with simultaneous cleavage of the peptide from the resin was performed by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% ethanedithiol, 2.5% water. Following evaporation of trifluoroacetic acid under vacuum at 30 °C, 10% acetic acid was added to the resulting product, and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with diethyl ether. The aqueous phase was then lyophilized. The obtained crude product, which was obtained in its reduced form and in a purity of about 90%, was further purified by C18 reverse phase (RP) HPLC (250 × 8 mm; 100 Å pore size, 7 μm particle size; Grom, Herrenberg, Germany). Elution of the peptides was achieved with two different water/acetonitrile elution programs. The first program consisted of a gradient of 10% B to 90% B between 1 and 31 min; and the second elution program was 0–7 min at 30% B, followed by a gradient from 30 to 60% B for 30 min, with buffer A 0.058% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B 90% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; flow rate 2 ml/min, and peptides were detected at 214 nm. The identity and purity of the peptides was verified by mass spectrometric analysis (see below and figure legends for details) and analytical HPLC. Following lyophilization, purified reduced peptide was stored at –20 °C until used further. Disulfide bridge-containing forms of the peptides were obtained by air oxidation in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at a peptide concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The oxidized peptide as well as the mixed disulfide species were collected on dry ice, deep frozen, and lyophilized. After lyophilization, the sample was dissolved in 10% acetic acid and immediately purified by HPLC (see above). For preparation of the purified reduced peptide see below. Mutant peptide C57S/C60S-MIF-(50–65) and the biotinylated, fluoresceinated, and side chain-to-side chain cyclized peptides were purified directly from their corresponding crude synthesis products by HPLC. The biotinylated and fluorescein-labeled wild-type derivatives were applied in the biological assays in their reduced forms.Peptide Verification by Mass Spectrometry, Electrophoresis, and Amino Acid Analysis—The mass spectrometric measurements for peptide verification and determination of the degree of oxidation/reduction and mixed disulfide formation were performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS; instruments from Shimadzu Kratos Kompact MALDI 3 version 3.0.2, Duisburg, Germany) and G2025A LD-TOF-System Mass Spectrometer from Hewlett-Packard (Böblingen, Germany), and for some preparations by liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray MS (LC-ESMS) on a quadrupole ion trap MS (LCQ from Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Some analyses were performed with an Applied Biosystems API 3000 liquid chromatography-MS. For characterization of some of the side products of the syntheses, fast atom bombardment-MS (VARIAN-MAT 711, Thermo-Finnigan, Bremen, Germany) was applied.In addition, peptide verification and quantification of the fluoresceinated peptide analogs was performed by 4–12% NuPAGE and silver staining analysis (25Nguyen M.

https://openalex.org/W1995539563,"The nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a phosphoprotein possessing various functions. We have previously reported that the HCV NS5A protein interacts with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domain of TRAF2 (Park, K.-J., Choi, S.-H., Lee, S. Y., Hwang, S. B., and Lai, M. M. C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13122-13128). Both TNF-alpha- and TRAF2-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activations were inhibited by NS5A-TRAF2 interaction. Because TRAF2 is required for the activation of both NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), we investigated HCV NS5A protein for its potential capacity to modulate TRAF2-mediated JNK activity. Using in vitro kinase assay, we have found that NS5A protein synergistically activated both TNF-alpha- and TRAF2-mediated JNK in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Furthermore, synergism of NS5A-mediated JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative form of MEK kinase 1. Our in vivo binding data show that NS5A does not inhibit interaction between TNF receptor-associated death domain and TRAF2 protein, indicating that NS5A and TRAF2 may form a ternary complex with TNF receptor-associated death domain. These results indicate that HCV NS5A protein modulates TNF signaling of the host cells and may play a role in HCV pathogenesis."

Moreover, several extracellular proteins have been reported to modulate PG synthesis in amnion cells. In this study, we found that lipid components dissolved in the amniotic fluid modulate PG synthesis in WISH human amnion cells and identified one of these components as a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). WISH cells express several S1P receptors including S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3. When WISH cells were stimulated with S1P, PGE2 synthesis increased in a concentration-dependent manner, showing maximal activity at around 100 nm. S1P treatment also caused the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein, which was apparent within 3–12 h of stimulation. In terms of the intracellular signaling pathway of S1P-induced WISH cell activation, we found that S1P stimulated two kinds of MAPK, ERK, and p38 kinase. We examined the roles of these two MAPKs in S1P-induced COX-2 expression. S1P-induced COX-2 expression was blocked completely by PD-98059 but not by SB-203580, suggesting that ERK has a critical role in the process. Transfection of S1P1 or S1P3 but not of S1P2 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited S1P-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in WISH cells, indicating the involvements of S1P1 and S1P3 in the processes.

Although many previous reports have demonstrated the pivotal role of S1P in the modulation of several biological responses via its specific receptor, the role of S1P in amnion cells has not been studied previously. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether amniotic fluid contains certain lipid ligands that modulate COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis. We found that S1P exists in the amniotic fluid and acts as a potential regulator of labor response.

PD-98059 and SB-203580 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before being added to the cell culture. The final concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide in culture were 0.1% or less. Preparation of Lipid Extract of Amniotic Fluid—Amniotic fluid was prepared from healthy volunteers who had been pregnant for eight to nine months or during labor. Informed consent was obtained from all volunteers, and this study was approved by the local institutional review board at Dong-A University Hospital. Prepared amniotic fluid was extracted with chloroform as described previously (17Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ml of amniotic fluid was extracted with ice-cold chloroform:methanol (1:2) and then with 2 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of 1 m KCl, 100 μl of 7 n NH4OH. The acidic phase (the lower phase) and the alkaline phase (upper phase) were then separated, 3 ml of chloroform and 200 μl of concentrated HCl were added to the alkaline phase, and the lower chloroform phase was retained. Each phase was evaporated under nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until use. Just before assay, the dried samples were dissolved by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4% BSA (w/v). PGE 2 Assay—PGE2 levels were determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of standard or sample was pipetted into the wells of a 96-well plate. Aliquots of mouse polyclonal PGE2 antibody and PGE2 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were then added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the wells were washed six times with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added. Wells were read at 670 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader 30 min after adding substrate. Quantitative Measurement of S1P—The amount of S1P in amniotic fluid was measured as described previously (18Min J.K. Yoo H.S. Lee E.Y. Lee W.J. Lee Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, acidified methanol containing C17-S1P, as an internal standard, was added to amniotic fluid. After partitioning the fluid with chloroform-sodium hydroxide solution, S1P was recovered from the aqueous phase. The release of monophosphate from S1P by alkaline phosphatase produced sphingosine, which was successively derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and quantified using a high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a fluorescence detector. Cell Culture—The WISH human amnion cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). WISH cells were cultured in RPMI 16040 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were subcultured twice weekly by trypsinization and seeded in either 12 (2 × 105 cells/well)- or 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well). The cells were then stimulated with lipid extract or S1P for various lengths of time ranging from a few minutes to 12 h in the presence of S1P with or without inhibitors. Ligand Binding Analysis—Ligand binding analysis was performed as described previously (19Van Brocklyn J.R. Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Hobson J.P. Lipp M. Spiegel S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, WISH cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well into a 24-well plate and cultured overnight. After blocking the cells with blocking buffer (33 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA in RPMI) for 2 h, several concentrations of 3H-labeled S1P were added to the cells in binding buffer (PBS containing 0.1% BSA), in the absence or presence of unlabeled 10 μm S1P, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 4 °C with continuous shaking. The samples were then washed five times with ice-cold binding buffer, and 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) was added to each well. After 20 min at room temperature, the lysates were collected and counted using a γ-ray counter (19Van Brocklyn J.R. Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Hobson J.P. Lipp M. Spiegel S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—mRNA was isolated by using a QIAshredder and an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). mRNA, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and pd(N)6 primers (Invitrogen) were used to obtain cDNA. The primers used for the RT-PCR analysis have been reported previously (11Idzko M. Panther E. Corinti S. Morelli A. Ferrari D. Herouy Y. Dichmann S. Mockenhaupt M. Gebicke-Haerter P. Di Virgilio F. Girolomoni G. Norgauer J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primer used were as follows: S1P1 receptor (429-bp product), sense, 5′-TATCAGCGCGGACAAGGAGAACAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-ATAGGCAGGCCACCCAGGATGAG-3′; S1P2 receptor (220-bp product), sense, 5′-TCGGCCTTCATCGTCATCCTCT-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCTCCCGGGCAAACCACTG-3′; S1P3 receptor (394-bp product), sense, 5′-CTGCCTGCACAATCTCCCTGACTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGCCCGCCGCATCTCCT-3′; S1P4 receptor (454-bp product), sense, 5′-GAGAGCGGGGCCACCAAGAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGTTGACCGCCGAGTTGAGGAC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (246-bp product), sense, 5′-GATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′. We ran 30 PCR cycles at 94 °C (denaturation, 1 min), 62 °C (annealing, 1 min), and 72 °C (extension, 1 min). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—WISH cells were plated in a 6-well plate and treated with the lipid extract of amniotic fluid or with S1P for different times. The cells were then washed with cold PBS, scraped off, and pelleted at 700 × g at 4 °C. The cell pellet obtained was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved as a whole-cell lysate. Proteins (30 μg) were separated by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and electroblotted in 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20 (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20), incubated with antibodies for 4 h, washed, and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Finally, the membrane was washed and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—WISH cells were cultured for the indicated times at 37 °C in 1 μm S1P and then washed three times with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. RNA was isolated using a Tri-Reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Aliquots (2 μg) of total RNA were denatured and fractionated by gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA was then transferred by capillary action in 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) onto a nylon membrane. Blots were incubated with specific DNA probes for human COX-2, which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using a Prime-α-Gene kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used as an internal RNA loading control. Transfection of Antisense Nucleotides of S1P Receptors—Antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the region of translation initiation of S1P1, S1P2, or S1P3 was used to inhibit the expression of S1P receptors, as described previously (20Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Sense nucleotides for each receptor were used as controls. Finally, 20 μm of antisense oligonucleotide for each S1P receptor were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 48 h prior to each experiment. Statistics—The results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the number of determinations indicated. The Student's t test was used to compare individual treatments with their respective control values. In the figures, * indicates a significant difference at a p value of p < 0.05 of individual treatments versus their respective control values. Amniotic Fluid Lipid Extracts Stimulate PGE 2 Synthesis via COX-2 Expression in WISH Cells—Because COX-2 has been reported to synthesize PGs in amnion cells, we investigated whether a lipid in the amniotic fluid modulates PGE2 synthesis and COX-2 expression in amnion-derived cells. For this purpose, we extracted lipids from amniotic fluid, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The three dried types of lipid extracts were dissolved by sonication in a suspension buffer (0.4% BSA in PBS). WISH cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of the three lipid extracts of amniotic fluid for various lengths of time. We found that the addition of the chloroform extract with acidic solvent caused a significant increase in PGE2 synthesis in WISH cells (Fig. 1A). When WISH cells were incubated with the lipid extract, PGE2 synthesis was enhanced in a time-dependent manner, showing maximal activity 6 h after stimulation (Fig. 1A). PGE2 synthesis was increased 2-fold as compared with the untreated cells at 6 h (Fig. 1A). We also performed Western blot analysis using antibodies recognizing COX-2. Stimulation of WISH cells with the lipid extract of the amniotic fluid induced 72-kDa COX-2 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), and this was maximally up-regulated 6–12 h after stimulation (Fig. 1B). The results obtained suggest the existence of certain lipid components in the amniotic fluid that stimulate PGE2 synthesis via COX-2 expression. A previous report demonstrated that activated charcoal adsorbs short lengths of lipid components such as S1P (21Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). When we stimulated WISH cells with charcoal-stripped amniotic fluid, as described previously (21Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), we did not observe any significant increase in the PGE2 or COX-2 expression of the cells (Fig. 1). This result supports our notion that S1P may be involved in the amniotic fluid-induced expression of COX-2 in WISH cells. S1P Is Dissolved in Amniotic Fluid—To check whether amniotic fluid contains S1P, we performed quantitative analysis for S1P in amniotic fluid that was prepared from volunteers who had been pregnant for eight to nine months using an analytical method described previously (18Min J.K. Yoo H.S. Lee E.Y. Lee W.J. Lee Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It was found to contain 19.7 ± 2.38 nm (Table I). To investigate the role of S1P in the regulation of labor, we checked whether S1P levels during labor (37.5 ± 4.27 nm) were found to be higher than the level prior to labor (19.7 ± 2.38 nm) (Table I), suggesting that S1P might be involved in the regulation of labor.Table ILevels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in human amniotic fluidAmniotic fluidSphingosine 1-Phosphateperiodpmol/mg proteinpmol/mlBefore labor7.1 ± 1.0119.7 ± 2.38During labor14.5 ± 3.4237.5 ± 4.27 Open table in a new tab WISH Cells Express Receptors for S1P—To confirm whether WISH cells express receptors for S1P, we performed a ligand-binding assay using [3H]S1P in WISH cells. The addition of various concentrations of [3H]S1P demonstrated the concentration-dependent binding of [3H]S1P to WISH cells (Fig. 2A), which was quantified after subtracting nonspecific binding. The addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled S1P prior to the addition of [3H]S1P reduced this binding. The specific binding of S1P in WISH cells was proven by adding 25 nm [3H]S1P, which achieved saturation at ∼200 nm [3H]S1P for 5 × 104 cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the specific binding curve was found to be biphasic, showing an initial saturation at 50 nm per 5 × 104 cells and next saturation at 200 nm per 5 × 104 cells (Fig. 2A). This indicates that WISH cells express at least two different receptors. To determine which isoforms of S1P receptor are expressed on WISH cells, we analyzed the mRNA expressions of different S1P by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B, WISH cells expressed several forms of S1P receptors, namely S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3, and the expression levels of S1P1 and S1P3 were higher than that of S1P2 (Fig. 2B). However, we were unable to detect S1P4 expression (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that the RT-PCR product obtained without the addition of reverse transcriptase did not contain a DNA band in the gel (Fig. 2B). This result correlates with that of the ligand binding analysis, which showed the existence of multiple S1P receptors in WISH cells. S1P Stimulates PGE 2 Synthesis via COX-2 Expression in WISH Cells—To reveal the physiological role of S1P in amnion cells, we investigated the effect of S1P on PGE2 synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the stimulation of WISH cells with various concentrations of S1P enhanced PGE2 release into the medium by 2-fold versus the unstimulated control, which showed maximal activity at a S1P concentration of 100 nm. Previous reports (3Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 4Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27689-27693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that COX-2 is responsible for the synthesis of PGE2 when induced by extracellular stimuli. COX-2 is also known to be induced by extracellular stimuli (5Albert T.J. Su H.C. Zimmerman P.D. Iams J.D. Kniss D.A. Prostaglandins. 1994; 48: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Perkins D.J. Kniss D.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The expression level of COX-2 protein was examined by Western blotting using anti-COX-2 antibodies. When WISH cells were stimulated with various concentrations of S1P, the 72-kDa COX-2 protein was increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). This effect was maximal at an S1P concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the concentration dependence of S1P-induced COX-2 expression was similar to that of S1P-induced PGE2 release, indicating that COX-2 is responsible for PGE2 synthesis. The time dependence of S1P-induced COX-2 up-regulation was also tested. When WISH cells were stimulated with 100 nm S1P for various lengths of time, S1P enhanced the expression level of COX-2 within 3 to 12 h (Fig. 4A). Western blotting analysis was also performed using anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loadings (Fig. 4A). We then examined the effect of S1P on the transcriptional level of COX-2 by Northern blotting with a COX-2 probe. As shown in Fig. 4B, the stimulation of WISH cells with 100 nm S1P induced an accumulation of COX-2 mRNA transcripts 0.5–1 h after treating with 100 nm S1P (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Time-dependent increase in COX-2 protein and mRNA expression by S1P. Cells were incubated with S1P (1 μm) for the indicated times. The cell lysates were extracted, and Western blot was performed using anti-COX-2 antibody (A). Total RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed using a probe specific for human COX-2 (B). The COX-2 protein and mRNA levels shown are representative of three independent experiments. Western blotting analysis was also performed with anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loadings (A). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ERK Is Involved in the S1P-induced Expression of COX-2 in WISH Cells—Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been reported to mediate extracellular signals to the nucleus in various cell types (22Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether S1P stimulates MAPKs by using Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-specific antibodies against each enzyme. When WISH cells were stimulated with 2 μm S1P for different times, the phosphorylation level of ERK was transiently increased, showing maximal activity within 2–5 min of stimulation (Fig. 5A), and returned to baseline 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 5A). Another important MAPK, p38 kinase, was also transiently activated by S1P stimulation with kinetics that resembled those of ERK activation (Fig. 5A). We also examined the concentration dependence of S1P-induced ERK and p38 kinase activation. When WISH cells were stimulated with various concentrations of S1P, ERK and p38 kinase were activated in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). In terms of ERK activation, S1P caused significant activation at 10 nm and maximal activation at 100 nm (Fig. 5B). However, p38 kinase activation was induced by ∼0.1 nm, and S1P was maximal at 100 nm S1P (Fig. 5B). To determine the role of each MAPK on S1P-induced COX-2 expression, we used two different MAPK inhibitors. The preincubation of WISH cells with PD-98059, a specific MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, prior to S1P treatment completely inhibited COX-2 expression by S1P (Fig. 5C). Moreover, SB-203580, a specific p38 kinase inhibitor, did not affect S1P-induced COX-2 expression. These results indicate that MAPK/ERK kinase-dependent ERK activity but not p38 kinase is essentially involved in S1P-induced COX-2 expression. S1P-induced COX-2 Expression Is Mediated by a Partially Pertussis Toxin (PTX)-sensitive Pathway—We investigated the role of PTX-sensitive G protein on S1P-induced COX-2 expression. Cultured WISH cells were preincubated with 100 ng/ml of PTX prior to stimulation with 100 nm S1P, which up-regulated COX-2. We found that pretreatment with PTX partially inhibited COX-2 expression by S1P (Fig. 6A). This result shows that S1P induces COX-2 expression in a partially PTX-sensitive manner. Fig. 5C shows that S1P-stimulated COX-2 expression was completely inhibited by PD-98059, thus indicating the criticality of the role played by ERK in the process. We also checked the effect of PTX on S1P-induced ERK activation. When WISH cells were preincubated with 100 ng/ml of PTX prior to being stimulated with 2 μm S1P, S1P-induced ERK activation was also found to be partially inhibited (Fig. 6B). This result supports our notion that S1P stimulates COX-2 expression via both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive pathways and that ERK is critically involved in the process. S1P 1 and S1P 3 but Not S1P 2 Are Involved in S1P-induced COX-2 Expression—In Fig. 2B, we showed that WISH cells express multiple isoforms of S1P receptor. To reveal the identity of the S1P receptor involved in S1P-induced COX-2 expression, we used S1P receptor antisense oligonucleotide, as described previously (20Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Transfection with the antisense oligonucleotides to S1P1 or S1P3 significantly suppressed S1P-mediated COX-2 expression and PGE2 production (Fig. 7, A and B). As shown in Fig. 7A, in WISH cells transfected with S1P1- or S1P3-specific antisense oligonucleotide, S1P-induced PGE2 production was reduced by ∼51% (n = 4) or 42% (n = 4), respectively. In contrast, transfection with antisense oligonucleotide to S1P2 did not affect the S1P-induced responses (Fig. 7, A and B). As control experiments, we confirmed that transfection with sense oligonucleotide to any S1P receptor had no effect on S1P-stimulated COX-2 expression and PGE2 production (Fig. 7, A and B). These results suggest that S1P requires both S1P1 and S1P3 for full activation of the intracellular signal needed for COX-2 induction and PGE2 production. The results also coincide with our data, namely that S1P-induced COX-2 expression is mediated by a partially PTX-sensitive pathway. In the present study, we found that S1P, a lysophospholipid, is dissolved in human amniotic fluid and that it modulates the activity of human amnion-derived WISH cells. We then focused on the effect of S1P on PGE2 synthesis and the expression of COX-2, which is critically involved in the regulation of labor. The modulation of labor response remains an important issue in the biology of reproduction. Many groups have reported that several kinds of cytokines are involved in the regulation of labor (3Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 4Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Nam J.O. Kim J.H. Lee Y.G. Park Y.K. Ryu S.H. Baek S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the role of lipid mediators on the modulation of labor response has not been studied. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that human amniotic fluid contains lipid components involved in PGE2 synthesis and COX-2 expression. We further characterized the lipid mediators and identified one of them as S1P. In a previous study (18Min J.K. Yoo H.S. Lee E.Y. Lee W.J. Lee Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we developed a quantitative analytical method for S1P in biological samples, and then using this developed method, we found that human amniotic fluid contains significant amounts of S1P. The level of S1P in amniotic fluid prepared from volunteers who had been pregnant for eight to nine months was around 19 pmol/ml (7.1 pmol/mg of protein) (Table I). In addition, S1P levels in amniotic fluid increase by ∼2-fold during labor. These data suggest that S1P play a role in labor. To determine the role of S1P in amniotic fluid, we examined the effect of purified S1P on amnion-derived WISH cells. The stimulation of human amnion-derived WISH cells with purified S1P induced COX-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 4). Because the lipid extract of amniotic fluid-induced PGE2 secretion, mediated by COX-2 expression, we suggest that S1P dissolved in the amniotic fluid modulates COX-2 expression in amnion cells. The role of S1P on the modulation of COX-2 expression has already been reported (24Davaille J. Gallois C. Habib A. Li L. Mallat A. Tao J. Levade T. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34628-34633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Davaille et al. (24Davaille J. Gallois C. Habib A. Li L. Mallat A. Tao J. Levade T. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34628-34633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) demonstrated that S1P stimulates COX-2 expression leading to anti-proliferative activity in human hepatic myofibroblasts. Our study indicates that S1P also regulates COX-2 expression in amnion-derived cells, suggesting that it has a role in the modulation of labor. Moreover, this finding strongly suggests not only protein cytokines, such as IL-1β, but also lipid mediators like S1P might be involved in the regulation of labor. Previous reports (13Okamoto H.

When we performed RT-PCR to check the expression pattern of S1P receptors on WISH cells, we found that WISH cells express S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 (Fig. 2B). According to previous reports (25Lee M.-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 787-794PubMed Google Scholar), S1P1 exclusive couples to G proteins of the Gi/Go family, whereas S1P2 and S1P3 are coupled to Gi/Go and also to Gq, Gs, and G13. In our study, we investigated the effect of PTX (which specifically inactivates Gi/Go-mediated signaling pathways) on S1P-induced signaling. When WISH cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 24 h prior to S1P stimulation, S1P-induced COX-2 expression was partially inhibited (Fig. 6A). S1P-stimulated ERK activation was also partially inhibited by PTX pretreatment, as shown in Fig. 6B. These results suggest that S1P modulates ERK activation leading to COX-2 expression and that not only PTX-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors but also PTX-insensitive G protein-coupled receptors are involved in the process in WISH cells. We also determined the identities of the S1P receptors that are involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis in WISH cells by S1P receptor antisense oligonucleotide transfection. As shown in Fig. 7, S1P-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis were inhibited by the down-regulation of S1P1 and S1P3 but not S1P2, which suggests that S1P1 and S1P3, but not S1P2, are involved in S1P-induced COX-2 expression in WISH cells. The results correlate with the finding that S1P-induced COX-2 expression is mediated by a partially PTX-sensitive signaling pathway. To investigate the signal pathway of COX-2 expression by S1P in WISH cells, we checked the role of two different kinds of MAPKs. We observed that S1P stimulates both ERK and p38 kinase activity (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine the role of ERK or p38 kinase on S1P-induced COX-2 expression, we pretreated WISH cells with two different MAPK-specific inhibitors, PD-98059 and SB-203580 (specific ERK and p38 kinase inhibitors, respectively). Preincubation of WISH cells with PD-98059 prior to S1P stimulation completely inhibited COX-2 expression by S1P (Fig. 5C); however, SB-203580 did not affect S1P-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 5C). This indicates that ERK, but not p38 kinase, plays a key role in S1P-induced COX-2 expression in amnion cells. Previously, we characterized the signaling pathways involved in IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression in WISH cells and showed that p38 kinase, but not ERK, is involved in the expression of COX-2 (23Park D.W. Bae Y.S. Nam J.O. Kim J.H. Lee Y.G. Park Y.K. Ryu S.H. Baek S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the addition of 1-butanol completely blocked IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression in WISH cells and suggested the critical role played by phospholipase D in the process (23Park D.W. Bae Y.S. Nam J.O. Kim J.H. Lee Y.G. Park Y.K. Ryu S.H. Baek S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study, when we stimulated S1P in the presence of 1-butanol, COX-2 expression was unaffected (data not shown). These results suggest that the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the modulation of COX-2 by S1P differ from those involved in the modulation of COX-2 by IL-1β in WISH cells. In conclusion, the present study has two important findings, first, that the lipid mediator S1P is present in human amniotic fluid, and second, that this acts on the S1P-specific receptors S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 expressed on human amnion-derived WISH cells. Because this study is the only report on the existence of lipid mediators in human amniotic fluid and on the potential role of S1P in labor response, further studies on the pathophysiological and physiological roles of S1P in labor response are required."

Group I chaperonins are thought to be restricted to the cytosol of bacteria and to mitochondria and chloroplasts, whereas the group II chaperonins are found in the archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol. Here we show that members of the archaeal genus Methanosarcina co-express both the complete group I (GroEL/GroES) and group II (thermosome/prefoldin) chaperonin systems in their cytosol. These mesophilic archaea have acquired between 20 and 35% of their genes by lateral gene transfer from bacteria. In Methanosarcina mazei Gö1, both chaperonins are similarly abundant and are moderately induced under heat stress. The M. mazei GroEL/GroES proteins have the structural features of their bacterial counterparts. The thermosome contains three paralogous subunits, α, β, and γ, which assemble preferentially at a molar ratio of 2:1:1. As shown in vitro, the assembly reaction is dependent on ATP/Mg2+ or ADP/Mg2+ and the regulatory role of the β subunit. The co-existence of both chaperonin systems in the same cellular compartment suggests the Methanosarcina species as useful model systems in studying the differential substrate specificity of the group I and II chaperonins and in elucidating how newly synthesized proteins are sorted from the ribosome to the proper chaperonin for folding.

They cooperate with cofactors of the Cpn10 or Hsp10 family (GroES in E. coli). Group II chaperonins occur in the archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol. The archaeal group II chaperonins are commonly referred to as thermosome (Ths), based on the initial description of this complex in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrodictium occultum (13Phipps B.M.

Gottschalk G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotech. 2002; 4: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). A striking feature of the Methanosarcina genomes is that they are the first archaeal genomes identified to contain both group I and group II chaperonin genes, thus adding to the growing evidence of lateral gene transfer between bacteria and archaea (37Deppenmeier U. Johann A. Hartsch T. Merkl R. Schmitz R.A. Martinez-Arias R. Henne A. Wiezer A. Baumer S. Jacobi C. Bruggemann H. Lienard T. Christmann A. Bomeke M. Steckel S. Bhattacharyya A. Lykidis A. Overbeek R.

How the two groups of chaperonins coevolved to function within the same compartment is an intriguing question.This report describes the molecular cloning, purification, reconstitution, and preliminary functional analysis of both types of chaperonin from M. mazei Gö1. We demonstrate that both chaperonins are expressed under standard growth conditions of M. mazei and coexist in the cytosolic compartment at a ratio of GroEL to Ths of ∼1:1. Heat stress results in a moderately increased expression. Three Ths subunits, α, β, and γ, were identified, which assemble preferentially at a molar ratio of 2:1:1. In contrast to the α and γ subunits, the β subunit is unable to form homo-oligomeric complexes and thus has a special role in regulating the subunit stoichiometry in the nucleotide-dependent assembly process. Both chaperonins are capable of preventing the aggregation of denatured model substrate proteins, such as mitochondrial rhodanese, but only the GroEL/GroES system supports rhodanese refolding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMultiple Sequence AlignmentAmino acid sequences were compared using the program Multalin, which creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive pairwise alignments (38Henikoff S.

Blaut M. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to an OD660 of 0.2–0.5 (early exponential phase). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 4900 × g. Cell pellets were lysed in 25 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA in the presence of Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μg/ml DNase I by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant (crude extract) was separated on either 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE as stated in the figure legends and immunoblotted for the various chaperonin proteins.To confirm that the chaperonins exist as oligomeric complexes, crude cell lysates were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S-200 PC3.2/30 or Superose 6 PC3.2/30; SMART system, Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with the following molecular size standards (Amersham Biosciences): thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Fractions of interest were then separated on either 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by immunoblotting. The high molecular mass fraction was also subjected to 4.5% native PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting.To determine the relative abundance of the chaperonin complexes, crude cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-chaperonin antibodies (see below), and quantified using purified chaperonins as standards.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ChaperoninsMmGroEL/GroES—The coding regions for MmGroEL and MmGroES were amplified by PCR from a genomic library of M. mazei Gö1 (37Deppenmeier U.

PCR products were inserted into the pET-22b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. BL21 (DE3) cells (41Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) were transformed with the respective constructs and were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) to an OD600 of ≈0.7 when chaperonin expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3–4 h. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1× Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (46,400 units/mg; chicken egg white, Sigma), followed by sonication (Misonix sonifier, position 4 at 50% duty in pulse mode) and subsequent addition of 0.1 μl/ml benzonase (250 units/μl; Merck) to digest DNA and RNA. After removal of cell debris and membranes by centrifugation at 4 °C (20 min, 50,000 × g, followed by 1 h at 100,000 × g), the protein in the supernatant was purified by successive steps of chromatography: DE52 (Whatman) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m; Source30Q (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm histidine-HCl, pH 5.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, NaCl gradient from 10 to 500 mm (final pH of loaded sample ∼6.0); Heparin-HiTrap 5 ml column (Amersham Biosciences) in 30 Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m, and S-300 HR 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Appropriate fractions from the final size exclusion column were pooled, divided into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 10,360 m–1 cm–1 for MmGroEL and 5120 m–1 cm–1 for MmGroES. MmGroEL and MmGroES were not detectably contaminated with their respective E. coli homologs, as demonstrated by peptide digests and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopic analysis, consistent with the massive overproduction of the M. mazei chaperonins in E. coli (Fig. 4).EcGroEL/GroES—E. coli GroEL and GroES were expressed from pET-11a vectors (Novagen) in BL21 cells and purified as described for MmGroEL and MmGroES. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 9080 m–1 cm–1 for EcGroEL and 1280 m–1 cm–1 for EcGroES.Ths—The coding regions of the α, β and γ subunits of MmThs were amplified by PCR from the genomic library of M. mazei (37Deppenmeier U.

The original archaeal translational TAA stop codon was replaced by TGA for all three subunits. In the case of MmThs γ, it was necessary to replace the original archaeal translational TTG start codon by ATG, allowing for translation in E. coli. The PCR products were inserted into pET-22b vector (Novagen) using a 5′ NdeI site that includes the translational ATG start codon and a 3′ NheI site just downstream of the translational TGA stop that is followed by a distinct BamHI site. The NheI site in combination with the BamHI site allowed the construction of bi- or polycystronic expression vectors. Because the pET-22b vector contains a XbaI site downstream from the T7 promoter but upstream of the ribosomal binding site, a MmThs subunit together with its ribosomal binding site was excised with XbaI and BamHI and inserted into a pET-22b vector (precut with NheI and BamHI) containing the translational cassette for another MmThs subunit. This procedure resulted in a bicistronic expression vector. The third MmThs subunit was then inserted into the bicistronic expression vector using the same procedure.BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the respective MmThs expression constructs were grown and induced (0.25 mm IPTG) as described above. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Thawed cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche) and lysozyme (1 mg/ml), incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by sonification as above. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (208,000 × g, 50 min). The supernatant was 2-fold diluted with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, loaded onto a Source30Q column (220 ml), and eluted with a linear salt gradient (50–500 mm NaCl). Monomeric MmThs subunits eluted at ∼180 mm NaCl and oligomers at ∼250 mm NaCl. The relevant fractions were concentrated using Centriprep™ 30 (Amicon) and diluted 1:6 with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-ME. This fraction was loaded onto a series of four heparin-Sepharose HiTrap columns (5 ml each) and eluted with 50–1000 mm NaCl. Unassembled subunits eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl and the MmThs oligomers at ∼460 mm NaCl. Respective fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Sephacryl S300 HR column (HiLoad 26/60) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-ME. Ths oligomers eluted after the void volume, whereas the unassembled MmThs subunits appeared at the ∼200–330-kDa molecular mass marker. The latter material represented monomeric subunits, as demonstrated by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, which were performed at 20 °C in a Beckman Coulter™ Optima™ XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics. The molecular masses were determined using the software Ultrascan 5.0 (B. Demeler, University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX; www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu). The aberrant fractionation on size exclusion chromatography may be attributed to the elongated shape of chaperonin subunits. The MmThs oligomers were further purified on an anion exchange column (MonoQ 16/10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-ME and eluted with a linear salt gradient (50–500 mm NaCl) at ∼280 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined using calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 12,090 m–1 cm–1 for MmThs α, 10,240 m–1 cm–1 for MmThs β, 7680 m–1 cm–1 MmThs γ, 9885 m–1 cm–1 for MmThs α, γ, and 10,003 m–1 cm–1 for MmThs α, β, γ.Reconstitution of MmThs Subunits—Assembly of Ths complexes was initiated by incubation of purified monomeric subunits (26.5 μm MmThs α; 13.4 μm MmThs β; 13.4 μm MmThs γ), alone or in different combinations, in assembly buffer (40 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 90 mm NH4OAc, 9 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm ATP or ADP, 16 mm β-ME) at 32 °C for ∼30 min. Assembly reactions were either analyzed on 4.5% native gels or applied onto a Superose 6 PC3.2/30 (SMART system, Amersham Biosciences) column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-ME. Fractions containing assembled subunits were pooled, analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-MmThs α and/or β antibodies.Prevention of Aggregation and in Vitro Refolding AssaysBovine liver mitochondrial rhodanese (Sigma) was denatured in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 6 m guanidinium chloride, and 5 mm DTT at a concentration of 50 μm and diluted 100-fold into reactions (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) as specified in the figure legends. Aggregation was followed spectrophotometrically at 320 nm at 30 °C in the presence of different concentrations of chaperonin, as indicated. Rhodanese refolding was performed at 37 °C under the same conditions ± 5 mm ATP, and enzyme activities were determined at 25 °C (42Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U.

The supernatant was then incubated with the antibody-cross-linked beads for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed as described previously, and specifically bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, pH 8.8 or 6.5, and immunoblotting. 10% SDS-PAGE gels at pH 6.5 resulted in a better separation of MmThs α, β, and γ subunits (see Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Analysis of the subunit composition of endogenous M. mazei Ths complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2035927100,"Galactokinase plays a key role in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of α-d-galactose to galactose 1-phosphate. In humans, mutations in the galactokinase gene can lead to the diseased state referred to as Type II galactosemia. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of galactokinase from Lactococcus lactis determined to 2.1-Å resolution. As expected from amino acid sequence alignments, galactokinase adopts a similar topology to that observed for members of the GHMP superfamily. The N-terminal domain is characterized by a five-stranded mixed β-sheet while the C-terminal motif is dominated by two distinct four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets. The structure was solved in the presence of α-d-galactose and inorganic phosphate. These ligands are wedged between the N- and C-terminal domains. Amino acid side chains responsible for anchoring the sugar ligand to the protein include Arg36, Glu42, Asp45, Asp183, and Tyr233. Both Arg36 and Asp183 are strictly conserved in the amino acid sequences available in the literature thus far for galactokinases. Interestingly, the carboxylate side chain of Asp183 is positioned within 3.5 Å of the C-1 hydroxyl group of galactose, whereas the guanidinium group of Arg36 is situated between both the C-1 hydroxyl group and the inorganic phosphate. Most likely these residues play key roles in catalysis. The structure of galactokinase described here serves as a model for understanding the functional consequences of point mutations known to result in Type II galactosemia in humans.

The structure of galactokinase described here serves as a model for understanding the functional consequences of point mutations known to result in Type II galactosemia in humans. In most organisms, the conversion of galactose to glucose 1-phosphate is accomplished by a series of enzymes belonging to the Leloir pathway as indicated in Scheme 1. Deficiencies in three of these enzymes in humans can result in the diseased state referred to as galactosemia (1Petry K.G. Reichardt J.K. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 98-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Novelli G. Reichardt J.K. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although galactosemia is rare, it is a potentially lethal genetic disease with clinical manifestations, including intellectual retardation, liver dys-function, and cataract formation, among others. At present, the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structures of three of the four enzymes in the pathway, namely galactose mutarotase, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, are known through efforts by this laboratory (3Thoden J.B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The remaining enzyme of unknown structure, galactokinase, catalyzes the second step of the pathway, the ATP-dependent conversion of α-d-galactose to galactose 1-phosphate.As has been the case for all of the enzymes belonging to the Leloir pathway, galactokinase has been the subject of intensive biochemical investigations for many years. Interestingly, the kinetic properties of galactokinase seem to differ according to the source of the protein. In the enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli, it appears that the reaction mechanism is random with either ATP or galactose binding first (10Gulbinsky J.S. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the rat, yeast, and human enzymes, however, it appears that the reaction mechanism is ordered with ATP binding first (11Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1966; 101: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Walker D.G. Khan H.H. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Timson D.J. Reece R.J.

Strikingly, in plant galactokinases, the reaction mechanism is reported to be ordered but with galactose rather than ATP binding in the first step (15Dey P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).In recent years it has been shown on the basis of amino acid sequence alignments that galactokinase belongs to a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes known as the GHMP 1The abbreviations used are: GHMP, superfamily of galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: GHMP, superfamily of galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. superfamily (the abbreviation of which refers to the original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) (16Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs, the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding (17Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Within the last three years, the three-dimensional architectures of homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase have been elucidated (17Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V.

Homoserine kinase plays a critical role in bacterial threonine biosynthesis by catalyzing the phosphorylation of l-homoserine to O-phospho-l-homoserine. Mevalonate kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the C-5 hydroxyl oxygen of mevalonic acid to yield mevalonate 5-phosphate, a key intermediate employed for the synthesis of isoprenoids and sterols. Likewise, phosphomevalonate kinase is involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis by promoting the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the phosphate oxygen of (R)-5-phosphomevalonate to yield (R)-5-pyrophosphomevalonate. All of these enzymes display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal motifs dominated by a mixed β-sheet flanked on one side by α-helices and their C-terminal domains containing a four stranded anti-parallel β-sheet.Here we describe the x-ray crystallographic structure of galactokinase determined to a nominal resolution of 2.1 Å. For this study, the gene encoding the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis was cloned, the protein was overexpressed and purified from E. coli, and crystals were grown in the presence of α-d-galactose and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme from L. lactis contains 399 amino acid residues. From this investigation, the overall fold of galactokinase has now been defined, and the location of the active site was identified. Key residues involved in galactose binding include Arg36, Glu42, Asp45, Asp183, and Tyr233. The structure of the enzyme is discussed in context with other members of the GHMP superfamily. Additionally, the bacterial and human forms of galactokinase are 34% identical and 47% similar. As such, this structure provides insight into the molecular basis for Type II galactosemia in humans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the Galactokinase Gene—Genomic DNA from L. lactis var. lactis was prepared as previously reported (3Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The galactokinase gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA such that the forward primer 5′-GGAATTCATATGTCTATAGTTGTAGAAAATAGTACCGTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTCACCATCCAACTTTGTTGAACCAGA-3′ added NdeI and XhoI cloning sites, respectively. The gene was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), followed by A-tailing and ligation into pGEM-T Vector (Promega) and transformation into E. coli DH5α cells. The galactokinase gene was subsequently sequenced in the pGEM-T vector construct with the ABI Prism™ Big Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. The pGEM-T vector construct was then digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the gene was separated from digestion by-products on a 1.0% agarose gel. Subsequently, the galactokinase gene was excised from the gel, purified with a QIAquick Gel Purification kit (Qiagen), and ligated into the expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) that was previously cut with NdeI and XhoI. Insertion of the galactokinase gene into the pET-28b(+) plasmid resulted in a construct containing an additional 20 amino acid residues at the N terminus with the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH, thereby allowing for subsequent purification utilizing Ni-NTA affinity resin. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and subsequently plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were tested for insertion of the galactokinase gene by digesting with NdeI and XhoI.Protein Expression—For protein expression, E. coli Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) cells were transformed with the pET28b-galk plasmid and plated onto LB agarose plates supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Single colonies from the plates were selected and grown overnight in 500 ml of LB media (plus kanamycin and chloramphenicol) for the inoculation of 12- × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of M9 minimal medium (30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, plus antibiotics). Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an A 600 of ∼0.9, at which time they were cooled on ice for 5 min and transferred to a 16 °C shaker before inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 18 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 8 min. Cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.Expression of the Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—Cultures of E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells containing the pET28b-galk plasmid were grown overnight in M9 minimal medium (plus kanamycin and chloramphenicol) at 37 °C. Subsequently 15 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate each of the 12- × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml thiamine, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of ∼0.9. Subsequently, the flasks were cooled on ice for 5 min, and the temperature of the incubator was adjusted to 16 °C before each flask was supplemented with 50 mg each of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-phenylalanine, and 25 mgs each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine (22Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). After 20 min of additional growth, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for 18 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 8 min, and the cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80 °C.Protein Purification—All protein purification steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The cell paste was thawed in three volumes of cold Ni-NTA lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole at pH 8.0. Cells were lysed on ice by four cycles of sonication (45 s) separated by 5 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 25 min at 20,000 × g. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with Ni-NTA lysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with ∼100 ml of Ni-NTA lysis buffer, followed by a wash with 100 ml of Ni-NTA wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0). The protein was recovered by gradient elution with 20–300 mm imidazole in Ni-NTA lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml, based on an extinction coefficient of ∼1.75 ml/(mg cm) as calculated by the program Protean (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Galactose-dependent ATPase activity was verified using the standard pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay.Crystallization of Wild-type and Selenomethionine-labeled Galactokinase—Potential crystallization conditions were examined with a sparse matrix screen, designed in this laboratory and composed of 144 conditions. Crystallization trials were conducted at both room temperature and 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. Protein samples containing 10 mmd-(+)-galactose were utilized for the crystallization experiments. Single crystals were observed growing at room temperature at pH 9 with 2.4 m Na+/K+ phosphate as the precipitant. Refinement of the crystallization conditions via macro-seeding into batch experiments resulted in crystals being routinely grown at room temperature with precipitant concentrations of 1.6–1.8 m Na+/K+ phosphate and 100 mm CHES (pH 9.0). These crystals achieved typical dimensions of ∼0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 mm in 3–6 weeks and belonged to the cubic space group I23 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = c = 143.4 Å and one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the selenomethionine-labeled protein were grown in the same manner, using seeds of the native enzyme to initiate crystallization.High Resolution x-ray Data Collection—Both the wild-type and selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals were flash-frozen in the same manner. Briefly, crystals were harvested from the batch experiments and soaked for several hours in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 2.15 m Na+/K+ phosphate, 10 mmd-(+)-galactose, and 100 mm CHES (pH 9.0). These crystals were then serially transferred to a cryoprotectant solution composed of 3.0 m Na+/K+ phosphate, 10 mmd-(+)-galactose, 15% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm CHES (pH 9.0). Subsequently, the crystals were flash-cooled to –150 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas. Frozen crystals were stored under liquid nitrogen until synchrotron beam time became available. X-ray data from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein were collected on the SBC3 CCD detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-BM beamline. X-ray data from crystals of the wild-type protein were collected with the SBC2 CCD detector on the19-ID beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). All x-ray data sets were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

The remaining three residues at the C terminus were not visible. Note that the electron density corresponding to the first 28 residues at the N terminus was not as well ordered as that observed for other portions of the map. Additionally, the His tag at the N terminus was not visible in the electron density map, and it is possible that this tag contributed to the observed conformational flexibility of the molecule in this region.The initial model of galactokinase was subsequently refined against x-ray data collected from crystals of the wild-type protein. Alternate cycles of least-squares refinement with the software package TNT (26Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A Ramachandran plot for all non-glycinyl φ,ψ angles is given in Fig. 1a. There are only two residues that lie substantially outside of the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, Arg213 (φ = 69.4°, ψ = –126.5°) and Thr323 (φ = –90.3°, ψ = –94.0°). The electron density for both of these residues is unambiguous. Both Arg213 and Thr323 are far removed from the active site cleft. A representative portion of the electron density map is displayed in Fig. 1b. From the electron density it is clear that α-d-galactose was trapped in the active site.Table IILeast-squares refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)20.0-2.10R-factor (overall) %/no. reflectionsaR-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc |/Σ|Fo |) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitude.20.4/28,536R-factor (working) %/no. reflections19.9/25,673R-factor (free) %/no. reflections26.6/2,896No. protein atomsbThis value includes multiple conformations for N155.2985No. hetero-atomscThese include 1 galactose molecule, 1 phosphate ion, and 164 waters.181Average B values (Å2)Protein atoms50.4Galactose30.4Phosphate72.5Waters60.6Weighted RMS deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.013Bond angles (deg)2.59Trigonal planes (Å)0.006General planes (Å)0.012Torsional angles (deg)dThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.18.1a R-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc |/Σ|Fo |) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitude.b This value includes multiple conformations for N155.c These include 1 galactose molecule, 1 phosphate ion, and 164 waters.d The torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.

J. 2002; 363: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Examination of the packing arrangement of the L. lactis enzyme in the crystalline lattice suggests that it is also monomeric. Shown in Fig. 2 is a ribbon representation of the L. lactis enzyme. The molecule is elongated with overall dimensions of ∼70 × 54 × 57 Å and folds into two domains of roughly equal size. The N-terminal domain is delineated by Thr9 to Gly190, whereas the C-terminal domain is formed by Glu191 to Gly390. In addition, the last amino acid residues, Ser391 to Ala396, curl back onto the N-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain initiates with an α-helix formed by Thr9 to Phe22. Following this α-helical region, the polypeptide chain folds into four β-strands, referred to as A–D and defined by Glu29 to Ile40, Gly49 to Leu66, Lys71 to Thr75, and Ile85 to Phe87. The A–B and C–D pairs run anti-parallel. After β-strand D, the polypeptide chain adopts an α-helical conformation from Ser101 to Leu111, which is followed by the fifth β-strand of the N-terminal domain, β-strand E (Gly121 to Gly128). This β-strand is situated between the A–B and C–D pairs such that it runs anti-parallel with β-strand B and parallel to β-strand C. There are an additional three α-helices (Ser137 to Asp151, Pro159 to Ile175, and Leu182 to Phe189) that flank one side of this five-stranded mixed β-sheet. Amino acid residues involved in the binding of the inorganic phosphate are located in the loop connecting β-strand E to the following α-helix.Fig. 2Ribbon representation of galactokinase. Shown is a ribbon representation of one subunit of galactokinase with the bound ligands, α-d-galactose and phosphate, depicted in ball-and-stick representations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C-terminal domain contains two regions of β-sheet. The first is a hairpin motif formed by β-strands F (Ala195 to Leu198) and G (Ala204 to Val210). These strands are connected by a Type III reverse turn (Asp199 to Thr202). In combination with portions of β-strands A and B, this β-hairpin contributes in the formation of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The second major tertiary element in the C-terminal domain is a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet formed by β-strands H–K (Asp216 to Asn221, Val340 to Thr346, Cys353 to Ala359, and Ser383 to Ala387). The β-strand H is connected to β-strand I via five α-helices (Ser231 to Arg250, Asn261 to Ala266, Glu274 to Ala299, Leu302 to Asp319, and Leu325 to Lys336), whereas β-strands J and K are linked by an α-helix defined by Val363 to Val378. The active site is wedged between the N- and C-terminal domains.Active Site Geometry—A close-up view of the galactokinase active site is shown in Fig. 3. Note that Gly347 and Ala348 abut one side of the sugar ligand. These residues are located in Motif III of the GHMP superfamily. For the L. lactis enzyme, these residues link β-strands I and J and have the following sequence: Gly347-Ala348-Gly349-Phe350-Gly351-Gly352-Cys353.Fig. 3Close-up view of the galactokinase active site. A close-up view of the active site, within ∼3.2 Å of the galactose and inorganic phosphate molecules, is shown. The ligands are highlighted in yellow-filled bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The galactose moiety is anchored to the protein via the guanidinium group of Arg36, the carboxylate groups of Glu42, Asp45, and Asp183, and Oη of Tyr233. There are two water molecules that lie within 3.2 Å of the 3- and 6-hydroxyl groups of the sugar ligand. The backbone peptidic groups of His43 and Gly180 provide hydrogen-bonding interactions with the 6- and 3-hydroxyl groups of galactose, respectively. The inorganic phosphate group is situated near Ser137. This residue is part of the conserved Motif II of the GHMP superfamily which, for the galactokinases, has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-X-X (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). In the L. lactis enzyme, the sequence is Pro131-Thr132-Ala133-Ser134-Gly135-Leu136-Ser137-Ser138-Ser139-Ala140. Pro131 initiates a Type I turn (Pro131 to Ser134) that connects β-strand E to the third α-helix of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2).Quite strikingly, the 1-hydroxyl group of galactose, which is phosphorylated during the reaction, is positioned within ∼3.1 Å of two of the phosphoryl oxygens of the inorganic phosphate and 3.0 Å of Nη2 of Arg36. The carboxylate side chain of Asp183 is located at 3.5 Å from the galactose 1-hydroxyl group, 3.3 Å from the 2-hydroxyl group, and 2.7 Å from one of the inorganic phosphate oxygens. This residue is strictly conserved in 56 of the galactokinase primary structures deposited in the SwissProt data bank. Arg36, as observed in the L. lactis galactokinase, is also strictly conserved in the 56-amino acid sequences deposited in the SwissProt data bank and is part of the conserved Motif I in the GMHP superfamily. In the L. lactis enzyme, Motif I has the following primary structure: Pro34-Gly35-Arg36-Ile37-Asn38-Leu39-Ile40-Gly41 and these residues form β-strand A (Fig. 2). Based on the observed geometry within the active site and the fact that these residues are strictly conserved, it can be speculated that Asp183 and Arg36 play key roles in catalysis.Comparison with Another Member of the GHMP Kinase Superfamily—As expected from amino acid sequence analyses, the overall topology of galactokinase is similar to that observed for homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2108890805,"The ERK MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase cascade modulates many cellular processes including transcription, adhesion, growth, survival, and proliferation. One target substrate of ERK involved in regulating transcription is the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) isozyme, RSK2. Here we demonstrate that a small death effector domain-containing protein called PEA-15 binds RSK2. RSK2 and PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes, 15 kDa) co-precipitated from cells and were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, purified PEA-15 bound in vitro translated RSK2, suggesting that these proteins interact directly. PEA-15 does not bind to RSK1 and therefore exhibits some binding specificity. RSK2 binds the COOH terminus of PEA-15 and does not interact with its NH2-terminal death effector domain. We show that this interaction has functional consequences including the inhibition of RSK2-dependent CREB transcription. PEA-15 expression also blocks histone H3 phosphorylation, an RSK2-dependent event that may contribute to effects on gene expression. These results can be attributed to two effects of PEA-15 on RSK2. First, PEA-15 blocks nuclear accumulation of RSK2 after epidermal growth factor stimulation. Second, PEA-15 inhibits RSK2 kinase activity by 50%. A mutant of PEA-15 that binds RSK2 but is localized to the nucleus had no effect on RSK2-dependent transcription. Interestingly, this mutant also did not affect RSK2 kinase activity. This may indicate that cytoplasmic retention of RSK2 is also required for PEA-15 to impair kinase activity. PEA-15 does not alter ERK phosphorylation of RSK2 and is not itself a substrate of RSK2. Hence the effects of PEA-15 on RSK2 represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of RSK2-mediated signaling.

MAP kinase cascade can regulate many cellular processes including transcription, adhesion, growth, survival, and proliferation. The canonical ERK MAP kinase cascade stimulated upon the binding of extracellular growth factors such as EGF to their respective transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors. The subsequent autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor on tyrosine leads to the recruitment of grb2, which binds the guanine exchange factor, SOS. Recruitment of SOS to the membrane promotes its interaction with the membrane localized H-Ras and results in GTP loading and activation of H-Ras (1Gutkind J.S. Sci. STKE. 2000; (2000/RE1)PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by the sequential recruitment and activation of Raf, MEK, and ERK. MEK binds and restricts inactive ERK to the cytosol (2Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The MEK and ERK complex dissociates when MEK is activated and phosphorylates ERK. The ERK may then dimerize and translocate into the nucleus by an active transport mechanism (3Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem.

Alternatively, ERK may phosphorylate cytoplasmic targets. The specific outcome of activation of this ubiquitous pathway is directed by interactions with differentially expressed substrate, scaffold, and adapter proteins (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar).One set of targets of ERK is the RSK family of proteins including RSK2 (8Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). RSK2 is a serine/threonine kinase activated by ERK1/2 MAP kinase and PDK1. Like other RSK family members, RSK2 consists of two kinase domains, an NH2-terminal catalytic domain (NTD) that is similar to protein kinases B and C and a COOH-terminal catalytic domain (CTD) that is similar to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I and II (9Jones S.W. Erikson E. Blenis J. Maller J.L. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Activation of RSK2 is complex. In response to growth factors like EGF, inactive RSK2 is phosphorylated by ERK at the catalytic loop of the CTD (10Richards S.A. Fu J. Romanelli A. Shimamura A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The CTD autophosphorylates RSK2 at serine 386 in the connecting domain (12Vik T.A. Ryder J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This enables further phosphorylation by the constitutively active kinase PDK1 at serine 227 in the NTD (10Richards S.A. Fu J. Romanelli A. Shimamura A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The NTD is the kinase domain responsible for phosphorylation of substrate molecules such as histone H3, CREB, and Akt (13Bjorbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutations in RSK2 are linked to Coffin Lowry syndrome in humans, an X-linked disease marked by cognitive disabilities and skeletal malformations (14Trivier E. De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Pannetier S. Zackai E. Young I. Mandel J.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Hanauer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In cells derived from Coffin Lowry syndrome patients, EGF-induced CREB phosphorylation and c-fos transcription did not occur (15De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Hence RSK2 appears to be required specifically for these functions. Finally, RSK2 is also required for EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 (16Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) implicating RSK2 in the regulation of chromatin remodeling. The regulation of RSK activity presents a complex problem that is just beginning to be solved.We have previously reported that the small death effector domain protein PEA-15 regulates the ERK MAP kinase pathway. PEA-15 is a 15-kDa protein that was originally identified as a major astrocytic phosphoprotein (17Araujo H. Danziger N. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5911-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Estelles A. Yokoyama M. Nothias F. Vincent J.D. Glowinski J. Vernier P. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14800-14806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first 80 amino acids of PEA-15 correspond to the canonical death effector domain (DED) sequence found in proteins that regulate apoptotic signaling pathways (19Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 20Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9621-9624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The remaining 51 amino acids contain a serine (Ser-104) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (17Araujo H. Danziger N. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5911-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a serine (Ser-116) phosphorylated by calcium calmodulin kinase II (21Kubes M. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PEA-15 blocks an H-Ras to integrin signal (22Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that PEA-15 blocks ERK-dependent transcription and proliferation by binding ERKs and preventing their accumulation in the nucleus (23Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). PEA-15 contains a nuclear export sequence required for its capacity to maintain ERK in the cytoplasm. Genetic deletion of PEA-15 results in increased ERK nuclear localization with a consequent increase in c-fos transcription and cell proliferation. Thus, PEA-15 can redirect the biological outcome of MAP kinase signaling by regulating the subcellular localization of ERK MAP kinase (23Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).We now show that PEA-15 binds RSK2 and alters its activity. PEA-15 does not bind to RSK1 and therefore appears to exhibit some binding specificity. PEA-15 expression impairs RSK2 kinase activity and prevents RSK2 accumulation in the nucleus. Moreover, PEA-15 blocks the ability of RSK2 to activate CREB mediated transcription and to phosphorylate histone H3. Hence we have identified a potentially crucial RSK2 binding partner that can regulate the outcome of RSK2 signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, DNA Constructs, Reagents, and Antibodies—HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and COS-7 cells were a gift from Dr. B.

PEA-15 was subcloned from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA3-HisC vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the His tag using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Protein expression was verified using both a PEA-15-specific antibody (from Dr. Hervé Chneiweiss) and a His-specific antibody (Novagen). RSK2 was cloned into pcDNA3 vector using forward primer 5′-GGATCCATGCCGCTGGCGCAGCTGGCGGAC-3′, which contains a BamHI restriction site, and a reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGTCACAGGGCTGTTGAGGTGATTTT-3′, which contains a XhoI restriction site.

EGF was obtained from Sigma.[35S]Methionine Labeling and GST Pull-downs—CHO-K1 cells were cultured to 90% confluency in a 100-mm tissue culture dish. Cells were then cultured for at least 4 h in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine. Cells were lysed in MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and then subjected to a pull-down assay using equal amounts of purified GST or GST-PEA-15 immobilized on agarose beads. The cell lysates were incubated with the purified proteins for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with MLB buffer and then once with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. The proteins were then cleaved with 1 unit of thrombin in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm of CaCl2. The beads were discarded, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed.Immunoprecipitations and Kinase Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected with pMT2 HA-RSK2 in 100-mm dishes. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were obtained by scraping the cells in cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell debris was discarded after centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used to immunoprecipitate HA-RSK2 using the monoclonal HA-antibody 12CA5. Lysates were incubated with the antibody for 2–3 h on ice. Immune complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed extensively in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl. For kinase assays, the precipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was used in an S6 peptide kinase assay (Upstate Biotechnology), while the other aliquot was subjected to immunoblotting to verify equal RSK2 precipitation. The kinase assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using an S6 peptide substrate to determine radiolabeled phosphate incorporation by scintillation counting. Alternatively, the S6 peptide was substituted with 10 μg of myelin basic protein, GST-PEA-15, or GST, and the reaction was arrested with sample buffer after 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography.His-tagged Protein Precipitations—His6-tagged constructs of PEA-15 (wt and mutants) were transfected into HeLa cells using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were cultured for 48 h prior to lysing with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer/100-mm dish. Lysates were obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. For each sample, 50 μl of Probond Ni+2 column (Invitrogen) was used after washing the column once with distilled water and lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with the columns for 45–60 min at 4 °C. The pellets with the bound protein were washed extensively with lysis buffer and finally resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for endogenous RSK2.Immunofluorescence Assays—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-RSK2 and GFP or PEA-15 fused to GFP. Cells were grown for 24 h and then serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 0, 20, or 50 min before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then stained overnight at 4 °C with anti-RSK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) in 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The antibody was detected using anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated antibody from Molecular Probes. The cells were imaged in a Zeiss Axiovert 100M fluorescent microscope using a 100X oil-immersion objective.Transcription Assays—Transcription assays for RSK2 activity were carried out using the Stratagene path detect kit specific for CREB-mediated transcription. The strategy involves the use of a Gal4DBD-tagged CREB construct (pFA2-CREB) and a luciferase construct carrying the Gal4 promoter region (pFR-Luc). Using this approach, only the effect of transfected CREB on luciferase expression is measured. 250 ng of pcDNA3 or PEA-15 (wt and mutants) was co-transfected with 500 ng of pFR-Luc and 50 ng of pFA2-CREB constructs. Cells were left serum-starved for 16–20 h prior to stimulation with 20% serum for 1 h. Luciferase readings were obtained using the Promega assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. To verify the specificity of the effect for RSK2, activated RSK2 (Y707A) was co-transfected along with the other plasmids, and cells were left serum-starved prior to lysis. Luciferase readings were obtained in a luminometer for 5 μg of total cellular protein according to the manufacturer's protocol.In Vitro Transcription/Translation—pcDNA3-RSK2 plasmid was used to transcribe RNA with a linked protein transcription/translation system (Ambion). The proteins were labeled using [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's protocol. One-tenth of the reaction was retained to load on the gel as input. The remaining 40 μl of the reaction was diluted to 500 μl in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Purified GST-PEA-15 or GST immobilized on agarose beads was used as bait to carry out a protein pull-down. The translation mixture containing full-length proteins was first precleared with GST for one-half hour at 4 °C. Equal amounts of GSTPEA-15 or GST were used for a pull-down experiment with the precleared reaction mixtures. The proteins were incubated for 2–3 h at 4 °C before washing the pellet extensively with MLB buffer. The samples were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, drying, and autoradiography.RESULTSPEA-15 Binds RSK2—We reported previously that the small death effector domain-containing protein, PEA-15, binds ERK1/2 and redirects traffic in the ERK MAP kinase pathway (23Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To identify other proteins that interact with PEA-15 and that might contribute to the effects on ERK signaling, we isolated PEA-15-interacting proteins from cell lysates by pull-down with GST-PEA-15 fusion proteins. We labeled CHO-K1 cells with [35S]methionine, prepared lysates from these cells, and ran the lysates over a glutathione-agarose column coated with GST-PEA-15 fusion protein containing full-length PEA-15 fused to glutathione S-transferase. In addition to bands the size of ERK1 and -2, we also saw a band at 90 kDa (Fig. 1A). The p90RSK proteins are targets of ERK1/2 (8Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and regulate transcription and cell survival events. We therefore tested whether the 90-kDa band was a member of the RSK family of proteins. Initial results showed that antibodies to RSK2 but not RSK1 reacted with a band in the GST-PEA-15 pull-down at 90 kDa (data not shown). To determine whether the PEA-15 could precipitate RSK2, we transfected HeLa cells with a His-tagged PEA-15 or the vector alone and isolated the over-expressed PEA-15 and any binding partners on a Ni+2 column. We observed that endogenous RSK2 co-precipitated with PEA-15 (Fig. 1B). Protein expression and pull-down were verified by Western blotting as indicated.To determine whether the interaction is direct, we used a linked in vitro transcription and translation system to produce [35S]methionine-labeled RSK2 and RSK1 proteins. We then mixed the labeled RSKs with agarose beads coated with purified GST-PEA-15. As controls we included GST-coated agarose beads. PEA-15 binds RSK2 but not RSK1 or GST (Fig. 1C). Hence PEA-15 and RSK2 can interact directly as purified proteins.To confirm the interaction we used an additional in vivo assay to isolate the protein complex. We co-transfected His tagged PEA-15 with HA-tagged RSK2 in COS-7 cells and allowed expression for 48 h. We then immunoprecipitated RSK2 using an anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and immunoblotted for PEA-15. We found a significant amount of PEA-15 co-immunoprecipitated with RSK2 (Fig. 1D). Additionally, we were able to observe endogenous PEA-15 that had also been precipitated in a complex with RSK2 (data not shown). Thus we have shown that PEA-15 and RSK2 interact with each other and that the interaction is direct.To determine the regions of PEA-15 that may be necessary for this interaction, we used point mutants of PEA-15 in the DED as well as the COOH-terminal regions of the protein. These two regions have been shown to be important for the interaction of PEA-15 with ERK, and mutations in these regions affect the ability of PEA-15 to alter ERK function (24Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The D74A mutation in the DED and the L123R mutation in the COOH-terminal tail abolish ERK binding to PEA-15 in vitro, and these mutants were therefore used as representatives. We also used a previously characterized point mutant in the nuclear export sequence of PEA-15 (I15A), which allows PEA-15 accumulation in the nucleus. We observed that whereas the D74A mutant and the I15A mutant bind RSK2 in vivo, the L123R tail mutant does not (Fig. 1E). Hence the interaction of PEA-15 with RSK2 involves the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. Furthermore, although the D74A mutation completely prevents ERK binding it has no effect on RSK2 binding. This supports a model in which PEA-15 can interact with ERK1/2 and RSK2 independently.Because PEA-15 binds RSK2, we determined whether the two proteins co-localize in the cell. We found that whereas PEA-15 appeared to be strongly co-localized with RSK2, control cells transfected with GFP did not show similar co-localization patterns (Fig. 2). Neither PEA-15 nor RSK2 appeared to be confined to any particular compartment of the cytoplasm but instead, under these conditions, were diffusely distributed throughout. These co-localization experiments provided further in vivo evidence for an interaction between PEA-15 and RSK2. Thus we have shown that PEA-15 interacts directly with RSK2, co-localizing with it in the cell, and that the interaction involves the COOH-terminal domain of PEA-15.Fig. 2RSK2 and PEA-15 co-localize in the cell. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-RSK2 and GFP or PEA-15 fused to GFP. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with anti-RSK2 antibody, and detected using Texas Red antibody. Detail panels show close-ups of regions with distinct co-localization of RSK2 and PEA-15. GFP controls do not show co-localization with RSK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PEA-15 Affects RSK2-dependent Transcription—Having found that PEA-15 binds to RSK2, we sought to determine whether PEA-15 expression affects RSK2 function. One known function of RSK2 is the activation of the transcription factor CREB (15De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 25Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). To examine the functional consequences of PEA-15 binding to RSK2 we carried out in vivo transcription assays using a CREB-driven luciferase construct in the Path-detect system. Cells were treated with serum or not and then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as a measure of CREB-mediated activation of transcription. Cells transfected with PEA-15 showed impaired CREB activity (Fig. 3). For comparison, PEA-15 had little impact on the activation of the c-Jun transcription factor.Fig. 3PEA-15 inhibits CREB mediated transcription. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with PEA-15, a luciferase reporter construct, pFRLuc, and pFA2CREB or pFA-cJun. Cells were serum-starved for 16–20 h prior to stimulation with serum. 5 μg of total protein was used for the luciferase assay. Lysates were blotted to verify protein expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then sought to exclude the possibility that PEA-15 blocks CREB activation by an RSK2-independent mechanism. We therefore examined whether PEA-15 expression could alter activation of CREB by an activated mutant of RSK2 (Fig. 4, Y707A). PEA-15 was co-transfected with the activated RSK2 construct. Cells transfected with wt PEA-15 strongly inhibited RSK2-dependent CREB-mediated transcription (Fig. 4). Furthermore a non-ERK-binding tail mutant (L123R) and the nuclear export sequence mutant, I15A, did not inhibit transcription (Fig. 4). Activated RSK2 expression was verified by blotting for RSK2 in the lysates (Fig. 4). Hence, PEA-15 is able to impair RSK2 activation of CREB.Fig. 4PEA-15 inhibits RSK2-specific CREB transcription. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with activated RSK2 (Y707A) and PEA-15, mutants, or vector control. The cells were left serum-starved for 16–20 h prior to lysis. 5 μg of total protein was used for the luciferase assay, and lysates were blotted to verify protein expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Over-expression of PEA-15 Decreases Phosphorylation of Histone H3—RSK2 is reportedly required for the phosphorylation of Histone H3 (16Sassone-Corsi P.

To further determine the functional consequences of PEA-15 expression on RSK2 kinase, we examined the effect of PEA-15 on the RSK2-specific nuclear substrate histone H3. We co-transfected COS-7 cells with RSK2 and PEA-15 or vector control. The MEK inhibitor was used to remove the high background phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10, which was observable even upon serum starvation (data not shown and previous reports). Cells were then stimulated with EGF. We observed that PEA-15 expression blocked H3 phosphorylation compared with the vector control"
https://openalex.org/W2024476402,"Growing evidence suggests that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of podocytes plays a central role in the glomerular disease of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). As an approach to identify host genes involved in the pathogenesis of the sclerotic glomerular lesion in HIVAN, representational difference analysis of cDNA was used to identify differentially expressed genes in HIV-1 transgenic and nontransgenic podocytes. We isolated a novel member of the small leucine-rich repeat (SLR) protein family, podocan, that is expressed at high levels in the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. In normal embryonic kidney, a 3.2-kb podocan transcript was detected at low levels, and expression increased dramatically within 24 h following birth. Expression of a 2.3-kb transcript became evident after birth and gradually increased to 50% of the total podocan RNA in the mature kidney. Phylogenetically, podocan represents a new class in the SLR protein gene family, an expanding protein family sharing homology with the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans. The 3.2-kb transcript encodes a predicted 611-amino acid secretory protein with 20 leucine-rich repeats, a unique N-terminal cysteine-rich cluster pattern and a highly acidic C-terminal domain. In situ hybridization of normal kidney revealed podocan mRNA expression in podocytes and likely vascular endothelial cells within the glomerulus. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of podocan protein in normal kidney glomeruli was consistent with that of the glomerular basement membrane, and staining was markedly increased in sclerotic glomerular lesions in the transgenic HIVAN model. Thus, podocan defines a new class within the SLR protein family and is a previously unrecognized component of the sclerotic glomerular lesion that develops in the course of experimental HIVAN.

HIVAN occurs almost exclusively in Blacks and Hispanics, suggesting that genetic factors play an important role in susceptibility to disease (1D'Agati V. Appel G.B. J. Am. Soc.

Infect. 1998; 74: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings of HIVAN include proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), often of the collapsing variant, combined with microcystic tubulointerstitial disease (6Cohen A.H. Nast C.C. Mod. Pathol. 1988; 1: 87-97PubMed Google Scholar, 7D'Agati V. Suh J.I. Carbone L. Cheng J.T. Appel G.

The disease untreated can be rapidly progressive, resulting in renal failure often within only weeks or months of the initial diagnosis. Evidence now indicates that HIV-1 infection of renal epithelial cells plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of HIVAN. Transgenic mice expressing the HIV-1 envelope and regulatory genes under the control of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter develop renal disease that is virtually identical to that seen in humans (9Dickie P. Felser J. Eckhaus M. Bryant J. Silver J. Marinos N. Notkins A.L. Virology. 1991; 185: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Kopp J.B. Klotman M.E. Adler S.H. Bruggeman L.A. Dickie P.

Reciprocal renal transplantation studies between HIV-1 transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates reveal that the development of renal disease is intrinsic to the kidney expressing the HIV-1 transgene (11Bruggeman L.A. Dikman S. Meng C. Quaggin S.E. Coffman T.M. Klotman P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In human kidney, we demonstrated the presence of HIV-1 mRNA and DNA in renal tubular epithelial cells and parietal and visceral epithelial cells of the glomerulus in HIVAN renal biopsy samples by in situ hybridization and in situ DNA PCR (12Bruggeman L.A. Ross M.D. Tanji N. Cara A. Dikman S. Gordon R.E. Burns G.C. D'Agati V.D. Winston J.A. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2079-2087PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of HIV-1 RNA expression in patients is remarkably similar to that observed in the transgenic HIVAN model. More recently, PCR was used to amplify HIV proviral sequences from individual renal tubules obtained by laser capture microdissection and from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same patients (13Marras D. Bruggeman L.A. Gao F. Tanji N. Mansukhani M.M. Cara A. Ross M.D. Gusella G.L. Benson G. D'Agati V.D. Hahn B.H. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Quasispecies analysis of the HIV-1 gp120 sequences obtained revealed that HIV-1 replication is supported by tubular epithelial cells and that replication in the renal epithelial compartment is distinct from the peripheral blood. One of the most distinctive pathological features of HIVAN is collapsing FSGS. This morphological feature is accompanied by evidence of HIV-1 infection of podocytes and consequent loss of normal function. The development of the FSGS lesion in HIVAN correlates with the loss or reduction of critical podocyte differentiation markers, most notably in collapsed glomeruli (14Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 15Barisoni L. Bruggeman L.A. Mundel P. D'Agati V.D. Klotman P.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p57, as well as an increase in the expression of cyclin A and the proliferative marker Ki-67, is also observed (14Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 15Barisoni L. Bruggeman L.A. Mundel P. D'Agati V.D. Klotman P.E.

Collectively, these changes represent a dysregulated podocyte phenotype characteristic of collapsing FSGS. In this study, we begin to explore the relationship between HIV-1 gene expression in podocytes and the pathogenic host response that results in the FSGS lesion of HIVAN. To approach this, we used representational difference analysis (RDA) of cDNA to identify host genes that are differentially expressed in podocytes bearing an HIV-1 transgene. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a novel small leucine-rich repeat (SLR) protein that is overexpressed in the sclerotic glomerular lesion of HIVAN. Phylogenetically, podocan represents a new class within this family of proteins that bear in common their homology to the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) (17Iozzo R. Murdoch A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that podocan is expressed in normal glomeruli in a pattern consistent with that of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and accumulates at high levels as a previously unrecognized component of the FSGS lesion of HIVAN. RDA of cDNA—Propagation and differentiation of the conditionally immortalized HIV-1 transgenic and wild-type podocytes were performed as previously reported (18Schwartz E.J. Cara A. Snoeck H. Ross M.D. Sunamoto M. Reiser J. Mundel P. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1677-1684PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to all experiments, the podocytes were cultured for 14 days under “nonpermissive” conditions to induce maximal differentiation. RDA of cDNA was performed as described by Hubank and Schatz (19Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and carried out through the generation of the second difference product. The nontransgenic driver was supplemented with 4 μg of the plasmid DNA used to generate the HIV-1 transgenic line (pNL4-3:d1443) digested with DpnI. Cloning the Mouse and Human Podocan cDNAs—The mouse podocan cDNA was isolated by screening a λ-ZapII (Stratagene) cDNA phage library, generated from size-selected poly(A)+ RNA from the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes, with a 0.7-kb novel difference product obtained by RDA. The mouse podocan cDNA sequence was used to identify homologous human genomic and expressed sequence tag entries in the GenBank™ data base. Oligonucleotide primers were designed from the available human sequences in regions predicted to flank the human podocan coding sequence 2The nucleotide sequences used to design the PCR primers for the amplification of the human podocan coding sequence can be obtained from the GenBank™ data base under the following accession numbers: 5′ sequences, GenBank™ accession numbers AL445183, BG721369, and AC022728; 3′ sequence, GenBank™ accession number AW361218.; sense (5′-gacttgaatggaaggagc-3′) and antisense (5′-catttgcatcaccttgtcactat-3′) human podocan was amplified from adult human kidney RNA (Stratagene) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the following PCR parameters: 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. Analysis of Podocan RNA Expression—Whole cell RNA was isolated from the cultured podocytes using TriReagent (Sigma), and 10 μg of each sample was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a 0.45-μm Biodyne A nylon membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory), and probed with the random labeled 0.7-kb difference product. To analyze the temporal regulation of podocan expression, kidneys were isolated from FVB/N embryos harvested at embryonic day 14–18 and from postnatal mice ranging in age from postnatal day 0 to day 64. Northern blot analysis of whole cell RNA was performed as above using 15 μg of each RNA sample and the full-length mouse podocan 3.2-kb cDNA insert as the probe. Tissue preparation and mRNA in situ hybridization of paraffinembedded thin sections were performed using kidney from adult FVB/N mice as previously described (11Bruggeman L.A. Dikman S. Meng C. Quaggin S.E. Coffman T.M. Klotman P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For synthesis of the digoxigenin riboprobes, a 296-bp fragment of the mouse podocan cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Sense (5′-aggtggttgtgagtcatcccagag-3′) and antisense (5′-accagcactggctgattctcttcc-3′) oligonucleotide primers were used for amplification with the following parameters: 1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. Production and Affinity Purification of Anti-podocan Antibodies— The NcoI-NheI fragment of the mouse podocan cDNA was subjected to a fill-in reaction using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment to produce blunt ends (Klenow-blunted) and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGEX-5X1 bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in BL-21(DE3) cells, and bacterial lysates were prepared using BugBuster (Novagen). The insoluble fraction containing the fusion protein was sonicated in 1.5% SDS and separated by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein was visualized in the gel by Coomassie staining, excised, and provided to Research Genetics (Invitrogen) for extraction and production of rabbit anti-podocan polyclonal antiserum. The anti-podocan polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified using a modification of a procedure described by Hale et al. (20Hale J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Klenowblunted NcoI-NheI fragment from the mouse podocan cDNA was cloned into the XhoI site of the pET-15b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) following treatment with the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment as above. The resulting His-tagged protein was expressed as above in a 500-ml culture volume, and the bacteria were lysed in 20 ml of Bug-Buster reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol supplemented with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). The soluble fraction was clarified through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Millex-HV; Millipore Corp.), imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and 10 ml was used to hydrate five SwellGel cobalt-chelated discs (Pierce) in a disposable chromatography column (Pierce). The lysate was incubated at 4 °C overnight with the SwellGel resin on a rocking platform. The 10-ml bacterial lysate was drained from the column by gravity flow, combined with the remaining lysate, and passed an additional two times over the hydrated SwellGel column. The column was then washed with 30 ml of 1× PBS. To oxidize the cobalt, 10 ml of 1× PBS containing 0.3% H2O2 was added to the column and incubated at 25 °C with the SwellGel resin on a rocking platform for 1 h. The column was then drained by gravity flow and washed again with 30 ml of 1× PBS. To block any unbound cobalt, 1 ml of normal rabbit serum (obtained from Research Genetic for animal prescreening) was diluted with 4 ml of 1× PBS, incubated with the resin for 15 min, and drained by gravity flow. The column was washed with 10 ml of IgG elution buffer (Pierce) followed by 30 ml of 1× PBS. The anti-podocan polyclonal serum (20 ml) was passed three times over the affinity resin followed by a 30-ml wash with 1× PBS. The antibodies were eluted with 10 ml of IgG elution buffer, collected in 1-ml fractions, and adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 n NaOH. A 15-μl aliquot from each fraction was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Fractions in which IgG could be visualized by Coomassie staining were then pooled for use in subsequent experiments. Expression and Detection of Secreted Podocan in Cultured Cells—The HindIII-NdeI fragment of the mouse podocan cDNA was cloned into the HindIII-XbaI-digested pCDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) following Klenow blunting of the NdeI and XbaI sites. The resulting expression vector encoding the full-length mouse podocan protein (pC-mPCAN) and control vector (pCDNA3.1) were transfected into HEK-293T cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were washed three times in 1× PBS 24 h post-transfection and cultured an additional 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of phenol red and fetal bovine serum. Similarly, HIV-1 transgenic and nontransgenic podocytes were washed three times with 1× PBS and cultured 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of phenol red and fetal bovine serum. Supernatants were harvested, passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter, and concentrated 10-fold using Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filters (Amicon). The samples (15 μl each) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp.). Western blot was performed using a 1:5000 dilution of the affinity-purified anti-podocan antibody and a 1:7500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry). Chemiluminescence for Western blot detection was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunolocalization of Podocan in Kidney—Kidneys were isolated from adult HIV-1 transgenic and nontransgenic age-matched littermates and frozen in Cryo-Gel embedding medium (Instrumedics). Thin sections (5 μm) prepared using the CryoJane Tape-Transfer System (Instrumedics) were fixed for 7 min in ice-cold acetone and washed three times in 1× PBS, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation for 15 min in 7.5% H2O2. Tissue staining was performed using the TSA Plus DNP (horseradish peroxidase) and (Cy3) Systems (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The anti-podocan and preimmune sera were used at a dilution of 1:500 with overnight incubations at 4 °C. The biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry) secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200, and the streptavidin/biotinhorseradish peroxidase complex was prepared using Vectastain ABC Elite reagents (Vector Laboratories). The rat anti-mouse laminin A chain antibody (Chemicon) and Cy2-labeled goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry) were used at dilutions of 1:400 and 1:500, respectively. Chromogenic development was performed using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Vector Laboratories). Identification of Candidate Genes in HIVAN Pathogenesis— RDA of cDNA was used to identify host genes that were differentially regulated in podocytes expressing an HIV-1 transgene. More than 250 difference products were analyzed corresponding to 29 differentially expressed genes between the cell populations. Included in the differentially expressed genes were several adhesion molecules, cell surface receptors, transcription factors, known extracellular matrix components, and previously uncharacterized cDNAs. Among the novel cDNAs was a 0.7-kb difference product predicted to be up-regulated in the HIV-1 transgenic cells. Although the nucleotide sequence of the 0.7 kb difference product matched only expressed sequence tags and genomic sequence entries in the GenBank™ data base, the predicted translation product from this sequence was found to be highly homologous to members of the SLRP family. SLRPs are known to play critical roles in regulating and maintaining the organization of collagen fibrils within a variety of extracellular matrices. Since no SLRP family member has been identified within the GBM, we hypothesized that this novel protein may be important to the formation and maintenance of collagen fibril organization within this extracellular matrix. Using the 0.7-kb difference product as a probe for Northern blot of RNA from the podocytes used for the RDA, expression of a 3.2-kb transcript was detected at high levels in the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes as compared with nontransgenic podocytes (Fig. 1). These results confirm that the gene corresponding to the novel difference product was differentially expressed in the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. Cloning the Mouse and Human Podocan cDNAs—The 3.2-kb cDNA corresponding to our isolated difference product was cloned using a cDNA phage library generated from the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. The cDNA was predicted to encode a 611-amino acid secretory protein that we have named podocan. Initial characterization indicated that podocan is a novel member of the SLR protein family. For comparative analysis, the coding sequence of human podocan was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from adult human kidney RNA. Human podocan was found to be greater than 91% identical to its mouse homolog at the amino acid level (Fig. 2A). Podocan Defines a New Fifth Class in the SLR Protein Gene Family—Phylogenetic analysis of podocan with the known mouse SLR proteins indicates that podocan defines a new class within this protein family (Fig. 2B). Although podocan shares much of its structural organization with the well characterized proteoglycans within this family, it is unique in many respects. Each SLRP family member contains a class-specific N-terminal cysteine-rich cluster preceding its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Podocan exhibits a unique cysteine-rich cluster pattern of CX 3CXCX 7C, where X denotes any amino acid and the subscript indicates the number of intervening residues (Fig. 2A). Based on studies by Matsushima et al. (21Matsushima N. Ohyanagi T. Tanaka T. Kretsinger R.H. Proteins. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of tandem LRR evolution within the SLRP family, the central domain of SLRPs can be characterized by a series of type S and/or type T LRRs. Class I and II proteins contain 12 LRRs composed of four tandem STT superrepeat units. Class III proteins have seven LRRs organized as four ST superrepeats, where the second superrepeat lacks the type S LRR. Chondroadherin, the only identified member of class IV, is composed of 10 type T LRRs. Although podocan shares the STT superrepeat structure of the class I and II proteins, the LRR domain of podocan is much larger, containing seven tandem STT superrepeats (Fig. 2A). Due to a nonconserved substitution of the terminal leucine with glutamic acid in the C-terminal type T LRR, however, we have determined that podocan contains 20 and not 21 complete LRRs. In addition, podocan lacks the C-terminal cysteine residues present in other SLRP family members and has a distinct acidic C-terminal domain. In addition to differences in protein primary structure, podocan also differs from the class I–IV SLRPs with respect to genomic organization. Alignment of the mouse podocan cDNA with the newly available mouse genomic data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information indicates that the gene is composed of 13 exons, including nine coding exons, residing on chromosome 4 (data not shown). Human podocan was found to share all of the features described for the mouse protein and also conserves the genomic organization of its coding exons (Fig. 2A and data not shown). This analysis leads us to conclude that podocan is the first identified member of a new class V SLR protein. Podocan Expression in the Kidney Is Developmentally Regulated—Analysis of podocan expression by Northern blot of normal mouse kidney RNA indicated that two podocan transcripts were expressed with distinct temporal regulation (Fig. 3). Expression of the cloned 3.2-kb podocan transcript was evident in the kidney at low levels from embryonic day 14 through birth (Fig. 3). A dramatic increase in the expression of the 3.2-kb transcript occurred within the fist 24 h of life, and maximal levels coincided with the completion of nephrogenesis at ∼2 weeks of age. Expression of an additional podocan transcript 2.3 kb in size was evident in the second week of life. In the adult kidney, expression levels of the 3.2- and 2.3-kb transcripts were approximately equivalent. Efforts to isolate and characterize the 2.3-kb transcript are ongoing. Glomerular Distribution of Podocan mRNA Expression in the Kidney—RNA in situ hybridization was performed to localize podocan expression in the normal adult mouse kidney. Staining of the hybridized riboprobe appeared restricted to the glomeruli of the adult kidney (Fig. 4). Under high magnification, staining of podocan RNA was clearly evident in the cytoplasm of podocytes within the glomerulus. Staining also appeared to be present in the cytoplasm of vascular endothelial cells within the glomerulus. The observed expression pattern of podocan within the glomerulus suggested that it may be a previously unrecognized component of the mature glomerular basement membrane. Detection of Secreted Podocan in Cultured Cell Supernatants—To characterize podocan expression at the protein level, polyclonal antibodies were raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the N-terminal 203 amino acids of the mouse podocan protein. The antiserum was subsequently affinity-purified and used for Western blot analysis of serum-free cell culture supernatants. In the supernatant of both HIV-1 transgenic podocytes and HEK-293T cells transfected with a mouse podocan expression vector, a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa was detected (Fig. 5). No reactivity was seen with supernatants from the nontransgenic podocytes or vector control-transfected HEK-293T cells. The disparity between the predicted molecular mass of the secreted core protein of 66 kDa and the observed molecular mass of 95 kDa indicates that podocan is probably subject to post-translational modification. Furthermore, these results confirm that podocan is secreted from the podocyte. Distribution of Podocan Protein in the Normal Kidney and in the Transgenic HIVAN Model—Immunodetection was performed to localize podocan protein in frozen kidney sections of normal adult and HIV-1 transgenic adult mice. In normal kidney, podocan was seen in the glomerulus in a pattern consistent with GBM staining (Fig. 6). Podocan staining was also observed in the afferent arterioles and interlobular arteries in sections where these structures were seen. This latter finding suggests that the vascular endothelial cells of the glomerulus and proximal vessels probably contribute to the deposition of podocan in their associated basement membranes. In the HIV-1 transgenic kidney, podocan staining in normal appearing glomeruli was comparable with the nontransgenic kidney (Fig. 6). In contrast, affected glomeruli showed a marked accumulation of podocan protein in sclerotic lesions. In the HIV-1 transgenic kidney sections evaluated, few glomeruli could be identified that did not have some degree of focal podocan accumulation. No staining was observed in normal or HIV-1 transgenic kidney using preimmune serum from the animal in which the anti-podocan antibodies were raised. Our results indicate that podocan is dysregulated in diseased glomeruli in the HIV-1 transgenic mouse and is an integral component of the FSGS lesion. The objective of our study was to better understand how HIV-1 gene expression in podocytes leads to the FSGS lesion of HIVAN. Using RDA of cDNA, we identified a novel SLR protein that is expressed at high levels in HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. Immunohistochemical localization of podocan in normal kidney demonstrates that it is expressed in glomeruli in a pattern consistent with GBM staining. In the HIV-1 transgenic mouse, however, podocan accumulates at high levels in FSGS lesions. These findings suggest that HIV-1 may directly or indirectly induce overexpression of podocan, thus contributing to the development of the sclerotic glomerular lesion of HIVAN. The SLRP family members have been shown to have a variety of diverse functions including inhibition of cellular proliferation through the induction of p21 (22De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A.

It has been shown that decorin, administered as either purified protein or using a gene therapy approach, can reduce the development of glomerular sclerosis in an anti-Thy-1 model of glomerulonephritis (33Border W.A.

Furthermore, increased glomerular expression of decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican has been demonstrated in several forms of renal disease (35Schaefer L. Grone H.J. Raslik I. Robenek H.

Thus, increased expression of decorin and other SLRPs capable of binding transforming growth factor-β may be a protective mechanism in renal disease. The role of SLRPs in modulating collagen fibrillogenesis is perhaps the most well established function of SLRP proteins. Whereas several family members have been shown to directly interact with collagen fibrils in vitro (38Scott J.E. Orford C.R. Biochem.

Individual targeted disruptions of decorin, fibromodulin, lumican, or biglycan all result in ultrastructural abnormalities of the collagen fibrils with which they are associated (44Chakravarti S.

Although further studies will be necessary to confirm the localization of podocan within the glomerulus, we have postulated that it is a component of the GBM. We have demonstrated that podocan is secreted from podocytes cultured in vitro and is present in the glomerulus in a pattern consistent with that of the GBM. Although a similar staining pattern would be observed by confocal microscopy if podocan were localized to podocyte foot processes or the slit diaphragm, staining of podocan in the proximal vasculature outside of the glomerulus suggests that this is unlikely. As such, podocan may in part serve to modulate fibrillogenesis in the mature GBM and help to maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Studies to localize podocan in the kidney by electron microscopy and to determine the ability of podocan to interact with type IV collagen are ongoing. As can be seen with proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (48Grover J. Chen X.N. Korenberg J.R. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Genomics. 1996; 38: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Grover J. Roughley P.J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and as is probably true of asporin (50Henry S.P. Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12201-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), podocan is probably secreted as a glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan. The mouse podocan protein does not contain a serine/glycine dipeptide consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan attachment as is typical of SLRPs in the N-terminal region preceding the LRR domain. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the secreted mouse podocan protein reveals a sharp band migrating with an apparent molecular mass only 30 kDa greater than the predicted molecular mass of the core protein (Fig. 4). This disparity may be the result of N-linked glycosylation for which the mouse and human podocan proteins have five and four potential glycosylation sites, respectively. The human podocan protein does have a serine/glycine dipeptide shortly after the predicted signal sequence cleavage site. This sequence, however, may not serve as a glycosaminoglycan attachment site, since the molecular weight of human podocan when expressed in HEK-293T cells is indistinguishable from its mouse homolog (data not shown). Although more definitive studies of post-translational modifications will be necessary, podocan is likely to represent an additional member of the SLR protein family that is secreted as a glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan. We have concluded from our phylogenetic analysis that podocan represents a fifth class in the SLR protein family. In addition to having the largest LRR domain of all of the SLR proteins identified, podocan has a unique N-terminal cysteine-rich pattern, lacks C-terminal cysteine residues and differs from other SLR proteins with respect to its genomic organization. The highly charged acidic C-terminal domain of podocan may be of considerable importance with respect to its potential role in the mature GBM. It has been known for over 2 decades that the negatively charged heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans of the GBM proteoglycans are critical to maintaining charge selection of the glomerular filtration barrier (52Kanwar Y.S. Linker A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Determining the molecular interactions of podocan in the GBM with collagen and the highly charged proteoglycans may prove insightful to understanding the architecture necessary for maintaining both size and charge selection of the glomerular filter. Furthermore, it may help elucidate how the dysregulation of podocan expression in HIVAN may contribute to the pathogenesis of FSGS. We thank Dr. Laura Gillim for critical review of the manuscript.

The proposal suggesting the presence of VDAC in extramitochondrial locations has received recent strong support from two independent reports: 1) the identification of a VDAC isoform (pl-VDAC) that contains a leader sequence for its trafficking to the plasma membrane (16Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and 2) the presence of VDAC in caveolae (17Bathori G. Parolini I. Tombola F. Szabo I. Messina A. Oliva M. De Pinto V. Lisanti M. Sargiacomo M. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29607-29612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have evaluated the presence of VDAC in the plasma membrane of C1300 neuroblastoma cells and, more interestingly, its contribution to the Maxi Cl– currents activated by antiestrogens in these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—C1300 mouse neuroblastoma cells, obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, Clare Hall, Herts, UK, were cultured as described previously (8Diaz M. Bahamonde M.I. Lock H. Muñoz F.J. Hardy S.P. Posas F. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 79-88Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For experimental procedures, cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes (NUNC) or 13-mm glass coverslips treated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml for 1 h). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Toremifene was obtained from Farmos, Torku, Finland.Preparation of Cell Lysates and Plasma Membrane Fractions—T-75 flasks containing confluent cells were washed three times with 5 ml of PBS without calcium, magnesium, and sodium bicarbonate (Invitrogen). After the final wash, 600–1,000 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Brij-35, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) was added per T-75 flask. The cell lysate was transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, rocked for 30 min at 4 °C, and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot was removed from the supernatant and stored at –20 °C for subsequent determination of protein concentration (Method DC protein assay, BioRad). The remaining supernatant was aliquoted into cryotubes and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen before being stored at –70 °C. Plasma membrane proteins were isolated using a previously described protocol (18Graeser D. Neubig R.R. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. First Edition. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 23-35Google Scholar, 19Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The primary antibodies used were: monoclonal mouse anti-porin 31 HL (Calbiochem) raised against the N terminus of human VDAC1 (1:2,000 dilution), monoclonal mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) to the corresponding complex of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, and goat polyclonal anti-ribophorin I (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes integral membrane glycoproteins that localize exclusively to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Non-specific binding was avoided by incubating the nitrocellulose membranes in a blocking solution consisting of Tween 20-Tris buffer solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Mouse and rabbit antibodies were detected either with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG at a 1:500 dilution (Calbiochem)) or peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (sheep anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG, both at a 1:2,000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences)). The membranes were then washed, and the bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate Super Signal (Pierce) and autoradiographed on either Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL or nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt solution for detection of alkaline phosphatase.Confocal Microscopy—Double-label analysis was carried out on C1300 cells adhered to glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.15 m sucrose, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton for 10 min. Prior to antibody incubation, cells were treated with NH4Cl for 30 min to minimize the number of reactive aldehyde groups and blocked for 30–60 min (room temperature) with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in washing buffer. Cells were then incubated with anti-porin 31 HL (20Reymann S. Kiafard Z. Rohm B. Strutz N. Hesse D. Kratzin H.D. Zimmermann B. Thinnes F.P. Hilschmann N. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)(1:80) or rabbit anti-caveolin-1 (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound antibody was removed by washing the cells three times with 1 ml of blocking solution for 10 min each time. Staining with FITC-labeled cholera toxin β subunit (CTXβ) was performed under non-permeabilized conditions by incubating the cells with blocking solution for 30 min and then staining them with FITC-CTXβ for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. Following several washes in blocking solution, cells were incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:500) and/or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to the fluorochrome Cy3 (1:2,000) for1hat room temperature. Prior to incubation, the secondary antibody was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet any precipitated constituents. Negative controls were performed in which the cells were solely incubated with the secondary antibody. Digital images were taken with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope and analyzed with Leica confocal software (Heidelberg, Germany).Antisense Oligonucleotides—Cells were seeded in 24-well dishes (NUNC) at a concentration of 104 cells/well 2 days before transfection. On reaching 60% confluency, the cells were exposed to an antisense oligonucleotide hybridizing to the pl-VDAC specific leader sequence (5′-CAC GAG AAA GAA TGA ACA C-3′) and then plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. β-Globin antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA ATT TAT A-3′) was used as the negative control. Immediately before transfection, cells were washed and placed in 200 μl of fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Each well received 200 ng of antisense pl-VDAC plus 100 ng of pEGFP plasmid (Clontech) diluted into 25 μl of serum-free DMEM. Cells were transfected by a LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) procedure following the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the cells were used for both path-clamp and immunofluorescence experiments.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as described previously (19Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, RNA was isolated from C1300 cells using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düven, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA. We used the following primer pair for PCR amplification of pl-VDAC (16Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar): forward, 5′-TGT GTT CAT TCT TTC TCG TGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA GTG TTC GGC GAG AAT GAC-3′. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide.Electrophysiology and Statistics—C1300-transfected cells were plated on 13-mm poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and mounted on the stage of an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope. Ion currents were recorded 48–72 h after transfection using the inside-out or whole-cell patch clamp modes as described previously (8Diaz M. Bahamonde M.I. Lock H. Muñoz F.J. Hardy S.P. Posas F. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 79-88Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for pulse generation, data acquisition through an Axon Digidata A/D interface, and subsequent analysis. Borosilicate glass patch pipettes had 3–5 megaohms resistance and were filled with a solution containing 140 mm N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (295 mosmol/liter, pH 7.3). ATP (4 mm) and GTP (0.1 mm) were added to the pipette solution for whole-cell experiments. Cells were bathed in a solution containing 140 mm N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (305 mosmol/liter, pH 7.4), which was also the solution bathing the cytoplasmic face of the patch membrane in inside-out experiments. Data were collected using a List Medical d-6100 Darmstadt or Axopatch 200A amplifier. Inside-out currents were acquired at 1 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Membrane patches were clamped at 0 mV and pulsed for 5 s to both –80 mV and +80 mV. Whole-cell currents were acquired at 5 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Cells were clamped at 0 mV and pulsed for 500 ms from –80 to +80 mV in 40-mV steps before and after addition of toremifene (10 μm) to the bath solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–26 °C). Data are expressed as means ±S.E. Differences between the three different groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons. Data are taken as significant at a probability of 0.05.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe presence of VDAC protein on C1300 cells was tested by Western blot (Fig. 1). The monoclonal anti-VDAC antibody used (anti-31HL, in particular Ab-2) was raised against an N-terminal synthetic peptide (21Babel D. Walter G. Gotz H. Thinnes F.P. Jurgens L. Konig U. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a Western blot obtained from a membrane fraction or whole lysate of C1300 cells. A single band of ∼32 kDa, which is the expected size for VDAC, was obtained from both preparations, indicating the absence of cross-reactivity with other cellular proteins. Contamination of the membrane fraction with organelle membranes was tested with antibodies against the cytochrome oxidase IV (a mitochondrial marker) or ribophorin I (endoplasmic reticulum marker). Fig. 1B shows that our membrane preparation is negative for the mitochondrial marker but positive for the marker of the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle where the presence of VDAC has already been reported (22Lewis T.M. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 181: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The experiments shown in Fig. 1, A and B, are consistent with the targeting of VDAC through two different pathways: the plasma membrane (via the endoplasmic reticulum/golgi pathway) and the mitochondria. The lack of a mechanism to explain how this protein is selected for its targeting to the plasma membrane, instead of the outer mitochondrial membrane, has fuelled the reticence to accept its extramitochondrial localization (15Yu W.H. Forte M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the recent identification of an alternative exon in the murine vdac-1 gene evidenced a plasmalemmal form of VDAC (pl-VDAC) with an N-terminal leader sequence for its targeting to the plasma membrane (16Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The presence of a pl-VDAC form in C1300 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers specific to the pl-VDAC, including the leader sequence (Fig. 1C). A band of the expected size (350 bp) was identified and confirmed to be pl-VDAC by sequencing.Another piece of evidence suggesting the presence of VDAC in the plasma membrane has been its isolation from liquid-ordered membrane microdomains called lipid rafts and functional reconstitution in artificial bilayers (17Bathori G. Parolini I. Tombola F. Szabo I. Messina A. Oliva M. De Pinto V. Lisanti M. Sargiacomo M. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29607-29612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test whether VDAC was also present in such specialized membrane microdomains in C1300 cells, we carried out colocalization experiments using confocal microscopy. Two markers for lipid raft microdomains were used: the β1 subunit of cholera toxin, which binds to GM1 ganglioside, with which lipid rafts are enriched, and caveolin-1, a protein present in more structured lipid rafts with flask-shaped membrane invaginations termed caveolae (23Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Encinas M. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 412-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows confocal images of C1300 cells probed with anti-VDAC antibody (Fig. 2, A and D, in red) and shows anti-caveolin 1 antibody (Fig. 2B, in green) or cholera toxin β1 subunit (CTX-β1) conjugated to FITC (Fig. 2E, in green). Merged images (Fig. 2, C and F) show an almost complete overlap of CTX-β1 and VDAC at the plasma membrane level, whereas no clear VDAC overlapping was observed with caveolin-1. These results reinforced previous observations suggesting the presence of VDAC at the plasma membrane, and similar to other cell types (17Bathori G. Parolini I. Tombola F. Szabo I. Messina A. Oliva M. De Pinto V. Lisanti M. Sargiacomo M. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29607-29612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), VDAC in C1300 cells segregates to GM1-containing lipid rafts. Caveolin-1 has been detected in cells from neuronal origin such as pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (25Galbiati F. Volonte D. Gil O. Zanazzi G. Salzer J.L. Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Engelman J.A. Schlegel A. Parenti M. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10257-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), although its localization varies with the degree of cell differentiation, mainly appearing in the soma of undifferentiated PC12 cells, similar to the pattern observed in our study with C1300 neuroblastoma cells. The apparent lack of colocalization of VDAC with caveolin-1 in C1300 cells might be related to the undifferentiated state of the cells and, therefore, the low presence of the caveolin-1 at the plasma membrane. However, experiments using differentiated C1300 cells, confirmed by the appearance of well developed neurites, did not modify the localization pattern of either caveolin-1 or VDAC. 2M. I. Bahamonde, unpublished observations. Further immunolocalization experiments using antibodies against other caveolin proteins expressed in neuronal cells will be necessary to elucidate the presence of VDAC in caveolae of C1300 cells.Fig. 2Colocalization of VDAC to membrane microdomains.

Bahamonde M.I. Lock H. Muñoz F.J. Hardy S.P. Posas F. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 79-88Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The activation of Maxi Cl– channels appears to involve the interaction of antiestrogens with an external plasma membrane binding site and the generation of intracellular signals (8Diaz M. Bahamonde M.I. Lock H. Muñoz F.J. Hardy S.P. Posas F. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 79-88Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane Maxi Cl– channel shares many of the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of the mitochondrial VDAC (11Colombini M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 42: 73-101Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), implying that VDAC might be the molecular correlate of Maxi Cl– channels (13Reymann S. Florke H. Heiden M. Jakob C. Stadtmuller U. Steinacker P. Lalk V.E. Pardowitz I. Thinnes F. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This hypothesis received additional experimental support from excisedpatch recording studies of Maxi Cl– channels from cells expressing heterologous VDAC protein (16Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Dermietzel R. Hwang T.-K. Buettner R. Hofer A. Dotzler E. Kremer M. Deutzman R. Thinnes F.P. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Siemen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and their functional inhibition with VDAC antibodies (26Dermietzel R. Hwang T.-K. Buettner R. Hofer A. Dotzler E. Kremer M. Deutzman R. Thinnes F.P. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Siemen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, these approaches can be criticized based on the fact that control cells used for transfection already express the channel of interest and, secondly, the absence of a correlation between immunodetection of VDAC protein and Maxi Cl– channel activity in VDAC-transfected cells. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether endogenous pl-VDAC might underlie the antiestrogen-activated Maxi Cl– current in C1300 cells. For that purpose, we transfected C1300 cells with antisense oligonucleotides against the 5′ end of the murine vdac-1 gene. The oligonucleotide hybridized with the leader sequence required for targeting VDAC to the plasma membrane (16Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The control antisense oligonucleotide was directed against an unrelated protein, β-globin. The use of an EGFP-expressing plasmid served as a reporter gene for the identification of transfected cells. Fig. 3 shows images of cells transfected with pl-VDAC antisense/EGFP (Fig. 3, A–C) or β-globin antisense/EGFP (Fig. 3, D–F). VDAC levels in transfected cells were determined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with the anti-VDAC antibody (Fig. 3, A and D) and the efficiency of the transfection by the production of EGFP protein (shown as the fluorescence signal in Fig. 3, B and E). From the images shown in Fig. 3 and the graph presented in Fig. 3G, a clear inverse correlation can be seen between the EGFP and VDAC signals in those cells transfected with pl-VDAC antisense and EGFP but not in those cells transfected with β-globin antisense/EGFP. Once we demonstrated that the pl-VDAC antisense oligonucleotide reduced VDAC levels, we proceeded to analyze the activity of Maxi Cl– channels.Fig. 3pl-VDAC antisense treatment of C1300 cells.

Transfection with the latter greatly reduced the magnitude of the toremifene-activated Maxi Cl– currents, whereas transfection with β-globin antisense oligonucleotides did not modify the channel response. The mean Maxi Cl– channel activity recorded from untransfected, β-globin antisense-, and pl-VDAC antisense-transfected cells exposed to toremifene is shown in Fig. 4C. We also tested by Western blot and confocal microscopy that VDAC expression was not affected by the treatment of C1300 cells with antiestrogens (results not shown).Fig. 4pl-VDAC antisense inhibition of toremifene-activated Maxi Cl– currents.

https://openalex.org/W2135909028,"Transcription of the rat fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene in the rat liver can be regulated by feeding a high carbohydrate diet. A carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) located on the rat FAS gene promoter has been identified. Using multiple copies of the ChoRE as the bait in a yeast one-hybrid system, a rat liver cDNA library was screened, and the cDNA of ChoRE-binding proteins was cloned. A positive clone that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein, enhancer of split- and hairy-related protein-2 (SHARP-2), was obtained. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of SHARP-2 mRNA increase when a high carbohydrate diet is fed to normal rats or when insulin is administered to diabetic rats. In primary cultured rat hepatocytes, insulin rapidly induced an accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA even in the absence of glucose. A time course for the increase in SHARP-2 mRNA levels indicated that it followed by those of FAS and L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs and that the initial time course of SHARP-2 mRNA was similar to changes in the levels of glucokinase mRNA and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. Although wortmannin, LY294002, and actinomycin D blocked the increase in SHARP-2 mRNA levels by insulin, rapamycin, staurosporine, PD98059, okadaic acid, and 8-bromocyclic AMP had no effect. In addition, nuclear run-on assay revealed that transcription of the rat SHARP-2 gene was induced by insulin. Thus, we conclude that insulin induces the transcription of the rat SHARP-2 gene via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway.

Thus, we conclude that insulin induces the transcription of the rat SHARP-2 gene via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. The feeding of a high carbohydrate diet including dextrin, sucrose, or glucose leads to an elevation in blood glucose levels and the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Insulin binds to an insulin receptor on the plasma membrane of target organs including liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, thus activating downstream signaling pathways (1Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 2Shepherd P.R. Kahn B.B. New Eng. J. Med. 1999; 341: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). This results in an increase in the influx of blood glucose into adipose tissue and muscle cells. It has recently been reported that glucose or its metabolites, such as glucose-6-phosphate and glucosamine, also regulate gene transcription in the liver, pancreatic β-cells, and muscle, respectively (3Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, two pathways are activated as the result of feeding a high carbohydrate diet that affect gene expression; one is an insulin-direct pathway and the other a glucose-dependent pathway.

Similar nucleotide sequences in the regulatory region of these two gene promoters have been identified and are designated as the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) (6Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This consists of two copies of an imperfect palindromic E box sequence (5′-CACGGG-3′) separated by 5 bp and is able to confer glucose-dependent transcriptional activation to the heterologous promoters (4Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Uyeda and coworkers (8Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) purified a ChoRE-binding protein (ChREBP) and identified it as the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region 14 protein. We also purified a protein that binds to the ChoRE of the rat LPK gene promoter (9Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the issue of whether our purified protein is identical to ChREBP is unclear because the amino acid sequence of the protein has not yet been determined. The mapping of ChoRE on the rat fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene distal promoter has recently been reported, and its nucleotide sequence resembles the ChoRE of both the LPK and Spot 14 genes (10Rufo C.

Generally, the E box sequence (5′-CANNTG-3′) is found in the transcriptional regulatory region of a number of genes and controls the transcription of these genes in biological events, including development, cell differentiation, cell growth, and oncogenesis (11Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional factors, with or without a leucine zipper motif, bind to the E box and regulate transcription positively or negatively (11Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The rat enhancer of split- and hairy-related protein-2 (SHARP-2) belongs to the bHLH transcription factor family (12Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.-A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mouse and human orthologs have also been cloned and are referred to as the stimulation of retinoic acid 13 (Stra13) and differentiated embryo chondrocytes 1 (DEC1), respectively (13Boudjelal M.

Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 236: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These proteins are expressed ubiquitously and bind to the E box sequence. It has been reported that both Stra13 and DEC1 act as transcriptional repressors via interactions with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 or with the basal transcription actor TFIIB (15Sun H. Taneja R.

In this study, we report on the isolation of SHARP-2 cDNA as a ChoRE-binding protein of the rat FAS gene using a yeast one-hybrid system. Hepatic expression of SHARP-2 mRNA both in vivo and in vitro under various nutritional and hormonal conditions was analyzed. The findings indicate that SHARP-2 is an insulin-inducible transcription factor and that the transcriptional stimulation of the rat SHARP-2 gene by insulin is mediated by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.

BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 568-574PubMed Google Scholar). The pLacZiB1 plasmid was described previously (18Yamada K. Mizutani T. Shou Z. Yazawa T. Sekiguchi T. Yoshino M. Inazu T. Miyamoto K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCTTCCTGCATGTGCCACAGGC GTGTCACCCTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGGAGGGTGACACGCCTGTGGCACATGCAGGAAG-3′ were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into the SpeI site of the pRW95–1 or XbaI site of the pLacZiB1 plasmids to obtain 6 × FASChoRE-HIS3 and 6 × FASChoRE-LacZ, respectively. YM4271 yeast cells were sequentially transformed with both reporter plasmids. The construction of the rat liver cDNA library was described previously (18Yamada K. Mizutani T. Shou Z. Yazawa T. Sekiguchi T. Yoshino M. Inazu T. Miyamoto K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reporter yeast strain, yFAS, was transformed with a rat liver cDNA library using a high efficiency transformation method (19Yamada K. Wang J.-C. Osawa H. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When 2.1 × 106 clones were screened on histidine-, tryptophan-, leucine-, and uracil-free synthetic dextrose plates supplemented with 1 mm 3-aminotriazole, one reproducible HIS3- and LacZ-positive clone was obtained. A plasmid, pF3, was isolated from the yeast and its nucleotide sequence determined. One-hybrid System and β-Galactosidase Assays—Reporter plasmids, pRW95–1-LHR, pLacZiB1-LHR, 3 × E box-HIS3, and 3 × E box-LacZ were previously described (18Yamada K. Mizutani T. Shou Z. Yazawa T.

Oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCGCCACGGGGCACTCCCGTGG-3′ and 5′-CTAGCCACGGGAGTGCCCCGTGGCG-3′ were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into the SpeI site of the pRW95–1or XbaI site of the pLacZiB1 plasmids to obtain 6 × LPKChoRE-HIS3 and 6 × LPKChoRE-LacZ, respectively. YM4271 cells were transformed with these plasmids. yLHR harboring both the pRW95–1-LHR and pLacZiB1-LHR, yEbox harboring both the 3 × E box-HIS3 and 3 × E box-LacZ, yLPK harboring both the 6 × LPKChoRE-HIS3 and 6 × LPKChoRE-LacZ, and yFAS were employed as reporter yeast strains. These yeast strains were transformed with the pF3 or pACT2, which expresses the activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4 AD) transcription factor alone, and their β-galactosidase activities were determined. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays, using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, were carried out on permeabilized cells as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 13.6.1-13.6.6Google Scholar). Animals and Treatment—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6-weeks-old, 160–180 g body weight) were used. Rats were housed in a photoperiod of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (from 20:00 through 8:00). To determine effects of a high carbohydrate diet, the rats were starved for 48 h and then refed a high carbohydrate diet containing 81% dextrin and 10% casein for 3, 6, and 16 h. For an analysis of circadian rhythm, rats given laboratory chow at ad libitum or starved rats were sacrificed starting from 6:00 at 6-h intervals. For the insulin study, STZ (60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to rats, and the onset of diabetes mellitus was then confirmed by determining the level of blood glucose. Four days after the administration of STZ, insulin was intraperitoneally injected with Humalin (40 units/kg), and the rats were sacrificed at 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. At all times, treatment of the animals followed National Institutes of Health guidelines. Primary Culture of Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley male rats using a collagenase perfusion method (22Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5189) Google Scholar, 23Matsuda T. Noguchi T. Yamada K. Takenaka M. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells (105 cells/cm2) were plated on type I collagen-coated dishes and cultured in Williams' medium E supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μm dex at a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with serum- and glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mm sodium pyruvate, antibiotics, and 0.5 μm dex. After 24 h, the medium was changed to the indicated one in the presence or absence of insulin. For signaling experiments, 0.2 μm wortmannin, 0.1 mm LY294002, 0.1 μm rapamycin, 0.1 μm staurosporine, 25 μm PD98059, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP, or 0.8 μm actinomycin D was added to the medium, respectively, then incubated for an additional 3 h. All reagents were added to the medium at 5 min before the addition of insulin. Preparation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was prepared from rat livers or primary cultured hepatocytes using the TRIZOL reagent. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was subjected to a 0.8% denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a Biodyne membrane. The filter was prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution at 68 °C for 30 min and then hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe and 20 μg/ml heat-denatured herring testis DNA for 1 h. After washing at 50 °C in 0.1 × 0.15 m NaCl/0.015 m sodium acetate (SSC), 0.1% SDS, the filter was exposed to a FUJIX imaging plate (Kanagawa, Japan). Hybridization signals were detected and quantified with the FUJIX BAS-2000 image analyzing system. The pUC119-FAS was a generous gift from Dr. Nobuko Iritani (Tezukayama Gakuin University, Sakai, Japan). A 1.1-kb EcoRI/MluI fragment of the pF3, a 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment of the pGK5, a 1.9-kb PstI/DraI fragment of the pLPK57, a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment of the pUC119-FAS, and a 1.2-kb PstI fragment of the pUC18-PEPCK were used as the probes for SHARP-2, glucokinase (GK), LPK, FAS, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), respectively (23Matsuda T. Noguchi T. Yamada K. Takenaka M. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Matsuda T. Noguchi T. Takenaka M. Yamada K. Tanaka T. J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For cDNA cloning mouse 36B4, a ribosomal protein, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out using oligonucleotides, 5′-ATGCCCAGGGAAGACAGGGCGACC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTCGAAGAGACCGAATCCCATA-3′ as primers and mouse liver cDNA as a template (26Shou Z. Yamada K. Inazu T. Kawata H. Hirano S. Mizutani T. Yazawa T. Sekiguchi T. Yoshino M. Kajitani T. Okada K. Miyamoto K. Gene. 2003; 302: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The product was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy to give pGEM-T Easy 36B4. A 954-bp EcoRI fragment was used as a probe. Probe DNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the BcaBest DNA labeling kit. Nuclear Run-on Assays—Nuclei were isolated from diabetic rat livers with or without the administration of insulin for 2 h. Run-on assays were performed as described previously in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (24Matsuda T. Noguchi T. Takenaka M. Yamada K. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An EcoRI/MluI fragment of the pF3 was subcloned into the pBluescript II SK(+) to give pBSII-SHARP-2-EM. The plasmids used for hybridization were pBluescript II SK(+), pBSII-SHARP-2-EM, pUC119, and pUC-PEPCK. After linearization, ten μg of these plasmids was bound to nylon membranes, prehybridized at 50 °C for 2 h, and hybridized at 50 °C for 24 h without or with the same amount of labeled RNA (5 × 106 cpm) in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSC, 250 μg/ml herring testis DNA, 0.5% SDS, and 10 ng/ml poly(A). The filters were washed under high stringent conditions (27Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 89-129Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were detected and quantified with the FUJIX BAS-2000 image analyzing system. Molecular Cloning of ChoRE-binding Protein cDNA—We attempted to clone the cDNA for a protein(s) binding to the ChoRE of the rat FAS gene using the yeast one-hybrid system. Six copies of the ChoRE sequence were inserted upstream of the gal1-minimal promoter of the HIS3-or LacZ-based reporter plasmids. Using a reporter yeast, yFAS, that harbors both reporter plasmids, 2.1 × 106 clones of a rat liver cDNA library were screened. We obtained a HIS3 and LacZ double positive clone and isolated a plasmid named pF3. We first determined the binding specificity between the ChoRE and a protein expressed from the pF3 using yeast one-hybrid assays. Two yeast strains, yFAS and yLHR (which harbors six copies of the early growth response gene-1-binding site of the rat luteinizing hormone receptor gene promoter), were used as the reporter. The pACT2, which expresses the activation domain of GAL4 alone, and pF3 were employed as the prey plasmids. When these reporter yeasts were transformed with the pACT2, they showed low β-galactosidase activities (Fig. 1). When yFAS was transformed with the pF3, high β-galactosidase activity was observed. In contrast, when the yLHR reporter yeast was transformed with the pF3, the yeasts continued to show a low β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). These results indicate that a protein that is expressed from the pF3 specifically binds to the ChoRE of the rat FAS gene. We then determined the nucleotide sequence of the pF3 and searched for similar sequences in the GenBank™ data base. The results showed that it was similar to the nucleotide sequence of rat SHARP-2, mouse Stra13, and human DEC1 cDNAs (12Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.-A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Kayano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 236: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the pF3 contained from 240 base upstream of the initiation codon to 964 base downstream that of rat SHARP-2. Two bases, “ga,” in the coding region were replaced with “ag.” The differences cause the replacement of the lysine residue at 133 with an arginine residue. The rat SHARP-2 protein consists of 411 amino acid residues and belongs to the bHLH protein family (12Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.-A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The region where we cloned the amino acid sequence between residues 1 and 322 contains the bHLH domain. It has been reported that DEC1 binds to the E box sequence (16Zawel L. Yu J. Torrance C.J. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2848-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We then examined the issue of whether SHARP-2 encoded by the pF3 binds to another ChoRE or the E box sequence. When two reporter yeast strains, yLPK and yEbox, which harbor six copies of the ChoRE of the rat LPK gene promoter or three copies of the E box sequence, respectively, were transformed with the pACT2, they showed low β-galactosidase activities (Fig. 1). When the yLPK reporter yeast was transformed with the pF3, the yeasts continued to show a low β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, when the yEbox was transformed with the pF3, high β-galactosidase activity was observed. These results indicate that SHARP-2 also binds to the E box sequence but not the ChoRE of the LPK gene promoter. Regulation of Gene Expression of SHARP-2 in the Rat Liver— We then examined the expression and regulation of rat SHARP-2 mRNA in the rat liver under various nutritional and hormonal conditions. During starvation for 48 h, both glycolysis and lipogenesis are repressed and gluconeogenesis is induced in the rat liver. In contrast, the administration of a high carbohydrate diet to starved rats induces both glycolysis and lipogenesis and represses gluconeogenesis. As shown in Fig. 2A, Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of SHARP-2 mRNA increased in the livers of refed rats. An increase in the level of SHARP-2 mRNA is rapid and was observed at least 3 h after the administration of a high carbohydrate diet. At 3, 6, and 16 h after refeeding a high carbohydrate diet, the levels of SHARP-2 mRNA increased to 3.5-, 4-, and 8-fold, respectively. The time course for the increase was followed by an increase in FAS and LPK mRNA levels, and the initial time course of SHARP-2 mRNA was similar to changes in the levels of GK mRNA and PEPCK mRNA. In contrast, the levels of 36B4 mRNA were unchanged in these rat livers. We next examined the issue of whether expression of SHARP-2 mRNA is regulated in a circadian fashion. Rats fed freely with laboratory chow or starved rats were sacrificed at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00, and the levels of hepatic SHARP-2 mRNA were determined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the level of SHARP-2 mRNA was low at 12:00 and gradually increased, reaching a maximum level at 6:00. In contrast, the level of PEPCK mRNA was low at 6:00, reached a maximum level at 12:00, and then gradually decreased. In the case of the starved rat livers, the levels of SHARP-2 mRNA were lower than those of the freely fed rat livers (Fig. 2C). Only the level was increased at 24:00. In contrast, the levels of PEPCK mRNA were high. The levels were gradually and slightly decreased at 24:00. In these rat livers, the levels of 36B4 mRNA were unchanged. These results suggest that the expression of the SHARP-2 gene is mainly regulated by diet, although diet-independent regulation was observed. We then determined whether insulin regulates the level of SHARP-2 mRNA. Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by administrating STZ. In the diabetic rat liver, gene expressions of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes are suppressed and that of gluconeogenic enzyme is active. The administration of insulin to the diabetic rats causes alterations of these gene expressions. As shown in Fig. 2D, the level of SHARP-2 mRNA was low in the diabetic rat liver and increased in insulin-administered diabetic rat liver. At 0.5, 1, and 2 h after administrating insulin, the level of SHARP-2 mRNA increased to 2-, 2-, and 3-fold, respectively. In these processes, the level of GK mRNA was induced and that of PEPCK mRNA was decreased. The levels of both LPK and FAS mRNAs were marginal at this time. In these rat livers, the levels of 36B4 mRNA were unchanged. It is known that insulin directly regulates gene expression via the insulin receptor signaling pathway and that glucose or its metabolites also regulate gene expression (3Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In vivo analysis does not distinguish whether an accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA is dependent upon either insulin or glucose or both. Because of this, we employed primary cultured rat hepatocytes to determine whether insulin or glucose is involved in the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3A, in primary cultured rat hepatocytes the levels of SHARP-2 mRNA in the presence of 0, 5, and 25 mm glucose were increased by 2-, 2-, and 3-fold by insulin, respectively. Insulin led to an increase in the level of SHARP-2 mRNA even in the absence of glucose. This indicates that insulin directly induces the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA. In addition, this effect was dose-dependent and the optimum concentration of insulin was 10 nm (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the level of 36B4 mRNA remains unchanged under all conditions. We then examined the time course for the induction of SHARP-2 mRNA under optimum conditions. An increase in the level of SHARP-2 mRNA by insulin was observed from 1 to 6 h. An increase in GK mRNA and a decrease in PEPCK mRNA were observed in similar time course (Fig. 3C). The levels of 36B4 mRNA remained unchanged. Insulin Stimulates Accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA via a PI3K Pathway—Insulin binds to the insulin receptor on the plasma membrane, induces receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates; the signal is then conferred downstream of the PI3K and ras/raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We then examined the issue of which insulin signaling pathway is involved in an accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA. Inhibitors of protein kinases or phosphatase involved in the insulin signal transduction pathways were added to the medium in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. Although both wortmannin and LY294002 blocked the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA, rapamycin, staurosporine, PD98059, and okadaic acid had no effects (Fig. 3D). Both wortmannin and LY294002 also blocked the down-regulation of PEPCK mRNA by insulin. In contrast, the level of 36B4 mRNA was unchanged by treatment with all reagents. These results indicate that a PI3K pathway mediates the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA by insulin. We then examined the issue of whether cAMP represses an accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA by insulin. By the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP in the absence or presence of insulin to primary cultured rat hepatocytes, the levels of PEPCK mRNA were increased but those of both SHARP-2 and 36B4 mRNAs were unchanged. In addition, actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, inhibited the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA. These results suggest that cAMP neither stimulates the accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA nor interferes with the effects of insulin and that insulin may act at the transcription level of the rat SHARP-2 gene. Insulin Stimulates Transcription of the Rat SHARP-2 Gene—We further examined the issue of whether the rapid accumulation of SHARP-2 mRNA as the result of treatment with insulin is regulated at the transcription level of the rat SHARP-2 gene. We compared the transcription rate of the rat SHARP-2 gene between control diabetic rat liver and insulintreated diabetic rat livers for 2 h. By treatment with insulin, transcription rate of the rat SHARP-2 gene was induced by 5.1-fold (±2.9) (Fig. 4). Under the same conditions, the transcription rate of the rat PEPCK gene was decreased to ∼47% (±3.3%). This result indicates that insulin acts at the transcription level of the rat SHARP-2 gene. We cloned SHARP-2 cDNA as a ChoRE-binding protein of the rat FAS gene. The ChoRE of the FAS gene is nearly identical to that of the LPK gene, and a common factor is suggested to bind to the ChoRE of the two genes (10Rufo C. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21969-21975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the yeast one-hybrid assay showed that SHARP-2 interacts with the ChoRE of the FAS gene but not with that of the LPK gene. Theses results suggest that SHARP-2 is not involved in the common regulation of both genes. Further studies will be required to address this problem. SHARP-2 is involved in the control of the proliferation and/or differentiation of chondrocytes, nerve cells, fibroblasts, and T cells (12Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.-A. Mol.

It has been reported that the human form, DEC1, and another isoform, DEC2, are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a circadian fashion and function as regulators of the mammalian molecular clock (29Honma S.

Furthermore, the expression of SHARP-2 mRNA was induced by cAMP, hypoxia, serum starvation, and TGF-β (15Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The level of SHARP-2 mRNA increased by refeeding a high carbohydrate diet to normal rats or the administration of insulin to diabetic rats. The time course for the increase in SHARP-2 mRNA levels showed that it was followed by an increase in the levels of FAS and LPK mRNAs; the initial time course of SHARP-2 mRNA was similar to changes in the levels of GK mRNA and PEPCK mRNA (Fig. 2). Insulin alone induced the level of SHARP-2 mRNA via a PI3K pathway in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (Fig. 3). The downstream signal may be protein kinase B but not atypical protein kinase C and the mammalian target of rapamycin, because inhibitors of the latter two signaling molecules were not effective. In addition, the administration of insulin to diabetic rats stimulated the transcription rate of the rat SHARP-2 gene in the liver (Fig. 4). Therefore, SHARP-2 is an insulin-inducible bHLH transcription factor. It is known that both the forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c mediate insulin action in the liver (34Ferre P. Foretz M. Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Foufelle F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the case of FKHR, it mediates insulin action directly or indirectly (35Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 36Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Insulin causes the phosphorylation of the serine residue at 256 of FKHR via a PI3K/protein kinase B/Akt pathway. Phosphorylated FKHR dissociates from the cognate sequence, is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and represses the transcription of the target gene promoter, such as the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 gene (35Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that FKHR functions as a corepressor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and that phosphorylation of FKHR by insulin causes the dissociation of HNF4, which then activates transcription (36Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, SREBP-1c, a bHLH transcription factor, is selectively expressed in liver and fat tissue (37Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar). The overexpression of SREBP-1c both in vivo and in vitro causes the stimulation of glycolysis and lipogenesis via the activation of the GK gene (37Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar, 38Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for this remains unknown (39Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 40Stoeckman A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been reported that insulin acts at the transcription level of the rat SREBP-1c gene and induces the level of SREBP-1 c mRNA in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The time course for the induction was slower than that of SHARP-2 mRNA (41Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.-B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, this raises the possibility that the SREBP-1c gene as well as the GK and PEPCK genes are downstream genes of SHARP-2. Indeed, an E box sequence was found in accessory element 3 of glucocorticoid response unit of the rat PEPCK gene. Two imperfect E boxes separated by 5 bp also exist just downstream of the transcription initiation sites of the gene (42Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Nobe R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A functional E box sequence is also present in the regulatory region of both the rat GK and SREBP-1c genes, respectively (44Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to address the issue of whether SHARP-2 directly represses transcription from the rat PEPCK gene promoter or activates transcription from the rat GK and SREBP-1c gene promoters. It has been reported that SHARP-2 physically interacts with the components, such as TBP and TFIIB, of the basal transcription machinery and recruits the histone deacetylase 1-Sin3A-NcoR corepressor complex through their carboxyl-terminal repression domains (15Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SHARP-2 also interacts with the DNA-binding domain of upstream stimulatory factor (USF), a bHLH protein, and inhibits DNA-binding and USF-mediated transactivation (46Dhar M. Taneja R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4750-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, SHARP-2 may regulate the transcription of these genes via mechanisms in which it not only binds to the E box sequence but also interferes with the activity of other bHLH proteins. Recently, Stra13-deficient mice were generated, and it has been shown that Stra13 is a key regulator of lymphocyte activation that is vital for maintenance of self-tolerance and the constraint of autoimmunity (28Sun H. Lu B. Li R.-Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus far, whether gene expressions of metabolic enzymes and insulin-related transcription factors are normal or not has not been reported. The transcription rate of the rat SHARP-2 gene was stimulated by insulin. Thus, it is likely that the promoter region of the rat SHARP-2 gene contains the insulin response sequence. The molecular cloning of the rat SHARP-2 gene and detailed analysis of the regulatory elements of the gene will be required to address these questions. We thank Drs.

In this study we found that, when expressed in COS-7 cells with HA-ERK2, the mobility of FLAG-MKP-7 was decreased on SDS-PAGE gels depending on several stimuli, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, fetal bovine serum, epidermal growth factor, H2O2, and ionomycin. By using U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and introducing several point mutations, we demonstrated that this upward mobility shift is because of phosphorylation and identified Ser-446 of MKP-7 as the phosphorylation site targeted by ERK activation. To determine how MKP-7 interacts with MAPKs, we identified three domains in MKP-7 required for interaction with MAPKs, namely, putative MAP kinase docking domains (D-domain) I and II and a long COOH-terminal stretch unique to MKP-7. The D-domain I is required for interaction with ERK and p38, whereas the D-domain II is required for interaction with JNK and p38, which is likely to be important for MKP-7 to suppress JNK and p38 activations. The COOH-terminal stretch of MKP-7 was shown to determine JNK preference for MKP-7 by masking MKP-7 activity toward p38 and is a domain bound by ERK. These data strongly suggested that Ser-446 of MKP-7 is phosphorylated by ERK.

Five MAPK pathways have been identified in eukaryotic cells, of which three are relatively well characterized: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38 pathway. The activation of MAPK is strictly regulated by two upstream kinases, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK). MAPKKKs, such as Raf, MEKK, MLK, and ASK1, phosphorylate and activate MAPKK. MAPKK is a dual-specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine and threonine residues in a TXY motif of MAPK, leading to the full activation of MAPK (5Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Once activated, MAPK can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, leading to phosphorylation of several transcription factors and altered regulation of gene expression (6Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of various MAPK subfamilies have been studied extensively in many systems. In general, activation of the ERK cascade leads to cell proliferation, differentiation, and enhanced cell survival after cellular stress, although in certain situations, ERK activation is required for the execution of apoptosis (8Tang D. Wu D. Hirao A. Lahti J.M. Liu L. Mazza B. Kidd V.J. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of the JNK and p38 cascades are usually associated with enhanced apoptosis and production of inflammatory cytokines (3Hall J.P. Merithew E. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14022-14024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), although there are notable exceptions in which JNK/p38 is necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation (13Martin-Blanco E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Ambrosino C. Nebreda A.R. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because MAP kinase pathways play important roles in regulating many critical cellular processes, the precise regulation of these signaling proteins is crucial for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. MAPK pathways are regulated at multiple levels to ensure the specificity, timing, and strength of their action (6Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). One critical aspect of this regulation is reversible phosphorylation of MAPKs. Negative regulation of MAPKs is achieved by dephosphorylation of the TXY motif by phosphatases (5Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 15Tamura S. Hanada M. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As an in vivo candidate for negative regulator, the MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), a family of dual-specificity protein phosphatases, has emerged (16Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 17Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3009.1-3009.10Crossref Google Scholar). In mammals, 10 MKPs have been reported, and they are precisely regulated in their substrate specificity to avoid inappropriate inactivation of MAPKs (16Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 17Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3009.1-3009.10Crossref Google Scholar). MKPs are primarily composed of two domains, a rhodanese-like domain and a dual-specificity phosphatase catalytic domain (18Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently we and other groups identified MKP-7, which possesses a long COOH-terminal stretch (CTS) containing both a nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal, in addition to the rhodanese-like domain and the dual-specificity phosphatase catalytic domain (19Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MAPKs interact with MAPKKs, MAPK substrates, and phosphatases, and the specificity of each interaction likely regulates the enzymatic efficiency and specificity of the MAPK pathways. Recently two regions, named the CD and ED sites, have been identified on the surface of MAPKs and shown to act as docking sites for complex formation (21Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 22Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Both sites contain negatively charged clusters of residues. How MAPK interacting proteins bind MAPK through the CD or ED sites is not yet clear. Recently, the presence of common MAPK docking domains were proposed in MAPKKs (21Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

The MAPK-docking domain (D-domain) is composed of three submotifs: a cluster of basic residues, an LXL element, and a cluster of hydrophobic residues. In a previous study (19Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we identified MKP-7 as a JNK-specific phosphatase (JNK ≫ p38 > ERK) with the characteristics of a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MKP-7 bound ERK2 and p38α as well as JNK1 despite its high specificity toward JNK1 as a substrate. This observation suggested that binding is necessary but not sufficient for determination of substrate specificity, and that there is an unidentified function associated with interaction between MKP-7 and ERK2. Here, we show that activation of ERK induces an upward mobility shift of MKP-7 on SDS-PAGE gels, resulting from phosphorylation. We also analyze the function of the CTS in interacting with MAPKs and inactivating them, and the function of the two putative D-domains, designated D-domain I and D-domain II. We found that the CTS is a critical determinant of substrate specificity and a target of ERK, which was suggested to phosphorylate MKP-7 on Ser-446. Finally we present evidence that D-domain II is important for its catalytic activity as a MAPK phosphatase. MKP-7 Expression Vectors—Mammalian expression vectors, pFLAG MKP7WT, CS (C244S), delC2 (residues 1–370), and delC3 (residues 1–568) have been described previously ((19Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M.

Several other constructs encoding MKP-7 mutant proteins including delC4 (residues 1–604), R2A (R56A, R57A), R2E (R56E, R57E), L2A (L166A, L168A), RL4A (R56A, R57A, L166A, L168A), delC2/R2A (R56A, R57A of delC2), delC2/L2A (L166A, L168A of del2), delC2/RL4A (R56A, R57A, L166A, L168A of delC2), S374A, S446A, S459A, and S501A were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Clontech). The open reading frame of MKP-7 mutants was cloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Stimulation—HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were co-transfected with various pFLAG-MKP-7 expression vectors together with SRα-HA-ERK2, SRα-HA-JNK1, or pMT3-HA-p38α. For transient assays, cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were starved for 18 h, and then exposed to various stimuli, namely, 100 ng/ml human EGF (Sigma), 10 ng/ml PMA (Sigma), and 1 mm ionomycin (Sigma) for 15 min, or 10% FBS, 0.4 m sorbitol, 0.5 m NaCl, 100 J/m2 UV-C, and 0.1 mm H2O2 for 30 min. For treatment of the transfected cells with MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega), cells were exposed to several concentrations of U0126 for 15 min before stimulation. Detection of Expressed Proteins—Methods for preparation of cell lysates and for immunoprecipitation were as described previously (19Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each sample was separated by a SDS-PAGE on 7.5 or 10% gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The expression level of HA-tagged MAPKs and FLAG-tagged MKP-7 wild type or mutant proteins was monitored by an anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), respectively. The activation of ERK2, JNK1, and p38α was monitored by an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (New England Biolabs), an anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody (Promega), and an anti-phospho p38 antibody (New England Biolabs), respectively. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Immunoprecipitates of FLAG-MKP-7WT or FLAG-MKP-7CS by an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and divided into five aliquots, one of which received 1× SDS sample buffer. Two aliquots were washed once with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) reaction buffer (TaKaRa), and the resulting precipitates were resuspended in CIAP buffer with or without 20 units of CIAP (TaKaRa). The remaining 2 aliquots were similarly washed with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) reaction buffer (TaKaRa), and the precipitates were resuspended in BAP buffer with or without 20 units of BAP (TaKaRa). The dephosphorylation reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by addition of 5× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Detection of Modified Forms of MKP-7—We previously showed that MKP-7 suppresses MAPK activation in COS-7 cells in the order of selectivity, JNK1 ≫ p38α > ERK2 (19Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, MKP-7 can bind ERK2 as well as JNK1 and p38α.To determine the physiological consequence of MKP-7 and ERK interaction, we co-expressed FLAG-MKP-7 with HA-ERK2 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1). We found that the band representing FLAG-MKP-7WT (wild type) was shifted upward dependent on PMA stimulation when HA-ERK2 was co-expressed. To determine the relevance of MKP-7 modification to its enzymatic activity, we compared the effect of MAPKs on the upward mobility shift of FLAG-MKP-7WT and the CS (phosphatase dead) mutant protein. The mobility shift was enhanced relative to the wild type protein with FLAG-MKP-7CS (Fig. 1a, lane 8), suggesting that activation of HA-ERK2 following PMA treatment is associated with modification of FLAG-MKP-7, and that MKP-7 enzymatic activity antagonizes this effect. When HAJNK1 was co-expressed, modification of FLAG-MKP-7WT following sorbitol stimulation was not observed (Fig. 1b, lane 6). However, a slight band shift of the CS mutant protein was observed with activation of JNK upon sorbitol stimulation (Fig. 1b, lanes 7 and 8). Co-expression of HA-p38α did not induce modification of either the wild type protein or the CS mutant of FLAG-MKP-7. These results indicate that modification of FLAG-MKP-7 is correlated with the activation of HA-ERK2, and that the catalytic activity of FLAG-MKP-7 antagonizes such modifying activity. Modification of MKP-7 Is Regulated by Activated HA-ERK Activity—To clarify whether MKP-7 modification is because of activated ERK, we observed the effect of U0126, a MEK inhibitor, on the upward mobility shift of MKP-7. The phosphorylation level of HA-ERK2 was increased by PMA and was decreased with U0126 treatment in COS-7 cells expressing HA-ERK2 and FLAG-MKP-7WT or HA-ERK2 alone (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, modification of MKP-7 was diminished by U0126 treatment (Fig. 2 lanes 6–10). When FLAG-MKP-7WT was expressed alone in COS-7 cells, PMA did not induce the upward mobility shift at all (Fig. 2, lanes 1-5). These results demonstrate that the observed modification of FLAG-MKP-7WT was induced by co-expression of activated HA-ERK2. FLAG-MKP-7 Protein Is Phosphorylated following PMA Stimulation—Slower migrating forms of FLAG-MKP-7WT could result from post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. Therefore, we determined whether the shifted band was susceptible to phosphatase treatment. FLAG-MKP-7WT or CS was co-expressed with HA-ERK2 in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunocomplex was then incubated with CIAP or BAP (Fig. 3). The shifted band collapsed into a slightly smaller band following CIAP or BAP treatment, but was not affected by treatment with the corresponding buffer (Fig. 3A, lanes 10–14). The shifted band of FLAG-MKP-7CS also collapsed by CIAP and BAP treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 10–14). Such an effect by alkaline phosphatase was blocked by a phosphatase inhibitor, sodium pyrophosphate (data not shown). These results indicate that the shifted band of FLAG-MKP-7WT and FLAG-MKP-7CS corresponds to phosphorylated forms of the protein. The COOH-terminal Region of MKP-7 Is Phosphorylated by ERK—To identify phophorylation site(s) of MKP-7, we used several FLAG-MKP-7 deletion mutants such as FLAG-MKP-7-delC2, -delC3, and -delC4 shown in Fig. 6A. Expression vectors encoding the mutants were co-transfected with HA-ERK2 into COS-7 cells, and the cells were stimulated with PMA. As shown in Fig. 4A, modification of FLAG-MKP-7WT, -delC3, and -delC4 was observed, but the delC2 protein was not modified, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation site(s) are present in residues 371–568. To determine which amino acid is phosphorylated, the same blot used in Fig. 4 was incubated with antiphosphotyrosine or anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. No signals were detected at the position corresponding to the shifted band (data not shown), suggesting that a serine residue(s) in residues 371–568 is potentially phosphorylated upon HAERK2 activation.Fig. 4Identification of a site of MKP-7 phosphorylated following PMA stimulation. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1.2 μg of pFLAG-MKP-7WT (lanes 2 and 7), delC2 (lanes 3 and 8), delC3 (lanes 4 and 9), or delC4 (lanes 5 and 10), together with 0.6 μg of SRα-HAERK2 and stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 15 min. Cell lysates (50 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG (upper panel), anti-HA (middle panel), or anti-phospho-p42/p44 antibody (lower panel). B, alignment of primary sequences of human MKP-7 and mouse MKP-7. Asterisks indicate identical residues between the two sequences, and shaded boxes show leucine-rich NES and PEST sequences. Four S-P motifs are boxed. C, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1.2 μg of pFLAG-MKP-7 WT or SA mutants (S374A, S446A, S459A, or S501A) together with 0.6 μg of SRα-HAERK2 and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 15 min. Cell lysates (50 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG (upper panel), anti-HA (middle panel), or antiphospho-p42/p44 antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Serine 446 Is the Phosphorylation Site Dependent on ERK Activation—We searched for an S-P motif, a putative ERK phosphorylation site (41Gonzalez F.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in residues 371–568 of human MKP-7, and, as shown in Fig. 4B, found four SP motifs conserved in human and mouse MKP-7. To identify the phosphorylation site(s) in vivo, we generated a series of SA mutants, each with a single Ser to Ala substitution, namely, S374A, S446A, S459A, and S501A. FLAG-MKP-7WT or each SA mutant was co-expressed with HA-ERK2 in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, the bands representing FLAG-MKP-7 S374A, S459A, and S501A were shifted upward following HA-ERK2 activation to a level similar to the wild type protein; however, the band representing FLAG-MKP-7 S446A was not shifted under conditions in which HA-ERK2 was strongly activated (Fig. 4C, lane 8). These results clearly show that Ser-446, which is located in PEST sequences, is the site of phosphorylation in vivo upon ERK activation, and that this phosphorylation represents the modification observed in MKP-7. Putative MAPK-binding Sites in MKP-7—Because Ser-446 is a putative ERK phosphorylation site and phosphorylation was inhibited by U0126, it is likely that ERK2 recognizes MKP-7 as a substrate. To determine how MKP-7 recognizes JNK as a substrate and how MKP-7 is recognized by ERK as a substrate, we analyzed the region necessary for binding to MAPKs in MKP-7. To search for the MAPK-docking domain (D-domain) in MKP-7, we aligned the primary sequence of MKP-7 with the D-domain of MAPKKs (21Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

We found two D-domains in MKP-7 at residues 52–69 in the rhodanese-like domain and in residues 161–180 in the DSP catalytic domain, and designated them D-domains I and II, respectively. The D-domain I exhibits conserved basic and hydrophobic motifs, whereas D-domain II has conserved LXL and hydrophobic motifs. Both D-domains are highly conserved among MKPs (Fig. 5B). To determine the potential function of these domains in interaction with the three MAPKs, we introduced several mutations into these domains (Fig. 6A). Role of D-domains in Interaction with JNK and p38 —It has been proposed that the basic cluster in several transcription factors, such as MEF-2A/2C, SAP-1, and Elk-1, which also occurs in D-domain I, is important for binding to a MAPK (30Yang S.H.

Hepatocytes adherent to collagen film spread extensively, express cyclin D1, and increase DNA synthesis in response to epidermal growth factor, whereas hepatocytes adherent to collagen gel have increased differentiated function, but lower DNA synthesis. The signaling mechanisms by which different forms of type I collagen modulate cell cycle progression are unknown. When ERK MAP kinase activation was analyzed in hepatocytes attached to collagen film, two peaks of ERK activity were demonstrated. Only the second peak, which correlated with an increase of cyclin D1, was required for G1-S progression. Notably, this second peak of ERK activity was absent in cells adherent to collagen gel, but not required in the presence of exogenous cyclin D1. Expression of activated mutants of the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway in cells adherent to collagen gel restored ERK phosphorylation and DNA synthesis, but differentially affected cell shape. Although Ras, Raf, and MEK all increased expression of cyclin D1 on collagen film, only Ras and Raf significantly up-regulated cyclin D1 levels on collagen gel. These results demonstrate that adhesion to polymerized collagen induces growth arrest by inhibiting the Ras/ERK-signaling pathway to cyclin D1 required in late G1.

Adhesion to certain types of ECM can promote cell-specific responses including differentiation or proliferation, whereas loss of adhesion results in growth arrest in mid-G1 of the cell cycle (1Fang F.

Whereas adhesion is generally required for cell cycle progression, adhesion to certain ECMs can inhibit cell cycle progression and/or increase differentiated function. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms of cell cycle arrest by these growth inhibitory substrates. Recently mechanisms have been identified that mediate adhesion-dependent cell cycle progression. A major target of cooperative signaling from integrins and growth factor receptors is the expression of cyclins, which bind to and activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), forming active kinase complexes required for progression through specific points in the cell cycle. G1 arrest in response to loss of adhesion is often characterized by lower levels of cyclin D1 (4Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J.

Expression of cyclins and CKIs is regulated by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction pathways that require integrin-mediated adhesion for maximal activity (7Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade lies downstream of both growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activation and integrin activation (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 9Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Sustained activation of this pathway is important for cyclin D1 expression and G1-S phase progression in fibroblasts (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and loss of adhesion inhibits growth factor signaling through this pathway and blocks G1-S progression (9Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J.

Both mechanical and biochemical properties of the ECM are conveyed through integrins, and these properties affect differences in activation of intracellular signaling pathways and/or morphogenic changes in the cell. For instance, endothelial cell adhesion to laminin via α2β1 integrin subunits decreases cyclin D1 translation and inhibits cell cycle progression, whereas adhesion to fibronectin via α5β1 promotes cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle progression (13Mettouchi A. Klein S. Guo W. Lopez-Lago M. Lemichez E. Westwick J.K. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Also, fibroblasts embedded within polymerized collagen fail to progress through the cell cycle when tension is released from the matrix. This failure is associated with decreased activation of ERK, decreased expression of cyclin D1, and increased expression of p27 (14Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, both biochemical and mechanical properties of the ECM are important for integration of growth factor signaling into the cell cycle machinery. Because most cells in vivo are in constant contact with the ECM, and the mechanical and biochemical properties of the ECM in vivo are dramatically different from rigid plastic dishes often used in cell culture, understanding how growth factor signaling is regulated by more physiological forms of ECM will be important for understanding cell behavior during disease and development. Primary cultures of hepatocytes provide a physiologically relevant model to study the signal transduction mechanisms by which different ECMs regulate cell cycle progression and differentiation. Although quiescent under normal conditions, hepatocytes in the liver rapidly enter and proceed through the cell cycle after chemical injury or partial hepatectomy in a fairly synchronous manner to restore liver mass and function (15Michalopoulos G.K.

Whereas a number of studies have investigated growth factor-mediated signal transduction pathways and cell cycle progression in hepatocytes, there has been less investigation into how signaling is modulated in hepatocytes by the ECM. As adhesion and growth factors play a concerted role in signal transduction to G1-S progression (26Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), elucidating the regulation of hepatocyte cell cycle progression in the context of signaling from both growth factors and adhesion is necessary. Type I collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and a major protein component of extracellular matrix. Its importance in normal physiology is illustrated by the numerous diseases that result from mutations in collagen (27Di Lullo G.A. Sweeney S.M. Korkko J. Ala-Kokko L. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), polymerized collagen has been used as a substrate upon which to elicit differentiated function and long term survival. Whereas differentiated functions increase in hepatocytes adherent to polymerized collagen, hepatocyte proliferation is often diminished, despite adhesion to the ECM and the presence of mitogens that normally induce proliferation on monomeric collagen (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41De Smet K. Loyer P. Gilot D. Vercruysse A. Rogiers V. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Biochem.

The mechanism, however, by which adhesion to polymerized collagen prevents growth factor signaling to G1-S progression and/or promotes differentiation is not known. Studies from this laboratory and others have previously demonstrated that adhesion to polymerized collagen (gel) inhibits hepatocyte cell spreading and cell cycle progression (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41De Smet K. Loyer P. Gilot D. Vercruysse A. Rogiers V. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), while adhesion to monomeric collagen (film) allows cell spreading, robust cyclin D1 expression, and permits G1-S progression in response to EGF. The signal transduction mechanisms by which differences in collagen structure regulate hepatocyte cell shape, cell cycle protein expression, and G1-S progression have not yet been elucidated. The purpose of the study described below was to identify the mechanisms by which adhesion to collagen gel inhibits growth factor signaling and cell cycle progression. We report that adhesion to different forms of type I collagen regulates signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, and that individual components of this pathway play distinct and dynamic roles in hepatocyte cell shape, cyclin D1 expression, and G1-S progression. Reagents—The cyclin D1 adenovirus was previously described (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing constitutively activated MEK (CA-MEK; S218E/S222D), membrane-targeted Raf (bxb-Raf), Ras(V12), and Ras(N17) were kindly provided by Dr. Luis F. Parada (University of Texas, Southwestern) (43Klesse L.J. Parada L.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10420-10428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1745-base pair cyclin D1 promoter-driven luciferase gene was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center) (44Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N.

The albumin promoter-luciferase construct was kindly provided by Dr. Gretchen J. Darlington (Baylor Medical College) (45Wu K.J. Wilson D.R. Shih C. Darlington G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Hepatocyte Culture—Primary rat hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion of adult Lewis rat liver (46Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), followed by purification through a Percoll gradient (Sigma). Only cells from harvests yielding >90% viability were used. Hepatocytes were plated at subconfluent density (10,000–12,000 cells/cm2) in serum-free William's medium E (Invitrogen) with the following additives as previously described (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml, Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), insulin (20 milliunits/ml, Sigma), dexamethasone (5 nm, Sigma), sodium pyruvate (1 mm, Invitrogen), ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml, Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Cultures were re-fed daily. Cultures were always performed in the presence of growth factors unless otherwise stated. Collagen Substrate Preparation—Type I collagen (“Vitrogen 100,” Collagen Biomaterials, Palo Alto, CA) was coated onto non-adhesive Petri dishes to produce either a monomeric coat of collagen referred to as collagen film, or a polymerized form referred to as collagen gel. Collagen film is prepared by coating dishes with collagen diluted in a basic, carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) as previously described (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce a collagen gel substrate, 50 μl of NaOH was added to each milliliter of 5× William's E medium. 1 part of 5× William's E medium (with NaOH) was mixed with 4 parts of Vitrogen 100 (final ∼2.4 mg/ml), added to a Petri dish at ∼1 ml/10-cm dish, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After coating, all plates were washed twice in PBS and incubated at least 20 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in William's E medium to block any non-coated sites. A collagen gel overlay was produced by diluting Vitrogen 100 1:7 in complete William's E medium, then adding to adherent cells. New media was added after the overlay had gelled (∼4 h). DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis is measured by adding [3H]thymidine at 1.2 μCi/well (specific activity = 50 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) to 96-well plate cultures at the indicated hours after plating. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was determined by harvesting cell lysates onto filter paper using a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) and quantitation by scintillation counting. Protein Isolation and Western Blot—Cultured hepatocytes were removed from the plates by scraping in lysis buffer as previously described (25Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed using ∼30 μg of cellular protein per lane as previously described (25Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). A loading control was obtained by stripping and reprobing blots with antibody against glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Antibodies used for Western blots include anti-rat cyclin E (catalog number sc-481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-active ERK and anti-pan-ERK (catalog numbers 9102 and 9101, respectively, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-cyclin D1 (catalog number 06-137, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-GAPDH (catalog number ab8245–100; Abcam Limited, Cambridge, UK). Western blots were visualized using ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and band intensity was quantitated using STORM imaging and Amersham Biosciences software (Amersham Biosciences), and model G5–700 imaging densitometer and molecular analyst software (Bio-Rad). Statistical comparisons of means were performed using the t test. Adenovirus Transfection—Rat hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus 3–6 h. after plating, as previously described (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10 “TCID 50” units of adenovirus were used per cell as previously described (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing the β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used at the equivalent titer as a control. Plasmid Transfections and Promoter Activity Luciferase Assays— Promoter-luciferase plasmids were purified using an endotoxin-free maxi-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For experiments on collagen film, hepatocytes were plated in William's E medium with EGF at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and transfected 6–12 h after plating using FuGENE reagent (Roche Diagnostics), as described by the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase plasmids were routinely co-transfected with control plasmids expressing Renilla luciferase under the control of either a null or CMV promoter (Null Renilla, or CMV Renilla; Promega). Transfection on collagen gel resulted in very low transfection efficiency. To compare film and gel conditions, 2 × 106 hepatocytes were transfected on a 10-cm collagen film-coated dish, then replated onto 35-mm dishes coated with film or gel. Briefly, 300 μl of William's E medium (no additives) containing 9 μl of FuGENE reagent was mixed with 3 μg of plasmid DNA, incubated 10 min at room temperature, then added to cells for 6–12 h. After a 6–12-h incubation with plasmids/FuGENE, cells were washed twice in PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+, then trypsinized and replated onto 35-mm dishes coated with film or gel. To harvest lysates for luciferase activity, hepatocytes adherent to 35-mm dishes of collagen film were washed twice in PBS, then lysed in 100 μl of 1× dual luciferase lysis buffer as described (Promega). Cells adherent to collagen gel were detached from the matrix with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) in PBS, then centrifuged and washed twice in PBS before adding 100 μl of lysis buffer. The differences in harvesting methods had no detectable effect on either firefly or Renilla luciferase activity. Unless otherwise stated, lysates were harvested at 72 h and frozen at –70 °C. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and normalized to Renilla values within the same lysate. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinase assays were performed as previously described (47Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK antibody followed by kinase assay in which immunobead complexes were incubated for 30 min with kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) plus substrate (myelin basic protein). Reaction was terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Cell Size Measurements—Hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed 3 times in PBS, then stained for 5 min with Coomassie Blue/methanol solution. Cells were then washed five times in PBS and measured using computerized image analysis (Image Pro Plus, Carlsbad, CA). Cyclin D1 Protein Levels and Promoter Activity Are Inhibited by Adhesion to Collagen Gel—It has been previously demonstrated that increased cyclin D1 in hepatocytes during mid to late G1 is dependent on stimulation by mitogens such as EGF and insulin (23Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar, 25Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclin D1 expression is inhibited in hepatocytes adherent to low density collagen 2L. K. Hansen, unpublished data. or denatured collagen fibrils even in the presence of EGF and insulin (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, culture of hepatocytes on collagen gel with growth factors results in a lower level of cyclin D1 protein expression than culture on a film of monomeric collagen (Fig. 1A). Cyclin D1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional levels (44Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 48Henry D.O. Moskalenko S.A. Kaur K.J. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine at what level cyclin D1 expression was regulated by adhesion to different collagen substrates, the transcriptional activity of a 1745-bp human cyclin D1 promoter construct fused to the luciferase gene was measured under different ECM conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, the activity of the 1745-bp human cyclin D1 promoter is up-regulated in a similar time course to the previously described up-regulation of cyclin D1 mRNA in primary hepatocytes (18Loyer P. Cariou S. Glaise D. Bilodeau M. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11484-11492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), demonstrating a large increase in activity between 48 and 72 h after plating. This increase in cyclin D1 expression correlates with entry into S phase, which occurs ∼42–52 h after plating. To determine how the interaction with polymerized collagen affects cyclin D1 transcription, the 1745-bp cyclin D1 promoter activity was measured in hepatocytes adherent to film or gel. Because the plasmid transfection efficiency on gel was insufficient to measure luciferase activity, cells were transfected on film and then trypsinized 6–12 h later and replated on film or gel, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h after replating. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, culture of hepatocytes on collagen gel decreases the relative activity of the cyclin promoter to ∼30% of that found on film. Similar results were demonstrated using a 1810-bp rat cyclin D1 promoter (data not shown). The higher activity on film suggests that cyclin D1 gene expression is transcriptionally regulated in hepatocytes by adhesion to different forms of type I collagen. Adhesion to Collagen Gel Inhibits G 1 -S Progression—To determine how the loss of cyclin D1 expression on collagen gel affected G1-S progression, DNA synthesis was measured in cells adherent to collagen film or collagen gel. As shown (Fig. 2), adhesion to collagen gel substantially diminished DNA synthesis to the low level observed in the absence of growth factors on film. However, infection with an adenovirus vector, which yields high transfection efficiency in hepatocytes (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressing a human cyclin D1 gene under control of the CMV promoter completely restores DNA synthesis both in the absence of growth factors as previously shown (25Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404"
https://openalex.org/W2082131284,"The non-structural protein NS2 of Bluetongue virus (BTV) is synthesized abundantly in virus-infected cells and has been suggested to be involved in virus replication. The protein, with a high content of charged residues, possesses a strong affinity for single-stranded RNA species but, to date, all studies have failed to identify any specificity in the NS2-RNA interaction. In this report, we have examined, through RNA binding assays using highly purified NS2, the specificity of interaction with different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) species in the presence of appropriate competitors. The data obtained show that NS2 indeed has a preference for BTV ssRNA over nonspecific RNA species and that NS2 recognizes a specific region within the BTV10 segment S10. The secondary structure of this region was determined and found to be a hairpin-loop with substructures within the loop. Modification-inhibition experiments highlighted two regions within this structure that were protected from ribonuclease cleavage in the presence of NS2. Overall, these data imply that a function of NS2 may be to recruit virus messenger RNAs (that also act as templates for synthesis of genomic RNAs) selectively from other RNA species within the infected cytosol of the cell during virus replication."

https://openalex.org/W2053053104,"CooA is a CO-dependent heme protein transcription factor of the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum. CO binding to its heme causes CooA to bind DNA and activate expression of genes for CO metabolism. To understand the nature of CO activation, several CooA mutational variants have been studied by resonance Raman spectroscopy, in vivo activity measurements, and DNA binding assays. Analysis of the Fe–C and C–O stretching Raman spectroscopy bands permits the conclusion that when CO displaces the Pro2 heme ligand, the protein forms a hydrophobic pocket in which the C-helix residues Gly117, Leu116, and Ile113 are close to the bound CO. The displaced Pro2 terminus is expelled from this pocket, unless the pH is raised above the pKa , in which case the terminus remains in H-bond contact. The pKa for this transition is 8.6, two units below that of aqueous proline, reflecting the hydrophobic nature of the pocket. The proximal Fe–His bond in Fe[II]CooA is as strong as it is in myoglobin but is weakened by CO binding, an effect attributable to loss of an H-bond from the proximal His77 ligand to the adjacent Asn42 side chain.

A structural model is proposed for the position of the CO-bound heme in the active form of CooA, which has implications for the mechanism of CO activation. CooA is a member of the emerging class of heme sensor proteins that modulate biological activity in response to fluctuations in the concentration of the gaseous molecules CO, NO, or O2 (1Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Chan M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Binding of these diatomic ligands to the heme induces the biological response. The mechanisms whereby the protein responds to the binding event are of great current interest. CooA is isolated from the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, which grows anaerobically on CO as sole energy source (3Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). CooA regulates the expression of genes, termed coo for COoxidation, whose products are associated with CO metabolism. The protein is a homodimer (222 amino acids per monomer) containing two b-type hemes that reversibly bind CO. The CO binding enables the protein to bind a specific DNA sequence and induce transcription of the coo genes. CooA contains DNA-binding and signal domains analogous to those found in the catabolite gene activator protein CAP 1The abbreviations used are: CAP, catabolite gene activator protein; RR, resonance Raman; Mb, myoglobin; WT, wild-type; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

The heme is bound within the signal domain, where it is ligated by a histidine (His77) side chain (although this ligand is replaced by the Cys75 side chain when the Fe[II] is oxidized to Fe[III] (4Reynolds M.F.

The sixth Fe[II] ligand is unprecedented; it is the N-terminal proline residue (Pro2) from the opposite chain, which is displaced by CO binding (5Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K.

To elucidate the nature of the CO-bound form of CooA and the mechanism of its CO activation, we have prepared a series of CooA variants by site-directed mutagenesis and examined in vivo activity, specific DNA binding, and the Fe–CO and C–O stretching resonance Raman (RR) bands. The residues chosen for mutagenesis are in the region of the heme groups, as defined by the Fe[II]CooA structure. Fig. 2 gives a close up view of this region. The data permit us to identify the approximate position of the heme-CO in CooA and propose a specific model for how that positioning affects CooA activation and leads to the C-helix repositioning. An important aspect of the active form involves the breakage of a critical interaction that stabilizes the inactive structure: an H-bond from the His77 proximal ligand to the side chain of Asn42. These structural inferences also provide a basis for understanding the cooperative binding and complex kinetics of CooA. 2M. Puranik, S. B. Nielsen, H. Youn, J. L. Bourassa, M. A. Case, A. N. Hvitved, C. Tengroth, G. Balakrishnan, M. V. Thorsteinsson, J. S. Olson, G. P. Roberts, J. T. Groves, G. L. McLendon, and T. G. Spiro, manuscript in preparation. Finally, we propose a structural model for the heme movement that is consistent with the data and will serve as a working hypothesis for future work. Strains, Plasmids, and in Vivo Assays—The construction of strains overexpressing WT CooA and CooA variants in an Escherichia coli background having a β-galactosidase reporter system in the chromosome was described previously (8Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol.

All the site-directed and region-randomized CooA mutations were constructed in a pEXT20-based expression plasmid, which provides tight control of CooA expression (11Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L.

Some CooA variants such as C75S, L116K, and M124R CooA were purified with modified methods, which are also described elsewhere (12Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P.

The purity of WT CooA and CooA variants was estimated to be >95% based on SDS-PAGE (in the case of L116K CooA, ∼90%). The heme content of CooA preparations was estimated using the extinction coefficient of Fe[III] WT CooA (3Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or by a modified reduced pyridine-hemochromogen method (3Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Vitro DNA Binding Assays—In vitro DNA binding assays of WT CooA and CooA variants were performed using the method described elsewhere (11Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As a fluorescence probe, a 26-bp target DNA containing PcooF was labeled with Texas Red on one end of the duplex and used at the concentration of 6.4 nm. Salmon sperm DNA was used as the nonspecific DNA competitor. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting of the binding data to a nonlinear equation with correction of the fluorescence quenching as described elsewhere (15Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—Purified CooA was diluted in buffer (25 mm Mops/0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) to a heme concentration of ∼20 μm. Other pH values were investigated using 0.1 m Tris, pH 7–9, 0.1 m glycine, pH 9.5–10, and ∼0.1 m NaOH, pH 11–12). CooA samples were purged with N2 for 20 min and then with CO for ∼3 min, followed by reduction of the Fe[III] to the Fe[II] form with sodium dithionite (final concentration ∼63 mm). Reduction and CO binding were monitored by changes in the absorption spectra. RR Spectroscopy—RR spectra were obtained with excitation wavelengths of 406.7 and 568.1 nm from a Kr+ laser (2080-RS; Spectra Physics) and 441.7 nm from a He-Cd (Liconix) laser in a 270° backscattering sample geometry. Photodissociation of the bound CO was minimized by using low laser power (∼5 milliwatts at the sample) and by focusing it with a cylindrical lens onto a spinning sample. The scattered light was collected and focused onto a single spectrograph (Chromex) equipped with a notch filter (Kaiser Optical) and a CCD detector (Roper Scientific) operating at 77 K. Spectra were calibrated with dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. The goal of this study has been to understand the nature of the heme environment of CO-bound CooA and use this information to better understand the mechanism of CooA activation. RR and activity data are gathered and compared in Table I. We note at the outset that spectroscopic probes, which report on local structural features, are not expected to track the degree of activity, which measures the biochemical competency of the global protein conformation. It is the interplay between the two sets of data that inform our thinking about activation mechanism.Table ISummary of in vivo activity and RR band positions for the indicated CooA variantsCooAβ-Galactosidase activityCooA-CO Kd for DNA bindingCooA-CO Raman bandFe[II]aAnaerobically grown cells were used for the activity.CooA-CObAnaerobically grown cells in the presence of CO were used for the activity.v FeC (ΔWT)cShift in the Raman band center, relative to WT CooA-CO.v CO (ΔWT)cShift in the Raman band center, relative to WT CooA-CO.%d% activity, relative to WT CooA-CO; mean value of multiple measurements, <10% variability.nmcm-1Control0.51WT2100WT, pH 7ND487 (0)1982 (0)WT, pH 821WT, pH 9.540WT, pH 1085WT, pH 10.5500WT, pH 11ND500 (+13)1964 (-18)P2Y159108487 (0)1982 (0)ΔP3R42114241487 (0)1982 (0)N42A110253487 (0)1979 (-3)N42D18352487 (0)1979 (-3)N42K159120487 (0)1979 (-3)I95W412413488 (+1)1980 (-2)E99L2140ND486 (-1)1982 (0)W110L389ND488 (+1)1984 (+2)I113A1106105487 (0)1975 (-7)I113Y311116485 (-2)1985 (+3)I113H68179490 (+3)1971 (-11)I113D14>1,000489 (+2)1973 (-9)L116F178150487 (0)1979 (-3)L116K9973121500 (+13)1964 (-18)G117I44>1,000486 (-1)1977 (-5)G117S311>1,000494 (+7)1970 (-12)G117H44>1,000498 (+11)1964 (-18)M124R1311620485 (-2)1965 (-17), 1985 (+3)a Anaerobically grown cells were used for the activity.b Anaerobically grown cells in the presence of CO were used for the activity.c Shift in the Raman band center, relative to WT CooA-CO.d % activity, relative to WT CooA-CO; mean value of multiple measurements, <10% variability. Open table in a new tab The results of this study are organized in the following manner. 1) There are actually two different forms of CooA–CO, with different C–O stretching frequencies, as revealed by reanalysis of RR spectra. This observation has an effect on the interpretation of RR data in this manuscript and resolves a discrepancy in RR data reported previously. 2) Backbonding analysis of the RR data reveals that the Fe–His proximal bond is weakened in the major form of CooA–CO. Mutational data point to breaking of the His77-Asn42 H-bond as the cause of this weakening and is consistent with a significant role for this process in CooA activation. 3) The bound CO is certainly in close proximity to Ile113, Leu116, and Gly117, which has implications for the movement of the heme and the protein upon CO binding. This proximity was revealed by the RR analysis of mutational variants substituted at these positions that show striking perturbations and is generally consistent with functional characterization of these variants. 4) RR analysis of pH effects of WT CooA, and of variants containing deletions at the N terminus that includes Pro2, suggest that CO displacement of Pro2 leads to its expulsion from the hydrophobic CO binding pocket, because of its positive charge when protonated. The previously reported depression of the Fe[II]CooA ν11 heme RR band is found, via the effects of variants, to stem from the strong ligand field of the Pro2 ligand. Structurally Distinct Populations of CO-bound CooA—We have previously reported RR spectra of CooA–CO showing a Fe–CO stretching band (νFeC) at 487 cm–1 and an unusually high CO stretching band (νCO) at 1982 cm–1 (16Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, Uchida et al. (17Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported νCO = 1969 cm–1 for their CooA–CO preparation although they reported the same νFeC value as ours, 487 cm–1. To resolve this discrepancy we reexamined the νCO and νFeC regions of the RR spectrum at high amplification (Fig. 3), using 13CO shifts to identify the bands definitively. νFeC was measured at 487 cm–1, as before, and we also reproduced the 1982-cm–1 νCO band. However the newly measured νCO band has a pronounced shoulder at 1962 cm–1. Upon 13CO substitution, this 1962-cm–1 band shifted appropriately, indicating a second νCO band. The 487-cm–1 νFeC band is a single band. Deconvolution from the 465-cm–1 band of excess dithionite (Fig. 3) yields a bandwidth, 14.5 cm–1, which is less than that of the CO adduct of myoglobin (data not shown), 18 cm–1, ruling out multiple νFeC contributions in CooA–CO. Therefore, we conclude that the molecules having νCO = 1982 and 1962 cm–1 both have the same νFeC = 487 cm–1. The νCO reported by Uchida et al. (17Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), 1969 cm–1, is closer to the lower of the two values we observe, but their CooA–CO preparation also had a fraction with νCO = 1979 cm–1; this is the frequency reported in picosecond FTIR experiments (18Rubtsov I.V. Zhang T.Q. Nakajima H. Aono S. Rubtsov G.I. Kumazaki S. Yoshihara K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10056-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for CooA–CO molecules undergoing photolysis. Thus, CooA–CO has two populations of molecules, having distinct νCO values (1962 and 1982 cm–1 in our hands), but the same νFeC value, 487 cm–1. The relative size of the populations appears to be preparation-dependent. In our preparation the 1962-cm–1 fraction is small; the species is labeled CooA–CO′. We suggest that the species represented by 1982 cm–1 is the active form and that CooA–CO′ is a form that has not rearranged to the active, DNA binding structure. There may be an equilibrium between active and inactive forms, or else a fraction of the molecules are stuck in the inactive configuration because of an energy barrier of some type. Conformational Change of CooA upon CO Binding Weakens the Fe–His77 Bond by Breaking the His77-Asn42 H-bond—The anomalous νCO of the major form of CooA–CO, 1982 cm–1, is produced by a weakened Fe–His77 bond. This can be seen in a plot of νFeC against νCO (Fig. 4). Because of backbonding, νFeC and νCO are negatively correlated in heme proteins (19Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Ray G.B. Li X.Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar), as illustrated for a set of Mb variants in Fig. 4 (solid line). Changes in the polarity of the binding pocket augment or diminish backbonding and shift the points along the line (19Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Ray G.B. Li X.Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, the correlation is displaced upward when the Fe-proximal ligand bond is weakened, because of diminished σ bonding competition between the proximal ligand and the CO (19Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 21Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The upper dashed line in Fig. 4 represents data for Fe[II] porphyrin CO adducts without any trans ligand (21Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When the CooA–CO values are plotted on the graph, the minority form, CooA–CO′, is seen to fall near Mb variants with hydrophobic pockets, in which the distal histidine is replaced by hydrophobic residues (cluster of points marked –H64 in Fig. 4). However, the distinctly higher νCO of the dominant form, CooA–CO, places it above the Mb line by 7 cm–1, implying a weakened bond from the Fe to the proximal ligand, His77 in CooA (see Fig. 2). This displacement from the Mb backbonding line was missed in our earlier correlation (16Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), because a more varied group of heme proteins was used, having greater scatter of the points. The high νCO was instead attributed to negative polarity in the CO binding pocket (16Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, examination of the pocket region, defined by the mutagenesis results to be described below, fails to reveal any candidate residue with a negative charge or even a lone pair of electrons that could provide a negative dipole. In principle, peptide dipoles (22Macgregor R.B. Weber G. Nature. 1986; 319: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) could interact with the bound CO, but this is unlikely, because the residues that form the binding pocket are part of a helix. The inference of a weakened Fe–His77 bond in CooA–CO is strongly supported by the picosecond RR study by Uchida et al. (23Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which identified the Fe–His stretching band at 211 cm–1 in the immediate photoproduct of CooA–CO. This band, a direct measure of the Fe–His bond strength, is enhanced in five coordinate Fe[II] hemes, and is found at 220 cm–1 in deoxyMb (24Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-132Google Scholar). The distinctly lower value found by Uchida et al. (23Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) shows that the Fe–His77 bond is weaker than in Mb for the immediate photoproduct, consistent with a weaker bond in the CO adduct itself. The minority form, CooA–CO′, which lies on the Mb backbonding line (Fig. 4), does not have a weakened Fe–His77 bond and is expected to have an Mb-like photoproduct; however, its νFe–His would escape detection because of the low population. How strong is the Fe–His77 bond in Fe[II]CooA itself? Because Fe[II]CooA is six-coordinate, the Fe–His vibration is not enhanced (25Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar), and its frequency cannot be measured. However, we took advantage of a significant five-coordinate fraction in the G117I variant of Fe[II]CooA (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in which the bulky Ile side chain causes partial dissociation of the Pro2 ligand (see below). The five-coordinate heme Soret absorption band is red-shifted from the six-coordinate band, allowing us to use laser wavelength tuning (442 nm) to enhance the five-coordinate RR signals (Fig. 5). Selection of the five-coordinate species is confirmed by the position of the strong ν4 band at 1355 cm–1, the standard five-coordinate frequency (25Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar). The νFe–His band is seen at 220 cm–1, the same frequency as in deoxyMb. Thus the Fe–His bond is as strong in G117I variant of Fe[II]CooA as in Mb. We infer that the Fe–His bond is similarly strong in WT Fe[II]CooA (there is no reason that steric displacement of Pro2 should make the proximal Fe–His connection stronger) and that it weakens significantly in the major form of CooA–CO, as well as its immediate photoproduct. At later times, the photo-product νFe–His position should increase to 220 cm–1 as the protein relaxes to the Fe[II]CooA structure, but this process cannot be followed in photolysis experiments because of rapid geminate rebinding of CO (18Rubtsov I.V. Zhang T.Q. Nakajima H. Aono S. Rubtsov G.I. Kumazaki S. Yoshihara K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10056-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results establish that CO binding weakens the Fe–His77 bond. We therefore asked what could be the mechanism responsible for this property of CooA. It has been known that H-bond donation increases the anionic character of the imidazole ring and strengthens the Fe–His bond (26Stein P. Mitchell M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7795-7797Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, the Fe–His frequency is much higher, 240 cm–1, in five-coordinate Fe[II] forms of the peroxidases that have a negative Asp side chain in position to accept the proximal His H-bond (24Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-132Google Scholar). In Mb the proximal His is H-bonded to a neutral OH group of a Ser residue, as well as to a backbone carbonyl (Fig. 4, inset). In the Fe[II]CooA structure (Fig. 2), the H-bond acceptor is the amide side chain carbonyl of Asn42 (Fig. 2). The O ... N distance is short, 2.7 Å (1Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Chan M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), making it reasonable that the H-bond is equivalent to the proximal H-bonds in Mb. Because the Fe–His bond strength depends on the His H-bond status, the observed weakening of the Fe–His77 bond in CooA–CO implies weakening of the His77-Asn42 H-bond when CO binds. This inference is strongly supported by the nearly unaltered νFeC or νCO positions when Asn42 is replaced by Ala, Lys, or Asp, which have different capability of forming H-bond (Fig. 6). This result indicates that neither Asn42 nor its replacements are within H-bonding range of His77 in the major CooA–CO form. If Asn42 remained H-bonded to His77 in CooA–CO, then its replacement by Ala, which would eliminate the H-bond, would have raised νFeC and νCO, whereas replacement by Asp, a stronger H-bond acceptor, would have lowered them. The absence of either effect implies that His77 has moved away from residue 42 in CooA–CO. With regard to the minor CooA–CO′ form, we note that the low frequency shoulder on the N42A νCO band is attenuated relative to the wild-type 1962-cm–1 shoulder. Curve resolution gives a higher frequency, 1966 cm–1 for the N42A shoulder, suggesting a weakened H-bond in the N42A CooA–CO′ structure. Although Asn42 interacts with His77 in the Fe[II] form and not the CO-bound form, the nature of the residue is of some importance to activation. N42A, N42D, and N42K CooA all displayed poorer DNA affinity in the presence of CO (and poorer β-galactosidase activity) than did WT CooA (Table I), suggesting some additional role for this residue in the active form. The basis for that effect is unknown. Note that the activity assays that measure DNA affinity are somewhat easier to interpret than the in vivo assays reporting β-galactosidase activity, because the former only measures DNA binding, whereas the latter measures interaction with RNA polymerase and has other complications (8Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results indicate that an element of the activation mechanism is the perturbation of the His–Fe bond. The data and arguments below strongly suggest that the His–Fe bond is perturbed by displacement of the heme upon CO binding, which is critical for CooA activation. Hydrophobic C-helix Residues, but Not Pro2, Form the CO Pocket of CooA That Is Necessary for Activation—The distal heme pocket has an important role in ligand discrimination in many heme proteins (27Spiro T.G. Kozlowski P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CooA activation is specific to CO, and an understanding of the CO binding pocket should be valuable in understanding both specificity and the activation in response to CO. We have already shown that hydrophobic residues at positions 113 and 116 are critical for normal CO activation (28Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that Gly117 is also necessary for this response (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M.

However, the positioning of these residues with respect to the bound CO was not investigated. We therefore measured the RR spectra of a variety of CooA variants that were either novel in terms of activity and might therefore be altered in their sensing of the bound CO (Table I) or assumed to be near bound CO based on the struc"

Phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), also referred to as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, catalyzes the reversible isomerization of d-glucose 6-phosphate to d-fructose 6-phosphate. Comparison of available bacterial and eukaryal sequences and structures (Bacillus stearothermophilus (1Sun Y. Chou C. Chen W. Wu R. Meng M. Hsiao C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 309: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) indicates homologous PGI enzymes that consist of a homodimer of 60–70-kDa subunits. Structural and biochemical studies have established that enzymes belonging to this family are based on an αβα sandwich (3Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These studies have led to the proposal of several mechanisms that are based on general acid-base catalysis and are thought to proceed via a cis-enediol intermediate in a metal-independent process involving critical glutamate, histidine, and lysine residues in the isomerization and ring-opening steps of the reaction. One such proposed mechanism from Read et al. (3Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is displayed in Fig. 2b. In the hyperthermophilic Archaea Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) 1The abbreviations used are: Pfu, Pyrococcus furiosus; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; Tli, Thermococcus litoralis. the metabolism of sugars proceeds via a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway (4Kengen S.W.M. de Bok F.A.M.

An analysis of the Pfu genome for counterparts of the bacterial and eukaryal glycolytic enzymes indicated that the archaeal glycolytic pathway is catalyzed by distantly related or unique enzymes. Phosphoglucose isomerase is one of the enzymes for which the corresponding gene could not be initially identified by comparative analyses despite the fact that significant PGI activity could be detected in the soluble fraction of disrupted Pfu cells (4Kengen S.W.M. de Bok F.A.M.

Recently, a reversed genetics approach has led to the unambiguous identification of the gene encoding this enzyme in both Pfu (6Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E.

Wakagi T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The identification of the gene for Pfu PGI revealed that this enzyme comprises a 21.5-kDa polypeptide of 189 amino acids, and gel filtration analysis has suggested that, like the eukaryotic and bacterial enzymes, it forms a homodimer in solution. Biochemical studies have shown that Pfu PGI shows high thermostability with an optimum temperature in excess of 90 °C (6Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E. Schiltz E. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J.

However, sequence comparisons failed to reveal any similarity between the Pfu enzyme and PGIs of eukaryotic and bacterial origin, strongly suggesting that the PGIs from Archaea are based on a completely different three-dimensional structure. The recognition of elements of the consensus sequence belonging to the cupin domain in the amino acid sequence of Pfu PGI suggested that this enzyme belongs to the cupin superfamily (6Verhees C.H.

In this paper we report the three-dimensional structure of Pfu PGI as a contribution toward understanding the molecular basis of its substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism. The archaeal PGI is compared with the different class of PGIs present in other domains of life and with proteins that are functionally different but share the same cupin fold. Crystallization and Data Collection—PGI from Pfu was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and crystallized as described previously (37Akerboom, J., Turnbull, A. P., Hargreaves, D., Fisher, M., de Geus, D., Sedelnikova, S. E., Berrisford, J. M., Baker, P. J., Verhees, C. H., van der Oost, J., and Rice, D. W. (2003) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar). The crystals belong to space group C2 with unit-cell dimensions a = 84.7 Å, b = 42.4 Å, c = 57.3 Å, β = 120.6 Å, and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Preliminary x-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Subsequently, three-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected on a single selenomethionine-incorporated crystal to a maximum resolution of 2 Å using a MAR Research CCD detector on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The wavelengths were chosen near the selenium absorption edge based on a fluorescence absorption spectrum obtained from the crystal in order to maximize the f ″ component (λ1, peak), to minimize the f ′ component (λ2, inflection), and to maximize Δf ′ (λ3, remote). The data for each wave-length were processed individually and scaled in such a way as to preserve the anomalous signal using the DENZO/SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski A. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Soaks with metal ions were performed by adding 1 μl of 10 mm MnSO4 or ZnSO4 in 1.6 m sodium citrate dihydrate, pH 6.5, to the 2-μl drop containing the crystal for 4 h. The resulting soaked crystal was flash cooled in liquid nitrogen at 100 K, and data were collected to a 2.2- and 1.86-Å resolution, respectively, on a MAR345 image plate detector using platinum/nickel mirror-focused CuKα x-rays produced by a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator. All data were processed and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski A. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) and subsequently were handled using Collaborative Computing Project 4 software (Table II) (11Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data were analyzed using XPREP (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI), and the selenium substructure was determined using the “half-baked” approach as implemented in SHELXD (12Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar). Preliminary phases were calculated using SHELXE (12Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar), and a preliminary model was automatically built at a 2-Å resolution using the SOLVE/RESOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; D55: 849-861Crossref Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) package. Rounds of rebuilding and refinement using REFMAC5 (14Murshudov G.N.

Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar) resulted in a final model with R factor of 17.9% and R free of 25.7% (Table III). The model contains 187 amino acid residues and 230 water molecules/subunit. The two C-terminal residues Lys188 and Lys189 have no density and were omitted. In the final model there are no non-glycine Ramachandran outliers with 91% in favored conformations (PROCHECK, Ref. 16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Similarly, for the data from the crystal soaked in 10 mm ZnSO4, a single 5σ peak could be seen adjacent to the same side chains and was thus assigned to a zinc ion. Solvent-accessible areas were calculated using AREAIMOL (17Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å2, and ion pairs were determined using CONTACT with a maximum probe radius of 4 Å (18Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 857-885Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using WebLab ViewerPro, Molscript (19Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Elemental Analysis—A sample of Pfu PGI was subject to multielemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, HP4500). The 15-mg/ml sample was diluted 20-fold in high purity water (Millipore) prior to analysis. The instrument was calibrated using an in-house multielement standard solution (19 elements, 100 μg/liter). Molecular Structure of Pfu PGI—The structure of Pfu PGI was solved to a 2-Å resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using crystals of selenomethionine-containing protein. A representative section of the final electron density map is presented in Fig. 1a. Gel filtration shows that Pfu PGI forms a homodimer (37Akerboom, J., Turnbull, A. P., Hargreaves, D., Fisher, M., de Geus, D., Sedelnikova, S. E., Berrisford, J. M., Baker, P. J., Verhees, C. H., van der Oost, J., and Rice, D. W. (2003) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar), and analysis of the crystal contacts showed that two subunits related by the crystallographic 2-fold around the b axis form extensive contacts consistent with a plausible dimer. The fold of Pfu PGI is based on a cupin domain (Fig. 1b). At the N terminus the chain starts by forming a short stretch of β structure (β1′), which forms an additional strand on the edge of the cupin domain of the 2-fold-related subunit (Fig. 1c). The two sheets that form the cupin domain have 7 (β2, β3, β4, β11, β6, β9, and β1′) and 5 (β12, β5, β10, β7, and β8) strands, respectively, and between them a deep pocket with approximate dimensions 5 × 8 × 8 Å can be observed (Fig. 1c). Following the cupin domain, a short α helix (α3, residues 160–166) and two antiparallel β strands (β13 (residues 171–175) and β14 (residues 182–187)), which lie on the periphery of the molecule, lead to the C terminus. Overall each subunit contains 14 β strands and 3 α helices (Fig. 2), which represent 47 and 12% of the total structure, respectively. The dimer has dimensions of ∼80 × 40 × 40 Å, and the interface between the two subunits is mainly hydrophobic and comprises residues principally from β strands β1′, β6, β9, and β11 and the loop regions between β3-β4 and β7-β8. The interface also includes the formation of a small hydrophilic cluster involving interactions between the side chains of Lys3, which lies near the start of β1′, Tyr129, from β9, and Gln59′ and Asp65′, from the β3-β4 loop (Fig. 1c). A single subunit of Pfu PGI has a solvent-accessible area of 10,150 Å2 (figure to the nearest 50 Å2). On forming the dimer 1800 Å2 (17.8%) of the subunit solvent-accessible surface is buried, with this proportion lying in the middle of the range observed for other dimeric proteins (23Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thermal Stability—The cupin domain has been identified as a stable fold and has been utilized as a platform for the construction of proteins involved in stress response in bacterial and eukaryotic systems (24Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, barley oxalate oxidase is remarkably resistant to proteolysis (25Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Mirobiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Like many proteins from hyperthermophiles, Pfu PGI displays exceptional thermal stability (6Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E. Schiltz E. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40926-40932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structures of a number of hyperthermophilic proteins has so far failed to reveal a single mechanism that is responsible for stabilizing proteins at high temperatures. A striking structural feature found in many hyperthermophilic proteins compared with their mesophilic counterparts is the presence of networks of ion pairs (26Yip K.S.P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Artymuik P.J. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Engel P.C. Pasquo A. Chiaraluce R. Consalvi V. Scandurra R. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This correlates with the bias for a higher proportion of charged versus polar (non-charged) amino acids in the proteomes of hyperthermophilic organisms with optimum growth temperatures above 80 °C (27Vertriani C. Maeder D.L. Tolliday N. Yip K.S.-P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Klump H.H. Robb F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12300-12305Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In Pfu PGI, there are 13 ion pair interactions/monomer, of which 11 are intrasubunit and 2 are intersubunit. Overall the number of ion pairs/residue (0.07) within Pfu PGI is not significantly greater than that seen in an analysis of mesophilic proteins (0.04) (Ref. 18Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 857-885Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and is less than that observed in some hyperthermophilic proteins (0.13) (Ref. 26Yip K.S.P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Artymuik P.J. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Engel P.C. Pasquo A. Chiaraluce R. Consalvi V. Scandurra R. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, an analysis of the nature of the ion pairs in Pfu PGI shows that 5 of the ion pairs are found in two small networks involving three (Lys80-Glu175-Lys180) and four (Asp94-Arg95-Glu155-Lys92) residues. The two closely related hyperthermophiles Pfu and Tli have optimal growth temperatures of 100 (28Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and 80 °C (29Neuner A. Jannasch H.W. Belkin S. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 153: 205-207Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), respectively, with the enzymes from the latter generally being less stable (27Vertriani C. Maeder D.L. Tolliday N. Yip K.S.-P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Klump H.H. Robb F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12300-12305Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Pfu and Tli PGIs are 84% identical, implying that their three-dimensional structures will be very similar. Although comparison of the sequences would suggest the 4-residue network ion pair is conserved, the substitution of Lys80 and Lys180 for Asn and Val, respectively, in Tli PGI would lead to the loss of the 3-residue network. This network stabilizes the contact between β strands β13 and β14 with the loop between β4 and β5 of the cupin domain, and the loss of this interaction could possibly lead to fraying of the chain at the C terminus and subsequent unfolding. However, whether the sequence differences are related to any difference in stability between these two enzymes and more generally whether the ion pairs are related to increased thermal stability are yet to be tested experimentally. Comparison with Other Enzymes—The fold of Pfu PGI, based as it is on a cupin domain, is completely different from the αβα sandwich of the much larger subunit that forms the structure of the eukaryotic (3Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and bacterial (1Sun Y. Chou C. Chen W. Wu R. Meng M. Hsiao C. Proc. Natl.

Structural overlaps between Pfu PGI and these proteins primarily involve residues from the cupin domains. Only oxalate decarboxylase showed any significant sequence similarity when compared with Pfu PGI, with 35% identity between the two sequences. Two enzymes, phosphomannose isomerase (34Cleasby A. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Hubbard R.E. Davies G.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Bernard A.R. Payton M.A. Wells T.N.C. Nat. Struct.

Moreover, whereas phosphomannose isomerase requires a bound divalent metal ion for catalytic activity (34Cleasby A. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Hubbard R.E. Davies G.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Bernard A.R. Payton M.A. Wells T.N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase does not (9Giraud M.F. Leonard G.A. Field R.A. Berlind C. Naismith J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The dimeric structure of auxin-binding protein 1 closely resembles that of Pfu PGI, and dimerization of both enzymes is achieved via interactions mainly between residues belonging to the larger of the β sheets, which makes up the cupin domain. The arrangement of the dimers of auxin-binding protein 1 (33Woo E. Marshall J. Bauly J. Chen J. Venis M. Napier R. Pickersgill R. EMBO J. 2002; 12: 2877-2885Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and Pfu PGI is also similar to that seen between the 2-fold-related subunits in the homohexamer of oxalate oxidase, the quaternary structure of which is based on six subunits arranged in D3 symmetry (36Woo E. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This structural similarity extends to the interaction of the larger β sheet of the cupin domain with the N-terminal β strand from a symmetry-related subunit (β1′ in Pfu PGI). The disposition of the two cupin domains in the dimer of Pfu PGI also resembles that between the two non-identical cupin domains found in the much larger monomeric bicupin enzyme phosphomannose isomerase (34Cleasby A. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Hubbard R.E. Davies G.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Bernard A.R. Payton M.A. Wells T.N.C. Nat. Struct.

However, many cupin domains contain metal ion-binding sites for first row transition metals (35Anand R. Dorrestein P.C. Kinslnad C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) binding Mn2+. Furthermore, despite differences in the metal ions bound by these proteins, the ligands used for coordinating these ions are often identical in sequence and are spatially conserved between auxin-binding protein 1 (His57, His59, Glu63, and His106), oxalate oxidase (His88, His90, Glu95, and His137), and oxalate decarboxylase (His95, His97, Glu101, and His140). In phosphomannose isomerase the four residues that form the metal-binding ligands (Gln111, His113, Glu138, and His285) differ only in the replacement of one of the histidines by a glutamine. Moreover, despite the apparent differences in sequence numbers, these residues are structurally equivalent, as phosphomannose isomerase has two large insertions compared with these other proteins. Comparison of these structures with Pfu PGI revealed that the latter conserves each of the four metal-binding ligands (His88, His90, Glu97, and His136), strongly suggesting the presence of a metal ion-binding site in this enzyme. However, examination of the electron density map provided no evidence for a bound metal. PGI Binds First Row Transition Metals—The close similarity of the structure of Pfu PGI to the metalloenzymes described above together with the apparent identification of the metal-binding ligands led us to consider the possibility that Pfu PGI, like other members of the cupin superfamily, might bind a first row transition metal. Analysis of the electron density map for Pfu PGI clearly indicated that the potential metal-binding site was unoccupied. However, this could be explained by the purification protocol of the enzyme, which included EDTA (37Akerboom, J., Turnbull, A. P., Hargreaves, D., Fisher, M., de Geus, D., Sedelnikova, S. E., Berrisford, J. M., Baker, P. J., Verhees, C. H., van der Oost, J., and Rice, D. W. (2003) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant Pfu PGI, purified in the absence of EDTA, showed the clear presence of iron in the protein sample. Despite this, the specific activity of the metal-depleted enzyme is comparable with that of Pfu PGI purified in the absence of EDTA either from Pfu or from the overexpressing E. coli strain (Table I). Incubation of the EDTA-purified recombinant enzyme with Zn2+ (4 mm), Fe2+ (1 mm), or Mn2+ (5 mm) gave rise to enhancements to the specific activities of ∼5, 50, and 500%, respectively (Table I). Although inductively coupled plasma data would suggest that the enzyme preferentially binds Fe2+ in the metal-binding site as outlined above, activity is not necessarily maximal with iron, and further analysis of the protein isolated from Pfu is required. More recently Jeong et al. (8Jeong J.J. Fushinobu S. Ito S. Jeon B.S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have reported the identification of iron as the bound metal in recombinant Tli PGI, expressed in E. coli.Table ISpecific activity assaysProtein sampleAssay temperatureSpecific activity°Cunits/mgNative PGI5020Rec PGIaRec PGI is the recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli.5019Rec PGI6021Rec PGI + Zn2+ (4 mm)6022Rec PGI + Mn2+ (5 mm)60100Rec PGI4012Rec PGI + Fe2+ (1 mm)4019a Rec PGI is the recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli. Open table in a new tab The position of the metal-binding site within Pfu PGI was confirmed by difference Fourier analysis using data from crystals purified in the presence of EDTA and soaked with either Mn2+ (Fig. 1d) or Zn2+ (data not shown) (Table II). This confirmed that these cations bind as predicted, making interactions with His88 (3.1 Å), His90 (2.9 Å), Glu97 (2.0 Å), and His138 (2.3 Å) (Fig. 1d). Location of the Putative Active Site—Thus far, we have been unable to identify the substrate-binding site in Pfu PGI by difference Fourier analysis on crystals soaked with substrates or inhibitors (Table III). Furthermore, the relatively high sequence similarity of the related enzymes from Pfu and Tli is such that the active site cannot be predicted to any degree of certainty from the pattern of sequence conservation. Analysis of the sequence conservation between these PGIs and the putative PGIs identified by analysis of genome sequence data from Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina acetivorans, and Sinorhizobium meliloti reveals striking conservation at one end of the pocket formed between the two β sheets of the cupin domain and involving the four metal-binding ligands (Fig. 4). Also seen is significant conservation of the hydrophilic residues, which line this pocket and include the conserved tyrosines (Tyr52, Tyr99, and Tyr160) and threonines (Thr71 and Thr85). However, a number of inward-facing hydrophobic residues are substituted, particularly Ala69, Phe148, and Ala150. Finally His158, on the edge of the pocket, is substituted by serine or glutamine. Despite the uncertainty of the reaction catalyzed by these other enzymes, this analysis would seem to point to the active site being in this region of the structure, in line with the position of the active sites in other enzymes based on the cupin fold. The size of the pocket between the two β sheets in Pfu PGI is consistent with binding of a glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) or a fructose 6-phosphate moiety. Moreover, analysis of the structure reveals that there are a number of residues that could form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups of the sugar and two groups of positively charged residues that could neutralize the negative charge on the phosphate group of the substrate. Modeling studies suggest that Glc-6-P can be orientated in the pocket in two distinctly different orientations. In one of the orientations the phosphate group is bound by an arginine-lysine cluster (Lys21, Arg25, and Lys86). This would place the C1 and C2 of Glc-6-P deep in the pocket, adjacent to the transition metal center and nearby the side chains of Tyr152 and His158 and the more remote side chain of Glu58 (Fig. 3c). In the alternative orientation the phosphate group lies adjacent to the transition metal center, with the C1 and C2 of Glc-6-P adjacent to side chains of Lys21, Ser23, Arg25, Lys86, His158, and Tyr160 (Fig. 3d). In either orientation the residues flanking the C1 and C2 hydroxyls are not completely conserved, except in Pfu and Tli PGIs, but the hydrophilic side chains that line the pocket are in positions that could form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups of the glucose. In the absence of experimental data, we cannot be certain of the orientation of the substrate, and indeed orientations other than the ones described are possible. Given that catalysis does not depend strongly on the presence or absence of transition metal, we would favor a binding mode in which the catalytic center is on the outer lip of the cupin domain with the phosphate group binding adjacent to the metal center. However, this is not consistent with the pattern of sequence conservation seen between Pfu and Tli PGI and the other putative PGIs. This analysis is further complicated by the lack of biochemical verification of the true activity of these putative PGIs which, although clearly related in structure, are not necessarily related in function. This ambiguity can only be resolved by the independent identification of the substrate-binding site of Pfu PGI and further studies on the function of the putative PGIs. The structure of Pfu PGI described here clearly reveals a further example of the diverse role to which a cupin domain can be applied. Furthermore, the structure reveals a completely different fold from that found in the PGIs belonging to the eukaryotic and bacterial kingdoms. Further studies on this enzyme will allow us to define the enzyme mechanism in more detail and, should the mechanism prove to be related to that of the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, to provide a new example of convergent evolution at work.

Our characterization indicated that the major function of Utp8p is in nuclear tRNA export. Like the S. cerevisiae Los1p and the mammalian exportin-t, which are proteins known to facilitate nuclear tRNA export, overexpression of Utp8p restored export of tRNAamTyr mutants defective in nuclear export. Furthermore, depletion of Utp8p blocked nuclear export of mature tRNAs derived from both intronless and intron-containing pre-tRNAs but did not affect tRNA and rRNA maturation, nuclear export of mRNA and ribosomes, or nuclear tRNA aminoacylation. Overexpression of Utp8p also alleviated nuclear retention of non-aminoacylated tRNATyr in a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase mutant strain. Utp8p binds tRNA directly and saturably, indicating that it has a tRNA-binding site. Utp8p does not appear to function as a tRNA export receptor, because it does not shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

Many of the components of the NPC, known as nucleoporins, as well as the soluble transporters that participate in nuclear transport of proteins and nucleic acids have been identified in both mammalian and yeast cells (1Rout M.P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The transport proteins are frequently members of the β-karyopherin family of nuclear import/export receptors, which translocate macromolecules through the NPC by interacting with specific nucleoporins, and their function is regulated by RanGTPase, a small Ras-like protein (2Cullen B.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The function of Los1p is not essential, because disruption of the chromosomal LOS1 gene did not affect growth or viability of S. cerevisiae. This finding suggests that in addition to Los1p another receptor is required for nuclear tRNA export in S. cerevisiae. Early studies in Xenopus laevis suggest that aminoacylation of tRNAs in the nucleus plays a role in nuclear tRNA export (12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the observation that tRNATyr or tRNAMet microinjected in the nucleus of X. laevis is aminoacylated, and loss of nuclear aminoacylation of tRNATyr in oocytes by inhibition of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) (12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) led to a significant decrease in the efficiency of nuclear export of the RNA. Moreover, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been detected in the nucleus of mammalian cells (13Nathanson L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31559-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutants of tRNAPhe that are defective in aminoacylation, however, were found to be exported to the cytoplasm after injection into the nucleus of X. laevis oocytes (14Arts G.J. Kuersten S. Romby P. Ehresmann B. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7430-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that nuclear tRNA aminoacylation is not absolutely required for tRNA export in mammalian cells. Aminoacylated tRNAs were also detected in the nucleus of an S. cerevisiae nup116 mutant strain defective in nuclear export (15Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3041-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear retention of tRNA was observed in several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutant strains and in wild type strains when aminoacylation was blocked by amino acid starvation (16Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14366-14371Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Grosshans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation detected TyrRS in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae (18Azad A.K. Stanford D.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme was shown to contain a nuclear localization signal (18Azad A.K. Stanford D.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutation of the nuclear localization signal caused a reduction in the nuclear pool of the protein as well as a block in nuclear export of tRNATyr (18Azad A.K. Stanford D.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this mutation did not affect the aminoacylation activity of the enzyme or the viability of the cells (18Azad A.K. Stanford D.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results provided very good evidence that nuclear aminoacylation also plays a role in nuclear tRNA export in S. cerevisiae, but it is not absolutely required. Nuclear tRNA aminoacylation may constitute a Los1p-independent export pathway, because overexpression of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase restored export of tRNAMet but not tRNAIle in the los1 mutant strain (19Feng W. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5412-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The receptor that facilitates nuclear export of aminoacylated tRNAs in S. cerevisiae is not known. The ATP (CTP):nucleotidyltransferase (Cca1p) is an essential enzyme that prepares tRNAs for aminoacylation in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion by adding the nucleotides C, C, and A to the 3′ ends of tRNAs. This maturation step, but not aminoacylation itself, appears to be absolutely required for nuclear export of tRNAs in both mammalian cells and S. cerevisiae, and because it has been shown that exportin-t preferentially binds tRNAs with the 3′ CCA ends, nuclear tRNA export is blocked in a cca1 S. cerevisiae mutant strain, and tRNAs lacking CCA were not exported to the cytoplasm in X. laevis (12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Arts G.J. Kuersten S. Romby P. Ehresmann B. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7430-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kutay U. Schafer S. Gross H.J. Beier H. Gorlich D. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicated that Cca1p is directly involved in nuclear tRNA export in S. cerevisiae. Like methionyl-tRNA synthetase, overexpression of Cca1p restored nuclear export of tRNAMet, a tRNA made from intronless pre-tRNA, in the los1 mutant strain, and the protein was shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (19Feng W. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5412-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that Cca1p may function as a tRNA export receptor or an adaptor in a Los1p- and nuclear aminoacylation-independent pathway that is required for export of tRNAs obtained from intronless pre-tRNAs (19Feng W. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5412-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that loss of Los1p function and nuclear tRNA aminoacylation did not affect the viability of the cells (18Azad A.K. Stanford D.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether Cca1p or another unidentified Los1p- and aminoacylation-independent pathway facilitates nuclear export of tRNAs derived from intron-containing pre-tRNAs. The genetic and biochemical studies reported suggest that nuclear tRNA export in S. cerevisiae involves multiple redundant pathways. The details of these pathways, however, are poorly understood, and only a small number of the proteins that participate in nuclear tRNA export are known. We reported previously (21Cleary J.D. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 115-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the development of an amber suppression phenotypic assay in S. cerevisiae to identify eukaryotic proteins associated with the nuclear tRNA export process. This method involves the use of nuclear export-defective mutants of the yeast tyrosine amber suppressor tRNA as reporters to identify genes of proteins that can restore their export. In this report we employ a yeast tRNA three-hybrid interaction approach and the amber suppression assay to identify proteins of the nuclear tRNA export apparatus of S. cerevisiae. This strategy resulted in the identification of several proteins including Utp8p, an essential 80-kDa nucleolar protein that has been implicated in 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis (22Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Hunt D.F. Baserga S.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Our genetic and biochemical characterizations showed that the primary function of Utp8p is in nuclear tRNA export. The data suggest that the protein acts at a step in-between tRNA maturation/aminoacylation and translocation of the tRNA out of the nucleus. Utp8p may serve as an intranuclear factor that delivers aminoacylated and non-aminoacylated tRNAs to the appropriate tRNA export pathway.

Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were plated on complete synthetic dextrose (CSD) medium lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine (CSD-Ura-Leu-His) and containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole. Transformants appeared within 7 days of incubation at 30 °C. The His+ transformants were tested for lacZ expression using the colony lift assay as specified by Clontech. Isolation of the pACT2 Library Plasmid from His + LacZ + L40 coat Transformants—The transformants were grown at 30 °C on CSD-Leu medium to select for the pACT plasmid. A single colony was streaked on CSD-Leu medium containing 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for cells lacking the pIII vector carrying the tRNA-MS2 fusion gene. The pACT2 plasmid was isolated from the L40coat transformant and amplified in DH5α. DNA sequencing followed by a BLAST search of the S. cerevisiae genome data base provided the complete DNA sequence and identity of the cloned genes. Amber Suppression Analysis of the Effect of Overproduction of Utp8p on Nuclear Export of tRNAamTyr Mutants Defective in Export in S. cerevisiae—The yEPLAC195 plasmid with and without the gene for the wild type tRNAamTyr or the G11:C24 tRNAamTyr mutant was electroporated into a HEY301-129 transformant carrying pYX242-UTP8 or pYX242-LOS1, and transformants were selected on CSD-Leu-Ura medium. The transformants were grown at 30 °C in CSD-Leu-Ura medium and suppression of amber codons in the trp1 gene in HEY301-129 was assessed by growth of the transformants on CSD-Leu-Ura-Trp (21Cleary J.D.

Isolation of a Conditional utp8p Mutant Strain—The BY4743 (UTP8/utp8::KANR) heterozygote harboring pCEN-URA-GAL1-UTP8 was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected on YP medium containing 2% raffinose. The haploids were screened for Ura+ G418R on CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose, 2% galactose, and 200 μg/ml G418. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) Analysis of the Nucleocytoplasmic Distribution of tRNAs—The utp8 strain (BYU8) carrying the pCEN-URA-GAL1-UTP8 plasmid was grown overnight at 30 °C in CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose and 200 μg/ml G418. The cells were diluted to an A 600 of 0.1 in CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose and 2% glucose or 2% galactose and grown at 30 °C for 6 h. These conditions were also used for growth of HEY301-129 transformants except CSD-Leu-Ura medium was used. The cells (3 ml of culture) were treated as described (15Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Biol.

Hybridization was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h in hybridization buffer containing 0.5 pmol/μl of 5′-end fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. The cells were washed two times (10 min each at 45 °C) with 2× SSC and three times (10 min each at room temperature) with 1× SSC. 4′,6′-Diamidoindo-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) was used to visualize nuclear DNA. The slides were viewed under a 60× objective lens of a Nikon Eclipse 6600 microscope. The images were recorded using a Coolsnapfx monochrome CCD digital camera (Roper Scientific) and processed using Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Fluorescent Oligonucleotides—5′-End fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. The tRNAamTyr and tRNATyr were detected with 5′-CAAGATTTAGAGTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGATTTACAGTCTTG-3′, respectively. 5′-GGCCCAACGATGGCAACG-3′ was used to detect tRNAGly. These oligonucleotides are complementary to sequences in the anticodon stem-loop of the mature tRNAs. 5-GGTCTTACTTCCCATC-3′ was used to detect the U18 small nucleolar RNA (U18 snoRNA). Overproduction and Purification of Utp8p Containing an N-terminal His 6 Tag—The His6-tagged Utp8p was overproduced in E. coli BL21 Codon Plus (Novagen). A transformant carrying the pET(His)6-UTP8 vector was grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was diluted 50-fold into 2 liters of 2YT containing the antibiotics and grown at 37 °C until the culture reached an A 600 of 0.6.

The column was washed with 20 ml of binding buffer, followed by 20 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted from the column with binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Rabbit antibodies against purified Utp8p were prepared by ResGen, Huntsville, AL. Western Blot Analysis of Utp8p Expression—The utp8 mutant strain harboring the pCEN-URA-GAL1-UTP8 vector was grown overnight at 30 °C in CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose and 200 μg/ml G418. An aliquot of the culture was diluted to an A 600 of 0.1 in CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose and 2% glucose or 2% galactose and grown at 30 °C. At the required times, an aliquot of the culture corresponding to the same number of cells, based on A 600, was pelleted and washed with water.

The protein precipitate was rinsed with water and solubilized by boiling for 5 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, buffer containing 5% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.02% bromphenol (v/v). The proteins were separated on a 10% PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to Protran nitrocellulose membrane. Utp8p was detected with a rabbit anti-Utp8p antibody using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis of the State of tRNA Processing and Maturation—The utp8 and UTP8 (BYU) strains carrying the pCEN-URA-GAL1-UTP8 plasmid were grown overnight at 30 °C in CS medium lacking Ura and containing 2% raffinose and 200 μg/ml G418.

https://openalex.org/W2095015780,"The human β1,3-glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I) is the key enzyme responsible for the completion of glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage tetrasaccharide of proteoglycans (GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ1-O-serine). We have investigated the role of aspartate residues Asp194-Asp195-Asp196 corresponding to the glycosyltransferase DXD signature motif, in GlcAT-I function by UDP binding experiments, kinetic analyses, and site-directed mutagenesis. We presented the first evidence that Mn2+ is not only essential for GlcAT-I activity but is also required for cosubstrate binding. In agreement, kinetic studies were consistent with a metal-activated enzyme model whereby activation probably occurs via binding of a Mn2+·UDP-GlcA complex to the enzyme. Mutational analysis showed that the Asp194-Asp195-Asp196 motif is a major element of the UDP/Mn2+ binding site. Furthermore, determination of the individual role of each aspartate showed that substitution of Asp195 as well as Asp196 to alanine strongly impaired GlcAT-I activity, whereas Asp194 replacement produced only a moderate alteration of the enzyme activity. These findings along with molecular modeling and three-dimensional structure comparison of the GlcAT-I catalytic center with that of the Bacillus subtilis glycosyltransferase SpsA provided evidence that the interactions of Asp195 with the ribose moiety of UDP and of Asp196 with the metal cation Mn2+ were crucial for GlcAT-I function. Altogether, these results indicated that, similarly to the SpsA enzyme, the nucleotide binding site of GlcAT-I contains a XDD motif rather than a DXD motif.

They are implicated in numerous biological processes such as regulation of cell growth and proliferation, cytodifferentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (see for review Refs. 1Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar and 2Selleck S.B. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate GAG chains is initiated by the formation of a linkage tetrasaccharide GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ1-O attached to specific serine residues of core proteins. This typical tetrasaccharide sequence is also found on so-called “part time” proteoglycans (3Fransson L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar), such as α-thrombomodulin, whose anticoagulant function is regulated by the presence or absence of a chondroitin sulfate chain (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GAG chains are thereafter built up on this linkage region by the alternate addition of N-acetylhexosamine and glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues (see for review Ref. 5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly process of the GAG-protein attachment region involves the sequential transfer of monosaccharide residues from the corresponding nucleotide sugar starting at the reducing end by xylosyltransferase (6Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), galactosyltransferase I (7Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), galactosyltransferase II (8Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Hennet T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48189-48195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I) (9Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka O. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). GlcAT-I is responsible for the completion of the specific GAG-protein attachment tetrasaccharide sequence, thus playing an essential role in the control of further GAG chain elongation. Accordingly, it has been shown that once GlcA is added to the nascent glycopeptidic chain, the tetrasaccharide sequence is efficiently consumed by downstream glycosyltransferases (GTs), suggesting that GlcAT-I may catalyze a rate-limiting step of GAG chain synthesis (10Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Salimath P.V. Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9164-9168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Like other GTs, GlcAT-I is a type II membrane Golgi-resident protein, with a short N-terminal cytosolic tail, a transmembrane helix, a stem region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a GlcA moiety, from UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), onto the 3-hydroxyl group of the terminal galactosyl residue, leading to the formation of a β1,3-linkage. On the basis of studies on several nucleotide-sugar transferases that share a similar inverting mechanism, the reaction is believed to be the S N2 type, whereby a general base would be required for the nucleophilic attack of the acceptor substrate and is often Mn2+ ion-dependent. Sequence alignments of members of the β1,3-glucuronosyl-transferase family have revealed a sequence of three aspartate residues corresponding to the DXD (aspartate-any residue-aspartate) signature motif characteristic for many GTs and other enzymes that use nucleotidic substrates and require a divalent metal ion for activity. In GlcAT-I, this motif corresponds to residues Asp194, Asp195, and Asp196, which lie in a loop located at the junction between the donor and acceptor substrate binding subdomains of the enzyme (12Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the highly conserved DXD motif of GTs has a key role in metal-mediated donor substrate binding and phosphate-sugar bond cleavage. However, recent studies support the idea that these motifs are not equivalent in nucleotide binding and catalysis. For example, the DXD motif in GM2 synthase was required for enzymatic activity but was not found critical for UDP binding (13Li J. Rancour D.M. Allende M.L. Worth C.A. Darling D.S. Gilbert J.B. Menon A.K. Young Jr., W.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas the presence of an intact DXD sequence was a prerequisite for both donor substrate binding and activity of clostridial cytotoxins (14Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the case of the Bacillus subtilis SpsA protein, a XDD motif instead of the DXD motif has been shown to play a major role in metal-UDP-sugar complex interactions (15Tarbouriech N. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the role of GlcAT-I in GAG chain assembly, it is crucial to better understand the structure and function of the protein. Our laboratory has been deeply involved in determining the peptide domains and amino acids that are important for catalysis and membrane organization of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (16Ouzzine M.

Chem. 2002; 28: 25439-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have shown that GlcAT-I is organized as a homodimer involving an intermolecular disulfide bond mediated by a cysteine residue located in the stem region (18Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently identified essential amino acids governing the donor substrate specificity of GlcAT-I (19Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 28: 25439-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the current study, using site-directed mutagenesis combined with UDP-beads affinity binding experiments and kinetic analyses, we demonstrate that the human GlcAT-I Asp194-Asp195-Asp196 sequence is a major determinant of the UDP-GlcA and metal complex binding site. Furthermore, we showed by mutant expression together with molecular modeling and three-dimensional structure comparison that the two last aspartate residues of this motif, Asp195 and Asp196, are crucial for GlcAT-I function and display distinct roles in cosubstrate and divalent metal ion interactions.

Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cloning of the full-length GlcAT-I cDNA and construction of the recombinant pPICZBGlcAT-I vector designed for the heterologous expression of the recombinant enzyme in the methyltrophic yeast P. pastoris was performed as previously described (18Ouzzine M.

Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml of zeocin (Invitrogen). The cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base and 1% (v/v) glycerol). Expression was induced by methanol (2%, v/v) for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (215 rpm). Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, broken with glass beads, and further submitted to differential centrifugations as previously described (17Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 100,000 × g pellet corresponding to the membrane fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in sucrose-HEPES buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) before analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using a polyclonal antipeptide antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies, as previously described (18Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of GlcAT-I Enzyme Activity—Activity of recombinant human GlcAT-I was evaluated using Gal-Gal as acceptor substrate as previously described (18Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard incubations were performed in 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with 10 mm MnCl2, 25–50 μg of membrane protein, 1 mm Gal-Gal, 5 mm saccharonolactone, and 1 mm UDP-GlcA, in a total volume of 100 μl. For the evaluation of the metal ion dependence of GlcAT-I, Mn2+ was replaced by various divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Ba2+) at different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 50 mm). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and the reaction product was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography after chromophore labeling by reductive amination by aniline as previously described (22Wang W.T. Le Donne N.C. Ackerman B. Sweely C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The labeled water-soluble product was analyzed on a reverse phase C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 4 μm, Waters, Milford, MA) at a detection wavelength of 254 nm. The mobile phase was composed of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.05% (v/v) 1,4-diaminobutane in water adjusted to pH 6.0. Control assays in which either the donor substrate UDP-GlcA or the acceptor substrate Gal-Gal was omitted were simultaneously run under the same conditions. Addition of a GlcA residue on the nonreducing end of Gal-Gal was verified by the susceptibility of the product to hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase from bovine liver. A time course of the glucuronosyltransferase reaction showed that the product formation was linear with time over 90 min. Initial rate data were subsequently taken after a 60-min incubation time. Kinetic Studies of Mn2 + Activation—The effects of varying metal and UDP-GlcA concentrations on the initial reaction velocity were determined in the standard assay conditions, i.e. at a saturating concentration of acceptor substrate (Gal-Gal, 1 mm) with an incubation time of 60 min. Activation of wild-type and mutant GlcAT-I by Mn2+ was measured at 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm MnCl2, whereas UDP-GlcA concentration varied from 0 to 2.0 mm. To provide further insight into the mechanism underlying Mn2+ activation, data were simultaneously fitted to Equation 1, Equation 2, or Equation 3 according to Segel (23Segel I.H. Sons J.W. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analyis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 227-272Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot 2000 software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Equation 1 corresponds to a general model for metal ion activation in that Mn2+ is essential for catalytic activity as well as for formation of the activator-substrate complex, but not for ligand binding to the catalytic site. In this case, Mn2+ (A), UDP-GlcA (S), and the Mn2+·UDP-GlcA complex (SA) bind to free enzyme (E) and also to the activator-enzyme (EA) complex. Only the activator-enzyme-substrate-activator AE(SA) complex is catalytically active. According to Equation 2, only the Mn2+·UDP-GlcA complex (SA) binds to the enzyme. Equation 3 states that Mn2+ binds to the enzyme before UDP-GlcA (23Segel I.H. Sons J.W. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analyis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Kinetics.

In Equation 2, K 0 is the equilibrium constant of the metal-UDP-GlcA complex and K SA is the apparent dissociation constant of the enzyme·Mn2+·UDP-GlcA complex. In Equation 3, K A and K S are the dissociation constants of the enzyme·Mn2+ complex and of the enzyme·Mn2+·UDP-GlcA complex, respectively. UDP Beads Binding—Membrane fractions from yeast cells expressing recombinant wild-type and mutant GlcAT-I (100 μg of protein) were treated by 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C and submitted to 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation. The supernatants containing solubilized GlcAT-I and mutants were used for UDP binding experiments according to a procedure similar to that published previously (24Munro S. Freeman M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 10-μl aliquot of UDP beads (10 μmol of UDP/ml of gel) was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the Triton X-100-solubilized material in 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0–10 mm Mn2+. Incubations were also performed in the presence of UDP, UDP-GlcA, and GlcA used as potential inhibitors of GlcAT-I binding to UDP beads. Following incubation, the beads were harvested by centrifugation, the supernatant was saved and the beads were washed once in acetate buffer solution and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Both the supernatant and the bound material associated with the beads were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Molecular Modeling—All minimization operations were performed with Amber software version 6 (25Case, D. A., Pearlman, D. A., Caldwell, J. W., Cheatham, T. E., III, Ross, W. S., Simmerling, C. L., Darden, T. A., Merz, K. M., Stanton, R. V., Cheng, A. L., Vincen, J. J., Crowleyt, M., Tsui, V., Radmer, R. J., Duan, Y., Pitera, J., Massova, I., Seibel, G. L., Singh, U. C., Weiner, P. K., and Kollman, P. A. (1999) AMBER 6, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar), using the GlcAT-I donor substrate complex, Protein Data Band entry 1kws. In all cases, the structure of the donor substrate was deleted. To avoid the missing residue regions in this file, all minimizations were done keeping fixed all residues outside a sphere of 10-Å radius from the α carbon of residue 195 in the A chain. After addition of hydrogen atoms, 10 different models were minimized: wild-type GlcAT-I and D194A, D195A, D196A, D194E, D195E, D196E, D194A/D196A, D194A/D195A, and D195A/D196A mutants. Energy minimization was carried out for each model using the Sander classic program by means of 100 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient relaxation. Superposition of the Protein Data Bank files 1kws (GlcAT-I) and 1h7l (SpsA) was done using the program topp of the CCP4 Suite (26Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). GlcAT-I Is Preferentially Activated by Manganese Divalent Ions—Coordination with metal divalent ions is a commonly proposed mechanism accounting for the binding of the UDP-sugar cosubstrate by DXD motif-containing GTs. To analyze the specificity of GlcAT-I toward the metal cofactor, we examined the effect of various divalent cations with different sizes and van der Waals volumes (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Ba2+) on the enzyme activity. In the absence of metal ions (Fig. 1) or when the cations were chelated by EDTA (data not shown), the recombinant wild-type enzyme was inactive but was strongly activated in the presence of Mn2+ (0.1–10 mm), up to a specific activity of 70 pmol·min–1·mg–1 protein. Other divalent cations tested were able to stimulate GlcAT-I at various levels only when used at a high concentration (10 mm). Mg2+, Zn2+, and to a lesser extent Co2+, produced a significant activation of GlcAT-I, whereas Ca2+ and Ba2+ were not able to assist catalysis (Fig. 1). Activation levels produced by Mg2+ and Zn2+ was about 50% to that produced by Mn2+ and 25% in the case of Co2+ (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that no further activation or inhibition of the enzyme was observed when the concentration of Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ was increased up to 50 mm (data not shown). Altogether, these results clearly indicated that the metal ion binding site of GlcAT-I can accommodate several divalent metal ions but that Mn2+ is the best metal activator of the enzyme. Kinetic Studies of Manganese Activation of GlcAT-I—To analyze the mechanism underlying Mn2+ stimulation of the Glc-AT-I activity, detailed kinetic studies of Mn2+ activation were performed. Initial rates of reaction were measured using varying concentrations of UDP-GlcA (0–1 mm) in the presence of different concentrations of Mn2+ (0–1 mm) (Fig. 2). Analysis of the results clearly showed that GlcAT-I requires the metal for activity and that the velocity of the enzyme was remarkably stimulated by Mn2+ in a range of concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 2). In addition, the plots indicated that V max was approached at the Mn2+ concentration from 0.5 to 1 mm. Furthermore, no inhibitory effect at higher Mn2+ concentration (up to 50 mm) was observed (results not shown). Visual analysis of the kinetic data treated as Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 2, inset) showed that all the lines intersected in the second quadrant suggesting that the substrate binds weakly to the enzyme in the absence of Mn2+. Mathematical treatment of the kinetics was conducted by fitting the data to Equations 1, 2, 3. Fitting the data to Equations 1 and 3 resulted in parameters with standard error values higher than the mean value, except for V max (data not shown). This poor fit suggested that these models may not account for the activation mechanism of GlcAT-I by Mn2+ divalent ions. In contrast, the data were best-fit to Equation 2 (Table II) favoring the model corresponding to a metal-activated enzyme via complex formation between the metal activator and the substrate.Table IIKinetic analysis of GlcAT-I activation by Mn2 +GlcAT-IApparent kinetic parametersVmaxKSApmol·min-1·mgP-1mmWild-type69.5 ± 2.10.027 ± 0.005D194A78.9 ± 3.70.12 ± 0.02D194E79.0 ± 2.90.083 ± 0.014 Open table in a new tab Identification of Essential Residues within the GlcAT-I DDD Motif—To investigate the role of the GlcAT-I motif Asp194-Asp195-Asp96 in metal-dependent enzyme activity, we performed systematic mutations and analyzed the effect of each mutation on metal activation and UDP-enzyme interactions. Double mutants, in which both Asp194 and Asp195, Asp194 and Asp196, or Asp195 and Asp196 residues were replaced by alanine and a series of mutants in which each individual aspartate residue was substituted by alanine, glutamic acid (Fig. 3A), or asparagine (data not shown) were engineered and expressed in yeast P. pastoris. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fraction from yeast cells expressing the mutants showed that they were produced at a similar level to that of the wild-type protein except for the double mutants that were expressed in higher amounts (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the catalytic activity of the mutants indicated that mutation of Asp194 and Asp195, Asp194 and Asp196, or Asp195 and Asp196 led to an inactive enzyme confirming the important role of the DDD motif (Fig. 3B). The contribution of each residue was then analyzed indicating that replacement of Asp196 by alanine reduced by 75% the enzyme activity (Fig. 3B). Mutation of Asp195 to alanine strongly affected GlcAT-I enzyme, leading to 80% loss of activity (Fig. 3B). Thus, unexpectedly, the variable residue of the DXD motif of GTs, which is, in the case of GlcAT-I, Asp195, appears as critical as Asp196 for the enzyme activity. Replacement of Asp195 and Asp196 by either glutamic acid (Fig. 3B) or by asparagine (results not shown) did not overcome the loss of activity observed for alanine mutants. Finally, substitution of Asp194 by alanine or glutamic acid produced 15% reduction of activity suggesting that the aspartate residue at position 194 is less crucial for the enzyme function compared with Asp195 and Asp196 (Fig. 3B). Because of low activity exhibited by Asp195 and Asp196 mutants, kinetic studies of Mn2+ activation were performed only on D194A and D194E. Initial rates of reaction were measured at varying concentrations of UDP-GlcA in the presence of different concentrations of Mn2+ (Fig. 4, A and B). As noted for the wild-type enzyme, Lineweaver-Burk representation of the kinetic data (Fig. 4, A and B, inset) suggested a weak binding of the substrate"
https://openalex.org/W1971691411,"The β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), the major component of the senile plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is derived from proteolytic processing of a transmembrane glycoprotein known as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Human APP exists in various isoforms, of which the major ones contain 695, 751, and 770 amino acids. Proteolytic cleavage of APP by α- or β-secretases releases the extracellular soluble fragments sAPPα or sAPPβ, respectively.

Such stepwise folding processes may be related to the identification of distinct structural domains in the three-dimensional model of sAPPα.

Aβ is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a ubiquitous transmembrane protein that spans the membrane a single time (4Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A.

Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1) and exists in three main isoforms with 695, 751, or 770 amino acids (known as APP695, APP751, and APP770, respectively). The isoforms with 751 and 770 amino acids contain a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain (5Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Tokushima Y. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Nature. 1988; 331: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The 695-amino acid isoform lacks the protease inhibitor domain and is predominant in neurons (6Kang J. Müller-Hill B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). APP is proteolytically processed by a set of enzymes known as secretases. Cleavage of APP by α-secretase at a site located 13 amino acid residues upstream from its membrane insertion gives rise to a soluble secreted form of APP (sAPPα) and to a C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids (Fig. 1) (7Lammich S. Koiro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cleavage by β-secretase occurs at a site located 29 amino acids upstream from the membrane insertion point of APP, giving rise to secreted sAPPβ and to a C-terminal fragment with 99 amino acids that encompasses the whole Aβ peptide sequence (8Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase releases the Aβ peptide. In addition to its involvement in the production of Aβ and, hence, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, APP has been proposed to play several relevant physiological roles in cell proliferation (9Saitoh T. Sundsmo M. Roch J.M. Kimura N. Cole G. Schubert D. Oltersdorf T. Schenk D.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 615-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (10Breen K.C. Bruce M.

Rydel R.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, very little is known about the structure of APP or its folding and stability. Using synchrotron radiation small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, we have recently obtained the first structural model of the extracellular domain of human APP (12Gralle M. Botelho M.M. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3513-3524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Combined analysis of SAXS, CD, and size exclusion chromatography data revealed that sAPPα695 is monomeric in solution and exhibits an elongated shape. Analysis of CD data and secondary structure predictions based on the primary sequence of APP further indicated that sAPPα contains distinct folded domains and regions with little ordered structure. We now report studies of the equilibrium unfolding of sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and urea, monitored by a combination of CD, intrinsic and bis-ANS fluorescence, UV absorption, and SAXS measurements. Taken together, these results indicated a multistep folding pathway for sAPPα and revealed the existence of partially folded intermediate states in the unfolding by GdnHCl. Materials—Recombinant human sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as previously described (12Gralle M. Botelho M.M. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3513-3524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol, guanidine hydrochloride, and urea were purchased from Sigma. Bis-ANS (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was dissolved in methanol and then diluted to 1 mm in water for storage at 4 °C. NAP-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Ultraviolet Absorption Measurements—sAPPα (7.17 μm) was diluted in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the presence of increasing concentrations of denaturants (urea or guanidine hydrochloride), as indicated under “Results.” UV absorption spectra were measured at 25 °C on an Ultrospec 2000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) using 1-cm path length semimicro quartz cells. Blank and protein samples were continuously alternated, and the subtracted spectra were accumulated (24 integrations) using the manufacturer's software. The scattering contribution was determined from absorption measurements between 314 and 324 nm and subtracted from the raw data to yield corrected sAPPα absorption spectra. Because the extinction coefficient at 270 nm is independent of experimental conditions (13Tendian S.W. Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Chaiken I.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6464-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), spectra were normalized for their absorption at 270 nm. Differential absorption spectra were generated by subtracting the spectra of sAPPα in the presence of denaturant from the spectrum of native sAPPα, and denaturation was monitored by the change at 286 nm, where the largest differences were seen. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on Hitachi F-4500 (Tokyo, Japan) and ISS PC1 (Champaign, IL) spectrofluorometers. For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, the excitation was at 280 nm and emission was recorded from 300 to 420 nm, using 5-nm (F-4500) or 8-nm (ISS PC1) band passes for both excitation and emission. Bis-ANS fluorescence was measured with excitation at 365 nm and emission from 400 to 600 nm. All experiments were carried out in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the presence of increasing concentrations of denaturant, as indicated under “Results.” The fluorescence spectral center of mass (average emission wavelength, λav) was calculated according to the equation, λav=ΣλI(λ)/ΣI(λ)(Eq. 1) where λ is the emission wavelength, and I(λ) represents the fluorescence intensity at wavelength λ. Circular Dichroism—sAPPα isoforms were diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, with increasing concentrations of denaturants (urea or guanidine hydrochloride), as indicated under “Results.” Spectra were measured at 25 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Alternatively, 0.5 mg/ml solutions were measured using a 0.02-cm path length quartz cell on a Jasco J-810 instrument (at Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron). Unfolding was monitored by the loss of residual molar ellipticity at 222 nm. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS experiments were performed at the D11A-SAXS beamline at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron in Campinas, Brazil (14Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. Craievitch A. Torriani I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar). The monochromatic beam was tuned at 1.488 Å to minimize absorption by carbon atoms. The experimental setup included a temperature-controlled glass capillary and a Gabriel type two-dimensional position-sensitive detector. The buffer solution used was 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, with or without denaturants, as indicated under “Results.” The samples were kept at 10 °C during the measurements. More diluted protein samples were also measured to investigate possible concentration effects in the SAXS curves. Data acquisition was performed by taking several 600-s frames of each sample, which allowed control of any possible radiation damage. Several sample-detector distances enabled detection in the q range accessible within the given experimental conditions: 0.0328 Å–1 < q < 0.8538 Å–1 for sAPPα695 and 0.0241 Å–1 < q < 0.8609 Å–1 for sAPPα770. Data treatment was performed using the software package TRAT2D. 2C. L. P. Oliveira, unpublished observations. Usual corrections for detector homogeneity, incident beam intensity, sample absorption, and blank subtraction were included in this routine. The output of this software provides the corrected intensities and error values. Data fitting was performed using the GNOM computer program (15Semenyuk V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements— Fig. 2A shows intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of native sAPPα695 (solid line), in the presence of 6.8 m GdnHCl (dashed line) or 8 m urea (dotted line). Native sAPPα695 exhibited maximum emission at ∼337 nm, and significant red shifts were observed in the presence of both GdnHCl and urea, indicating increased exposure of the tryptophan residues of APP to the aqueous medium. The fluorescence emission spectra of native sAPPα770 and sAPPα770 in the presence of denaturants exhibited essentially the same behavior as observed for sAPPα695 (data not shown). The equilibrium unfolding of sAPPα by GdnHCl was monitored by the red shift in the fluorescence spectral center of mass (λav) in the presence of increasing concentrations of denaturant (Fig. 2B). Low concentrations of GdnHCl (<0.5 m) induced a small red shift (∼1–2 nm) of the emission, and an initial plateau was observed at ∼1 m GdnHCl. Higher GdnHCl concentrations (from ∼1.5 to 2.5 m) induced a further fluorescence red shift (∼3–4 nm), and a second plateau was observed at ∼3 m GdnHCl. A third transition occurred at GdnHCl concentrations higher than 5 m, but a final plateau corresponding to fully unfolded sAPP was not achieved up to 7 m GdnHCl. Complete unfolding of both sAPP isoforms was obtained upon incubation for 30 min at 100 °C in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Fig. 2B). It is important to note that full refolding of sAPP was obtained by running the protein through a desalting NAP-25 column in order to remove the denaturant (open symbols in Fig. 2B), indicating the complete reversibility of the (un)folding transition of both sAPP isoforms. The equilibrium unfolding of sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 by urea is shown in Fig. 2C. Interestingly, for both proteins unfolding by urea appeared to follow a two-state transition (albeit a highly noncooperative one) between the native and unfolded states, without significantly populated partially unfolded intermediates. Complete unfolding of sAPP could not be achieved even at 7.6 m urea, and full reversibility of the transition was also observed upon removal of urea from previously unfolded samples (Fig. 2C). Bis-ANS Binding Studies—The polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe, bis-ANS, was used in order to investigate the nature of the conformational intermediates stabilized in the presence of low concentrations of GdnHCl. Bis-ANS binds to exposed hydrophobic surfaces in partially folded intermediates with much higher affinity than to native or completely unfolded proteins (16York S.S. Lawson R.C. Worah D.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 9: 1038-1047Google Scholar, 17Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), resulting in a marked increase in fluorescence emission compared with the emission of free bis-ANS in aqueous solution. Interestingly, we found that bis-ANS binds to native sAPPα695 (Fig. 3A) and sAPPα770 (data not shown). The addition of 0.5 m GdnHCl led to an increase in fluorescence emission compared with the native protein, indicating additional exposure of hydrophobic domains. As expected, the addition of 5 m GdnHCl (a concentration that causes extensive unfolding of sAPP; Fig. 2B) completely abolished the binding of bis-ANS to sAPP. Fig. 3B shows the fluorescence emission of bis-ANS in the presence of both sAPPα isoforms and denaturants (GdnHCl or urea), normalized by the fluorescence emission of bis-ANS in the presence of native sAPPα. For both isoforms, there was an initial sharp increase in bis-ANS fluorescence emission up to ∼0.5 m GdnHCl. A gradual decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence emission was observed at higher GdnHCl concentrations. By contrast, a completely different pattern was observed when urea was used as a denaturant. In that case, no increase in bis-ANS binding was observed at low urea concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that urea did not stabilize partially folded intermediates of sAPPα exhibiting exposed hydrophobic regions. Higher urea concentrations also led to a decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence emission (Fig. 3A). Circular Dichroism Analysis—The secondary structures of sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 in the presence of denaturants were analyzed by circular dichroism. Fig. 4A shows CD spectra of native sAPPα695, in the presence of intermediate concentrations of denaturant (2.2 m GdnHCl or 2.9 m urea) or in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl or 7.6 m urea. At intermediate concentrations of denaturants, marked decreases in secondary structure of sAPPα were indicated by the decrease in ellipticity at both 208 and 222 nm, and the secondary structure content was almost completely lost in the presence of high concentrations of both denaturants. Circular dichroism spectra of sAPPα770 showed essentially the same behavior as observed for sAPPα695 (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows a plot of the molar residual ellipticity at 222 nm for both isoforms in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. For both isoforms, the secondary structures remained essentially unaffected up to 1 m GdnHCl. Between 1 and 3 m GdnHCl, there was a sharp loss in secondary structure content, and a plateau indicative of some residual secondary structure content was achieved at higher concentrations of GdnHCl. Fig. 4C shows that the secondary structures of both sAPP isoforms were preserved up to ∼1 m urea, with most changes in CD taking place between 2 and 4 m urea. CD data also indicated preservation of some residual secondary structure in both isoforms at high (7.6 m) urea concentrations. UV Absorption Spectroscopy—As an additional probe of the unfolding transitions of sAPPα, the near UV absorption spectra of sAPPα695 in the presence of different concentrations of denaturants were measured. In the presence of denaturants, the absorption of aromatic amino acid residues in proteins decreases, and characteristic difference peaks may be observed (13Tendian S.W. Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Chaiken I.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6464-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Levine R.L. Federici M.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The difference spectra of sAPPα695 obtained in the presence of GdnHCl and urea contained a principal peak at 286 nm and subsidiary peaks at 279 and 292–293 nm (Fig. 5, A and B). The main peak at 286 nm was used to monitor the unfolding of sAPPα695. The main transition occurs between 1 and 2 m GdnHCl or between 1.5 and 4.5 m urea, with a plateau reached at higher concentrations of denaturant (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained for the denaturation of sAPPα770 by GdnHCl (data not shown). Thus, the unfolding of sAPPα as monitored by near UV absorption spectroscopy roughly parallels the loss of secondary structure of the protein as revealed by CD (Fig. 4C). SAXS Measurements and Analysis—SAXS is a sensitive technique for analyzing the global shape and dimensions of macromolecules in solution. We have used high resolution synchrotron radiation SAXS measurements to analyze the unfolding transitions of both sAPP isoforms. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows the raw intensity curves of sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 for the whole range of q measured after subtraction of the buffer signal. Scattering curves for both isoforms in the presence of 0.25 m GdnHCl, 2.0 m GdnHCl, and 6.0 m urea were also acquired and treated in the same way. In Fig. 6 (C and D), the curves corresponding to the native protein (black symbols) are shown together with the curves corresponding to the samples containing denaturants in the q region up to 0.3 Å–1. For the latter curves, data obtained at higher q values were not employed, because the statistical errors became much larger than for the pure protein. All curves were fitted and extrapolated to zero angle using the GNOM program (14Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. Craievitch A. Torriani I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar) (continuous lines). From the zero angle scattering values, I(0), the molecular masses of sAPPα695 and sAPPα770 were calculated as 67 and 74 kDa, respectively, using albumin as a secondary standard. The ∼7-kDa difference in molecular mass agrees well with the fact that sAPPα770 contains 75 additional amino acids as compared with sAPPα695 (5Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Tokushima Y. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Nature. 1988; 331: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). For both isoforms, the scattering in 0.25 m GdnHCl (red symbols) is quite similar to that of the native protein. The slightly lower extrapolated I(0) (which is more noteworthy in the data for sAPPα695) may indicate a lower contrast between the protein and the solvent. In the presence of higher denaturant concentrations, the scattering curves of both sAPPα isoforms change considerably, indicating significant changes in particle shape and dimensions. For sAPPα695 in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl (green symbols), the scattering intensity begins at a lower I(0) value and crosses the native curve at ∼0.12 Å–1 (Fig. 6C). In the presence of 6 m urea (blue symbols), the scattering function is similar to that observed in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl, indicating similarities in the denaturation process. Scattering data of sAPPα695 in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl could not be interpreted because of the very high x-ray absorption by the buffer (data not shown). For the sAPPα770 isoform, the behavior of the intensity curves as a function of added denaturant is somewhat different (Fig. 6D). These curves also show different values of I(0) but do not exhibit marked differences in the intensity at higher q values. The radii of gyration (R g) for both sAPPα isoforms in their native states and in the presence of denaturants were calculated with the GNOM program (Table I). The R g of native sAPPα695 is slightly higher than the previously reported value (12Gralle M. Botelho M.M. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3513-3524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We consider this a more reliable value, due to the much higher resolution of the present data. In accordance with the expectations, the R g of native sAPPα770 is 4 Å larger than that of native sAPPα695, indicating a somewhat larger molecular dimension. The addition of up to 2 m GdnHCl caused hardly any change in R g for sAPPα695 and an increase of <2 Å in R g for sAPPα770. On the other hand, the addition of 6 m urea caused an increase in R g of 9.5 Å for sAPPα695 and 11.3 Å for sAPPα770.Table IRadii of gyration of sAPPα 695 and sAPPα 770SampleRgsAPPα695sAPPα770ÅNative sAPPα42.5 ± 0.346.5 ± 0.5sAPPα + 0.25 m GdnHCl43 ± 149.3 ± 0.6sAPPα + 2.0 m GdnHCl43 ± 448 ± 1sAPPα + 6.0 m urea52 ± 157.8 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The radius of gyration reflects the overall size of the protein particle, and, thus, many changes in the structure of a protein may not affect its radius of gyration (22Muroga Y. Macromolecules. 1992; 25: 3385-3391Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For a more sensitive analysis of the effects of chemical denaturants on the global compactness of sAPPα isoforms, we have analyzed the SAXS data in terms of the Kratky plot (23Kratky O. Porod G. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1949; 68: 1106-1122Crossref Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). For a system with compact shape and sharp phase boundaries, this plot shows a well defined curve with an initial upward portion followed by a descending curve (24Porod P. Kolloid-Z. 1951; 124: 83-114Crossref Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the curve for a polymer in an extended or random coil conformation shows a characteristic plateau and rises at higher angles (25Debye P. J. Phys. Colloid Chem. 1947; 51: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 26Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). Therefore, this plot has been shown to be quite useful to monitor the unfolding of proteins (e.g. see Refs. 27Kataoka M. Hagihara Y. Mihara K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 28Doniach S. Bascle J. Garel T. Orland H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the form of the Kratky plot depends more on the preservation of a compact core than on differences in secondary structure (29Semisotnov G.V. Kihara H. Kotova N.V. Kimura K. Amemiya Y. Wakabayashi K. Serdyuk I.N. Timchenko A.A. Chiba K. Nikaido K. Ikura T. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both native sAPPα isoforms showed well defined maxima at low q in the corresponding Kratky plots (Fig. 7, black symbols and lines), indicating that they are relatively compact particles. However, it is noteworthy that the scattering intensities do not fall as steeply at higher q as would be expected for a sharp phase boundary (i.e. a particle without loose parts) (see Refs. 27Kataoka M. Hagihara Y. Mihara K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 29Semisotnov G.V. Kihara H. Kotova N.V. Kimura K. Amemiya Y. Wakabayashi K. Serdyuk I.N. Timchenko A.A. Chiba K. Nikaido K. Ikura T. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting a certain extent of structural looseness of sAPPα even in the native state. This is in line with our recent report of the possible presence of >30% nonstandard secondary structure in native sAPPα695 (12Gralle M. Botelho M.M. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3513-3524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.25 m GdnHCl (red symbols), the maxima of the curves for both isoforms are shifted to higher q, but the curves still exhibit a clear descent at higher q values. By contrast, in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl (green symbols) or 6 m urea (blue symbols), the curves do not show any maxima but instead an initial plateau up to 0.09 Å–1. This type of plateau is typical of the intermediate q region for Gaussian coils (26Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). Furthermore, at higher q the curves do not descend but rather rise, as typically exhibited by elongated chains (26Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). Thus, the Kratky plots of the scattering data of sAPPα in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl or 6 m urea suggest that both isoforms are largely unfolded. The upward curvature in the Kratky plots in the high q range is more pronounced in the case of sAPPα695, indicating that it may adopt a random coil conformation approaching a state of complete denaturation. On the other hand, the smoother increase in the Kratky curves of sAPPα770 indicates that this isoform does not completely denature in the presence of the same concentrations of denaturants. Since the main differences in the scattering curves occur for q > 0.1 Å–1, which corresponds to molecular details on the order of ∼30 Å, our results indicate that for the sAPP770 isoform, structural features of that size are not completely denatured even with the loss of the general protein conformation. On the other hand, in the presence of 6 m urea, sAPPα770 exhibits a loss of structure similar to that of the other isoform, assuming a random coil conformation, indicated by the rising intensity in the Kratky plot. The amyloid precursor protein has been known for about 15 years, and its relevance to the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease is well established. However, relatively little is still known about the normal physiological roles and binding partners of APP, and even less is known about its structure. In order to provide insight into the roles and functional mechanisms of APP, a more detailed structural characterization of this protein is clearly needed. In this work, the folding and stability of sAPPα were investigated using different approaches and are related to recently elucidated structural features of the protein. The intrinsic fluores"
https://openalex.org/W2006209599,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in lipoprotein and adipocyte metabolism. Defects in LPL can lead to hypertriglyceridemia and the subsequent development of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of regulation of this enzyme are complex and may occur at multiple levels of gene expression. Because the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) is involved in LPL translational regulation, transgenic mice were generated with adipose tissue expression of an LPL construct either with or without the proximal 3'-UTR and driven by the aP2 promoter. Both transgenic mouse colonies were viable and expressed the transgene, resulting in a 2-fold increase in LPL activity in white adipose tissue. Neither mouse colony exhibited any obvious phenotype in terms of body weight, plasma lipids, glucose, and non-esterified fatty acid levels. In the mice expressing hLPL with an intact 3'-UTR, hLPL mRNA expression approximately paralleled hLPL activity. However in the mice without the proximal 3'-UTR, hLPL mRNA was low in the setting of large amounts of hLPL protein and LPL activity. In previous studies, the 3'-UTR of LPL was critical for the inhibitory effects of constitutively expressed hormones, such as thyroid hormone and catecholamines. Therefore, these data suggest that the absence of the 3'-UTR results in a translationally unrepressed LPL, resulting in a moderate overexpression of adipose LPL activity."

In search of a constitutive secretory pathway marker for pancreatic beta cells, we produced INS-1 cells stably expressing wild-type AAT. Because newly synthesized AAT arrives very rapidly in the Golgi complex, kinetics alone cannot resolve AAT release via distinct secretory pathways, although most AAT is secreted within a few hours and virtually none is stored in mature granules. Nevertheless, from pulse-chase analyses, a major fraction of newly synthesized AAT transiently exhibits secretogogue-stimulated exocytosis and localizes within immature secretory granules (ISGs). This trafficking occurs without detectable AAT polymerization or binding to lipid rafts. Remarkably, in a manner not requiring its glycans, all of the newly synthesized AAT is then removed from granules during their maturation, leading mostly to constitutive-like AAT secretion, whereas a smaller fraction (∼10%) goes on to lysosomes. Secretogogue-stimulated ISG exocytosis reroutes newly synthesized AAT directly into the medium and prevents its arrival in lysosomes.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). How luminal proteins (such as peptide hormones) come to be selected for storage in secretory granules potentially involves sorting events that occur both at the TGN and ISGs (2Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.-H. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin (the major peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic beta cells), studies have generally supported a model known as “sorting by retention” (3Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which suggests that polymeric assembly of the newly synthesized hormone (4Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol.

In addition, endoproteolytic release of a single chain insulin from a fusion protein precursor in the late Golgi of yeast (by Kex2 protease) has been shown to promote intracellular retention and prevent rapid secretion of the single-chain insulin (7Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells, the prohormone processing, secretory protein multimerization, and initiation of constitutive-like protein traffic tends to occur substantially within ISGs (8Arvan P.

Gerdes H.-H. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and thereby contribute to the distinctive compositions of constitutive secretory transport intermediates and ISGs (in addition to TGN-derived clathrincoated vesicles). The recent observation that some luminal proteins of the regulated secretory pathway may associate with cholesterol-enriched “lipid rafts” (14Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol.

The situation for soluble monomeric secretory proteins within the lumen of the TGN is currently less clear; are such molecules included or excluded from ISGs? Entry of many soluble proteins into ISGs might be expected in endocrine cells in which a large fraction of the luminal volume of the anterograde protein trafficking pathway is directed toward secretory granule biogenesis (17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, from studies of NIT-1 insulinoma cells, Rindler et al. (18Rindler M.J. Colomer V. Jin Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have argued that soluble secretory proteins are largely excluded from entry into beta cell ISGs. Further, Glombik and Gerdes (2Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.-H. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have pointed out that a key aspect of the sorting by retention model, namely, entrance of constitutive secretory “marker proteins” from the TGN into ISGs, is supported by little direct evidence. On the other hand, recent data indicate that a green fluorescent protein targeted to the secretory pathway only by a cleavable signal sequence (i.e. with no apparent sorting for entry signal) is able to abundantly enter insulin secretory granules (19Molinete M. Lilla V. Jain R. Joyce P.B.M. Gorr S.-U. Ravazzola M. Halban P.A. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and similar phenotypes have been observed for entry into ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) secretory granules (20Castle A.M. Huang A.Y. Castle J.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21El Meskini R. Jin L. Marx R. Bruzzaniti A. Lee J. Emeson R. Mains R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, these are but the latest in a series of observations of luminal proteins not expected to be sorted selectively for entry into ISGs that nevertheless do enter the regulated secretory pathway (for review, see Ref. 17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). For example, newly synthesized hydrolases en route to lysosomes enter ISGs in pancreatic beta cells (3Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Klumperman J. Kuliawat R. Griffith J.M. Geuze H.J. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the entry of such proteins into granules does not involve the specific lysosomal targeting signal (23Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Further, some of what had been thought to be constitutive secretion of lysosomal procathepsin B from beta cells has been demonstrated in fact to represent constitutive-like secretion via an endosomal intermediate (24Turner M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although the role of endosomes as intermediates in the release of bona fide secretory proteins is less well studied (25Millar C.A. Meerloo T. Martin S. Hickson G.R.X. Shimwell N.J. Wakelam M.J.O. James D.E. Gould G.W. Traffic. 2000; 1: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus far, in most endocrine cells, it has been difficult to identify a soluble secretory protein dedicated to the constitutive pathway, and we have been engaged in a considerable effort to try to find such a marker. In PC12 cells, Glombik et al. (27Glombik M.M. Krömer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.-H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that a sulfated α1-antitrypsin (AAT) (also known as α1-protease inhibitor (26Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar)) is not targeted to secretory granules and that granule storage of this protein is conferred only after appending specific structural information from the granule protein, chromogranin B, which indicates that AAT might be a useful constitutive secretory marker. These studies have prompted us to examine the fate of wild-type AAT expressed in the INS-1 pancreatic beta cell line. Indeed, in these cells, we now confirm the finding that AAT exhibits rapid unstimulated secretion and is entirely unstored in secretory granules. However, our evidence indicates that a major fraction of AAT actually enters ISGs and then proceeds to the endosome/lysosome system, implicating endosomes as an intermediate in the constitutive-like secretory pathway. Antibodies and Other Materials—A rabbit polyclonal anti-human AAT was from Roche Applied Science, and a goat polyclonal anti-human AAT was from ICN/Cappel (Costa Mesa CA). Guinea pig polyclonal anti-insulin was from Linco Research (St. Charles, MO). Rabbit polyclonal anti-procathepsin B was from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cab45 was the kind gift of Dr. P. Scherer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Secondary antibodies and peroxidase conjugates were from Jackson ImmunLaboratories (West Grove, PA). [35S]Methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S) was from New England Nuclear (New Bedford, MA). Methionine/cysteine-deficient and complete RPMI, tunicamycin, brefeldin A, leupeptin, pepstatin, and stock chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 30 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, 50 μm beta-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 as described (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The INS-832/13 subclone of INS-1 cells (29Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. C. Newgard (Duke University, Durham, NC) and was grown in the same medium. Transfection—The wild-type human AAT cDNA (obtained from Dr. R. Sifers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) in which expression is under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmid DNA was transfected into INS-1 cells with the Effectene Transfection Reagent Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were selected with 150 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) beginning at 48 h after transfection. Individual drug-resistant cell clones obtained by serial dilution were picked manually and maintained in the presence of 100 μg/ml G418. In INS-832/13 cells the plasmid was transiently transfected, and the entire cell pool was used for studies at 48 h after transfection (Fig. 4B). Metabolic Labeling—INS-AAT cells or INS-832/13 cells were cultured in the absence of G418 for at least 2 days before experiments. Cells were preincubated for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 and then pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for either 15 or 30 min in the same medium. After pulse labeling, the cells were washed three times with PBS before being chased for various times in complete growth medium (for INS-832/13 cells the unstimulated chase medium contained only 2 mm glucose). In other experiments, INS cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys in complete growth medium for extended periods to approach steady-state labeling conditions. Where indicated, brefeldin A (BFA) was included during labeling and chase at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Tunicamycin (20 μg/ml), when employed, was added at 1 h before and during the pulse labeling but was not present not during chase incubations. Where indicated, pepstatin (100 μm) and leupeptin (200 μm) were included in the preincubation and pulse labeling periods. Stimulation of Granule Exocytosis—Secretory granule exocytosis was stimulated for the indicated times in complete growth medium containing a combination secretogogue including 10 mm glucose, 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm tolbutamide, 10 mm leucine, and 10 mm glutamine (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of selected chase periods, media were collected and the cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (24Turner M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For INS-832/13 cells, the secretogogue employed was complete chase medium containing a final glucose concentration of 15 mm. Immunoelectron Microscopy—We employed the method of Orci et al. (30Orci L. Ravazzola M. Storch M.J. Anderson R.G.W. Vassalli J.D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1987; 49: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), using INS-AAT cells fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer dehydrated through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations, with a progressive lowering of the temperature to –50 °C, embedded in Lowicryl HM-20 monostep resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and polymerized using UV light. Ultra-thin sections were mounted on nickel grids and then immunolabeled as follows. Sections were floated on blocking solution (Aurion) incubated overnight at 4 °C with the proinsulin cleavage site antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody GSA8 diluted 1:1000, kindly provided by Dr. O. Madsen, Hagedorn Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) along with the rabbit polyclonal anti-human AAT diluted 1:100 in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA-c, Aurion). Sections were rinsed in PBS with bovine serum albumin and incubated with 6 nm goat anti-rabbit gold and 15 nm goat anti-mouse gold for 3 h at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed and postfixed with 2% gluteraldehyde in PBS. The immunolabeled sections were examined, and images were captured at a magnification of 40,000× in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV, performed in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Analytical Imaging Facility. Cell Fractionation—We employed the method of Rindler et al. (18Rindler M.J. Colomer V. Jin Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with certain modifications. Specifically, INS-AAT cells were pulse-labeled and chased for various times. For each sample, the cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and then scraped gently from the plate followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 4 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, plus a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were then passed 10 times (up-and-down) through a 25-gauge needle followed by 10 passes (back-and-forth) through a ball-bearing homogenizer with 40-μm clearance. After removal of nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 4 min, the post-nuclear supernatant was collected and a 400-μl aliquot of was loaded atop a 2-ml discontinuous sucrose gradient (sucrose layers from the bottom: 1.8 m (0.2 ml), 1.6 m (0.2 ml), 1.4 m (0.3 ml), 1.2 m (0.3 ml), 1.1 m (0.3 ml), 0.8 m (0.3 ml)). After centrifugation in a Sorvall RP55-S swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor at 200,000 × g av for 2 h, 10 200-μl fractions were collected from the top for analysis by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates and chase media were routinely treated with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). These samples were precleared with Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation. Zysorbin-bound immunocomplexes were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 4 min, and pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and once in high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Endo H or PNGase F Digestion—After immunoprecipitation, AAT bound to Zysorbin was eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 4 min. The supernates were diluted to 0.4% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and digested with Endo H or PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as per protocol provided by the manufacturer. AAT Solubility Assay—The permeabilization and protein extraction protocol was adapted from Chanat and Huttner (31Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Briefly, AAT-expressing INS-1 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for 1 h. Cells were then scraped from the dish in ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and homogenized by eight passages (up-and-down) through a 25-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Membranes in the postnuclear supernatant were then pelleted at 23,000 × g for 30 min and then washed once with 1 ml of PBS and repelleted. The washed pellet containing membrane-enclosed AAT was then resuspended in 500 μl of aggregative milieu (10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.4, and 10 mm CaCl2 plus 1.2 mm leupeptin) or nonaggregative milieu (10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 30 mm KCl plus 1.2 mm leupeptin) with or without saponin (1 mg/ml) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The membrane extract was finally subjected to centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min, and both supernatant and pellet fractions were collected for quantitative immunoprecipitation of AAT and Cab45. Raft Assay—Fractionation of Triton X-100 insoluble rafts was performed by standard procedure (32Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar, 33Martin-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for 1 h were rinsed twice with PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice in 1.4 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was scraped from the dish, passed 10 times (up-and-down) through a 22-guage needle, and then mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in the same buffer without Triton X-100. A Triton X-100 extract of unlabeled HEK293 cells containing caveolin-1 was prepared in the same way. Four parts of the labeled extract from INS-1 cells was mixed with one part unlabeled 293 cell extract; this mixed heavy sucrose layer was placed at the bottom of polycarbonate micro-ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid with 30% sucrose and 5% sucrose layers. Gradients were placed in a Sorvall RP55S rotor and spun at 167,000 × g at 4 °C for 18 h. Six 350-μl gradient fractions, collected manually from the top, were processed for immunoprecipitation of AAT and immunoblotting of caveolin-1. Western Blotting—100 μg of total cell lysate protein or immunoprecipitated protein samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (semi-dry transfer, 150 mA for 1 h). The membrane was then blotted with the primary antibody against AAT or caveolin-1 at 1:1000 dilution and a secondary IgG-peroxidase conjugate at 1:1000 dilution followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Rapid Intracellular Transit of AAT through the Secretory Pathway of INS Pancreatic Beta Cells—INS-1 pancreatic beta cells were transfected to express the cDNA encoding wild-type human AAT. Multiple clonal isolates selected for G418 resistance were screened for secretion of the 56-kDa AAT, and a variety of positively expressing and non-expressing clones were obtained (Fig. 1). Most subsequent experiments were performed with clone #3 (referred to hereinafter as “INS-AAT” cells), but most of the results presented herein were confirmed with at least two additional independent clones. In preliminary experiments employing a 45-min [35S]Met/Cys pulse labeling of INS-AAT cells without chase (not shown), a labeled 56-kDa intracellular AAT glycoprotein was predominant. A band of identical mobility was also recovered in the subsequent secretion, suggesting that much of the ER export and well established Golgi carbohydrate processing reactions might have already taken place at the zero chase time for molecules made during such a long pulse period (34Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J.A.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To establish this point, when INS-AAT cells were pretreated and cotreated with BFA during pulse labeling to block ER exit, a faster migrating newly synthesized AATER band was clearly apparent (Fig. 2A, first lane). If BFA was present only during a 1-h chase, some labeled AAT molecules acquired the higher gel mobility (Fig. 2A, second lane), and when BFA was omitted entirely, the ER molecules were no longer apparent (Fig. 2A, third lane). Without BFA, the mature form of AAT, both intracellularly and in the medium, was PNGase F-sensitive (cleaved to a band migrating at the predicted molecular mass of 44.5 kDa, Fig. 2B, lanes marked “P”) and Endo H-resistant (lanes marked “E”), establishing that this form had undergone Golgi carbohydrate modifications. (A proteolytic fragment of AAT was also observed in cells at 2 h of chase, which is described further below.) The foregoing and additional data (see below) indicate that AAT rapidly exits the ER in INS-AAT cells. Because ER exit is a rate-limiting step in overall intracellular transport (35Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined unstimulated secretion of newly synthesized AAT in two sequential blocks of time up to 8 h. A large majority of AATmature was released during the first 4 h under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 3, left panel) so that there was relatively little intracellular AATmature remaining at 4 h of chase. Consequently, during the next period from 4–8 h of chase, only a small fraction of labeled AATmature could be released under any conditions (Fig. 3, left panel) despite the fact that stored intracellular insulin could be significantly depleted from the cells under stimulation conditions (Fig. 3, right panel). Together, the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate rapid intracellular transit and unstimulated secretion of AAT from INS-1 pancreatic beta cells, with little or no intracellular storage of the protein in mature secretory granules, such as occurs for insulin. Mass Entry of Newly Synthesized AAT into Beta Secretory Granules—Because so much newly synthesized AATmature is released into the unstimulated secretion during the first 4-h period, and because so little intracellular AATmature remains to be released into the medium during the second 4-h period, the addition of secretogogue during neither of these 4-h chase intervals showed a major effect on AATmature secretion (Fig. 3), despite the fact that a 4-h incubation with the secretogogue stimulates exocytosis of ∼50% of labeled secretory granules from these cells (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, AATmature behaves as one would expect if AATmature were a constitutive secretory marker protein. However, a modest stimulation of AATmature secretion upon addition of secretogogue could in fact be observed during both of these 4-h chase periods (Fig. 3), raising the question of whether newly synthesized AATmature might significantly enter ISGs but nevertheless fail to be stored within mature granules (17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To test this point, we attempted to examine more closely the maturation and stimulus-dependent secretion of AAT during the first 60 min after a 15-min pulse labeling (Fig. 4A). At the zero chase time, almost all of the intracellular AAT was the faster migrating ER form (Fig. 4A, lower panel), and there was no AAT secreted (upper panel). At 15 min of chase, less than half of the AAT molecules had acquired Golgi sugars (Fig. 4A, lower panel), and secretion was still barely detectable (upper panel). By 30 min of chase in the absence of stimulation, >50% of the molecules had reached the Golgi complex (suggesting a half-time out of the ER of ∼20 min), a small fraction of AATmature was now detected in the unstimulated secretion, and stimulus-dependent secretion of newly synthesized AAT (stimulated minus unstimulated expressed as percent of total) was 10.1 ± 2.1% (n = 3), which is very similar to insulin stimulus-dependent secretion (of ∼10%) over the same time (30 min) period (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2L. Feng and P. Arvan, unpublished data. Finally by 60 min of chase, all AAT had exited the ER (Fig. 4A, lower panel), a significant fraction was released even in the absence of stimulation, and stimulus-dependent secretion of AAT (upper panel) was 19.1 ± 2.6% (n = 6), which can be compared with a 60-min stimulus-dependent secretion of insulin of 20% of the granule pool (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 From these data we calculate that ≥90% of newly synthesized AAT enters the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway, despite that AATmature is not stored but instead is routed into relatively rapid unstimulated secretion, features that define the constitutive-like secretory pathway (17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The standard stimulation of INS-1 cells involves use of a combination of secretogogues (28Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that may activate multiple signal transduction pathways. This is done because the amount of secretory granule discharge in response to increased glucose alone (a physiological stimulus of granule exocytosis) is far less in INS-1 cells than we have observed in isolated pancreatic islets (8Arvan P. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Zavacki A.M. Elahi D. Wang S. Pilkey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14171-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, subclones of INS-1 cells have been isolated that exhibit more robust exocytosis of insulin secretory granules in response to high glucose alone. We therefore obtained one such subclone, called INS-832/13 (29Hohmeier H."
https://openalex.org/W2055562280,"We have cloned and characterized a human cDNA, designated N4WBP5A, that belongs to the family of Nedd4-binding proteins. We originally identified N4WBP5A as an unknown expressed sequence tag (AA770150) represented in a cDNA microarray analysis that was up-regulated upon activation of T cells and inhibited by cell treatment with the calcineurin phosphatase inhibitors, cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506). The predicted N4WBP5A amino acid sequence of 242 amino acid residues reveals an open reading frame of 729 nucleotides with a corresponding molecular mass of 27.1 kDa. Detection of N4WBP5A mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR was consistent with the induction of N4WBP5A following mitogenic stimulation of T lymphocytes and inhibition by CsA. Immunoblot analysis revealed endogenous N4WBP5A protein to be up-regulated following T cell activation and inhibited by CsA. This regulation of N4WBP5A mRNA expression differed from that of its homologue (51% identical; 65% similar) N4WBP5. Like N4WBP5, however, expression of epitope-tagged N4WBP5A indicated that the protein is localized predominantly to the Golgi network. Here we show by co-precipitation experiments that N4WBP5A interacts with the WW domains of Nedd4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Taken together, our data suggest that N4WBP5A may play a regulatory role in modulating Nedd4 activity at the level of the Golgi apparatus in T lymphocytes.

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins that involves the covalent binding of a 76-amino acid polypeptide, ubiquitin, to a target protein (1Ben-Neriah Y. Nat.

The ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, is responsible for ATP-dependent ubiquitin activation. Once activated, ubiquitin is transferred to the downstream carrier protein, E2, and then to the isopeptide ligase, E3, that mediates the transfer to a substrate protein (3Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2000; 34: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is involved in the down-regulation of membrane receptors, transporters, and channels as well as in cell cycle control (4Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr.

Within the immune system, ubiquitination is involved in transcriptional and translational activation, protein kinase activation, and apoptosis (1Ben-Neriah Y. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although the enzymes involved in ubiquitination have been extensively studied, the factors and signals that regulate their activities remain less well understood. Resolving this regulation is important given the evidence that irregular ubiquitination can give rise to cellular dysregulation (5Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T.

To identify regulatory signals that may control ubiquitination, the enzyme-substrate recognition step, mediated by E3, has received more attention in recent years. A growing family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, termed Nedd4, share an N-terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid protein binding (C2/CaLB) domain (8Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), two to four WW protein-protein interaction domains (9Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal Hect (homology to E6-associated protein at the carboxyl terminus) domain. Although the C2/CaLB domain is responsible for membrane localization in response to calcium signals, the conserved Hect domain represents the catalytic region responsible for ubiquitin ligase activity. Nedd4, initially identified to be developmentally down-regulated in neuronal precursor cells (10Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), targets downstream substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Nedd4 is evolutionarily well conserved: orthologues in yeast, mouse, rat, and humans have been identified (11Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At present, the best characterized Nedd4 target is the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (12Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 13Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

Deletion of the WW-binding domains of ENaC leads to hyperactivation of the channel, a characteristic of patients with Liddle's syndrome. The Nedd4 WW domains are small regions comprising 38–40 conserved amino acid residues that mediate protein-protein interactions (15Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem.

Using mouse embryonic cDNA expression libraries, Jolliffe and coworkers (18Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochemical J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) identified eight PY motif-containing murine proteins capable of binding Nedd4 in vitro. One of the identified proteins, N4WBP5, was later shown to be Golgi-localized and capable of binding Nedd4 via an interaction of the PY motifs (of N4WBP5) with the Nedd4 WW domains (19Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We here report the cloning and characterization of N4WBP5A, a cDNA encoding a novel member of the growing family of Nedd4-binding proteins, isolated from activated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. The 729 nucleotide open reading frame predicts a 242-amino acid protein of molecular mass 27.1 kDa. We initially identified N4WBP5A as an unknown EST (AA770150) represented in a cDNA microarray analysis that was up-regulated upon activation of T cells and inhibited by the immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) (20Cristillo A.D. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4465-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We report N4WBP5A to be widely expressed in such tissues as brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta but not in resting human T lymphocytes. RT-PCR analysis showed N4WBP5A mRNA to be expressed in activated but not resting T cells. Induction of both N4WBP5A mRNA and protein was found to be sensitive to inhibition by CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin, and hence, regulated by calcineurin. N4WBP5A was found to localize predominantly to the Golgi network and to interact with Nedd4 via binding to the Nedd4 WW-1, WW-2, and WW-3 domains. While the manuscript for this report was in review, the same protein was reported to have been cloned from epithelial sources and found to bind Nedd4 (21Konstas A.A. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A.B.

Our findings reveal that the novel member of the Nedd4 WW domain-binding protein family is induced in activated T cells; a role for Nedd4 and its binding partners, and for Nedd4-dependent ubiquitination pathways in human T lymphocytes has not been previously appreciated. Cells and Stimulations—Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were obtained from healthy human donors, isolated by apheresis followed by reverse flow elutriation and by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque, and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBL were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MediaTech), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), termed 10% cRPMI1640, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air. After overnight incubation, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem), soluble (100 ng/ml) anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), and/or 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 (the kind gift of Carl June, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) as indicated. Cells were pre-treated for 30 min, where indicated, with 1 μm cyclosporine A (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland), 100 nm tacrolimus (FK506, Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA), or 100 nm sirolimus (rapamycin, Calbiochem). COS-7 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Nedd4 WW1-, WW2-, WW3-, and HECT-GST-agarose were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B (glutathione-Sepharose beads) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Sequence Retrieval and Analysis—A GenBank™ nucleotide search (BLASTn) of the non-redundant data base (GenBank™ /EMBL/DDBJ/PDB) of sequences using the EST (AA770150) revealed a cDNA sequence encoding an unknown protein (KIAA1165) containing the EST of interest. A GenBank™ protein search (TBLASTN) of the non-redundant data base using the predicted amino acid residues identified a homologous protein (N4WBP5). Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using ClustalW 1.8 (Baylor College of Medicine, Human Genome Sequence Center). The exon/intron composition of N4WBP5A was determined (Gene Finder software, Sanger Institute, UK). Putative transcription factor binding sites within the promoter of N4WBP5A were identified using TRANSFAC, TFD, and IMD databases (BioInformatics & Molecular Analysis Section, National Institutes of Health (22Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar)). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of N4WBP5A was performed with an integrated search of PROSITE, Pfam, and PRINTS domain databases (European Bioinformatics Institute (23Apweiler R. Biswas M. Fleischmann W. Kanapin A. Karavidopoulou Y. Kersey P. Kriventseva E.V. Mittard V. Mulder N. Phan I. Zdobnov E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). Isolation of N4WBP5A—Human PBLs were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA for 4 h. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen) and quantitated using A 260. Poly(A) RNA (mRNA) was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according the manufacturer's protocol and quantitated using the RiboGreen™ RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A reverse transcription reaction was carried out using 50 ng of sample mRNA and an oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). N4WBP5A cDNA was isolated from the resulting cDNA by PCR using PfuTurbo® polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers: N4WBP5A-F, 5′-ACG CGT CGA CGC GAG AAG ACT CCC TCT CTC-3′; N4WBP5A-R, 5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CAA AAA CCA CCC TGC CAT TCA ATT T-3′. PCR was performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 45 s; 30 cycles of (i) 94 °C for 45 s, (ii) 72 °C for 45 s, and (iii) 72 °C for 2 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting N4WBP5A cDNA PCR product (934 nucleotides) was subcloned using SalI/NotI restriction enzymes into the corresponding multiple cloning site of pCMV-HA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). N4WBP5A was then subcloned from HA-N4WBP5A using SalI/SacII restriction enzymes into the corresponding multiple cloning site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech), hereinafter termed GFP-N4WBP5A. N4WBP5A was PCR-amplified from HA-N4WBP5A using the following primers: N4WBP5AF, 5′-GAA GAT CTA CCA TGG ATC ACC ACC AGC CGG GG-3′; N4WBP5AR, 5′-GCT CTA GAA TGT CGG GTT GAT GCA GTC TCT AC-3′. N4WBP5A was subsequently subcloned using BglII/XbaI restriction enzymes into the corresponding multiple cloning site of pCDNA3 backbone to which RFP was fused, hereinafter termed RFP-N4WBP5A. pRc-CMV-Nedd4 was a generous gift from Daniela Rotin (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Nedd4 cDNA was PCR-amplified from pRc-CMV-Nedd4 using the following primers: Nedd4-F, 5′-GAA GAT CTA CCA TGG CAG CCG ACG ACA CTG AG-3′; Nedd4-R, 5′-CGG AAT TCT CAA TCA ACC CCA TCA AAG CCC TG-3′. Nedd4 was then subcloned using BglII/EcoRI restriction enzymes into the corresponding multiple cloning site of pEGFP-C1, hereinafter termed GFP-Nedd4. Northern Blot Analysis—The N4WBP5A cloned PCR product (934 nucleotides) and an actin control cDNA (Clontech) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) using the random primer labeling procedure (Strip-EZ DNA, Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled N4WBP5A probe was hybridized to a mutliple tissue Northern (MTN®) blot. Bands were then visualized by phosphorimaging analysis (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuaNT software. Membranes were stripped of probe and rehybridized using the control actin probe. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from human PBLs using TRIzol™ and quantitated using A 260 and the RiboGreen™ RNA quantitation kit. mRNA levels were assayed using the Onestep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the following oligonucleotide purification cartridge-purified primers (BioServe Biotechnologies, Laurel, MD): N4WBP5A-F, 5′-TCA GCA CCA GCA CTT GAA AC-3′; N4WBP5A-R, 5′-CCG CAG ATA GCA CCA TAC TC-3′; N4WBP5-F, 5′-GCC ATG GCG TTG GCG TTG-3′; N4WBP5-R, 5′-CTC CCA GGA ACC AAA GGG ATA-3′; β-actin-F, 5′-ATC TGG CAC CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG CG-3′; and β-actin-R, 5′-CGT CAT ACT CCT GCT TGC TGA TCC ACA TCT GC-3′. RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 15 min; 30 cycles of (i) 94 °C for 1 min, (ii) 55 °C for 1 min, and (iii) 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and bands were revealed by staining gels with ethidium bromide. Bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using ImageQuaNT software, and mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels as indicated. Antibody Production—Two rabbits were inoculated with 0.5 mg of a KLH-conjugated peptide (QEEECPPRDDFSDADQ, Covance Immunological Service, Denver, PA) specific for N4WBP5A. Rabbits were boosted four times with peptide, 3 weeks apart, using 0.25 mg/boost in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. Sera were collected and tested against the antigenic peptide using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Collected sera showing the most robust and specific reactivity for antigenic peptide (clone 1442) were subsequently used for Western blot protein analysis. Precipitations and Characterization of Nedd4 Association—GFP-N4WBP5A or pEGFP-C3 (termed GFP) were transiently transfected into COS-7 and HeLa cells using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transient transfection, cells rested for 24 h at 37 °C prior to harvesting by centrifugation at 466 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with cold DMEM (without additives), and 107 cells were resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/100 μl in DMEM prior to centrifugation at 3,220 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. Cell pellets were lysed using 1 ml of buffer A (10% Brij97 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m EDTA, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 m sodium orthovanadate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)). Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of Nedd4 WW1-, WW-2, WW3-, HECT-GST, or GST alone for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (30 μl) were added to samples and incubated for one additional hour at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 3,220 × g at 4 °C and washed three times in buffer B (10% Brij97, 5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 m Na3VO4). Samples were resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Protogel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), immunoblotted with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cell supernatants were incubated with a rabbit anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech) for 2 h at 4 °C, after which protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, San Jose, CA) was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in buffer B, resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and were transferred to PVDF membranes. Precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with a mouse anti-Nedd4 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, Palo Alto, CA). Immunoblotting of N4WBP5A—After stimulation of human PBLs, samples were centrifuged at 466 × g for 5 min and washed once with RPMI 1640. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 17,530 × g. The post-nuclear lysates were removed, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-human N4WBP5A antisera (clone 1442), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells (5 × 104 cells/coverslip) were plated on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with GFP-N4WBP5A or a control GFP construct. Following transfection (24 h) cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times using 1× PBS and incubated with 0.05 m NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed three times using 1× PBS and incubated with 5 ml of 0.01% TritonX-100 in PBS for 2.5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times using 0.2% gelatin in PBS and incubated with anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories) in antibody dilution solution (1× PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide) at room temperature for 30 min to stain cells for the Golgi complex. Alternatively, the nucleus was detected using either Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich), endoplasmic reticulum detected using ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX dye (Molecular Probes) and mitochondria detected using MitoTracker Red-CMXRos dye (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were washed three times with 0.2% gelatin PBS, three times with 1× PBS, mounted onto glass slides (using a Prolong Antifade kit, Molecular Probes), and visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM510; a 100×/1.3 numerical aperture oil lens was used for all samples except for nuclear staining: 63×/1.2 water lens). Endogenous N4WBP5A was detected in COS-7 cells and human PBLs by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy using anti-peptide antisera (clone 1442) followed by either fluorescein- or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). For N4WBP5A and Nedd4 co-localization studies, 293T cells were co-transfected with RFP-N4WBP5A and GFP-Nedd4 constructs using the CalPhos mammalian transfection protocol as outlined above. Expression of these targets was visualized using confocal microscopy as previously outlined. Endogenous N4WBP5A was detected in 293T cells using anti-peptide antisera (clone 1442) and a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Endogenous Nedd4 was detected in 293T cells using a mouse anti-Nedd4 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) and a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). N4WBP5A: a Novel Nedd4 WW Domain-binding Protein Family Member—We originally identified N4WBP5A as an unknown EST represented in a cDNA microarray analysis that was induced following T cell activation and inhibited by the immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) (20Cristillo A.D. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4465-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A GenBank™ nucleotide search (BLASTn) using this EST (AA770150) of the non-redundant data base (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ/PDB) of sequences revealed a cDNA sequence containing the EST of interest, encoding a protein of no known function (KIAA1165). A GenBank™ protein search (TBLASTN) of the non-redundant data base using the predicted amino acid residues identified a homologous protein named Nedd4 WW domain-binding protein 5 (N4WBP5), previously shown to bind the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4 (19Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid residues of KIAA1165 (herein after named N4WBP5A) with N4WBP5 revealed that the sequences were 51% identical and 65% similar (Fig. 1A). N4WBP5A was previously identified as part of a TBLASTN search of GenBank™ using N4WBP5 (19Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast to N4WBP5, which maps to human chromosome 5q31.3, the N4WBP5A genomic sequence maps to human chromosome 13q22.2 with a predicted exon/intron composition comprised of 7 exons and 6 introns (Gene Finder software, Sanger Institute, UK) (Fig. 1B , upper). N4WBP5A orthologues exist in Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, and Xenopus laevis. A GenBank™ (TBLASTN) and HomoloGene search of N4WBP5A and N4WBP5 sequences revealed the existence of several human cDNA clones from different tissues that show homology to both proteins. Some of the cDNA clones encode proteins that appear to be truncated forms of N4WBP5A and N4WBP5. Although it is formally possible that N4WBP5A and N4WBP5 are members of a larger family of Nedd4-binding proteins, a more likely possibility is that these cDNA clones represent partial cDNA clones of either N4WBP5A or N4WBP5. Putative transcription factor binding sites within the promoter of N4WBP5A (TRANSFAC (22Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar)) include several calcineurin targets such as NFAT-1 and Elk-1 (Fig. 1B , lower), whose known inhibition by the calcineurin inhibitors CsA and FK506 may help to explain the transcriptional control of N4WBP5A by these immunosuppressive agents. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of N4WBP5A with an integrated search of PROSITE, Pfam, and PRINTS domain databases (23Apweiler R. Biswas M. Fleischmann W. Kanapin A. Karavidopoulou Y. Kersey P. Kriventseva E.V. Mittard V. Mulder N. Phan I. Zdobnov E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) revealed three putative transmembrane segments, two putative proline-rich WW binding domain regions, and several predicted SH2 and SH3 binding sites (Fig. 1C). Together our findings suggest the identification of a Nedd4 WW domain-binding protein. Wide Tissue Distribution of N4WBP5A—Using RT-PCR, we cloned N4WBP5A (934 nucleotides) from human PBLs stimulated for 4 h with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA. The sequence of this PCR product, containing the 729-nucleotide open reading frame, was verified (BioServe Biotechnologies, Laurel, MD) to be identical to that published in GenBank™ (accession XM_041162). A random labeled ([α-32P]dCTP) probe for N4WBP5A (see “Materials and Methods”) was used to screen a multiple tissue Northern blot. While a single 4.4-kb transcript was expressed in the brain and lung, two transcripts (4.4 and 2.4 kb) were detected in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a multiple tissue expression array confirmed the presence of N4WBP5A in the tissues mentioned above (data not shown). N4WBP5A was not detected, however, in peripheral blood for reasons that will be discussed and explored below. N4WBP5A Localization to Golgi Complex—We subcloned the N4WBP5A cDNA, isolated from activated human PBL, into the green fluorescent protein-tagged construct, pEGFP-C3 (see “Materials and Methods”). To gain insight into the localization of N4WBP5A, HeLa and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either the GFP-N4WBP5A or control construct. Overexpression of the construct encoding GFP demonstrated diffuse localization, including the nucleus but excluding nucleoli. In contrast, GFP-N4WBP5A was localized in non-random distinct regions within both HeLa (Fig. 3A) and COS-7 (Fig. 3B) cells. In addition to the apparent subcellular localization of N4WBP5A, a punctate pattern of GFP-N4WBP5A localization within both cell types was noted. To identify the subcellular compartment localized by N4WBP5A, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-N4WBP5A or control construct were stained with the Golgi complex marker, GM130, or the nuclear dye, Hoechst; cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The GFP-N4WBP5A localized to a subcellular compartment that overlapped with that of the Golgi complex (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GFP-N4WBP5A subcellular localization did not overlap with the nucleus (Fig. 4B). To rule out the possibility that the su"

The protein folding cycle requires the simultaneous positive intra-ring and negative inter-ring cooperativities of ATP binding. This ensures GroES binding to one ring and release of the ligands from the opposite one. To better characterize inter-ring allosterism, the thermal stability as well as the temperature dependence of the functional and conformational properties of wild type GroEL, a single ring mutant (SR1) and two single point mutants suppressing one interring salt bridge (E434K and E461K) were studied. The results indicate that ionic interactions at the two interring contact sites are essential to maintain the negative cooperativity for protein substrate binding and to set the protein thermostat at 39 °C. These electrostatic interactions contribute distinctly to the stability of the inter-ring interface and the overall protein stability, e.g. the E434K thermal inactivation curve is shifted to lower temperatures, and its unfolding temperature and activation energy are also lowered. An analysis of the ionic interactions at the inter-ring contact sites reveals that at the so called “left site” a network of electrostatic interactions involving three charged residues might be established, in contrast to what is found at the “right site” where only two oppositely charged residues interact. Our data suggest that electrostatic interactions stabilize protein-protein interfaces depending on both the number of ionic interactions and the number of residues engaged in each of these interactions. In the case of GroEL, this combination sets the thermostat of the protein so that the chaperonin distinguishes physiological from stress temperatures.

An analysis of the ionic interactions at the inter-ring contact sites reveals that at the so called “left site” a network of electrostatic interactions involving three charged residues might be established, in contrast to what is found at the “right site” where only two oppositely charged residues interact. Our data suggest that electrostatic interactions stabilize protein-protein interfaces depending on both the number of ionic interactions and the number of residues engaged in each of these interactions. In the case of GroEL, this combination sets the thermostat of the protein so that the chaperonin distinguishes physiological from stress temperatures. Molecular chaperones are required for the proper folding, transport, and degradation of many proteins in vivo. Among them, the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL is one of the best characterized both structurally and mechanistically. It consists of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits arranged in two heptameric rings stacked back to back (1Braig K. Otwinoswki Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Different allosteric routes ensure the correct communication between subunits of the same ring and of opposite rings (3Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 4Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The positive cooperative binding of ATP to one protein ring promotes GroES binding to that ring, converting it from a polypeptide accepting state to a folding-active state. Negative cooperativity in ATP binding results in an asymmetric particle with the two rings adopting different conformations. Essential for the protein folding activity of GroEL is the fact that ATP binding allosterically discharges the ligands from the opposite ring. Therefore, interring allosterism is essential to cycle the protein rings between protein accepting and releasing states (5Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).The equatorial domain of each subunit in the homotetradecameric structure contacts the same domain of two neighboring subunits in the opposite ring. Although the allosteric movements are not known in detail, it seems likely that displacement of the equatorial domain of protein subunits in opposite rings couples ATP binding to the trans-ring with GroES release from the cis-ring. The contact surface between the two rings is composed of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (1Braig K. Otwinoswki Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 6Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). This surface is formed by two different contact sites, the so-called “right site,” which includes the salt bridge Glu461–Arg452, and the “left site,” where the ion pair Glu434–Lys105 is located. In a previous work it was shown that inter-ring salt bridges form a stabilizing ring-shaped ionic zipper that ensures inter-ring communication and regulates the thermostat of GroEL, allowing the chaperone to distinguish physiological from stress temperatures (7Sot B. Galán A. Valpuesta J.M. Bertrand S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34024-34029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work is to characterize the contribution of each of these ionic interactions to the functionality and stability of the protein. To this end, we have used biophysical (infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry), and biochemical methods to show that the ionic interactions at the left contact site contribute to a greater extent to the stability of the inter-ring interface than those at the right site. A structural basis for this different contribution is put forward.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—GroEL mutants were produced by the homologous recombination technique (8Martin A.

The single ring (SR1), and the single point, double ring (E461K and E434K) mutants were purified applying the same procedure used with wild type (wt) 1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; CS, citrate synthase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; T m, temperature corresponding to the maximum of the heat capacity change; T½, temperature corresponding to the loss of 50% of the ATPase activity; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; SR1, single ring mutant. GroEL. The endogenous bound substrate proteins were removed by chromatography on Reactive Red 120-agarose (Sigma) as described (12Clark A.C. Ramanathan R. Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 100-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).ATP Hydrolysis—ATPase activity was assayed using a spectrophotometric method that includes an ATP regenerating system (13Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 15 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, pH 7.5. The mixture was incubated at a given temperature for 10 min, and then ATP (final concentration 2 mm) was added and incubated for 2 min. Finally, wt GroEL, E461K, or E434K (50 nm, oligomer concentration) was added. The decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 10 min in a thermostatted Cary 3 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined from the slope of the absorbance versus time plot, considering the extinction coefficient of NADH. The effect of GroES on ATPase activity was measured in samples containing wt GroEL, E461K, or E434K (2:1 oligomer ratio).Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH) Refolding—(14Miller A.D. Maghlaoui K. Albanese G. Kleingan D.A. Smith C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial MDH (from porcine heart, Sigma) was denatured in 6 m urea at 37 °C for 30 min and diluted 30-fold in a medium containing the desired chaperonin species that had been incubated previously at a specific temperature. The substrate:chaperonin molar ratio was 2:1. MDH activity was assayed by measuring the decrease in absorption at 340 nm of NADH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with oxalacetate as substrate.Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy—Purified proteins were concentrated on Centricon-30 (Amicon) filters, and the buffer was exchanged by repeated concentration and dilution steps in Pipes 20 mm, pD 7.0 (pD = pH + 0.4). The filtrate obtained in the last concentration step was used as a reference. Samples, containing around 6 μm protein oligomer, were placed between two calcium fluoride windows separated by a 50-μm spacer. Infrared spectra were recorded in a Nicolet Magna 550 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. Data acquisition and analysis were performed as previously described (15Arrondo J.L. Castresana J.L.R. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11650-11655Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Differential scanning calorimetry was performed in a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Prior to DSC experiments, samples were dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. Samples and reference solutions were properly degassed and loaded into the calorimeter, and the experiments were carried out above atmospheric pressure to avoid degassing during heating. To form the substrate-chaperonin complexes, citrate synthase (CS) was chemically denatured in 6.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm dithiothreitol and diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and the desired chaperonin. The dilution of CS into the buffer was set to get the final desired CS:GroEL molar ratio, keeping always the denaturant concentration below 0.5 m. The complex was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, and centrifuged to remove protein aggregates before loading the sample into the calorimeter. The calorimetric data were analyzed using Origin software provided with the calorimeter. Protein concentration was 8–12 μm protein monomer, and the scan rate was varied between 20 and 90 °C/h. To obtain the activation energy of denaturation, the calorimetric traces were analyzed as described previously (16Sánchez Ruiz J.M. López L.J. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 17Galisteo M.L. Mateo P.L. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mathematical elaboration leads to different methods to calculate the activation energy (E a) that describes the process. Equations used were as follows. K=νCp/ΔH(T)-ΔH(Eq. 1) ln{ln[ΔH(T)/(ΔH(T)-ΔH)]}=E/R(1/Tm1/T)(Eq. 2) ln(v/Tm2)=constE/RTm(Eq. 3) where Cp is the excess heat capacity and E the activation energy.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of the same samples characterized by DSC were recorded in a PerkinElmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter, with excitation at 290 nm and emission at 300–450 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. Protein concentration was 250 nm oligomer.Kinetics of Irreversible Thermal Inactivation—90-μl aliquots (8–12 μm protein monomer) were incubated in a water bath at the desired temperature. At different times aliquots were removed, cooled quickly to 37 °C, and assayed for ATPase activity as described above. Experiments were repeated at least twice at a final concentration of GroEL monomer of 160 nm.RESULTSFunctional Studies—The functionality of wt GroEL and of mutants E434K and E461K was analyzed by characterizing GroES-mediated inhibition of their ATPase activity, as well as their ability to fold MDH, as a function of temperature. We have previously demonstrated that the mutated residues are involved in the thermostat of the protein, which allows it to distinguish physiological temperatures (37 °C) from stress temperatures (42 °C) (7Sot B. Galán A. Valpuesta J.M. Bertrand S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34024-34029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to define the contribution of the salt bridges involving Glu434 and Glu461 to the stability of the inter-ring interface, which is in turn related to negative inter-ring cooperativity. The ability of E434K to assist the refolding of MDH decreases at temperatures above 25 °C and becomes negligible at 34 °C, T½ of its thermal inactivation being 29 °C (Fig. 1A). A similar temperature dependence is observed for the folding activity of E461K (Fig. 1B) and wt GroEL (Fig. 1C), although their thermal inactivation occurs at higher temperatures (T½ at 32 and 39 °C, respectively). These findings indicate that the ionic interactions in which the mutated residues are involved contribute distinctly to the stability of the inter-ring interface against the thermal challenge. GroES-mediated inhibition of the mutant ATPase activity takes place concomitantly (Fig. 1A) or just before the observed temperature-induced inactivation of the protein (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the latter might occur because of a loss or weakening of the negative inter-ring cooperativity. Both this SR1-like behavior and the temperature-induced stabilization of the GroEL-GroES symmetric complexes observed for both mutants at 37 °C (7Sot B. Galán A. Valpuesta J.M. Bertrand S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34024-34029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) support this hypothesis. In contrast, as shown previously (19Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), at temperatures above 37 °C inhibition of the ATPase activity of wt GroEL by GroES is slightly reduced (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the mechanism by which GroEL switches from being a folding to a storing device in response to an increase in temperature might be different in the wt and in the mutants (18Llorca O.

Valpuesta J.M. Bertrand S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34024-34029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).IR Spectroscopy—The conformational properties of wt GroEL and E461K, E434K, and SR1 mutants have been characterized by IR spectroscopy. Their spectra look rather similar, showing after deconvolution several bands that can be attributed to different types of secondary structures, based on previous studies (19Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The bands at 1656 and 1648 cm–1 (Fig. 2) represent two types of α-helices, the latter probably being distorted and/or exposed to the solvent (20Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Surewicz W.K Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). The band component at 1642 cm–1 contains contributions from irregular (loops, turns) and unordered structures. The component at 1631 cm–1 has been associated with β-structures, and those at 1668 and 1681 cm–1 are usually assigned to turns. The only subtle difference, detected in the deconvoluted spectra, between wt GroEL and the mutant proteins is the higher intensity of the band components at 1648 and 1642 cm–1 relative to that at 1656 cm–1 in the spectra of the mutants. This suggests that part of the helical structure is more accessible to the solvent and/or that inter-ring interactions stabilize helical protein segments. The fact that this spectral difference is also observed in the spectrum of SR1 (Fig. 2A) reinforces this interpretation. This conformational change is expected because the highly helical equatorial domain that forms the inter-ring interface is composed mainly by α-helices (1Braig K. Otwinoswki Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Therefore, the spectral similarity indicates that the aforementioned mutations have little impact in the overall secondary structure of the protein.Fig. 2Infrared spectra of the chaperonins. Original (lower traces) and deconvoluted (upper traces) infrared spectra of SR1 (A), E434K (B), E461K (C), and wt GroEL (D) are shown. Deconvolution was carried out using a Lorentzian function with a half-bandwidth of 18 cm–1 and a band narrowing factor of 2.25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DSC—To examine the conformational stability of the wt and mutant proteins, their thermal denaturation was studied by DSC. Prior to characterizing the thermal stability of the proteins, the presence of endogenous bound substrates was examined by fluorescence spectroscopy. These ligands can significantly modify the stability of the protein. Because GroEL has no Trp residues, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to detect bound protein substrates. Indeed, the results showed that all proteins contained these ligands, and therefore they were all subjected to an additional chromatographic step (12Clark A.C. Ramanathan R. Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 100-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that removed most, if not all (see below), ligands. The thermograms corresponding to the four “apo”-proteins used in this study are shown in Fig. 3. The stability of the proteins follows the order wt > E461K > E434K > SR1, as judged by the T m and ΔH cal values (Table I). The presence of two overlapping endotherms in the calorimetric profiles of E434K and E461K might be because of endogenous substrates that remain bound to the protein after the chromatographic procedure. To confirm this interpretation, the fluorescence spectra of the same samples used in DSC were recorded (Fig. 3, inset). The results clearly indicate that only the proteins that show two endotherms in their calorimetric traces (E434K and E461K) display significant fluorescence intensity and therefore support this interpretation. The low temperature endotherm comes from the unfolding of the chaperonin, whereas the high temperature one originates from the thermal denaturation of the chaperonin-substrate complex (see below). As judged by the calorimetric traces and the fluorescence data, wt GroEL and SR1, but not the single point mutants, can be purified in their substrate-free forms.Fig. 3Thermal denaturation of the chaperonins. Calorimetric recordings of SR1 (A), E434K (B), E461K (C), and wt GroEL (D) are shown. Calorimetric traces are given after subtraction of the instrumental base line. The scan rate was 60 °C/h.

The chaperonin-substrate complexes were formed by diluting chemically denatured citrate synthase in buffer containing the desired GroEL variant. Titration of apo-GroEL with denatured CS induces the progressive appearance of a high temperature endotherm (Fig. 4A), in which the relative area increases with the fluorescence intensity of the protein complex (Fig. 4A, inset). The presence of an isoenthalpic point suggests that substrate binding induces a transition between two protein states. In the presence of saturating protein-substrate concentrations the T m of the denaturation transition of each of the proteins is shifted to a higher value (Table I), indicating that ligand binding stabilizes the four proteins.Fig. 4Titration of chaperonins with protein substrates.

Insets, fluorescence spectra of the same samples measured by DSC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It should be mentioned that considering the molecular masses of GroEL and CS and the stoichiometry of the complex (saturation at 2:1 bound substrate to chaperonin molar ratio), the expected contribution of CS unfolding to the observed GroEL denaturation enthalpy should not be more than 10%. This contribution is most likely much lower, because the GroEL-bound substrate adopts a partially folded conformation, which is marginally stable due to the absence of extensive tertiary interactions (22Goldberg M.S. Zhang J. Sondek S. Matthews C.R. Fox R.O. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1080-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is important to note that in the case of wt GroEL, saturation is achieved at CS:GroEL molar ratios higher than 2. In contrast, a single, high temperature endotherm is observed for E461K (Fig. 4B) and E434K (not shown) at a CS to GroEL molar ratio of 2:1. This suggests that the negative cooperativity that allows binding of substrates to one ring only in the wt protein has been, at least partially, lost in the mutant proteins.In a previous work in which the effect of nucleotides on GroEL stability was analyzed (19Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it was noted that thermal denaturation of the protein was, at least partially, irreversible. If this is the case, thermal denaturation occurs under kinetic control, as described for other proteins. As expected in such cases the denaturation temperature is scan rate-dependent, an effect that becomes more pronounced for the mutant proteins both in the absence (Table I) and presence (Fig. 5; Table I) of saturating concentrations of protein substrate. We have used the DSC data obtained at different scan rates to check whether the denaturation behavior of the chaperonin-substrate complexes could be described by the simplest two-state kinetic transition (16Sánchez Ruiz J.M. López L.J. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This model considers the irreversible transition of the native (N) to a denatured (D) state as a first order reaction in which the rate constant changes with temperature following the Arrhenius equation. Therefore, the rate of increase in the concentration of D (and of the corresponding decrease in the concentration of N) is determined by the free energy of activation (24Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A. Kruuv J. Biochemistry. 1992; 27: 1648-1652Google Scholar). If the system under study follows this model, the activation energy of the process can be estimated from DSC data by different methods (16Sánchez Ruiz J.M. López L.J. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 24Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A. Kruuv J. Biochemistry. 1992; 27: 1648-1652Google Scholar). The data obtained for wt GroEL and E434K (Fig. 6), as well as that of E461K and SR1 (not shown), can be fitted to a two-state kinetic transition. The overall average activation energies for wt GroEL, E461K, E434K, and SR1 are 219 ± 20, 138 ± 18, 122 ± 8, and 110 ± 5 kcal/mol, respectively. Alternatively, the activation energy of thermal denaturation can be estimated from the temperature-induced loss of ATPase activity at several temperatures within the calorimetric endotherm (Fig. 7). The rate constants were estimated by fitting the data to first-order kinetics equation. The Arrhenius plots of the kinetic constants fit a straight line (Fig. 7, inset) and yield the following activation energies of denaturation for wt GroEL, E461K, E434K, and SR1: 198 ± 5 kcal/mol, 145.5 ± 10 kcal/mol, 115 ± 12 kcal/mol and 96 ± 5 kcal/mol, respectively. The values are in reasonable agreement with those determined from the calorimetric profiles, supporting the idea that the thermal denaturation of these proteins can be described by a two-state kinetic transition in which only two states, native and denatured, are significantly populated in the denaturation process.Fig. 5Effect of scan rate on the chaperonin thermal denaturation.

https://openalex.org/W2057025311,"The fungal extracellular flavocytochrome cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) participates in lignocellulose degradation. The enzyme has a cytochrome domain connected to a flavin-binding domain by a peptide linker. The cytochrome domain contains a 6-coordinate low spin b-type heme with unusual iron ligands and coordination geometry. Wild type CDH is only the second example of a b-type heme with Met-His ligation, and it is the first example of a Met-His ligation of heme b where the ligands are arranged in a nearly perpendicular orientation. To investigate the ligation further, Met65 was replaced with a histidine to create a bis-histidyl ligated iron typical of b-type cytochromes. The variant is expressed as a stable 90-kDa protein that retains the flavin domain catalytic reactivity. However, the ability of the mutant to reduce external one-electron acceptors such as cytochrome c is impaired. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate a decrease in the redox midpoint potential of the heme by 210 mV. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, the ferric state of the protoheme displays a mixed low spin/high spin state at room temperature and low spin character at 90 K, as determined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The wild type cytochrome does not bind CO, but the ferrous state of the variant forms a CO complex, although the association rate is very low. The crystal structure of the M65H cytochrome domain has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The variant structure confirms a bis-histidyl ligation but reveals unusual features. As for the wild type enzyme, the ligands have a nearly perpendicular arrangement. Furthermore, the iron is bound by imidazole Nδ1 and Nϵ2 nitrogen atoms, rather than the typical Nϵ2/Nϵ2 coordination encountered in bis-histidyl ligated heme proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a bis-histidyl Nδ1/Nϵ2-coordinated protoporphyrin IX iron. The fungal extracellular flavocytochrome cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) participates in lignocellulose degradation. The enzyme has a cytochrome domain connected to a flavin-binding domain by a peptide linker. The cytochrome domain contains a 6-coordinate low spin b-type heme with unusual iron ligands and coordination geometry. Wild type CDH is only the second example of a b-type heme with Met-His ligation, and it is the first example of a Met-His ligation of heme b where the ligands are arranged in a nearly perpendicular orientation. To investigate the ligation further, Met65 was replaced with a histidine to create a bis-histidyl ligated iron typical of b-type cytochromes. The variant is expressed as a stable 90-kDa protein that retains the flavin domain catalytic reactivity. However, the ability of the mutant to reduce external one-electron acceptors such as cytochrome c is impaired. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate a decrease in the redox midpoint potential of the heme by 210 mV. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, the ferric state of the protoheme displays a mixed low spin/high spin state at room temperature and low spin character at 90 K, as determined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The wild type cytochrome does not bind CO, but the ferrous state of the variant forms a CO complex, although the association rate is very low. The crystal structure of the M65H cytochrome domain has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The variant structure confirms a bis-histidyl ligation but reveals unusual features. As for the wild type enzyme, the ligands have a nearly perpendicular arrangement. Furthermore, the iron is bound by imidazole Nδ1 and Nϵ2 nitrogen atoms, rather than the typical Nϵ2/Nϵ2 coordination encountered in bis-histidyl ligated heme proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a bis-histidyl Nδ1/Nϵ2-coordinated protoporphyrin IX iron.

Johansson G. Pettersson G. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The CDH gene from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been cloned and sequenced (2Li B. Nagalla S.R. Renganathan V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raices M. Paifer E. Cremata J. Montesino R. Stahlberg J. Divne C. Szabo Istvan J. Henriksson G. Johansson G. Pettersson G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), revealing a full-length protein of 755 amino acids partitioned into a cytochrome domain (residues 1–190) and a flavodehydrogenase domain (residues 216–755) connected by a 25-residue peptide linker. A flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor is bound to the flavoprotein domain, whereas the cytochrome domain contains a 6-coordinate low spin (6cLS) Fe-protoporphyrin IX (4Cox M.C. Rogers M.S.

Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the reductive half-reaction, the flavodehydrogenase domain catalyzes the oxidation of cellobiose to yield cellobiono-1,5-lactone (6Higham C.W. Gordon-Smith D. Dempsey C.E. Wood P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the concomitant reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide. During the ensuing oxidative half-reaction, the flavin is reoxidized by an electron acceptor, either directly for two-electron acceptors such as 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) or via the cytochrome domain for one-electron acceptors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c).The 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the wild type P. chrysosporium CDH cytochrome domain has been reported elsewhere (7Hallberg B.M. Bergfors T. Backbro K. Pettersson G. Herriksson G. Divne C. Structure. 2000; 8: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The heme-binding module features an unusual fold among cytochromes: an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich consisting of a five-stranded and a six-stranded β-sheet. The protoheme group is bound in a hydrophobic pocket at one face of the β-core with one heme edge exposed to solvent. Three loops protrude from the β-sheet and wedge the b-type heme. The packing of the heme pocket formed by various nonpolar residues is tight, leaving little space for exogenous molecules. The crystal structure (7Hallberg B.M. Bergfors T. Backbro K. Pettersson G. Herriksson G. Divne C. Structure. 2000; 8: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) confirmed earlier spectroscopic predictions (4Cox M.C. Rogers M.S. Cheesman M. Jones G.D. Thomson A.J. Wilson M.T. Moore G.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), that the heme iron is ligated by a methionine and histidine with an unusual, nearly perpendicular arrangement (∼100°) of the two planes defined by the methionine thioether group and the His163 imidazole ring. The distances of the iron-nitrogen and iron-sulfur bonds, 2.0 and 2.3 Å, respectively, are typical of those observed in c-type cytochromes with Met-His iron ligation.Results from site-directed mutagenesis of the two protoheme-iron ligands confirmed their importance (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Substitution of either residue with an alanine demonstrated that the Met-His coordination is essential for heme reactivity, i.e. the electron transfer (ET) to one-electron acceptors. In addition, the loss of an axial protein ligand rendered the cytochrome domain highly susceptible to degradation. Indeed, similar mutant studies in other b-type cytochromes reveal a weaker binding (9Miles C.S. Manson F.D. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or nonincorporation of the heme (10Hampsey D.M. Das G. Sherman F.

Loss of the protoheme in the alanine variants of CDH may lead to unfolding of the cytochrome domain, rendering it more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, in c-type cytochromes, replacing the axially ligated methionine with a histidine produced a stable protein with some properties similar to the wild type (13Aubert C. Guerlesquin F.

Speculation about the coordination geometry to the protoheme in these variants has been advanced (14Darrouzet E. Mandaci S. Li J. Qin H. Knaff D.B. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7908-7917Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Raphael A.L. Gray H.B. Proteins. 1989; 6: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but no structural studies have been reported. Herein, we report the results from site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies on the M65H variant of P. chrysosporium CDH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOrganism—Growth and maintenance of the auxotrophic strain OGC316-7 (Ura 11) and prototrophic transformants were as described previously (17Akileswaran L. Alic M. Clark E.K. Hornick J.L. Gold M.H. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Alic M. Clark E.K. Kornegay J.R. Gold M.H. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 305-311Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for subcloning plasmids.Construction of the Mutant Plasmid pM65H—The M65H site-directed mutation was introduced into pUGC1 using the Transform™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutant primer converted the ATG codon (Met) to the CAC codon (His). The mutant plasmid pM65H was isolated, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing.Transformation of P. chrysosporium with pM65H—Protoplasts of P. chrysosporium OGC316-7 (Ura11), a uracil auxotroph, were prepared as described previously (19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Sollewijn Gelpke M.D. Mayfield-Gambill M. Cereghino G.P.L. Gold M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed with EcoRI-linearized pM65H (2 μg), and potential transformants were screened for uracil prototrophy (19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Sollewijn Gelpke M.D. Mayfield-Gambill M. Cereghino G.P.L. Gold M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conidia from prototrophs were then cultured in high carbon high nitrogen (HCHN) stationary liquid cultures with glucose as the sole carbon source (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and assayed for extracellular CDH activity using both the cyt c and DCPIP assays (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The transformant exhibiting the highest activity was purified by isolating single basidiospores as described elsewhere (21Alic M. Kornegay J.R. Pribnow D. Gold M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 406-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alic M. Mayfield M.B. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 491-494Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and progeny were rescreened for CDH activity in liquid cultures.Production and Purification of the M65H Variant—The M65H strain was grown for 7 days at 37 °C from conidial inocula in HCHN stationary liquid cultures with glucose as the sole carbon source. The extracellular fluid from 7-day-old cultures was concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6. Subsequently, the variant protein was purified by cellulose affinity chromatography, gel filtration (Sephacryl S200 HR), and fast protein liquid chromatography using a MonoQ HR5/5 anion exchanger, as described previously (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cytochrome Domains—The cytochrome domains of recombinant wild type CDH (rCDH) and M65H (CYTM65H) were obtained by limited proteolysis with papain (5Cohen J.D. Bao W. Renganathan V. Subramaniam S.S. Loehr T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a MonoQ anion exchanger with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using a 12% Tris-glycine system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) in a Miniprotean II apparatus (Bio-Rad), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Estimation of Protein and Heme Content—The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18446) Google Scholar). The heme content was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen procedure (26Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar).Spectroscopic Procedures—Electronic absorption spectra of rCDH and the M65H variant were recorded at room temperature with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer. The spectra were obtained in 20 mm sodium succinate, pH 4.5. The enzymes were reduced under aerobic or anaerobic conditions by addition of cellobiose (200 μm) or excess dithionite. The CO adduct of the reduced form of the M65H variant was obtained by briefly bubbling CO gas through a cellobiose- or dithionite-reduced enzyme solution under anaerobic conditions. To measure the association rate of CO, native M65H variant (∼1.5 μm) was added to an anaerobic solution of 20 mm sodium succinate, pH 4.5, containing 60–240 μm CO and >100 μm dithionite. Ligand association was followed by the change in the absorbance at 431 nm.Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman spectra were measured on 15 μl of each sample sealed in a glass melting point capillary tube using a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph equipped with a Princeton Instruments LN1100PB liquid N2-cooled CCD detector and Kaiser Optical Systems holographic notch filter. Excitation light was provided by an Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm). The laser power at the sample was ∼40 mW. The plasma emission lines were removed by an Applied Photophysics prism monochromator. The data at room temperature and 90 K were collected in a back-scattering geometry with the sample capillary placed in a copper cold finger. For the 90 K experiments, the capillary was cooled by liquid nitrogen. Spectral data were processed using GRAMS/386 (Galactic Industries) and Origin (Microcal) data analysis programs. The spectra were calibrated against indene as an external standard. The frequencies are estimated to be accurate to within ±1 cm–1.Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Procedure—CDH activity was measured using either the cyt c or the DCPIP assay (8Rotsaert F.A. Li B. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The steady state kinetic parameters for cellobiose oxidation were determined by monitoring ferrocytochrome c formation (ϵ550 = 28 mm–1 cm–1) or DCPIP reduction (ϵ515 = 6.8 mm–1 cm–1). The assays contained a fixed level of ferricytochrome c (12.5 μm) or DCPIP (35 μm) and varying levels of cellobiose (5–200 μm) in 20 mm sodium succinate, pH 4.5. The steady state kinetics for cyt c and DCPIP reduction were determined with a fixed cellobiose concentration (200 μm) and variable cyt c and DCPIP concentrations (0.2–40 μm).Potentiometric Titration—Potentiometric titrations were carried out at room temperature in a borosilicate glass cell, similar to that described previously (27Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The potential was measured with a platinum electrode versus a REF401 calomel electrode (Radiometer). All of the values are expressed with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. The electrodes were calibrated against a pH 7 standard solution of quinhydrone (E m = +293 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode) with a Metrohm 632 pH meter (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). The redox midpoint potential was determined in 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 4.5. Redox equilibration between the protein and the electrode was achieved by the use of a mixture of dyes: phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, 2-hydoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate, and/or Fe3+-EDTA. The redox titration was carried out with stirring of the buffered solution (5.5 ml), containing 5 μm enzyme, the mediator dyes (20 μm each), and 50 μm Fe3+-EDTA. Prior to the reductive titration, the solution of enzyme and mediators was flushed with argon. The solution was then allowed to reach equilibrium, and the first UV-visible spectrum was recorded with an HP 8353 Diode Array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The redox potential of the system was adjusted by the addition of a small volume of 10 or 100 mm dithionite via a Hamilton syringe. After equilibration (constant reading of absorbance and potential), a spectrum was recorded, the was potential noted, and an additional small volume of dithionite was added. This process was repeated until the enzyme was completely reduced. The oxidative titration was carried out by the addition of small amounts of air to the cell, followed by flushing with argon. The system was allowed to equilibrate, a spectrum was recorded, and the potential was noted. This procedure was repeated until the enzyme was completely oxidized. The redox state of CDH was determined from the size of α the band of heme b: 562 nm for rCDH and 560 nm for M65H. The absorbance at this wavelength, corrected for the absorbance at 800 nm, was plotted against the potential of the system. The graph was fitted against the Nernst equation to obtain the redox potential E m. The Nernst plot for both oxidative and reductive titration exhibited no hysteresis, confirming that the system was at equilibrium.Protein Preparation for Crystallization—The M65H variant was cleaved proteolytically with papain to yield distinct cytochrome and flavin fragments as described previously (5Cohen J.D. Bao W. Renganathan V. Subramaniam S.S. Loehr T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The fragments were fractionated on a MonoQ HR 5/5 anion exchanger in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m), followed by refraction-ation of the samples containing CYTM65H at pH 4.2, using a linear sodium acetate gradient (50 mm to 1 m). Crystals of CYTM65H were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method (28McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Chrystals. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982Google Scholar). Hanging drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (3 mg/ml) and reservoir. The reservoir contained 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% (v/v) 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mm CaCl2. The crystals appeared as red hexagonal rods of space group P65 with cell constants a = b = 139.0 Å and c = 52.67 Å and with two molecules in the asymmetric unit.X-ray Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement—The data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation (source ID14-EH4, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France; λ = 0.9763 Å). Data reduction and scaling were carried out using MOSFLM (29Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and SCALA (30Evans P.R. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of CCP4 Sutdy Weekend on Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Lab., Warrington, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar), respectively. The previously reported structure of the P. chrysosporium CDH cytochrome domain at 1.9 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 1D7C) (7Hallberg B.M. Bergfors T. Backbro K. Pettersson G. Herriksson G. Divne C. Structure. 2000; 8: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was used as a starting model for crystallographic refinement against CYTM65H amplitudes. Initial refinement and manual model building were performed with the programs CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) and O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), respectively. Final refinement was done with REF-MAC5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar) at 1.9 Å resolution, using anisotropic scaling, hydrogens in their riding positions, and atomic displacement parameter refinement, using the “translation, liberation, screw rotation” model. The two noncrystallographically related molecules were defined as rigid bodies during translation, liberation, screw rotation refinement. All least squares planes and angles between normals and least squares planes were calculated, using the program MOLEMAN2 (34Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression and Purification of the M65H Variant—The M65H mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Transformation of the Ura– strain (Ura11) with linearized pM65H resulted in the isolation of several prototrophic transformants. Each was grown in liquid HCHN culture in the presence of glucose, conditions under which endogenous wild type CDH is not expressed (2Li B. Nagalla S.R. Renganathan V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li B. Rotsaert F.A.J. Gold M.H. Renganathan V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The extracellular medium was monitored for CDH activity, using the cyt c and DCPIP reduction assays. Several transformants exhibited significant DCPIP reduction activity, but none efficiently reduced cyt c. The transformant exhibiting the highest DCPIP activity was purified by fruiting and isolating single basidiospore-derived colonies (21Alic M. Kornegay J.R. Pribnow D. Gold M.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 406-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alic M. Mayfield M.B. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 491-494Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purified transformant was incubated at 37 °C in HCHN medium for 7 days. The amount of CDH secreted was ∼50% of rCDH cultures, based on the DCPIP reduction assay. Western blot analysis of the extracellular medium over the 7-day-old culture period indicated the presence of a 90-kDa CDH-like protein. The M65H protein was purified to homogeneity by cellulose affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and anionic exchange chromatography. The R z value (A 411/A 280) was 0.77, and the extinction coefficient of the Soret maximum at 411 nm was 133 mm–1 cm–1.Steady State Kinetics—Measuring CDH activity in the extracellular medium of M65H transformants suggested that the cytochrome variant efficiently reduced DCPIP, but its ability to reduce cyt c was significantly impaired. Under steady state conditions, linear double-reciprocal plots were obtained in 20 mm sodium succinate, pH 4.5, for the purified variant and for the rCDH protein. The apparent Km values for cellobiose and DCPIP and k cat values for cellobiose oxidation and DCPIP reduction were similar for both CDH proteins (Table I). However, the specific activity for cyt c reduction by the M65H variant was ∼100-fold lower than that for rCDH (Table I).Table ISteady state parameters for rCDH and the M65H variant at pH 4.5EnzymeCellobiose oxidation (DCPIP)DCPIP reductionk catKmk cat/Kmk catKmk cat/Kms-1μmm-1 s-1s-1μmm-1 s-1rCDH25.7406.4·10527.06.44.2·106M65H26.0357.6·10525.07.43.4·106EnzymeCellobiose oxidation (cyt c)Cyt c reductionk catKmk cat/Kmk catKmk cat/Kms-1μmm-1 s-1s-1μmm-1 s-1rCDH10.5185.8·10510.80.81.4·107M65H0.1NAaNA, not applicable.NA0.1NANAa NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab UV-visible Spectroscopy of rCDH and the M65H Variant— The electronic absorption spectra for both rCDH and the M65H variant were dominated by the heme b spectrum, with a weak absorbance near 450 nm attributed to the flavin. The ferric heme spectrum of rCDH was typical for a low spin (LS) heme iron, with a Soret maximum at 421 nm and visible bands at 530 and 570 nm (Fig. 1A and Table II). The M65H substitution altered the optical properties of the ferric heme, giving rise to a spectrum that contained a mixture of LS and high spin (HS) protoheme iron signals (Table II). Moreover, the Soret band was blue-shifted to 411 nm in the variant, and the band at 730 nm, characteristic of a methionine-iron ligation (35Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochrome c: Evolutionary, Structural, and Physiochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar), disappeared. A new weak band indicative of a HS species in the ferric state is present at 630 nm. Analysis of possible heme absorbances near 500 nm was compromised by the flavin absorbance. Therefore, the truncated cytochrome domain was obtained by limited proteolysis, and the resulting electronic absorption spectrum showed a maximum at 495 and shoulders at 530 and 560 nm (Fig. 1A). As was observed with rCDH, the ferric heme in M65H is unreactive with both cyanide and imidazole (50 mm).Table IISpectral features and heme redox midpoint potential for rCDH, the M65H variant, and selected heme proteins with histidine ligationProteinOxidizedReducedE m (mV vs. normal hydrogen electrode)rCDH421, 530, 570429, 532, 562aThe addition of 400 μm cellobiose (rCDH) or a grain of dithionite (rCDH, M65H, and cytochrome domains).+164rCDH (cyt domain)421, 530, 570429, 532, 562aThe addition of 400 μm cellobiose (rCDH) or a grain of dithionite (rCDH, M65H, and cytochrome domains).+161M65H411, 530, 560, 630428, 530, 560aThe addition of 400 μm cellobiose (rCDH) or a grain of dithionite (rCDH, M65H, and cytochrome domains).-53M65H (cyt domain)411, 495, 530, 560, 630428, 530, 560aThe addition of 400 μm cellobiose (rCDH) or a grain of dithionite (rCDH, M65H, and cytochrome domains).NDbND, not determined.Cytochrome b 5cUV-visible from Ref. 51; redox potential from Ref. 40.413, 532, 560423, 526, 556+4Cytochrome b 562dUV-visible from Ref. 52; redox potential from Ref. 39.418, 529, 558427, 531, 562+167Horseradish peroxidaseeUV-visible from Ref. 53.403, 500, 641437, 556MetMbfUV-visible from Ref. 54; redox potential from Ref. 55.410, 505, 635434, 556+61a The addition of 400 μm cellobiose (rCDH) or a grain"
