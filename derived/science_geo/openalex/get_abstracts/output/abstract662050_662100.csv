https://openalex.org/W3093768302,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein substitution D614G became dominant during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1,2. However, the effect of this variant on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineered the spike D614G substitution in the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain, and found that it enhances viral replication in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues by increasing the infectivity and stability of virions. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike(D614G) (G614 virus) produced higher infectious titres in nasal washes and the trachea, but not in the lungs, supporting clinical evidence showing that the mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increase transmission. Sera from hamsters infected with D614 virus exhibit modestly higher neutralization titres against G614 virus than against D614 virus, suggesting that the mutation is unlikely to reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19, and that therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this variant in viral spread and its implications for vaccine efficacy and antibody therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3093490071,"Acquired mutations are pervasive across normal tissues. However, understanding of the processes that drive transformation of certain clones to cancer is limited. Here we study this phenomenon in the context of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs). We find that mutations are selected differentially based on exposures. Mutations in ASXL1 are enriched in current or former smokers, whereas cancer therapy with radiation, platinum and topoisomerase II inhibitors preferentially selects for mutations in DNA damage response genes (TP53, PPM1D, CHEK2). Sequential sampling provides definitive evidence that DNA damage response clones outcompete other clones when exposed to certain therapies. Among cases in which CH was previously detected, the CH mutation was present at tMN diagnosis. We identify the molecular characteristics of CH that increase risk of tMN. The increasing implementation of clinical sequencing at diagnosis provides an opportunity to identify patients at risk of tMN for prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3093674228,"Genome-wide association studies of neurological diseases have identified thousands of variants associated with disease phenotypes. However, most of these variants do not alter coding sequences, making it difficult to assign their function. Here, we present a multi-omic epigenetic atlas of the adult human brain through profiling of single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes and three-dimensional chromatin interactions of diverse adult brain regions across a cohort of cognitively healthy individuals. We developed a machine-learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional SNPs for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, nominating target genes and cell types for previously orphaned loci from genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we dissected the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) Parkinson’s disease risk locus, identifying putative ectopic regulatory interactions in neurons that may mediate this disease association. This work expands understanding of inherited variation and provides a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of causal regulatory variation in disease. Single-cell chromatin profiling of different brain regions identifies cell-type-specific regulatory elements, and helps to predict functional SNPs for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3093879470,"Bread wheat expanded its habitat from a core area of the Fertile Crescent to global environments within ~10,000 years. The genetic mechanisms of this remarkable evolutionary success are not well understood. By whole-genome sequencing of populations from 25 subspecies within the genera Triticum and Aegilops, we identified composite introgression from wild populations contributing to a substantial portion (4-32%) of the bread wheat genome, which increased the genetic diversity of bread wheat and allowed its divergent adaptation. Meanwhile, convergent adaptation to human selection showed 2- to 16-fold enrichment relative to random expectation-a certain set of genes were repeatedly selected in Triticum species despite their drastic differences in ploidy levels and growing zones, indicating the important role of evolutionary constraints in shaping the adaptive landscape of bread wheat. These results showed the genetic necessities of wheat as a global crop and provided new perspectives on transferring adaptive success across species for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3033087201,"Many different countries have been under lockdown or extreme social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N = 3,504), Spain (N = 3,524) and the United Kingdom (N = 3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to predict the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety, and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock."

https://openalex.org/W3094566369,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common diagnosed leukemia. In older adults, AML confers an adverse outcome1,2. AML originates from a dominant mutation, then acquires collaborative transformative mutations leading to myeloid transformation and clinical/biological heterogeneity. Currently, AML treatment is initiated rapidly, precluding the ability to consider the mutational profile of a patient's leukemia for treatment decisions. Untreated patients with AML ≥ 60 years were prospectively enrolled on the ongoing Beat AML trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03013998 ), which aims to provide cytogenetic and mutational data within 7 days (d) from sample receipt and before treatment selection, followed by treatment assignment to a sub-study based on the dominant clone. A total of 487 patients with suspected AML were enrolled; 395 were eligible. Median age was 72 years (range 60-92 years; 38% ≥75 years); 374 patients (94.7%) had genetic and cytogenetic analysis completed within 7 d and were centrally assigned to a Beat AML sub-study; 224 (56.7%) were enrolled on a Beat AML sub-study. The remaining 171 patients elected standard of care (SOC) (103), investigational therapy (28) or palliative care (40); 9 died before treatment assignment. Demographic, laboratory and molecular characteristics were not significantly different between patients on the Beat AML sub-studies and those receiving SOC (induction with cytarabine + daunorubicin (7 + 3 or equivalent) or hypomethylation agent). Thirty-day mortality was less frequent and overall survival was significantly longer for patients enrolled on the Beat AML sub-studies versus those who elected SOC. A precision medicine therapy strategy in AML is feasible within 7 d, allowing patients and physicians to rapidly incorporate genomic data into treatment decisions without increasing early death or adversely impacting overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W3093839808,"While calcium imaging has become a mainstay of modern neuroscience, the spectral properties of current fluorescent calcium indicators limit deep-tissue imaging as well as simultaneous use with other probes. Using two monomeric near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent proteins (FPs), we engineered an NIR Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based genetically encoded calcium indicator (iGECI). iGECI exhibits high levels of brightness and photostability and an increase up to 600% in the fluorescence response to calcium. In dissociated neurons, iGECI detects spontaneous neuronal activity and electrically and optogenetically induced firing. We validated the performance of iGECI up to a depth of almost 400 µm in acute brain slices using one-photon light-sheet imaging. Applying hybrid photoacoustic and fluorescence microscopy, we simultaneously monitored neuronal and hemodynamic activities in the mouse brain through an intact skull, with resolutions of ~3 μm (lateral) and ~25-50 μm (axial). Using two-photon imaging, we detected evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity in the mouse visual cortex, with fluorescence changes of up to 25%. iGECI allows biosensors and optogenetic actuators to be multiplexed without spectral crosstalk."
https://openalex.org/W3094005756,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is a fulminant complication of multiple etiologies, characterized by rapid hepatic destruction, multi-organ failure and mortality. ALF treatment is mainly limited to supportive care and liver transplantation. Here we utilize the acetaminophen (APAP) and thioacetamide (TAA) ALF models in characterizing 56,527 single-cell transcriptomes to define the mouse ALF cellular atlas. We demonstrate that unique, previously uncharacterized stellate cell, endothelial cell, Kupffer cell, monocyte and neutrophil subsets, and their intricate intercellular crosstalk, drive ALF. We unravel a common MYC-dependent transcriptional program orchestrating stellate, endothelial and Kupffer cell activation during ALF, which is regulated by the gut microbiome through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of MYC, upstream TLR signaling checkpoints or microbiome depletion suppress this cell-specific, MYC-dependent program, thereby attenuating ALF. In humans, we demonstrate upregulated hepatic MYC expression in ALF transplant recipients compared to healthy donors. Collectively we demonstrate that detailed cellular/genetic decoding may enable pathway-specific ALF therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3094458800,"The dry season is a major challenge for Plasmodium falciparum parasites in many malaria endemic regions, where water availability limits mosquito vectors to only part of the year. How P. falciparum bridges two transmission seasons months apart, without being cleared by the human host or compromising host survival, is poorly understood. Here we show that low levels of P. falciparum parasites persist in the blood of asymptomatic Malian individuals during the 5- to 6-month dry season, rarely causing symptoms and minimally affecting the host immune response. Parasites isolated during the dry season are transcriptionally distinct from those of individuals with febrile malaria in the transmission season, coinciding with longer circulation within each replicative cycle of parasitized erythrocytes without adhering to the vascular endothelium. Low parasite levels during the dry season are not due to impaired replication but rather to increased splenic clearance of longer-circulating infected erythrocytes, which likely maintain parasitemias below clinical and immunological radar. We propose that P. falciparum virulence in areas of seasonal malaria transmission is regulated so that the parasite decreases its endothelial binding capacity, allowing increased splenic clearance and enabling several months of subclinical parasite persistence. Malaria cases are predominant during the rainy seasons in many endemic regions owing to the life cycle of the mosquito vector. How Plasmodium falciparum adapts in humans during the intervening dry season, without causing malaria symptoms or killing the host, offers new insights into its persistence in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3097860048,"Myelination facilitates rapid axonal conduction, enabling efficient communication across different parts of the nervous system. Here we examined mechanisms controlling myelination after injury and during axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Previously, we discovered multiple molecular pathways and strategies that could promote robust axon regrowth after optic nerve injury. However, regenerated axons remain unmyelinated, and the underlying mechanisms are elusive. In this study, we found that, in injured optic nerves, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo transient proliferation but fail to differentiate into mature myelination-competent oligodendrocytes, reminiscent of what is observed in human progressive multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we showed that OPC-intrinsic GPR17 signaling and sustained activation of microglia inhibit different stages of OPC differentiation. Importantly, co-manipulation of GPR17 and microglia led to extensive myelination of regenerated axons. The regulatory mechanisms of stage-dependent OPC differentiation uncovered here suggest a translatable strategy for efficient de novo myelination after CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W3093707140,"Momilactones from rice have allelopathic activity, the ability to inhibit growth of competing plants. Transferring momilactone production to other crops is a potential approach to combat weeds, yet a complete momilactone biosynthetic pathway remains elusive. Here, we address this challenge through rapid gene screening in Nicotiana benthamiana, a heterologous plant host. This required us to solve a central problem: diminishing intermediate and product yields remain a bottleneck for multistep diterpene pathways. We increased intermediate and product titers by rerouting diterpene biosynthesis from the chloroplast to the cytosolic, high-flux mevalonate pathway. This enabled the discovery and reconstitution of a complete route to momilactones (>10-fold yield improvement in production versus rice). Pure momilactone B isolated from N. benthamiana inhibited germination and root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, validating allelopathic activity. We demonstrated the broad utility of this approach by applying it to forskolin, a Hedgehog inhibitor, and taxadiene, an intermediate in taxol biosynthesis (~10-fold improvement in production versus chloroplast expression)."

https://openalex.org/W3093684634,"An asteroid’s history is determined in large part by its strength against collisions with other objects1,2 (impact strength). Laboratory experiments on centimetre-scale meteorites3 have been extrapolated and buttressed with numerical simulations to derive the impact strength at the asteroid scale4,5. In situ evidence of impacts on boulders on airless planetary bodies has come from Apollo lunar samples6 and images of the asteroid (25143) Itokawa7. It has not yet been possible, however, to assess directly the impact strength, and thus the absolute surface age, of the boulders that constitute the building blocks of a rubble-pile asteroid. Here we report an analysis of the size and depth of craters observed on boulders on the asteroid (101955) Bennu. We show that the impact strength of metre-sized boulders is 0.44 to 1.7 megapascals, which is low compared to that of solid terrestrial materials. We infer that Bennu’s metre-sized boulders record its history of impact by millimetre- to centimetre-scale objects in near-Earth space. We conclude that this population of near-Earth impactors has a size frequency distribution similar to that of metre-scale bolides and originates from the asteroidal population. Our results indicate that Bennu has been dynamically decoupled from the main asteroid belt for 1.75 ± 0.75 million years. Analysis of the size and depth of craters on boulders on the asteroid (101955) Bennu indicates that Bennu has been in near-Earth space for 1.75 ± 0.75 million years."

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China were collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Early outbreak data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source (from January 24 to February 16, 2020) were used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimisation procedure was used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the following months. The work was completed on February 19, 2020. Our results showed that the number of infections in most cities in China would peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively. Moreover, for most cities outside and within Hubei Province (except Wuhan), the total number of infected individuals is expected to be less than 300 and 4000, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3096417670,"Early life stress compromises brain development and can contribute to the development of mental illnesses. A common animal model used to study different facets of psychiatric disorders is social isolation from early life on. In rats, this isolation can induce long-lasting alterations in molecular expression and in behavior. Since social isolation models severe psychiatric symptoms, it is to be expected that it affects the overall wellbeing of the animals. As also promoted by the 3Rs principle, though, it is pivotal to decrease the burden of laboratory animals by limiting the number of subjects (reduce, replace) and by improving the animals’ wellbeing (refine). The aim of this study was therefore to test possible refinement strategies such as resocialization and mere adult social isolation. We examined whether the alternatives still triggered the necessary phenotype while minimizing the stress load on the animals. Interestingly, we did not find reduced wellbeing-associated burrowing performance in isolated rats. The hyperactive phenotype seen in socially isolated animals was observed for rats undergoing the adult-only isolation, but resocializing ameliorated the locomotor abnormality. Isolation strongly affected markers of neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex independent of timing: mRNA levels of Arc, Bdnf and the pool of Bdnf transcripts with the 3’ long UTR were reduced in all groups. Bdnf splice variant IV expression was reduced in lifelong-isolated animals. Some of these deficits normalized after resocialization; likewise, exon VI Bdnf mRNA levels were reduced only in animals persistently isolated. Conversely, social deprivation did not affect the expression of Gad67 and Pvb, two GABAergic markers, whereas changes occurred in the expression of dopamine d1 and d2 receptors. As adult isolation was sufficient to trigger the hyperactive phenotype and impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex, it could be a candidate for a refinement strategy for certain research questions. To fully grade the severity of post-weaning social isolation and the alternatives, adult isolation and resocialization, a more profound and multimodal assessment approach is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3093648046,"MicroRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small, noncoding RNAs that regulate diverse biological processes. Due to their essential regulatory roles, microRNA biogenesis is tightly regulated, where protein factors are often found to interact with specific primary and precursor microRNAs for regulation. Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy and mutagenesis, we reveal that the precursor of oncogenic microRNA-21 exists as a pH-dependent ensemble that spontaneously reshuffles the secondary structure of the entire apical stem-loop region, including the Dicer cleavage site. We show that the alternative excited conformation transiently sequesters the bulged adenine into a noncanonical protonated A+-G mismatch, conferring a substantial enhancement in Dicer processing over its ground conformational state. These results indicate that microRNA maturation efficiency may be encoded in the intrinsic dynamic ensemble of primary and precursor microRNAs, providing a potential means of regulating microRNA biogenesis in response to environmental and cellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3095095703,"Neurofilaments are structural components of neurons and are particularly abundant in highly myelinated axons. The levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma have been related to degeneration in several neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and NfL is currently considered as the most promising diagnostic and prognostic fluid biomarker in FTD. Although the location and function of filaments in the healthy nervous system suggests a link between increased NfL and white matter degeneration, such a claim has not been fully elucidated in vivo, especially in the context of FTD. The present study provides evidence of an association between the plasma levels of NfL and white matter involvement in behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) by relating plasma concentration of NfL to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics in a group of 20 bvFTD patients. The results of both voxel-wise and tract specific analysis showed that increased plasma NfL concentration is associated with a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) in a widespread set of white matter tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the fronto-occipital fasciculus the anterior thalamic radiation and the dorsal cingulum bundle. Plasma NfL concentration also correlated with cortical thinning in a portion of the right medial prefrontal cortex and of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that blood NfL levels reflect the global level of neurodegeneration in bvFTD and help to advance our understanding of the association between this blood biomarker for FTD and the disease process."
https://openalex.org/W3093516866,"Cysteine thiol-based transcriptional regulators orchestrate the coordinated regulation of redox homeostasis and other cellular processes by 'sensing' or detecting a specific redox-active molecule, which in turn activates the transcription of a specific detoxification pathway. The extent to which these sensors are truly specific in cells for a singular class of reactive small-molecule stressors, for example, reactive oxygen or sulfur species, is largely unknown. Here, we report structural and mechanistic insights into the thiol-based transcriptional repressor SqrR, which reacts exclusively with oxidized sulfur species such as persulfides, to yield a tetrasulfide bridge that inhibits DNA operator-promoter binding. Evaluation of crystallographic structures of SqrR in various derivatized states, coupled with the results of a mass spectrometry-based kinetic profiling strategy, suggest that persulfide selectivity is determined by structural frustration of the disulfide form. These findings led to the identification of an uncharacterized repressor from the bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii as a persulfide sensor."
https://openalex.org/W3093715746,"Precipitation and atmospheric circulation are the coupled processes through which tropical ocean surface temperatures drive global weather and climate1–5. Local sea surface warming tends to increase precipitation, but this local control is difficult to disentangle from remote effects of conditions elsewhere. As an example of such a remote effect, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the equatorial Pacific Ocean alter precipitation across the tropics. Atmospheric circulations associated with tropical precipitation are predominantly deep, extending up to the tropopause. Shallow atmospheric circulations6–8 affecting the lower troposphere also occur, but the importance of their interaction with precipitation is unclear. Uncertainty in precipitation observations9,10 and limited observations of shallow circulations11 further obstruct our understanding of the ocean’s influence on weather and climate. Despite decades of research, persistent biases remain in many numerical model simulations12–18, including excessively wide tropical rainbands14,18, the ‘double-intertropical convergence zone problem’12,16,17 and too-weak responses to ENSO15. These biases demonstrate gaps in our understanding, reducing confidence in forecasts and projections. Here we use observations to show that seasonal tropical precipitation has a high sensitivity to local sea surface temperature. Our best observational estimate is an 80 per cent change in precipitation for every gram per kilogram change in the saturation specific humidity (itself a function of the sea surface temperature). This observed sensitivity is higher than in 43 of the 47 climate models studied, and is associated with strong shallow circulations. Models with more realistic (closer to 80%) sensitivity have smaller biases across a wide range of metrics. Our results apply to both temporal and spatial variation, over regions where climatological precipitation is about one millimetre per day or more. Our analyses of multiple independent observations, physical constraints and model data underpin these findings. The spread in model behaviour is further linked to differences in shallow convection, thus providing a focus for accelerated research to improve seasonal forecasts through multidecadal climate projections. The response of tropical precipitation to variation in sea surface temperature is stronger than in most climate models, with cool and warm ocean regions linked by strong shallow atmospheric circulations."
https://openalex.org/W3093890133,"The calcium release activated calcium channel is activated by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium sensor protein STIM1. On activation, STIM1 C terminus changes from an inactive, tight to an active, extended conformation. A coiled-coil clamp involving the CC1 and CC3 domains is essential in controlling STIM1 activation, with CC1 as the key entity. The nuclear magnetic resonance-derived solution structure of the CC1 domain represents a three-helix bundle stabilized by interhelical contacts, which are absent in the Stormorken disease-related STIM1 R304W mutant. Two interhelical sites between the CC1α1 and CC1α2 helices are key in controlling STIM1 activation, affecting the balance between tight and extended conformations. Nuclear magnetic resonance-directed mutations within these interhelical interactions restore the physiological, store-dependent activation behavior of the gain-of-function STIM1 R304W mutant. This study reveals the functional impact of interhelical interactions within the CC1 domain for modifying the CC1–CC3 clamp strength to control the activation of STIM1. The helical bundle structure of the CC1 domain of STIM1 of the store-activated calcium channel CRAC is crucial to maintaining the channel resting state, and helix–helix interactions can be manipulated to normalize a disease-linked STIM1 mutant."

Our objective was to examine risk of maternal pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in women with IDD compared to women without IDD in Wisconsin Medicaid, from 2007-2016.Data were from the Big Data for Little Kids project, a data linkage that creates an administrative data based cohort of mothers and children in Wisconsin. Women with ≥1 IDD claim the year before delivery were classified as having IDD. Common pregnancy complications and maternal birth outcomes were identified from the birth record. We calculated risk ratios (RR) using log-linear regression clustered by mother. We examined outcomes grouped by IDD-type and explored interaction by race.Of 177,691 women with live births, 1,032 (0.58%) had an IDD claim. Of 274,865 deliveries, 1,757 were to mothers with IDD (0.64%). Women with IDD were at greater risk for gestational diabetes (RR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6), gestational hypertension (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.5), and caesarean delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.4) compared to other women. Adjustment for demographic covariates did not change estimates. Women with intellectual disability were at highest risk of gestational hypertension. Black women with IDD were at higher risk of gestational hypertension than expected under a multiplicative model.Women with IDD have increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes in Wisconsin Medicaid. Results were robust to adjustment. Unique patterns by IDD types and Black race warrant further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3095635875,"Given the urgent need for non-invasive biomarkers of LN, we aim to identify novel urinary biomarkers that facilitate diagnosis, assessment of disease activity and prediction of treatment response in a retrospective SLE cohort. A total of 154 SLE patients and 55 healthy controls were enrolled, among whom 73 were active LN patients. We measured renal activity by renal SLEDAI. The treatment response of the active LN patients who finished 6-month induction therapy was assessed based on the American College of Rheumatology response criteria. The expression levels of 10 urinary biomarkers (UBMs): β2-MG, calbindin D, cystatin C, IL-18, KIM-1, MCP-1, nephrin, NGAL, VCAM-1, and VDBP were tested using Luminex high-throughput proteomics technology. All but urinary nephrin levels were significantly increased in active LN compared to healthy controls. uCystatinC, uMCP-1, uKIM-1 levels were significantly higher in active LN group compared to inactive LN group. Correlation analysis revealed positive correlation between uCystatinC, uKIM-1, uMCP-1, uNGAL, uVDBP and RSLEDAI score. In renal pathology, uCystatinC, uKIM-1, uVCAM-1, and uVDBP positively correlated with activity index (AI) while uVCAM-1 positively correlated with chronicity index (CI). Moreover, the combination of uVCAM-1, uCystatinC, uKIM-1 discriminated proliferative LN from membranous LN with an AUC of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.69–0.90). Most importantly, baseline uNGAL demonstrated good prediction ability to discriminate responders from non-responders in active LN patients after 6-month induction therapy. Using a multiplex bead technique, we have identified the combination of uVCAM-1, uCystatinC, uKIM-1 as a biomarker panel to reflect renal pathology and NGAL as a promising urinary biomarker to both reflect disease activity and predict treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3096087890,"Background Pregnant teenage women are prime targets of violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners, family members, and miscreants in their neighborhoods. This study estimated the prevalence of Teenage pregnancy (TP) and Physical Violence (PV) and further assessed the relationship between TP and PV in five Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Methods The study was conducted among five LIMCs (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, and Tanzania) using data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in these countries. Modified Poisson with the robust standard error was used to quantify the association between TP and PV. All analyses adjusted for the complex survey design structure (clustering, weighting, and stratification). Results The analysis involved a total of 26055 adolescent women aged 15–19 years across the five countries. The overall prevalence of TP was 25.4% (95%CI = 24.4–26.4) with the highest prevalence occurring among Malawians [29.0% (95%CI = 27.4–30.7)]. Meanwhile, the prevalence of TP among older adolescents (18–19 years) was approximately two-thirds significantly higher compared with young adolescents [aPR(95%CI) = 1.60[1.49–1.71)]. The prevalence of PV among teenagers across the five countries was 24.2% (95%CI = 22.3–26.2). The highest prevalence of PV was recorded among Nigerian adolescent women [31.8% (95%CI = 28.5–35.3)]. The prevalence of PV among adolescent women who were pregnant was approximately 5-folds significant compared to those who were not pregnant (adjusted prevalence ratio; aPR = 4.70; 95% CI: 3.86–5.73; p<0.0001). Conclusion There was a high prevalence of pregnancy among older teenagers aged 18–19 years. Close to a quarter of teenage women ever experienced physical violence. Pregnant teenage women ever experience of physical violence was very high compared to non-pregnant peers. Intervention should target PV and TP by adopting a gender-sensitive approach to eliminate physical violence, particularly among teenagers to prevent TP."
https://openalex.org/W3093764239,"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) represents a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by infantile-onset intractable seizures and unfavorable prognosis of psychomotor development. To date, hundreds of genes have been linked to the onset of DEE. GNAO1 is a DEE-associated gene encoding the alpha-O1 subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GαO). Despite the increasing number of reported children with GNAO1 encephalopathy, the molecular mechanisms underlying their neurodevelopmental phenotypes remain elusive. We herein present that co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses identified another DEE-associated protein, SPTAN1, as an interacting partner of GαO. Silencing of endogenous Gnao1 attenuated the neurite outgrowth and calcium-dependent signaling. Inactivation of GNAO1 in human-induced pluripotent stem cells gave rise to anomalous brain organoids that only weakly expressed SPTAN1 and Ankyrin-G. Furthermore, GNAO1-deficient organoids failed to conduct synchronized firing to adjacent neurons. These data indicate that GαO and other DEE-associated proteins organize the cytoskeletal remodeling and functional polarity of neurons in the developing brain."

This study determined the prevalence of C. kefyr among yeast isolates collected during 2011–2018 in Kuwait. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) and genotypic heterogeneity among C. kefyr was also studied. Methods Clinical C. kefyr isolates recovered from bloodstream and other specimens during 2011 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All C. kefyr isolates were identified by CHROMagar Candida, Vitek2 and PCR amplification of rDNA. AST was performed by Etest. Molecular basis of resistance to fluconazole and echinocandins was studied by PCR-sequencing of ERG11 and FKS1, respectively. Genotypic heterogeneity was determined with microsatellite-/minisatellite-based primers and for 27 selected isolates by PCR-sequencing of IGS1 region of rDNA. Results Among 8257 yeast strains, 69 C. kefyr (including four bloodstream) isolates were detected by phenotypic and molecular methods. Isolation from urine and respiratory samples from female and male patients was significantly different (P = 0.001). Four isolates showed reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B and one isolate to all (amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin/micafungin) antifungals tested. Fluconazole-resistant isolate contained only synonymous mutations in ERG11. Echinocandin-resistant isolate contained wild-type hotspot-1 and hotspot-2 of FKS1. Fingerprinting with microsatellite-/minisatellite-based primers identified only three types. IGS1 sequencing identified seven haplotypes among 27 selected isolates. Conclusions The overall prevalence of C. kefyr among clinical yeast isolates and among candidemia cases was recorded as 0.83% and 0.32%, respectively. The frequency of isolation of C. kefyr from bloodstream and other invasive samples was stable during the study period. The C. kefyr isolates grown from invasive (bloodstream, bronchoalveolar lavage, abdominal drain fluid, peritonial fluid and gastric fluid) samples and amphotericin B-resistant isolates were genotypically heterogeneous strains."

We assess EVs characteristics as a tool to evaluate the endothelial and anti-tumor treatment injury during adjuvant chemotherapy in breast (BC) and colon cancer (CC) patients. Blood samples were taken from 29 BC and 25 CC patients before and after chemotherapy, as well as from healthy control donors (HC). Circulating blood EVs were isolated and characterized by size/concentration, membrane antigens for cell origin, thrombogenicity, and protein content. We observed higher EVs concentration and particle size in CC patients after chemotherapy compared with HC. Higher levels of endothelial EVs (CD144-positive) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), apparently as an indication of endothelial dysfunction, were found in all cancer patients, regardless of a given treatment, compared to HC. Levels of EVs labeled CD62E, CD34+41-, the lymphocyte markers CD11+ and CD-14+, Annexin-V, and the coagulation proteins TF and TFPI, however, sometimes demonstrate significant differences between patients, although HC did not show significant differences between patients pre- and post-chemotherapy. Most importantly, increasing levels of EVs encapsulated Angiostatin were found in patients with CC, while chemotherapy treatment leads to its notable rise in circulating blood EVs. Our results demonstrate the potential of EVs encapsulated Angiostatin as a tool to evaluate endothelial damage during adjuvant chemotherapy in BC and CC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3097368728,"Background Melanoma causes the vast majority of deaths attributable to skin cancer, largely due to its propensity for metastasis. To date, few studies have examined molecular changes between primary cutaneous melanoma and adjacent putatively normal skin. To broaden temporal inferences related to initiation of disease, we performed a metabolomics investigation of primary melanoma and matched extratumoral microenvironment (EM) tissues; and, to make inferences about progressive disease, we also compared unmatched metastatic melanoma tissues to EM tissues. Methods Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling was performed on frozen human tissues. Results We observed 824 metabolites as differentially abundant among 33 matched tissue samples, and 1,118 metabolites as differentially abundant between metastatic melanoma (n = 46) and EM (n = 34) after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (p<0.01). No significant differences in metabolite abundances were noted comparing primary and metastatic melanoma tissues. Conclusions Overall, pathway-based results significantly distinguished melanoma tissues from EM in the metabolism of: ascorbate and aldarate, propanoate, tryptophan, histidine, and pyrimidine. Within pathways, the majority of individual metabolite abundances observed in comparisons of primary melanoma vs. EM and metastatic melanoma vs. EM were directionally consistent. This observed concordance suggests most identified compounds are implicated in the initiation or maintenance of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3097487210,"Background The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MagicTouch™ sirolimus-coated balloon (SCB) catheter (Concept Medical Inc., Tampa, FL, US) on improving the patency of failing arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) with de novo and recurrent stenoses. MATILDA reports early outcomes at 3- and 6 months post intervention. Methods Single-centre, single-arm prospective pilot study of 33 (18 males; mean age 64.7±11.6 years) end-stage renal failure Asian patients with a dysfunctional AVF, who underwent SCB angioplasty between May 2019-January 2020. All procedures were performed under local anaesthetic without sedation and as day surgery. All patients were prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 months and followed up with Duplex ultrasound at 3 and 6 months. Results 47 stenotic target lesions treated and 24/33 (72.7%) patients were for restenosis. Main indications for intervention was low/dropping access flow (21/33; 63.6%) and most common target lesion was in the juxta-anastomosis (19/47; 40.4%). There was 100% technical and procedural success. There were no peri-procedural complications related to the SCB. The target lesion primary patency rates at 3 and 6 months were 46/47 (97.9%) and 29/35 (82.9%) respectively. Circuit access patency rates at 3 and 6 months were 31/33 (93.9%) and 17/25 (68%) respectively. There was one (2.9%) death at 6 months and 4/33 (12.1%) overall to date, all from patients’ underlying co-morbidities. Conclusions SCB angioplasty for dysfunctional AVF circuits is a safe and efficacious modality in Asian haemodialysis patients at six months comparable if not better than the paclitaxel data reported to date in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3097805994,"Background Immune activities of monocytes (MOs) can be altered within the microenvironment of solid malignancies, including breast cancer. Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride, MET), has been shown to decrease tumor cell proliferation, but its effects have yet to be explored with respect to MOs (monocytes) activity during their crosstalk with breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated the effects of MET on overall phenotypic functional activities, including cellular immunometabolism and protective redox signaling based-biomarkers, intracellular free calcium ions (ifCa2+), phagocytosis and co-operative cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-10) of autologous MOs before and during their interplay with primary ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast cancer cells. Methods Human primary breast cancer cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured with autologous MOs before treatment with MET. Results MET downregulated breast cancer cell proliferation and phagocytosis, while having no significant effect on the ratio of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) to total Akt. Additionally, we observed that, in the absence of MET treatment, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-based cytotoxicity, catalase, ifCa2+, IL-10 and arginase activity were significantly reduced in co-cultures compared to levels in MOs cultured alone whereas levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity were significantly increased. In contrast, MET treatment reduced the effects measured in co-culture on the levels of LDH-based cytotoxicity, arginase activity, catalase, ifCa2+, and IFN-γ. MET also induced upregulation of both iNOS and arginase in MO cells, although the increase did not reach significant difference for iNOS activity. Moreover, MET induced a robust increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in MOs, but not in MOs co-cultured with breast cancer cells. Furthermore, MET markedly upregulated the levels of IFN-γ production and downregulated those of IL-10 in isolated MOs, while inducing a slight opposing up-regulation of IL-10 production in co-cultures. Conclusions Our results show that the biomarkers of phenotypic functional activities of MOs are modified after co-culturing with primary human breast cancer cells. Treatment of co-cultures with MET resulted in increased release of antitumor cytokine IFN-γ and ifCa2+, and increased cell necrosis during breast cancer cells-MOs crosstalk."
https://openalex.org/W3097774002,"Satellite DNA (satDNA) is one of the major fractions of the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Highly variable satDNA is involved in various genome functions, and a clear link between satellites and phenotypes exists in a wide range of organisms. However, little is known about the origin and temporal dynamics of satDNA. The “library hypothesis” indicates that the rapid evolutionary changes experienced by satDNAs are mostly quantitative. Although this hypothesis has received some confirmation, a number of its aspects are still controversial. A recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) method allows the determination of the satDNA landscape and could shed light on unresolved issues. Here, we explore low-coverage NGS data to infer satDNA evolution in the phylogenetic context of the diploid species of the Chenopodium album aggregate. The application of the Illumina read assembly algorithm in combination with Oxford Nanopore sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization allowed the estimation of eight satDNA families within the studied group, six of which were newly described. The obtained set of satDNA families of different origins can be divided into several categories, namely group-specific, lineage-specific and species-specific. In the process of evolution, satDNA families can be transmitted vertically and can be eliminated over time. Moreover, transposable element-derived satDNA families may appear repeatedly in the satellitome, creating an illusion of family conservation. Thus, the obtained data refute the “library hypothesis”, rather than confirming it, and in our opinion, it is more appropriate to speak about “the library of the mechanisms of origin”."
https://openalex.org/W3095476395,"Americans on the political left and right are engaged in a Culture War with one another, one that is often characterized by mutual fear, antipathy, and avoidance. Are there safe havens from the socially straining effects of this Culture War, times and places where Americans of different political stripes gather and put aside their political differences? Previous research (Chen & Rohla, 2018) implied that there might not be insofar as even intimate family gatherings seem to be subject to Culture War tensions. They found that politically diverse Thanksgiving Dinners were 35-70 minutes shorter than politically uniform ones, representing a 14-27% reduction in overall dinner duration. Noting analytical and methodological limitations in the prior analysis, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test whether diverse dinners are shorter than uniform ones and to attempt to conceptually replicate and extend this prior analysis. Individual analyses yielded mixed results, with null models generally supported but effect estimates generally overlapping with those of Chen and Rohla (2018). A mega-analysis found that, when controlling for various covariates, politically diverse dinners were 24 minutes shorter than politically uniform ones, 95% confidence interval = [9, 39], representing a 6% decrease in the total dinner time [2%-10%]. This final result successfully replicates Chen and Rohla (2018) both in terms of effect overlap and direct-and-significance criteria while nonetheless favoring the conclusion that politics is not straining family ties as much as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3096654623,"Introduction Nurses play a significant role in ensuring the safety and quality of drugs. Our aim was to assess significant factors in nurses’ participation in ensuring pharmacotherapy safety by reporting adverse drug reactions (ADR) and detecting substandard drugs (SD). Materials and methods The study was a cross-sectional, comparative survey, using original questionnaires. Survey questions were grouped to probe the opinions, attitudes and practices of nurses reporting ADRs and SDs. Data were obtained from nurses working in teaching hospitals in Poland (group A) and, for comparison, in the USA (group B). 1200 questionnaires were distributed in Poland (return rate: 55.7%) and 200 questionnaires in the USA (return rate: 73%). Both groups were surveyed during the same period. There were no exclusion criteria. The questionnaires were self-administered. Distribution and collection were anonymous. Participation was voluntary. The Spearman correlation test was used. Both groups’ responses were cross-tabulated and compared using Fisher’s Exact Test for Count Data. Results The study group comprised 669 Polish and 146 American professionally active nurses working in general care and surgical departments. Age range: 18 to 72 years. Median job seniority: 18.3 years (group A) and 20.6 years (group B). Education levels varied. ADR reporting conditions in Poland are unfavorable: shortage of time—83.9% vs 22.6% in the US (p = 0.01); no incentive—58.2% vs 6.1% in the US (p = 0.01); and no equipment—44.7% vs 2.8% in the US (p < 0.01). Both Polish and American nurses indicate they rarely report SDs, with rates of 0.4% and 11% (p < 0.0001) respectively, during the study period. Conclusions Nurses in Poland are insufficiently prepared to ensure drug safety conscientiously and responsibly. Training is required for Polish nurses. Nurses’ employers need to improve conditions to enable reporting of ADRs and SDs."
https://openalex.org/W3097281069,"Introduction Balance is key to controlling body posture. Balance is typically assessed by measures of the body’s vertical orientation, obtained by balancing out the forces acting on different body segments. The ability to maintain balance is assessed by evaluating centre of pressure (CoP) displacement; such assessments are typically used to evaluate responses to a treatment process. Purpose of study This study evaluated the efficiency of compensatory reactions in children according to the extent of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Materials and method The study enrolled 312 children aged 8‒12 years, including 211 patients with postural disorders: thoracic kyphosis outside the 47‒50-degree range and lordosis outside the 38‒42-degree range (study group). A control group was also recruited and comprised 101 children without postural disorders. The DIERS formetric 4D system was used to assess posture and CoP displacement. Results Children in the study group showed a significantly greater range of CoP displacement than children in the control group. The kyphosis angle correlated with the maximum CoP displacement in the coronal plane and the maximum CoP displacement in the sagittal plane during gait. The kyphosis angle also correlated with the maximum CoP displacement back in the static test. The size of the lordosis angle correlated with the maximum displacement of CoP in the coronary plane during gait, and with the maximum displacement of CoP toward the left, forward, and backward in the static test. The correlation coefficient of the lordosis angle with displacement of the CoP in the sagittal plane was 0.999. Conclusions We found an association between kyphosis and lordosis and the amplitude of CoP displacement, which may reflect the postural control system’s response to biomechanical destabilisation caused by changes in kyphosis and lordosis. The lordosis angle correlation strength for displacement of CoP in sagittal plane is 0.999 and adopts a linear value."
https://openalex.org/W3096038664,"Introduction Congenital hyperinsulinism is characterized by abnormal regulation of insulin secretion from the pancreas causing profound hypoketotic hypoglycemia and is the leading cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. The main objective of this study is to highlight the different mechanisms to interpret the 18F-DOPA PET scans and how this can influence outcomes. Materials and methods After 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA was injected intravenously into 50 subjects’ arm at a dose of 2.96–5.92 MBq/kg, three to four single-bed position PET scans were acquired at 20, 30, 40 and 50-minute post injection. The radiologist interpreted the scans for focal and diffuse hyperinsulinism using a visual interpretation method, as well as determining the Standard Uptake Value ratios with varying cut-offs. Results Visual interpretation had the combination of the best sensitivity and positive prediction values. Conclusions In patients with focal disease, SUV ratios are not as accurate in identifying the focal lesion as visual inspection, and cases of focal disease may be missed by those relying on SUV ratios, thereby denying the patients a chance of cure. We recommend treating patients with diazoxide-resistant hyperinsulinism in centers with dedicated multidisciplinary team comprising of at least a pediatric endocrinologist with a special interest in hyperinsulinism, a radiologist experienced in interpretation of 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA PET/CT scans, a histopathologist with experience in frozen section analysis of the pancreas and a pancreatic surgeon experienced in partial pancreatectomies in patients with hyperinsulinism."
https://openalex.org/W3096280583,"Introduction People with disabilities face socioeconomic disadvantages and they have limited access to sexual and reproductive health information. They are highly vulnerable to sexual abuse which places them at increased risk of HIV and STI infection. At present, however, little is known about the knowledge, attitude and practice of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS and other STIs in Ethiopia. This study aimed to identify which individual factors best predict knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to HIV/AIDS and other STIs among people with disabilities in North-shewa zone, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to October 2019. A total of 397 respondents were interviewed using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select the respondents. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the data. A significant association was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Nearly half of the study participants were knowledgeable in relation to HIV/AIDS (47.3%) and STIs (46.9%). Sixty-two percent of respondents had good attitude towards evidence of HIV/AIDS while sixty-nine percent of participants had good attitude towards helpful facts of STIs. Twenty-three percent of study participants had been ever tested for HIV infections. Being married (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.92, 10.72) was associated with having good knowledge of STI. Males were 1.6 times more knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS than females (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.21, 9.12). Conclusions In this study, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of people with disabilities in relation to HIV/AIDS and other STIs were relatively low. This is clear evidence that HIV programs need to ensure that people with disabilities can access basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS and STIs."

The results show that 19 SNPs combined with academic qualifications have the best discrimination effect. In the GS-SVM, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is 0.87, the AUC of CNN-LSTM is 0.88, and the performance of the CNN model is the best, with an AUC of 0.92.

https://openalex.org/W3097213660,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Though NAFLD may progress to end-stage liver disease, the top cause of mortality in NAFLD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the data on liver-related mortality in NAFLD derives from specialist liver centres. It is not clear if the higher reported mortality rates in individuals with non-cirrhotic NAFLD are entirely accounted for by complications of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Therefore, we aimed to describe the CVD burden and mortality in NAFLD when adjusting for metabolic risk factors using a 'real world' cohort. We performed a retrospective study of patients followed-up after an admission to non-specialist hospitals with a NAFLD-spectrum diagnosis. Non-cirrhotic NAFLD and NAFLD-cirrhosis patients were defined by ICD-10 codes. Cases were age-/sex-matched with non-NAFLD hospitalised patients. All-cause mortality over 14-years follow-up after discharge was compared between groups using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics, CVD, and metabolic syndrome components. We identified 1,802 patients with NAFLD-diagnoses: 1,091 with non-cirrhotic NAFLD and 711 with NAFLD-cirrhosis, matched to 24,737 controls. There was an increasing burden of CVD with progression of NAFLD: for congestive heart failure 3.5% control, 4.2% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, 6.6% NAFLD-cirrhosis; and for atrial fibrillation 4.7% control, 5.9% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, 12.1% NAFLD-cirrhosis. Over 14-years follow-up, crude mortality rates were 14.7% control, 13.7% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, and 40.5% NAFLD-cirrhosis. However, after adjusting for demographics, non-cirrhotic NAFLD (HR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5)) as well as NAFLD-cirrhosis (HR 3.7 (95% CI 3.0-4.5)) patients had higher mortality compared to controls. These differences remained after adjusting for CVD and metabolic syndrome components: non-cirrhotic NAFLD (HR 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4)) and NAFLD-cirrhosis (HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.8-4.2)). In conclusion, from a large non-specialist registry of hospitalised patients, those with non-cirrhotic NAFLD had increased overall mortality compared to controls even after adjusting for CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3097601652,"It is now widely agreed that a positive affective state is a crucial component of animal well-being. The judgment bias test represents a widespread tool used to assess animals’ optimistic/pessimistic attitude and to evaluate their emotional state and welfare. Judgment bias tests have been used several times with dogs (Canis familiaris), in most cases using a spatial test with a bowl placed in ambiguous positions located between a relatively positive trained location (P) which contains a baited bowl and a relatively negative trained location (N) which contains an empty bowl. The latency to approach the bowl in the ambiguous locations is an indicator of the dog’s expectation of a positive/negative outcome. However, results from such tests are often inconclusive. For the present study, the judgment bias test performance of 51 shelter dogs and 40 pet dogs was thoroughly analysed. A pattern emerged with shelter dogs behaving in a more pessimistic-like way than pet dogs. However, this difference between the two populations was detected only when analysing the raw latencies to reach the locations and not the more commonly applied adjusted score (i.e. average latency values). Furthermore, several methodological caveats were found. First of all, a non-negligible percentage of dogs did not pass the training phase, possibly due to the experimental paradigm not being fully suited for this species. Second, results showed a high intra-dog variability in response to the trained locations, i.e. the dogs’ responses were not consistent throughout the test, suggesting that animals may not have fully learned the association between locations and their outcomes. Third, dogs did not always behave differently towards adjacent locations, raising doubts about the animals’ ability to discriminate between locations. Finally, a potential influence of the researcher’s presence on dogs’ performance emerged from analyses. The implications of these findings and potential solutions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3094845307,"Boosting energy expenditure by harnessing the activity of brown adipocytes is a promising strategy for combatting the global epidemic of obesity. Many studies have revealed that the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist is a potent activator of brown adipocytes, even in humans, and PKA and p38 MAPK have been demonstrated for regulating the transcription of a wide range of critical genes such as Ucp1. We previously revealed that the PKA-ASK1-p38 axis is activated in immature brown adipocytes and contributes to functional maturation. However, the downstream mechanisms of PKA that initiate the p38 MAPK cascade are still mostly unknown in mature brown adipocytes. Here, we identified the ASK family as a crucial signaling molecule bridging PKA and MAPK in mature brown adipocytes. Mechanistically, the phosphorylation of ASK1 at threonine 99 and serine 993 is critical in PKA-dependent ASK1 activation. Additionally, PKA also activates ASK2, which contributes to MAPK regulation. These lines of evidence provide new details for tailoring a βAR-dependent brown adipocyte activation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3096160232,"Introduction Aerobic capacity is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Whether aerobic capacity influences myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury is unknown. Purpose To investigate the impact of intrinsic differences in aerobic capacity and the cardioprotective potential on IR injury. Methods We studied hearts from rats developed by selective breeding for high (HCR) or low (LCR) capacity for treadmill running. The rats were randomized to: (1) control, (2) local ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or (3) remote ischemic preconditioning (RIC) followed by 30 minutes of ischemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion in an isolated perfused heart model. The primary endpoint was infarct size. Secondary endpoints included uptake of labelled glucose, content of selected mitochondrial proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Results At baseline, running distance was 203±7 m in LCR vs 1905±51 m in HCR rats (p<0.01). Infarct size was significantly lower in LCR than in HCR controls (49±5% vs 68±5%, p = 0.04). IPC reduced infarct size by 47% in LCR (p<0.01) and by 31% in HCR rats (p = 0.01). RIC did not modulate infarct size (LCR: 52±5, p>0.99; HCR: 69±6%, p>0.99, respectively). Phosphorylaion of AMPK did not differ between LCR and HCR controls. IPC did not modulate cardiac phosphorylation of AMPK. Glucose uptake during reperfusion was similar in LCR and HCR rats. IPC increased glucose uptake during reperfusion in LCR animals (p = 0.02). Mitochondrial protein content in skeletal muscle was lower in LCR than in HCR (0.77±0.10 arbitrary units (AU) vs 1.09±0.07 AU, p = 0.02), but not in cardiac muscle. Conclusion Aerobic capacity is associated with altered myocardial sensitivity to IR injury, but the cardioprotective effect of IPC is not. Glucose uptake, AMPK activation immediately prior to ischemia and basal mitochondrial protein content in the heart seem to be of minor importance as underlying mechanisms for the cardioprotective effects."
https://openalex.org/W3095843514,"The development of a complex organ involves the specification and differentiation of diverse cell types constituting that organ. Two major cell subtypes, contractile cardial cells (CCs) and nephrocytic pericardial cells (PCs), comprise the Drosophila heart. Binding sites for Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], an integral transcription factor in the Notch signaling pathway, are enriched in the enhancers of PC-specific genes. Here we show three distinct mechanisms regulating the expression of two different PC-specific genes, Holes in muscle (Him), and Zn finger homeodomain 1 (zfh1). Him transcription is activated in PCs in a permissive manner by Notch signaling: in the absence of Notch signaling, Su(H) forms a repressor complex with co-repressors and binds to the Him enhancer, repressing its transcription; upon alleviation of this repression by Notch signaling, Him transcription is activated. In contrast, zfh1 is transcribed by a Notch-instructive mechanism in most PCs, where mere alleviation of repression by preventing the binding of Su(H)-co-repressor complex is not sufficient to activate transcription. Our results suggest that upon activation of Notch signaling, the Notch intracellular domain associates with Su(H) to form an activator complex that binds to the zfh1 enhancer, and that this activator complex is necessary for bringing about zfh1 transcription in these PCs. Finally, a third, Notch-independent mechanism activates zfh1 transcription in the remaining, even skipped-expressing, PCs. Collectively, our data show how the same feature, enrichment of Su(H) binding sites in PC-specific gene enhancers, is utilized by two very distinct mechanisms, one permissive, the other instructive, to contribute to the same overall goal: the specification and differentiation of a cardiac cell subtype by activation of the pericardial gene program. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the zfh1 enhancer drives expression in two different domains using distinct Notch-instructive and Notch-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3096994466,"Background Immune system suppression during critical care contributes to the risk of acquired bacterial infections with Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa. Repeated exposure to endotoxin can attenuate systemic inflammatory cytokine responses. Mechanical ventilation affects the systemic inflammatory response to various stimuli. Aim To study the effect of pre-exposure to mechanical ventilation with and without endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation on P. aeruginosa growth and wet-to-dry weight measurements on lung tissue and plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins 6 and 10. Methods Two groups of pigs were exposed to mechanical ventilation for 24 hours before bacterial inoculation and six h of experimental pneumonia (total experimental time 30 h): A30h+Etx (n = 6, endotoxin 0.063 μg x kg-1 x h-1) and B30h (n = 6, saline). A third group, C6h (n = 8), started the experiment at the bacterial inoculation unexposed to endotoxin or mechanical ventilation (total experimental time 6 h). Bacterial inoculation was performed by tracheal instillation of 1x1011 colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa. Bacterial cultures and wet-to-dry weight ratio analyses were done on lung tissue samples postmortem. Separate group comparisons were done between A30h+Etx vs.B30h (Inflammation) and B30h vs. C6h (Ventilation Time) during the bacterial phase of 6 h. Results P. aeruginosa growth was highest in A30h+Etx, and lowest in C6h (Inflammation and Ventilation Time both p<0.05). Lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were highest in A30h+Etx and lowest in B30h (Inflammation p<0.01, Ventilation Time p<0.05). C6h had the highest TNF-α levels in plasma (Ventilation Time p<0.01). No differences in bronchoalveolar lavage variables between the groups were observed. Conclusions Mechanical ventilation and systemic inflammation before the onset of pneumonia increase the growth of P. aeruginosa in lung tissue. The attenuated growth of P. aeruginosa in the non-pre-exposed animals (C6h) was associated with a higher systemic TNF-α production elicited from the bacterial challenge."

Pheromone-based luring agents are used currently in controlling bark beetle. Antennae are the primary insect organs sensing volatiles of host trees and pheromones of pioneer males. We studied the external morphology of antennae and the type, distribution, and the number of the beetle sensilla. Our results show E. parallelus have a geniculate antenna composed of 6 segments, namely the scape, 4-segmented funicle and club. Ninety-seven percent of the antennal sensors were distributed in the club, and 3% were distributed in the scape and funicle. 6 types of sensilla on the antennae were found, including sensilla trichodea (subtypes: STI, STII and STIII), sensilla basiconica (subtypes: SBI, SBII, SBIII and SBIV), sensilla chaetica (subtypes: SChI, SChII and SChIII), as well as sensilla coeloconica, sensilla campaniform and sensilla furcatea. There was no significant difference in the type, distribution and number of sensilla in males and females. No significant difference in the shape and distribution of antennae was found between sexes, but the length of antennae and the number of SChI, SChII, STI, SBI, SBIII and SBIV were significantly larger in females than males. We revealed the external cuticular structure of the antennae in E. parallelus, which can be used to guide future electrophysiological investigations to understand the ability of this beetle to detect semiochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W3095221228,"African weakly electric fish of the mormyrid genus Campylomormyrus generate pulse-type electric organ discharges (EODs) for orientation and communication. Their pulse durations are species-specific and elongated EODs are a derived trait. So far, differential gene expression among tissue-specific transcriptomes across species with different pulses and point mutations in single ion channel genes indicate a relation of pulse duration and electrocyte geometry/excitability. However, a comprehensive assessment of expressed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the entire transcriptome of African weakly electric fish, with the potential to identify further genes influencing EOD duration, is still lacking. This is of particular value, as discharge duration is likely based on multiple cellular mechanisms and various genes. Here we provide the first transcriptome-wide SNP analysis of African weakly electric fish species (genus Campylomormyrus) differing by EOD duration to identify candidate genes and cellular mechanisms potentially involved in the determination of an elongated discharge of C. tshokwe. Non-synonymous substitutions specific to C. tshokwe were found in 27 candidate genes with inferred positive selection among Campylomormyrus species. These candidate genes had mainly functions linked to transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Further, by comparing gene annotations between C. compressirostris (ancestral short EOD) and C. tshokwe (derived elongated EOD), we identified 27 GO terms and 2 KEGG pathway categories for which C. tshokwe significantly more frequently exhibited a species-specific expressed substitution than C. compressirostris. The results indicate that transcriptional regulation as well cell proliferation and differentiation take part in the determination of elongated pulse durations in C. tshokwe. Those cellular processes are pivotal for tissue morphogenesis and might determine the shape of electric organs supporting the observed correlation between electrocyte geometry/tissue structure and discharge duration. The inferred expressed SNPs and their functional implications are a valuable resource for future investigations on EOD durations."
https://openalex.org/W3097360571,"We aimed to estimate the rate of germline mutations in the offspring of individuals accidentally exposed to Cesium-137 ionizing radiation. The study included two distinct groups: one of cases, consisting of males and females accidentally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation of Cs137, and a control group of non-exposed participants. The cases included 37 people representing 11 families and 15 children conceived after the accident. Exposed families incurred radiation absorbed doses in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 Gray. The control group included 15 families and 15 children also conceived after 1987 in Goiânia with no history of radiation exposure. DNA samples from peripheral blood were analyzed with the Affymetrix GeneChip® CytoScanHD™ to estimate point mutations in autosomal SNPs. A set of scripts previously developed was used to detect de novo mutations by comparing parent and offspring genotypes at the level of each SNP marker. Overall numbers of observed Mendelian deviations were statistically significant between the exposed and control groups. Our retrospective transgenerational DNA analysis showed a 44.0% increase in the burden of SNP mutations in the offspring of cases when compared to controls, based on the average of MFMD for the two groups. Parent-of-origin and type of nucleotide substitution were also inferred. This proved useful in a retrospective estimation of the rate of de novo germline mutations in a human population accidentally exposed to low doses of radiation from Cesium-137. Our results suggested that observed burden of germline mutations identified in offspring was a potentially useful biomarker of effect to estimate parental exposure to low doses of IR and could become an important marker suitable for biomonitoring human population exposed to environmental mutagens."
https://openalex.org/W3097474722,"Introduction In Switzerland, a nationwide Swiss Diagnosis related Groups (Swiss DRG) system for hospital reimbursement was introduced in 2012. However, the impact of DRG systems on primary care is still unclear with respect to number of consultations and costs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the implementation of DRG on costs and volumes in the primary care sector, on a nationwide basis in Switzerland. Methods The study retrospectively analysed yearly data, from 2008 to 2014, of almost 60 Swiss health insurers that covered almost all Swiss general practitioners, with a total number of patients which represented approximately 76% of the Swiss population. GP consultations, total numbers and rates, and the relative costs reimbursed (TARMED tariff values) in the Swiss federal states, cantons, which already introduced a DRG-like system before 2012 (AP-DRG), were compared to the GP consultations and costs reimbursed in the other cantons (DRG-naive). Regression discontinuity design analysis and mixed regression models, at cantonal level, were performed to evaluate the effect of the nationwide implementation of the Swiss DRG on health care demand and costs in the primary care setting. Change in outcome level and yearly trend pattern difference between groups (AP-DRG vs. DRG-naive) were examined. Results Overall, the total number of GP consultations and the relative TARMED values increased from 2008 to 2014. In the DRG naive, 15 cantons: in 2008, the number of GP consultations were 13,114,126, with a TARMED value of 1,194,957,157 CHF, and in 2014, the GP consultation were 13,752,511, with a TARMED value of 1,513,861,260 CHF. In the AP-DRG group, 11 cantons, the total number of GP consultations increased from 8,787,646, in 2008, to 9,347,168 in 2014 and the TARMED value increased from 896,673,657 CHF in 2008, to 1,100,203,508 CHF in 2014. The yearly trend pattern of GP consultations and TARMED values, in the AP-DRG group, were not significantly different from the respective trends in the DRG- naive and, overall, no significant change was detected in consultations and costs trends before and after 2012. Discussion/Conclusion This study found no evidence of any effect of the introduction of the SwissDRG on the yearly trend of primary care consultations and costs. Nevertheless, potential negative impacts on vulnerable patients, as chronically ill patients, could not be excluded and further investigation is required."
https://openalex.org/W3093662594,"The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), a nonprofit federation of 29 research societies representing 130 000 scientists, hosts an annual Science Research Conferences (SRC) series. These conferences allow scientists to meet in a relaxing, collegial atmosphere, and explore new approaches to current research areas. This year, the Conference on Nutrient Sensing and Metabolic Signaling was held on August 10-11. The meeting was held virtually, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference featured a mixture of live and prerecorded videos, as well as virtual roundtable discussions sessions, a poster hall, and a question-and-answer platform. The conference aimed to present and discuss the most current work on the fundamental aspects of nutrient sensing and signal transduction events in the modulation of health and disease, bring together physician-scientists and research scientists in diverse research fields to promote interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration, and encourage the attendance and participation of new and young scientists such as junior faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. During the 2 days, 25 senior and young investigators served as invited speakers, and 47 posters were presented. Dr. Laurie Goodyear (Harvard Medical School and Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA), an international expert in exercise and metabolic signaling, delivered the keynote address on how maternal exercise and diet alter offspring metabolic health, followed by four sessions that broadly addressed current issues related to the role of nutrients as signaling molecules in metabolic control, health, and disease. There were 224 participants, including 46 postdoctoral fellows and 53 students, from 15 countries, who virtually attended the conference. This was the 9th conference and 26th anniversary of this series, all of which have been sponsored by FASEB. The basis for the first meeting in this series in 1994 was the then-novel concept that nutrients, including amino acids and carbohydrates, could act as signaling molecules to modulate metabolism and cellular function. Since that time, the area of nutrients as signaling molecules has blossomed, and new developments in the field have generated additional widespread interest. The Nutrient Sensing and Metabolic Signaling Conference was organized by Scot R. Kimball (Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA) and Teresa Ann Davis (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA). Dr. Laurie Goodyear, a world leader in exercise and metabolic signaling in skeletal muscle, delivered the keynote address, setting the tone of the conference. Her elegant lecture detailed her studies using mouse models which demonstrate that maternal exercise improves the metabolic health of the offspring, and she discussed the mechanisms and epigenetic regulation involved. Dr. Goodyear's presentation concluded with the identification of a novel protein that improves offspring health. The first session of the conference addressed metabolic signaling and was chaired by Dr. Timothy Osborne (Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA). The session featured a discussion by Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University, Durham, NC, USA) on multiomic strategies for defining cardiometabolic disease mechanism with a focus on the relationship between branched-chain amino acids and metabolic disease. Data presented suggest that branched-chain amino acids and/or branched-chain keto acids play a causal role in metabolic disease as well as serving as the biomarkers of dysregulation of lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Subsequent talks in the session focused on lipid metabolism and included lectures by Dr. Barbara Kahn (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA) on the mechanistic pathways mediating the antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory actions of branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, Dr. Nada Abumrad (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA) on fatty acid sensing and fatty acid uptake, Dr. Rebeca Haeusler (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA) on the bile acid regulation of metal homeostasis, and Dr. Peter Crawford (University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA) on the multidimensional roles of ketone bodies in fuel metabolism, signaling, and therapeutics. A live question-and-answer session was held after the talks with ample audience participation. Attendees had the opportunity to hear from experts in government, industry, and academics who provided insight into different career choices during a “Meet the Experts” panel session. The session, led by Dr. Timothy Osborne, featured Dr. John Blenis (Professor of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA), Dr. Christopher Lynch, (Chief, Nutrition Research Branch, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), and Dr. Suzette Pereira (Senior Associate Research Fellow, Abbott Nutrition, Chicago, IL, USA). The second session was chaired by Sue Bodine (University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA) and focused on the Interaction of Nutrient and Exercise Sensing Pathways. This engaging session began with a talk by Dr. Gregory Cartee (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) focusing on the role of exercise and diet on insulin signaling and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. He provided evidence that AS160 activation is involved in the exercise-induced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and that the response is influenced by the diet and exhibits fiber-type specificity. Dr. Sean Adams (Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center and The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA) spoke on how exercise affects blood and muscle metabolomics patterns and gut-derived xenometabolites, Dr. Lauren Sparks (Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes, Orlando, FL, USA) discussed molecular profiling of exercise responses in blood, muscle, and adipose tissues in obesity and diabetes, Dr. Kristin Stanford (The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA) provided evidence of a novel role for brown adipose tissue to improve cardiac function, and Dr. Sree Chintapalli (Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center and The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) spoke of the novel metabolic functions of myoglobin. The end of the first day featured the Poster Hall on the virtual platform, where participants engaged in live chats with the authors and other attendees. The second and final day of the virtual conference began with a session on Amino Acid Signaling, chaired by Dr. Tracy Anthony (Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Dr. Brendan Manning (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health) gave a live talk on how mTORC1 connects growth signals to anabolic processes underlying cell growth. He presented exciting findings that the mTORC1-mediated activation of ATF4 contributes to enhanced protein, nucleotide, and glutathione synthesis and that the hepatic anabolic program downstream of mTORC1 affects liver and plasma macromolecules. Dr. John Blenis (Weill Cornell Medicine) discussed aging-associated metabolic signaling and cancer progression, Dr. Ron Wek (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA) spoke on nutrient signaling and the integrated stress response, Dr. Stefan Broer (Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia) provided a unified model of amino acid homeostasis in mammalian cells, Dr. Adam Rose (Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) provided evidence that the restriction of essential amino acids dictates the systemic metabolic response to dietary protein dilution, and Dr. Dudley Lamming (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA) spoke on the regulation of metabolic health by specific dietary macronutrients. Dr. Anthony concluded the session with a stimulating talk on amino acid control of protein homeostasis and her studies on the molecular sensing of amino acid insufficiency and the coordination of signal transduction to maintain proteostasis control. Participants had the opportunity to participate in a Career Development session with Dr. Teresa Davis (Editor-in-Chief, The Journal of Nutrition), Dr. Sue Bodine (Editor-in-Chief, The Journal of Applied Physiology), and Dr. Scot Kimball (Editorial Board Member of the American Journal of Physiology–Endocrinology and Metabolism and The Journal of Nutrition). This session provided insights into journal publishing, including manuscript preparation, journal selection, and the submission process. The final session of the conference was centered on the important topic of Nutrient Signaling Across the Life Cycle and was chaired by Dr. Blake Rasmussen (UTMB Health, Galveston, TX, USA). Lectures focusing on perinatal nutrient signaling were presented by Dr. Rebecca Simmons (University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Philadelphia, PA, USA), who discussed the effects of growth restriction and oxidative stress in the developmental programming of type 2 diabetes, and Dr. Laura Brown (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA) who detailed her studies examining the effect of intrauterine growth restriction on nutrient signaling in a fetal sheep model. Dr. Elena Volpi (UTMB Sealy Center on Aging, Galveston, TX, USA) set the stage for lectures on nutrient signaling and aging with her overview of age-related changes in protein turnover, and the interaction of amino acids, insulin, and exercise in regulating protein synthesis in the elderly. Dr. Christopher Adams (University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine) discussed the role of ATF4 in muscle atrophy in aging, and Dr. Anna Thalackler-Mercer (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) presented recent work using muscle stem cells to investigate the interaction of aging and diet on muscle regeneration. Dr. Stuart Phillips (McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada) rounded out the session in his presentation of anabolic signaling in muscle and the interaction of amino acids and resistance exercise in the regulation of protein synthesis. A second poster session was held and attendees were encouraged to participate in live chats with the authors. Dr. Teresa Davis closed the meeting by thanking all attendees, speakers, and sponsors for participating in this virtual meeting and announced the Poster Session awardees. Student Poster awards were presented to Alessandra Esposito (Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, Naples, Italy) for a poster titled A Substrate-Specific mTORC1 Pathway Modulates TFEB Activity, Nicholas Lesner (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA) for a poster titled Alpha-Ketobutyrate Links Amino Acid Metabolism and Respiratory Activity in Mitochondrial Dysfunction, and Hala Haddad (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA) for a poster on The Role of Opsin 3 in Metabolism and Melanocortin Receptor-Mediated cAMP Signaling. Postdoctoral Fellow Poster awards were given to Dr. Daniel Levin (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA) for a poster on NAD(H) Redox State Reprograms Transcription During Caloric Restriction, Dr. Paul Roberson (Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA) for a poster on Glucose-Induced mTORC1 Activation Occurs in a Sestrin-Dependent Manner, and Dr. Haejin Yoon (Harvard Medical School) for a poster on PHD3 Promotes Exercise Capacity and Fat Oxidation in Skeletal Muscle.

https://openalex.org/W3095054480,"Nutrition in pregnancy and early childhood affects later blood pressure and precursors of atherosclerosis, but its influence on arterial stiffness is unexplored. This study determines whether exposure to improved nutrition during early life influences Augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in mid-adulthood. We included 1221 adults (37-54y) who participated in a cluster-randomized nutritional supplementation trial of a protein-energy beverage (Atole), conducted between 1969–1977 in Guatemala. The comparison group received Fresco, a low-calorie protein-free beverage. In 2015–17, we measured anthropometry (weight, height, and waist-to-height ratio); AI and PWV (using carotid—femoral tonometry); blood pressure; fasting plasma glucose and serum lipids; and sociodemographic characteristics. Based on patterns of exposure, we characterized participants as fully, partially or unexposed to the intervention from conception to their second birthday (the ‘first 1000 days’). We fit pooled and sex-specific models using intention-to-treat, difference-in-difference regression analysis to test whether exposure to the supplement in the first 1000 days was associated with AI and PWV in adulthood adjusting for basal and current sociodemographic variables and current life-style and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Prevalence of obesity in men and women was 39.6% and 19.6%, and prevalence of hypertension was 44.0% and 36.0%, respectively. Women had higher AI (34.4±9.6%) compared to men (23.0± 9.8%), but had similar PWV (7.60±1.13 m/s and 7.60±1.31, respectively). AI did not differ significantly across intervention groups. PWV was lower in individuals with full exposure to the supplement during the first 1000 days (-0.39m/s, 95% CI -0.87, 0.09; p = 0.1) compared to unexposed individuals. This difference was similar after adjusting for cardio-metabolic risk factors (-0.45m/s; 95%C-0.93, 0.01; p = 0.06). Exposure to improved nutrition during the first 1000 days was marginally associated with lower PWV, but not with AI."
