https://openalex.org/W2974854470,"Assessments of the global carbon (C) cycle typically rely on simplified models which consider large areas as homogeneous in terms of the response of soils to land use or consider very broad land classes. For example, ""cropland"" is typically modelled as an aggregation of distinct practices and individual crops over large regions. Here, we use the process-based Rothamsted soil Carbon Model (RothC model), which has a history of being successfully applied at a global scale, to calculate attainable SOC stocks and C mineralization rates for each of c. 17,000 regions (combination of soil type and texture, climate type, initial land use and country) in the World, under near-past climate conditions. We considered 28 individual crops and, for each, multiple production practices, plus 16 forest types and 1 grassland class (total of 80 classes). We find that conversion to cropland can result in SOC increases, particularly when the soil remains covered with crop residues (an average gain of 12 t C/ha) or using irrigation (4 t C/ha), which are mutually reinforcing effects. Attainable SOC stocks vary significantly depending on the land use class, particularly for cropland. Common aggregations in global modelling of a single agricultural class would be inaccurate representations of these results. Attainable SOC stocks obtained here were compared to long-term experiment data and are well aligned with the literature. Our results provide a regional and detailed understanding of C sequestration that will also enable better greenhouse gas reporting at national level as alternatives to IPCC tier 2 defaults."
https://openalex.org/W2973454533,"Global warming is increasingly affecting our biosphere. However, in addition to global warming, a panoply of local stressors caused by human activities is having a profound impact on our environment. The risk that these local stressors could modify the response of organisms to global warming has attracted interest and fostered research on their combined effect, especially with a view to identifying potential synergies. In coastal areas, where human activities are heavily concentrated, this scenario is particularly worrying, especially for foundation species such as seagrasses. In this study we explore these potential interactions in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. This species is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. It is well known that the Mediterranean is already experiencing the effects of global warming, especially in the form of heat waves, whose frequency and intensity are expected to increase in the coming decades. Moreover, this species is especially sensitive to stress and plays a key role as a foundation species. The aim of this work is thus to evaluate plant responses (in terms of photosynthetic efficiency and growth) to the combined effects of short-term temperature increases and ammonium additions.To achieve this, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in which plants were exposed to three thermal treatments (20°C, 30°C and 35°C) and three ammonium concentrations (ambient, 30 μM and 120 μM) in a full factorial experiment. We assessed plant performance by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence variables (maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), effective quantum yield of photosystem II (ΔF/Fm'), maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)), shoot growth rate and leaf necrosis incidence. At ambient ammonium concentrations, P. oceanica tolerates short-term temperature increases up to 30°C. However, at 35°C, the plant loses functionality as indicated by a decrease in photosynthetic performance, an inhibition of plant growth and an increase of the necrosis incidence in leaves. On the other hand, ammonium additions at control temperatures showed only a minor effect on seagrass performance. However, the combined effects of warming and ammonium were much worse than those of each stressor in isolation, given that photosynthetic parameters and, above all, leaf growth were affected. This serves as a warning that the impact of global warming could be even worse than expected (based on temperature-only approaches) in environments that are already subject to eutrophication, especially in persistent seagrass species living in oligotrophic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2973810997,"A range of demographic and socioeconomic factors are known to account for enormous disparities in the uptake of maternal health care in low- and middle-income countries. In contrast, contextual factors such as child marriage are far less explored as a deterrent to the uptake of maternal health care. The present study aimed to assess the total effect of child marriage on the utilization of maternal health services in Nepal. This study drew on data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016. The study restricted its analysis to a subsample of 3,970 currently married women of reproductive age who had at least one live birth in the five years preceding the survey. After descriptive analysis, logistic regression models were constructed to estimate adjusted odds ratios. The results of logistic regression controlling for confounders suggested child marriage decreased the likelihood of antenatal care visits (AOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63-0.86), skilled attendance at delivery (AOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56-0.78), facility-based delivery (AOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.56-0.77), and postnatal care use (AOR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.96). The findings of this study reinforced the existing evidence for the adverse effect of child marriage on maternal health-seeking behaviors. Women's restricted access to household resources, limited autonomy in decision-making, social isolation, and the dominant power of husbands and mothers-in-law may play a role in the findings. Addressing women's social vulnerability as a barrier to accessing health care may help to increase the uptake of maternal health services."
https://openalex.org/W2974217089,"Albeit differences in climbing-specific strength of the forearms have been demonstrated between lead and boulder climbers, little is known about the potential differences in force and power output of the upper body pulling-apparatus between disciplines. The aim of this study was to compare the climbing-specific upper-body strength and finger flexor endurance between lead and boulder climbers, as well as to examine the relative utilization of force when testing on a ledge hold compared to a jug hold. Sixteen boulder climbers (red-point climbing grade 17.9 ± 3.3) and fifteen lead climbers (red-point climbing grade 20.5 ± 3.5) performing on an advanced level volunteered for the study. Peak force, average force and rate of force development (RFD) were measured during an isometric pull-up, average velocity in dynamic pull-up, and finger flexor endurance in an intermittent test to fatigue. The isometric pull-up was performed on a ledge hold (high finger strength requirements) and on a jug hold (very low finger strength requirements). Boulder climbers demonstrated a higher maximal and explosive strength in all strength and power measurements (26.2–52.9%, ES = 0.90–1.12, p = 0.006–0.023), whereas the finger flexor endurance test showed no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.088). Both groups were able to utilize 57–69% of peak force, average force and RFD in the ledge condition compared to the jug condition, but the relative utilization was not different between the groups (p = 0.290–0.996). In conclusion, boulder climbers were stronger and more explosive compared to lead climbers, whereas no differences in finger flexor endurance were observed. Performing climbing-specific tests on a smaller hold appears to limit the force and power output equally between the two groups."
https://openalex.org/W2974422654,"DNA barcoding based on a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene is widely applied in species identification and biodiversity studies. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive barcoding database of coastal ray-finned fishes in Vietnam. A total of 3,638 specimens were collected from fish landing sites in northern, central and southern Vietnam. Seven hundred and sixty-five COI sequences of ray-finned fishes were generated, belonging to 458 species, 273 genera, 113 families and 43 orders. A total of 59 species were newly recorded in Vietnam and sequences of six species were new to the Genbank and BOLD online databases. Only 32 species cannot be annotated to species level because difficulty in morphological identifications and their Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) genetic distances to most similar sequences were more than 2%. Moreover, intra-specific genetic distances in some species are also higher than 2%, implying the existence of putative cryptic species. The mean K2P genetic distances within species, genera, families, orders and classes were 0.34%, 12.14%, 17.39%, 21.42%, and 24.80, respectively. Species compositions are quite different with only 16 common species among northern, central and southern Vietnam. This may attribute to multiple habitats and environmental factors across the 3,260 km Vietnamese coastline. Our results confirmed that DNA barcoding is an efficient and reliable tool for coastal fish identification in Vietnam, and also established a reliable DNA barcode reference library for these fishes. DNA barcodes will contribute to future efforts to achieve better monitoring, conservation, and management of fisheries in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2973856869,"Rapid progress has been made in terms of metal nanoparticles studied in numerous fields. Metal nanoparticles have also been used in medical research, and antibacterial properties and anticancer effects have been reported. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for these effects has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study focused on platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and examined their antibacterial properties and functional potential for decomposing organic matter, considering potential applications in the dental field. PtNPs were allowed to react with dental-related bacteria (Streptococcus mutans; Enterococcus faecalis, caries; Porphyromonas gingivalis, and endodontic and periodontal lesions). Antibacterial properties were evaluated by measuring colony formation. In addition, PtNPs were allowed to react with albumin and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and the functional potential to decompose organic matter was evaluated. All evaluations were performed in vitro. Colony formation in all bacterial species was completely suppressed by PtNPs at concentrations of >5 ppm. The addition of PtNPs at concentrations of >10 ppm significantly increased fragmentation and decomposition. The addition of PtNPs at concentrations of >125 pico/mL to 1 EU/mL LPS resulted in significant amounts of decomposition and elimination. The results revealed that PtNPs had antibacterial effects against dental-related bacteria and proteolytic potential to decompose proteins and LPS, an inflammatory factor associated with periodontal disease. Therefore, the use and application of PtNPs in periodontal and endodontic treatment is considered promising."
https://openalex.org/W2974572712,"Antimicrobial peptides can protect the gastric mucosa from bacteria, but Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can equally colonize the gastric apparatus. To understand beta-defensin function in H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis, we investigated susceptibility, human beta-defensin mRNA expression, and DNA methylation changes to promoters in the gastric mucosa with or without H. pylori infection. We studied the expression of HBD2 (gene name DEFB4A), HBD3 (DEFB103A), and HBD4 (DEFB104) using real-time PCR in 15 control and 10 H. pylori infection patient gastric specimens. This study demonstrates that H. pylori infection is related to gastric enhancement of inducible HBD2, but inducible HBD3 and HBD4 expression levels remained unchanged. HBD2 gene methylation levels were overall higher in H. pylori-negative samples than in H. pylori-positive samples. We also assessed antimicrobial susceptibility using growth on blood agar. The H. pylori strain Tox+ was susceptible to all defensins tested and their analogs (3N, 3NI). These results show that HBD2 is involved in gastritis development driven by H. pylori, which facilitates the creation of an epigenetic field during H. pylori-associated gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2973692277,"Asprosin is a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin which plays a role in fasting. It may therefore also play a role in hypoglycaemia unawareness, which has been subsequently examined in this pilot study. Intravenous glucose tolerance test was used to induce controlled hyperglycemia whereas a hyperinsulinemic clamp test was used to induce a controlled hypoglycaemia in 15 patients with diabetes type 1, with and without hypoglycaemia unawareness. Changes in asprosin plasma levels did not differ between patients with and without hypoglycaemia unawareness. However, nine patients with insulin resistance as well as higher liver stiffness values and low-density lipoprotein but lower high-density lipoprotein levels did not show the expected increase in asprosin plasma levels during hypoglycemia. Therefore, insulin resistance and alterations in liver structure, most likely early stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, seem to be relevant in type 1 diabetes and do not only lead to elevated plasma levels of asprosin, but also to a blunted asprosin response in hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2973692336,"Background Lactate is used to evaluate the prognosis of adult patients with trauma. However, the prognostic significance of admission serum lactate in the setting of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still unclear. We aim to investigate the impact of admission lactate on the outcome in children with moderate to severe TBI. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric hospital between May 2012 and Jun 2018 included children with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of ≤13. Two hundred and thirteen patients were included in the analysis and 45 patients died in hospital. Results Admission lactate and glucose were significantly higher in non-survivors than those in survivors (P < 0.05). Admission lactate was positively correlated with admission glucose and negatively correlated with GCS in all patients (n = 213), subgroup of isolated TBI (n = 112) and subgroup of GCS ≤ 8 (n = 133), respectively. AUCs of lactate could significantly predict the mortality and were higher than those of glucose in all patients, subgroup of isolated TBI and subgroup of GCS ≤ 8, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that admission lactate (Adjusted OR = 1.189; 95% CI: 1.002–1.410; P = 0.047) was independently associated with mortality, while admission glucose (Adjusted OR = 1.077; 95% CI: 0.978–1.186; P = 0.133) wasn’t an independent risk factor of death. Elevated admission lactate (> 2 mmol/L) was associated with death, reduced 14-day ventilation-free days, 14-day ICU-free days and 28-day hospital-free days. Conclusions Admission serum lactate can effectively predict the mortality of children with moderate to severe TBI. Elevated admission lactate is associated with death, reduced ventilator-free, ICU-free, and hospital-free days. Admission serum lactate could be used as a prognostic biomarker of mortality in children with moderate to severe TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2973705737,"Background Post-implant care of patients with heart failure (HF) undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is not addressed in current HF or CRT guidelines and is often fragmented with poor communication between specialties. We sought to develop a new model of post-CRT care which could be implemented in busy clinical settings. Methods and results We designed a novel, multidisciplinary approach to standardizing post CRT care. All patients receiving a CRT device at the Cleveland Clinic between March 2017 and August 2018 were invited to be seen in the clinic 6 months post implant. A one-time collaborative visit encompassing cardiac imaging, heart failure, and electrophysiology care was performed. We recorded the operational feasibility of the clinic in terms of patient throughput as well as patient characteristics, interventions, and new diagnoses made. Between September 2017 and February 2019, 150 patients were seen in the clinic. Of these, 125 patients had their index CRT implanted for standard indications and were included in the current analysis. Approximately 45 minutes were dedicated for each patient visit. Interventions in care were made in 95% of patients, with CRT non-responders offered a higher number of interventions as compared to responders (median 3 versus 2 interventions). Types of interventions were device-related (26% of population), medication-related (74%), and referral for alternate medical services (80%). Conclusions Multidisciplinary post-implant care of patients with HF receiving CRT devices, regardless of CRT response status, is feasible and results in frequent medical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2973617310,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor important in diverse biological processes including cell proliferation and survival. Upregulation of EGFR activity due to over-expression or mutation is widely implicated in cancer. Activating somatic mutations of the EGFR kinase are postulated to affect the conformation and/or stability of the protein, shifting the EGFR inactive-active state equilibrium towards the activated state. Here, we examined a common EGFR deletion mutation, Δ746ELREA750, which is frequently observed in non-small cell lung cancer patients. By using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the structural effects of the mutation that lead to the experimentally reported increases in kinase activity. Simulations of the active form wild-type and ΔELREA EGFRs revealed the deletion stabilizes the αC helix of the kinase domain, which is located adjacent to the deletion site, by rigidifying the flexible β3-αC loop that accommodates the ELREA sequence. Consequently, the αC helix is stabilized in the “αC-in” active conformation that would prolong the time of the activated state. Moreover, in the mutant kinase, a salt bridge between E762 and K745, which is key for EGFR activity, was also stabilized during the simulation. Additionally, the interaction between EGFR and ATP was favored by ΔELREA EGFR over wild-type EGFR, as reflected by the number of hydrogen bonds formed and the free energy of binding. Simulation of inactive EGFR suggested the deletion would promote a shift from the inactive conformation towards active EGFR, which is supported by the inward movement of the αC helix. The MDS results also align with the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on ΔELREA and wild-type EGFR lung cancer cell lines, where more pronounced inhibition was observed against ΔELREA than for wild-type EGFR by inhibitors recognizing the active kinase conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2974634236,"Maize genotypes can show different responsiveness to inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense and an intriguing issue is which genes of the plant are involved in the recognition and growth promotion by these Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria (PGPB). We conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using additive and heterozygous (dis)advantage models to find candidate genes for root and shoot traits under nitrogen (N) stress and N stress plus A. brasilense. A total of 52,215 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers were used for GWAS analyses. For the six root traits with significant inoculation effect, the GWAS analyses revealed 25 significant SNPs for the N stress plus A. brasilense treatment, in which only two were overlapped with the 22 found for N stress only. Most were found by the heterozygous (dis)advantage model and were more related to exclusive gene ontology terms. Interestingly, the candidate genes around the significant SNPs found for the maize-A. brasilense association were involved in different functions previously described for PGPB in plants (e.g. signaling pathways of the plant's defense system and phytohormone biosynthesis). Our findings are a benchmark in the understanding of the genetic variation among maize hybrids for the association with A. brasilense and reveal the potential for further enhancement of maize through this association."

These problems have a large impact on quality of life and place a significant burden on health systems.This study aimed to ascertain the frequency of bladder and bowel problems in a select Australian MS cohort and to investigate the relationships between level of disability, bladder and bowel problems, and fatigue.Questionnaires on the nature and severity of MS symptoms were distributed to clients attending an Australian MS centre. Log-binomial regression and multiple linear regression models were used to investigate relationships between disability, fatigue, and bladder and bowel problems.Of 167 questionnaires distributed, 136 were completed. Bladder problems were reported by 87 (74.4%) respondents, whilst 66 (48.9%) experienced functional constipation and 43 (31.9%) faecal incontinence. This frequency in our select Australian MS population is similar to that reported globally. There was a significant correlation between level of disability and: bladder problems (p = 0.015), faecal incontinence (p = 0.001), fatigue (p<0.001) and constipation (p = 0.016, relative risk: 1.16). Further investigation into the causal relationships between various MS symptoms may be beneficial in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for people with MS."
https://openalex.org/W2974481410,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes preterm birth and neonatal disease. Although GBS is known to exhibit vast diversity in virulence across strains, the mechanisms of GBS-associated pathogenesis are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that GBS strains of different genotypes would vary in their ability to elicit host inflammatory responses, and that strains associated with neonatal disease would induce different cytokine profiles than those associated with colonization. Using a multiplexed, antibody-based protein detection array, we found that production of a discrete number of inflammatory mediators by THP-1 macrophage-like cells was universally induced in response to challenge with each of five genetically distinct GBS isolates, while other responses appeared to be strain-specific. Key array responses were validated by ELISA using the initial five strains as well as ten additional strains with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Interestingly, IL-6 was significantly elevated following infection with neonatal infection-associated sequence type (ST)-17 strains and among strains possessing capsule (cps) type III. Significant differences in production of IL1-β, IL-10 and MCP-2 were also identified across STs and cps types. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that unique host innate immune responses reflect strain-specific differences in virulence across GBS isolates. Such data might inform the development of improved diagnostic or prognostic strategies against invasive GBS infections."
https://openalex.org/W2974689574,"Objectives Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of death worldwide. For improved accuracy of CVD prediction, risk classification was performed using national time-series health examination data. The data offers an opportunity to access deep learning (RNN-LSTM), which is widely known as an outstanding algorithm for analyzing time-series datasets. The objective of this study was to show the improved accuracy of deep learning by comparing the performance of a Cox hazard regression and RNN-LSTM based on survival analysis. Methods and findings We selected 361,239 subjects (age 40 to 79 years) with more than two health examination records from 2002–2006 using the National Health Insurance System-National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS). The average number of health screenings (from 2002–2013) used in the analysis was 2.9 ± 1.0. Two CVD prediction models were developed from the NHIS-HEALS data: a Cox hazard regression model and a deep learning model. In an internal validation of the NHIS-HEALS dataset, the Cox regression model showed a highest time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87) for in females and 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.80) in males at 2 years. The deep learning model showed a highest time-dependent AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) for in females and 0.96 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.97) in males at 2 years. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) revealed that age was the variable that had the greatest effect on CVD, followed by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in that order. Conclusion The performance of the deep learning model for predicting CVD occurrences was better than that of the Cox regression model. In addition, it was confirmed that the known risk factors shown to be important by previous clinical studies were extracted from the study results using LRP."
https://openalex.org/W2973998738,"Esca is a Grapevine Trunk Disease (GTD) caused by a broad range of taxonomically unrelated fungal pathogens. These attack grapevine wood tissues inducing necroses even in the conductive vascular tissues, thus affecting the vine physiology and potentially leading to plant death. However, the influence of Esca on leaf and whole-plant water transport disruption remains poorly understood. In this paper, a detailed analysis of xylem-related physiological parameters in grapevines that expressed Esca-foliar symptoms was carried out. The experiments were conducted in a vineyard in the Bordeaux region (France) on cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L.) grapevines, which were monitored for Esca-foliar symptoms over a two-year period. Heat dissipation sap-flow sensors were installed during the summer on grapevines having expressed or not Esca-foliar symptoms. Leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration were also measured. Physiological monitoring showed that sap flow density and whole-plant transpiration of Esca-infected grapevines decreased significantly a week before the first foliar symptoms appeared. When atmospheric water demand (Vapour Pressure Deficit, VPD) was the highest, both parameters tended to be about twice as low in symptomatic grapevines as in asymptomatic ones. Sap flow density data at the maximum transpiration-time, was systematically 29–30% lower in Esca-infected grapevines compared to control plants before or after the appearance of Esca-foliar symptoms. This trend was observed whatever the temperatures and VPD values measured. In Esca-diseased plants, larger amounts of necrotic wood, mainly white rot, were found in the trunk and cordon of symptomatic grapevines compared to healthy ones, suggesting necroses have an influence in reducing the whole-plant hydraulic capacity. This study reveals that the use of physiological monitoring methods, together with the visual monitoring of foliar symptoms, could prove useful in providing accurate measurements of Esca disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2974246080,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in tissue remodeling by degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This mechanism is implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes including wound healing. One of the key proteins involved in this process is the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β, which induces the expression of MMP-3 mRNA and the secretion of MMP-3 protein by dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we first investigated the contribution of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) to IL-1β-induced MMP-3 expression in dermal fibroblasts. Our results showed that in cells transfected with ATF-2 siRNA or treated with the ATF-2 inhibitor SBI-0087702, IL-1β-induced MMP-3 mRNA expression was reduced. We also demonstrated that IL-1β stimulates the phosphorylation of ATF-2. These observations suggest that ATF-2 plays an important role in IL-1β-induced MMP-3 expression. Next, we investigated the role of MAPK signaling in ATF-2 activation. In cells treated with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor FR180240, as well as in cells transfected with ERK1 and ERK2 siRNAs, IL-1β-induced MMP-3 mRNA expression was reduced. In addition, we showed that IL-1β induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These observations suggest that ERK1 and ERK2 are involved in IL-1β-induced MMP-3 expression. However, ERK1 and ERK2 do seem to play different roles. While the ERK inhibitor FR180204 inhibited IL-1β-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation, only in cells transfected with ERK1 siRNA, but not ERK2 siRNA, IL-1β-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation was reduced. These findings suggest that the ERK1/ATF-2 signaling axis contributes to IL-1β-induced MMP-3 expression in dermal fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2974531393,"To determine the origin and genetic consequences of anagenesis in Rubus takesimensis on Ulleung Island, Korea, we compared the genetic diversity and population structure of R. takesimensis with those of its continental progenitor R. crataegifolius. We broadly sampled a total of 315 accessions in 35 populations and sequenced five noncoding regions of chloroplast DNA. Rubus takesimensis emerged as nonmonophyletic and several geographically diverse continental populations were likely responsible for the origin of R. takesimensis; the majority of R. takesimensis accessions were sisters to the clade containing accessions of R. crataegifolius, primarily from the Korean peninsula, while rare accessions from three populations shared common ancestors with the ones from the southern part of the Korean peninsula, Jeju Island, and Japan. A few accessions from the Chusan population originated independently from the Korean peninsula. Of 129 haplotypes, 81 and 48 were found exclusively in R. crataegifolius and R. takesimensis, respectively. We found unusually high genetic diversity in two regions on Ulleung Island and no geographic population structure. For R. crataegifolius, two major haplotype groups were found; one for the northern mainland Korean peninsula, and the other for the southern Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. Compared with populations of R. crataegifolius sampled from Japan, much higher haplotype diversity was found in populations from the Korean peninsula. The patterns of genetic consequences in R. takesimensis need to be verified for other endemic species based on chloroplast DNA and independent nuclear markers to synthesize emerging patterns of anagenetic speciation on Ulleung Island."
https://openalex.org/W2974618842,"Thyroid eye disease (TED) can lead to scar formation and tissue remodeling in the orbital space. In severe cases, the scarring process leads to sight-threatening pathophysiology. There is no known effective way to prevent scar formation in TED patients, or to reverse scarring once it occurs. In this study, we show that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), esomeprazole and lansoprazole, can prevent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-mediated differentiation of TED orbital fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, a critical step in scar formation. Both PPIs prevent TGFβ-induced increases in alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), calponin, and collagen production and reduce TED orbital fibroblast cell proliferation and migration. Esomeprazole and lansoprazole exert these effects through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-dependent pathway that includes reducing β-catenin/Wnt signaling. We conclude that PPIs are potentially useful therapies for preventing or treating TED by reducing the myofibroblast accumulation that occurs in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2973861296,"The ventral midbrain supports a variety of functions through the heterogeneity of neurons. Dopaminergic and GABA neurons within this region are particularly susceptible targets of amphetamine-class psychostimulants such as methamphetamine. While this has been evidenced through single-neuron methods, it remains unclear whether and to what extent the local neuronal network is affected and if so, by which mechanisms. Both GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons were heavily featured within the primary ventral midbrain network model system. Using spontaneous calcium activity, our data suggest methamphetamine decreased total network output via a D2 receptor-dependent manner. Over culture duration, functional connectivity between neurons decreased significantly but was unaffected by methamphetamine. However, across culture duration, exposure to methamphetamine significantly altered changes in network assortativity. Here we have established primary ventral midbrain networks culture as a viable model system that reveals specific changes in network activity, connectivity, and topology modulation by methamphetamine. This network culture system enables control over the type and number of neurons that comprise a network and facilitates detection of emergent properties that arise from the specific organization. Thus, the multidimensional properties of methamphetamine can be unraveled, leading to a better understanding of its impact on the local network structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2973470805,"Background Carpal instability is defined as a condition where wrist motion and/or loading creates mechanical dysfunction, resulting in weakness, pain and decreased function. When conventional methods do not identify the instability patterns, yet clinical signs of instability exist, the diagnosis of dynamic instability is often suggested to describe carpal derangement manifested only during the wrist’s active motion or stress. We addressed the question: can advanced MRI techniques provide quantitative means to evaluate dynamic carpal instability and supplement standard static MRI acquisition? Our objectives were to (i) develop a real-time, three-dimensional MRI method to image the carpal joints during their active, uninterrupted motion; and (ii) demonstrate feasibility of the method for assessing metrics relevant to dynamic carpal instability, thus overcoming limitations of standard MRI. Methods Twenty wrists (bilateral wrists of ten healthy participants) were scanned during radial-ulnar deviation and clenched-fist maneuvers. Images resulting from two real-time MRI pulse sequences, four sparse data-acquisition schemes, and three constrained image reconstruction techniques were compared. Image quality was assessed via blinded scoring by three radiologists and quantitative imaging metrics. Results Real-time MRI data-acquisition employing sparse radial sampling with a gradient-recalled-echo acquisition and constrained iterative reconstruction appeared to provide a practical tradeoff between imaging speed (temporal resolution up to 135 ms per slice) and image quality. The method effectively reduced streaking artifacts arising from data undersampling and enabled the derivation of quantitative measures pertinent to evaluating dynamic carpal instability. Conclusion This study demonstrates that real-time, three-dimensional MRI of the moving wrist is feasible and may be useful for the evaluation of dynamic carpal instability."
https://openalex.org/W2973782419,"Introduction Analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak and strong opioids are commonly used among elderly persons. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of elderly analgesic users and to measure the frequency of analgesic use, including the frequency of potentially inappropriate analgesic use. Methods The Arianna database was used to carry out this study. This database contains prescription data with associated indication of use for 1,076,486 inhabitants registered with their general practitioners (GPs) in the Caserta Local Health Unit (Caserta district, Campania region in Italy). A cohort of persons aged ≥65 years old with >1 year of database history having at least one analgesic drug (NSAIDs, strong or weak opioids) between 2010 and 2014 were identified. The date of the first analgesic prescription in the study period was considered the index date (ID). Results From a source population of 1,076,486 persons, 116,486 elderly persons were identified. Of these, 94,820 elderly persons received at least one analgesic drug: 36.6% were incident NSAID users (N = 36,629), while 13.2% were incident weak opioid users (N = 12,485) and 8.1% were incident strong opioid users (N = 7,658). In terms of inappropriate analgesic use, 9.2% (N = 10,763) of all elderly users were prescribed ketorolac/indomethacin inappropriately, since these drugs should not be prescribed to elderly persons. Furthermore, at least half all elderly persons with chronic kidney disease or congestive heart failure were prescribed NSAIDs, while these drugs should be avoided. Conclusion Analgesics are commonly used inappropriately among elderly persons, suggesting that prescribing practice in the catchment area may yet be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2974314471,"Strawberry powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis Wallr.) is a pathogen which infects the leaves, fruit, stolon and flowers of the cultivated strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa), causing major yield losses, primarily through unmarketable fruit. The primary commercial control of the disease is the application of fungicidal sprays. However, as the use of key active ingredients of commercial fungicides is becoming increasingly restricted, interest in developing novel strawberry cultivars exhibiting resistance to the pathogen is growing rapidly. In this study, a mapping population derived from a cross between two commercial strawberry cultivars ('Sonata' and 'Babette') was genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the Axiom iStraw90k genotyping array and phenotyped for powdery mildew susceptibility in both glasshouse and field environments. Three distinct, significant QTLs for powdery mildew resistance were identified across the two experiments. Through comparison with previous studies and scrutiny of the F. vesca genome sequence, candidate genes underlying the genetic control of this trait were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2973986420,"It has been reported that neuroinflammation occurs in the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with neuropathic pain, Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorder. The 18-kDa translocator protein TSPO is used as an imaging target in positron emission tomography to detect neuroinflammation, and its expression is correlated with microglial activation. However, the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of Tspo induced by inflammation is not clear. Here, we revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced Tspo expression was activated by the AP-1 complex in a mouse microglial cell line, BV-2. Knockdown of c-Fos and c-Jun, the components of AP-1, reduced LPS-induced Tspo expression. Furthermore, the enrichment of Sp1 in the proximal promoter region of Tspo was increased in the presence of LPS. In addition, the binding of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the enhancer region, which contains the AP-1 site, was decreased by LPS treatment, but there were no significant differences in HDAC1 binding to the proximal promoter region with or without LPS. These results indicated that HDAC1 is involved not in the proximal promoter region but in the enhancer region. Our study revealed that inflammatory signals induce the recruitment of AP-1 to the enhancer region and Sp1 to the proximal promoter region of the Tspo gene and that Sp1 may regulate the basal expression of Tspo."
https://openalex.org/W2974866962,"Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) are standard of care for women at risk of preterm delivery, although choice of drug, dose or route have not been systematically evaluated. Further, ACS are infrequently used in low resource environments where most of the mortality from prematurity occurs. We report proof of principle experiments to test betamethasone-phosphate (Beta-P) or dexamethasone-phosphate (Dex-P) given orally in comparison to the clinical treatment with the intramuscular combination drug beta-phosphate plus beta-acetate in a Rhesus Macaque model. First, we performed pharmacokinetic studies in non-pregnant monkeys to compare blood levels of the steroids using oral dosing with Beta-P, Dex-P and an effective maternal intramuscular dose of the beta-acetate component of the clinical treatment. We then evaluated maternal and fetal blood steroid levels with limited fetal sampling under ultrasound guidance in pregnant macaques. We found that oral Beta is more slowly cleared from plasma than oral Dex. The blood levels of both drugs were lower in maternal plasma of pregnant than in non-pregnant macaques. Using the pharmacokinetic data, we treated groups of 6–8 pregnant monkeys with oral Beta-P, oral Dex-P, or the maternal intramuscular clinical treatment and saline controls and measured pressure-volume curves to assess corticosteroid effects on lung maturation at 5d. Oral Beta-P improved the pressure-volume curves similarly to the clinical treatment. Oral Dex-P gave more variable and nonsignificant responses. We then compared gene expression in the fetal lung, liver and hippocampus between oral Beta-P and the clinical treatment by RNA-sequencing. The transcriptomes were largely similar with small gene expression differences in the lung and liver, and no differences in the hippocampus between the groups. As proof of principle, ACS therapy can be effective using inexpensive and widely available oral drugs. Clinical dosing strategies must carefully consider the pharmacokinetics of oral Beta-P or Dex-P to minimize fetal exposure while achieving the desired treatment responses."
https://openalex.org/W2974880488,"Despite a proven association between the implementation of prevention guidelines for central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) and reduction in CLABSI rates, in practice there is poor adherence. Furthermore, current guidelines fail to address the multiple process on the care continuum. This research is based on the bottom-up ""Positive Deviance"" (PD) approach, through which multiple creative and safer solutions for central line (CL) insertion were identified that were not previously described in the guidelines. The aim of the study was to deconstruct CLABSI prevention guidelines (""during insertion"" process only) through the PD approach, working with physicians to identify additional actions that, in practice, help maintain a sterile environment and contribute to patient safety.Our study included a qualitative ethnographic study involving 76 physicians, working in a division of internal medicine and two intensive care units (ICUs). We triangulated findings from a combination of data-collection methods: semi-structured interviews, focused observations, video documentation, Discovery & Action Dialogue (DAD), and simulations. Deconstruction analysis was performed. A total of 23 creative extensions and variations of CL insertion practices were identified.The PD approach enables the identification of vital nuggets of hidden wisdom missing from the formal explicit CLABSI guidelines, and therefore helps bridge the gap between theory and praxis. During the guideline's deconstruction process, through collaborative staff learning, the written procedure is transformed into a living, breathing and cooperative one. It can reduce hospital stays and save lives, and therefore needs careful attention of healthcare scholars and practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W2973719605,"Cochlear implantation is a surgical procedure, which is performed on severely hearing-impaired patients. Impedance field telemetry is commonly used to determine the integrity of the cochlear implant device during and after surgery. At the Department of Otolaryngology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan), the cochlear implant devices are switched on within 24 hours of their implantation. In the present study, the impedance changes of Advanced Bionics™ cochlear implant devices were compared with previous studies and other devices. The aim was to confirm previous hypotheses and to explore other potential associated factors that could influence impedance following cochlear implantation. The current study included 12 patients who underwent cochlear implantation at Cheng Hsin General Hospital with Advanced Bionics cochlear implant devices. The cochlear devices were all switched on within 24 hours of their implantation. The impedance was measured and compared across all contact channels of the electrode, both intra-operatively and post-operatively. The intra-operative impedance was compared with the switch-on impedance (within 24 hours of the cochlear implantation); the impedance was notably increased for all contact channels at switch-on. Of the 16 channels examined, 4 channels had a significant increase in impedance between the intra-operative measurement and the switch-on measurement. To the best of our knowledge, the impedance of a cochlear implant device can be affected by the diameter of the electrode, the position of the electrode arrays in the scala tympani, sheath formation and fibrosis surrounding the electrode after implantation and electrical stimulation during or after surgery. When the results of the current study were compared with previous studies, it was found that the impedance changes were opposite to that of Cochlear™ implant devices. This may be explained by the position of the electrode arrays, sheath formation, the blow-out effect and differences in electrical stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2974265670,"Despite guidance towards minimally invasive, outpatient procedures for endometriosis, many patients nonetheless receive inpatient care. Our objective was to assess trends in patient and hospital characteristics, surgical complications and hospital charges for women with an endometriosis-related inpatient admission in the United States.We conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Visits were stratified into three time-period-defined cohorts (2006-2007, 2010-2011, and 2014 through the first three quarters of 2015). Visits were included if the patient was aged 18-49 years and the primary diagnosis code was for endometriosis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code 617.xx). We evaluated counts of inpatient admissions and rates of patient and hospital characteristics.The number of inpatient admissions with a primary diagnosis code for endometriosis decreased by 72.8% from 2006 to 2015. At the same time, among those admitted for inpatient care for endometriosis, the proportions who had Medicaid insurance and multiple documented comorbidities increased. From 2006 to 2015, mean total hospital charges increased by 75% to $39,662 in 2015 US dollars, although average length of stay increased by <1 day.The number of inpatient admissions with a primary diagnosis of endometriosis decreased over the past decade, while surgical complications and associated hospital charges increased. The share of patients with multiple comorbidities increased and an increasing proportion of inpatient endometriosis admissions were covered by Medicaid and occurred at urban teaching hospitals. These findings suggest a demographic shift in patients receiving inpatient care for endometriosis towards more complex, vulnerable patients."
https://openalex.org/W2974756807,"Purpose Self-regulation is the capacity to regulate attention, emotion, and behaviour to pursue long-term goals. The current study examined the associations between role model presence and self-regulation during early adolescence, controlling for hopefulness, using a large population-based data set from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study. Methods Adolescents, aged 12 years, identified a role model using a single item on a paper questionnaire: ‘Who is the person you most look up to?’ Level of hopefulness was also assessed using a single question: ‘To what extent do you feel hopeful about the future of your life?’ Trained investigators evaluated self-regulation. Results Of 2550 adolescents, 2279 (89.4%) identified a role model. After adjusting for level of hopefulness, identifying a role model was associated with higher levels of self-regulation in comparison to indications of no role model. Hopeful future expectations were also associated with higher self-regulation; however, the beta coefficient was smaller than role model presence in the multivariate linear regression analysis. Conclusions Role model presence was significantly associated with higher self-regulation among early adolescents. Educational environments should focus on support for adolescents with no role models."
https://openalex.org/W2974761163,"Background Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women. However, there remains no consensus in current literature on the incidence of autoimmune diseases among breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risks of major autoimmune diseases (MAD) including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and dermatomyositis (DMtis)/polymyositis (PM) in female breast cancer patients. Methods Using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) records from 2003 to 2013, we identified newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients and randomly selected females without breast cancer in the period 2007 to 2013 into a control group. We matched the two cohorts using a 1:4 ratio based on age, and the year of index date for comparison of the risk of major autoimmune diseases. We estimated and compared the relative risks of autoimmune diseases in female breast cancer patients and females without breast cancer. Results A total of 54,311 females with breast cancer and 217,244 matched females without breast cancer were included in this study. For SLE, the incidence rates were 2.3 (breast cancer group) vs. 10.0 (control group) per 100,000 women years; for RA rates were 19.3 (breast cancer group) vs. 42.7 (control group) per 100,000 women years; and for SS rates were 20.5 (breast cancer group) vs. 38.2 (control group) per 100,000 women years. After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for female breast cancer patients vs. control group were 0.04 (0.01–0.24) for SLE; 0.03 (0.02–0.04) for RA; and 0.21 (0.09–0.48) for SS. Conclusion Female breast cancer patients had lower risks of SLE, RA and SS when compared to female individuals without breast cancer. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing DMtis/PM between both groups."
https://openalex.org/W2973728513,"Aim This study aimed to investigate whether different levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in prediabetes are associated with hyperfiltration. Methods A prospective cohort of 2,022 individuals aged 30–74 years took part in the PREDAPS Study. One cohort of 1,184 participants with prediabetes and another cohort of 838 participants with normal FPG and normal HbA1c were followed for 5 years. Hyperfiltration was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above the age- and gender-specific 95th percentile for healthy control participants, while hypofiltration was defined as an eGFR below the 5th percentile. The prevalence of hyperfiltration was compared for different levels of prediabetes: level 1 of prediabetes: FPG <100 mg/dL plus HbA1c 5.7–6.0% or FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus HbA1c < 5.7%; level 2 of prediabetes: FPG <100 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.1–6.4% or FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus HbA1c 5.7–6.0% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL plus HbA1c <5.7% and level 3 of prediabetes: FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.1–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL plus HbA1c 5.7–6.4%. Results The participants with hyperfiltration were significantly younger, had a higher percentage of active smokers, and lower levels of hemoglobin and less use of ACEIs or ARBs. Only level 3 prediabetes based on FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.1–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL plus HbA1c 5.7–6.4% had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of hyperfiltration (OR 1.69 (1.05–2.74); P < 0.001) compared with no prediabetes (FPG < 100 mg/dL and HbA1c < 5.7%) after adjustment for different factors. The odds ratios for different levels of HbA1c alone in prediabetes increased progressively, but not significantly. Conclusions Level 3 of prediabetes based on FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus HbA1c 6.1–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL plus HbA1c 5.7–6.4% had a significantly higher OR of hyperfiltration compared with participants without prediabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2973888250,"Early conversion to everolimus was assessed in kidney transplant recipients participating in the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP), a population in whom data are lacking. The SENATOR multicenter study enrolled 207 kidney transplant recipients undergoing steroid withdrawal at week 2 post-transplant (ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00956293]). At week 7, patients were randomized (1:2 ratio) to continue the previous calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimen with mycophenolic acid (MPA) and cyclosporine or switch to a CNI-free regimen with MPA, everolimus (5-10 ng/mL) and basiliximab at weeks 7 and 12, then followed for 18 weeks to month 6 post-transplant. The primary endpoint was estimated GFR (eGFR). At week 7, 77/207 (37.2%) patients were randomized (53 everolimus, 24 control). At month 6, eGFR was comparable: 36.5±10.8ml/min with everolimus versus 42.0±13.0ml/min in the control group (p = 0.784). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 27.8% of everolimus-treated patients and 0.0% of control patients (p = 0005). Efficacy profiles showed no difference. In conclusion, eGFR, safety and efficacy outcomes at month 6 post-transplant showed no difference between groups. The everolimus group experienced a higher rate of discontinuation due to adverse events. However, the high rate of non-randomization is highly relevant, indicating this to be a somewhat unstable patient population regardless of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2974822691,"Respiratory infection can be exacerbated by the high glucose concentration in the airway surface liquid (ASL). We investigated the effects of salbutamol and phlorizin on the pulmonary function, oxidative stress levels and SGLT1 activity in lung, pulmonary histopathological damages and survival rates of rats with sepsis. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP). Twenty-four hours after surgery, CLP rats were intranasally treated with saline, salbutamol or phlorizin. After 2 hours, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed. Sepsis promoted atelectasis and bronchial inflammation, and led to increased expression of SGLT1 on cytoplasm of pneumocytes. Salbutamol treatment reduced bronchial inflammation and promoted hyperinsuflation in CLP rats. The interferon-ɤ and Interleucin-1β concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were closely related to the bronchial inflammation regulation. Salbutamol stimulated SGLT1 in plasma membrane; whereas, phlorizin promoted the increase of SGLT1 in cytoplasm. Phlorizin reduced catalase activity and induced a significant decrease in the survival rate of CLP rats. Taken together, sepsis promoted atelectasis and lung inflammation, which can be associated with SGLT1 inhibition. The loss of function of SGLT1 by phlorizin are related to the augmented disease severity, increased atelectasis, bronchial inflammation and a significant reduction of survival rate of CLP rats. Alternatively salbutamol reduced BAL inflammatory cytokines, bronchial inflammation, atelectasis, and airway damage in sepsis. These data suggest that this selective β2-adrenergic agonist may protect lung of septic acute effects."
https://openalex.org/W2973450212,"Aggregation of the prion protein has strong implications in the human prion disease. Sup35p is a yeast prion, and has been used as a model protein to study the disease mechanism. We have studied the pattern of Sup35p aggregation inside live yeast cells under stress, by using confocal microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting and western blotting. Heat shock proteins are a family of proteins that are produced by yeast cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions. Many of the proteins behave as chaperones to combat stress-induced protein misfolding and aggregation. In spite of this, yeast also produce small molecules called osmolytes during stress. In our work, we tried to find the reason as to why yeast produce osmolytes and showed that the osmolytes are paramount to ameliorate the long-term effects of lethal stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, either in the presence or absence of Hsp104p."
https://openalex.org/W2974900478,"Metronomic chemotherapy using the 5-FU prodrug uracil-tegafur (UFT) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) was previously shown to only modestly delay primary tumor growth, but nevertheless markedly suppressed the development of micro-metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model, using the metastatic variant of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, 231/LM2-4. Furthermore, a remarkable prolongation of survival, with no toxicity, was observed in a model of postsurgical advanced metastatic disease. A question that has remained unanswered is the seemingly selective anti-metastatic mechanisms of action responsible for this treatment. We assessed the in vivo effect of metronomic UFT, CTX or their combination, on vascular density, collagen deposition and c-Met (cell mediators or modulators of tumor cell invasion or dissemination) via histochemistry/immunohistochemistry of primary tumor sections. We also assessed the effect of continuous exposure to low and non-toxic doses of active drug metabolites 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) or their combination, on 231/LM2-4 cell invasiveness in vitro. In the in vivo studies, a significant reduction in vascular density and p-Met[Y1003] levels was associated with UFT+CTX treatment. All treatments reduced intratumoral collagen deposition. In the in vitro studies, a significant reduction of collagen IV invasion by all treatments was observed. The 3D structures formed by 231/LM2-4 on Matrigel showed a predominantly Mass phenotype under treated conditions and Stellate phenotype in untreated cultures. Taken together, the results suggest the low-dose metronomic chemotherapy regimens tested can suppress several mediators of tumor invasiveness highlighting a new perspective for the anti-metastatic efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2973822411,"The aim of this project was to investigate the effects of different types of graft material, and different remaining segments of the native TM on its motion. In twelve human temporal bones, controlled TM perforations were made to simulate three different conditions. (1) Central perforation leaving both annular and umbo rims of native TM. (2) Central perforation leaving only a malleal rim of native TM. (3) Central perforation leaving only an annular rim of native TM. Five different graft materials (1) perichondrium (2) silastic (3) thin cartilage (4) thick cartilage (5) Lotriderm® cream were used to reconstruct each perforation condition. Umbo and stapes vibrations to acoustic stimuli from 250 to 6349 Hz were measured using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. Results showed that at low frequencies: in the Two Rims condition, all grafting materials except thick cartilage and Lotriderm cream showed no significant difference in umbo velocity from the Normal TM, while only Lotriderm cream showed a significant decrease in stapes velocity; in the Malleal Rim condition, all materials showed a significant decrease in both umbo and stapes velocities; in the Annular Rim condition, all grafting materials except Lotriderm and perichondrium showed no significant difference from the Normal TM in stapes velocity. Umbo data might not be reliable in some conditions because of coverage by the graft. At middle and high frequencies: all materials showed a significant difference from the Normal TM in both umbo and stapes velocities for all perforation conditions except in the Annular Rim condition, in which silastic and perichondrium showed no significant difference from the Normal TM at umbo velocity in the middle frequencies. In the low frequencies, the choice of repair material does not seem to have a large effect on sound transfer. Our data also suggests that the annular rim could be important for low frequency sound transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2974344397,"Paterson's curse (Echium plantagineum L. (Boraginaceae)), is an herbaceous annual native to Western Europe and northwest Africa. It has been recorded in Australia since the 1800's and is now a major weed in pastures and rangelands, but its introduction history is poorly understood. An understanding of its invasion pathway and subsequent genetic structure is critical to the successful introduction of biological control agents and for provision of informed decisions for plant biosecurity efforts. We sampled E. plantagineum in its native (Iberian Peninsula), non-native (UK) and invaded ranges (Australia and South Africa) and analysed three chloroplast gene regions. Considerable genetic diversity was found among E. plantagineum in Australia, suggesting a complex introduction history. Fourteen haplotypes were identified globally, 10 of which were co-present in Australia and South Africa, indicating South Africa as an important source population, likely through contamination of traded goods or livestock. Haplotype 4 was most abundant in Australia (43%), and in historical and contemporary UK populations (80%), but scarce elsewhere (< 17%), suggesting that ornamental and/or other introductions from genetically impoverished UK sources were also important. Collectively, genetic evidence and historical records indicate E. plantagineum in southern Australia exists as an admixture that is likely derived from introduced source populations in both the UK and South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2974867951,"Malaria and schistosomiasis represent two of the most prevalent and disabling parasitic infections in developing countries. Few studies have evaluated the effect of maternal schistosomiasis and malaria in the peri-conceptional period on infant's risk of infection.In Benin, women were followed from the preconception period until delivery. Subsequently, their children were followed from birth to 3 months of age. Pre-pregnancy malaria, malaria in pregnancy (MiP)-determined monthly using a thick blood smear-and urinary schistosomiasis-determined once before pregnancy and once at delivery using urine filtration-were the main maternal exposures. Infant's febrile infection (fever with respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or cutaneous clinical signs anytime during follow-up) was the main outcome. In a secondary analysis, we checked the relation of malaria and schistosomiasis with infant's hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Both effects were separately assessed using logistic/mixed linear regression models.The prevalence of MiP was 35.7% with 10.8% occurring during the 1st trimester, and the prevalence of schistosomiasis was 21.8%. From birth to 3 months, 25.3% of infants had at least one episode of febrile infection. In multivariate analysis, MiP, particularly malaria in the 1st trimester, was significantly associated with a higher risk of infant's febrile infection (aOR = 4.99 [1.1; 22.6], p = 0.03). In secondary results, pre-pregnancy malaria and schistosomiasis were significantly associated with a lower infant's Hb concentration during the first 3 months.We evidenced the deleterious effect of maternal parasitic infections on infant's health. Our results argue in favor of the implementation of preventive strategies as early as in the peri-conception."
https://openalex.org/W2972539448,"The temptation to free-ride on others' contributions to public goods makes enhancing cooperation a critical challenge. Solutions to the cooperation problem have centered on installing a sanctioning institution where all can punish all, i.e., peer punishment. But a new, growing literature considers whether and when the designation of a group leader-one group member, given the sole ability to administer punishment-is an effective and efficient alternative. What remains unknown is whether and to what extent these group leaders establish cooperative norms in their groups via their own contributions to the public good, their use of sanctions, or both. Nor has past work examined whether leaders' behaviors have lasting effects on non-leaders' cooperation in subsequent interactions, outside of the leader's purview. Here I show that leaders' contributions to the public good predict non-leaders' subsequent cooperation. Importantly, the effect is not limited to cooperation within the institution: the effect of leaders' contributions continue to predict non-leaders' contributions in a later interaction, where sanctions are removed. This process is mediated by non-leaders' increased contributions in the institution, suggesting that leaders have effects on followers that shape followers' subsequent behaviors. These effects occur above and beyond a baseline tendency to be influenced by non-leader group members; they also occur above and beyond the influence of peers in groups under a peer punishment institution. Results underscore how critical it is that groups install cooperative leaders: followers model their leaders' cooperation choices, even in decisions external to the original institution and outside of the leader's watch."
https://openalex.org/W2973339094,"Background Most manufacturer manuals do not verify the use of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for body composition analysis in subjects with a metal implant. This study aimed to quantify the effects of a spinal implant on body composition, and to determine whether unadjusted lean mass estimates are valid for patients with a spinal implant. Methods A total of 30 healthy subjects were recruited. Three consecutive scans were performed for each participant, one with and two without extraneous spinal implant, without repositioning between scans. Lean, fat and bone estimates in the total body, trunk and limb were measured. Results Precision errors for all total and regional body compositions were within the recommended ranges. Bone masses in the trunk and total body were significantly increased with spinal implant, and the increases exceeded the least significant change. For total and regional lean and fat estimates, the measurements between subjects with and without metal implants were in substantial to almost perfect agreement and the differences were not significant and did not exceed the least significant change. Conclusions Spinal metal artifacts significantly increased the total body and trunk bone mass but the differences in lean- and fat-related estimates at total and regional body levels and all estimates in the extremity remained within the clinical acceptable range. Thus, a spinal implant may not compromise screening of patients for fat and lean masses using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Application of image reconstruction or a filtering algorithm may help reduce the effect of metallic artifacts and further study is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2973755162,"Activins regulate numerous processes including inflammation and are synthesized as precursors consisting of a long N-terminal pro-region and a mature protein. Genomic human databases currently list three activin A (Act A) variants termed X1, X2 and X3. The X3 variant is the shortest, lacks N-terminal segments present in X1 and X2, and has been the focus of most past literature. Here, we asked whether these variants are expressed by human cells and tissues and what structural features are contained within their pro-regions. Human monocytic-like cells THP1 and U937 expressed X1 and X2 variants after exposure to phorbol ester or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, while X2 transcripts were present in placenta. Expression vectors encoding full length X2 or X3 variants resulted in production and secretion of biologically active Act A from cultured cells. Previous studies reported a putative HS-binding domain (HBD) in the X3 pro-region. Here, we identified a novel HBD with consensus HS-binding motifs near the N-terminal end of X1 and X2 pro-regions. Peptides encompassing this new domain interacted with substrate-bound HS with nanomolar affinity, while peptides from putative X3 HBD did not. In good agreement, full length X2 pro-region interacted with heparin-agarose, while the X3 pro-region did not. In sum, our study reveals that Act A variants are expressed by inflammatory cells and placenta and yield biological activity. The high affinity HBD in X1 and X2 pro-region and its absence in X3 could greatly influence overall Act A distribution, availability and activity in physiological and pathological circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2974569084,"Maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes are interdependent. Designing public health strategies that link fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal outcomes is necessary in order to successfully reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality, particularly in low- and middle- income countries. However, to date, there has been no standardized method for documenting, reporting, and reviewing facility-based stillbirths and neonatal deaths that links to maternal health outcomes would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the burden and determinants of poor fetal and neonatal outcomes. We developed and pilot-tested an adapted RAPID tool, Perinatal-Neonatal Rapid Ascertainment Process for Institutional Deaths (PN RAPID), to systematically identify and quantify facility-based stillbirths and neonatal deaths and link them to maternal health factors in two countries: Liberia and Nepal. This study found an absence of stillbirth timing documented in records, a high proportion of neonatal deaths occurring within the first 24 hours, and an absence of documentation of pregnancy-related and maternal factors that might be associated with fetal and neonatal outcomes. The use of an adapted RAPID methodology and tools was limited by these data gaps, highlighting the need for concurrent strengthening of death documentation through training and standardized record templates."
https://openalex.org/W2974606506,"Performance appraisal is a complex process by which an organization can determine the extent to which employees are performing their work effectively. However, this appraisal may not be accurate if there is no reduction in the impact of problems caused by possibly subjective rater judgements. The main objective of this work is to check the effectiveness-separately and jointly-of the following four training programmes in the extant literature aimed at improving the accuracy of performance assessment: 1) Performance Dimension Training, 2) Frame-of-Reference, 3) Rater Error Training, and 4) Behavioural Observation Training. Based on these training strategies, three programmes were designed and applied separately. A fourth programme was a combination of the other three. We analyzed two studies using different samples (85 students and 42 employees) for the existence of differences in the levels of knowledge of performance and its dimensions, rater errors, observational accuracy, and accuracy of task and citizenship performance appraisal, according to the type of training raters receive. First, the main results show that training based on performance dimensions and the creation of a common framework, in addition to the training that includes the four programmes (Training_4_programmes), increases the level of knowledge of performance and its dimensions. Second, groups that receive training in rater error score higher in knowledge of biases than the other groups, whether or not they have received training. Third, participants' observational accuracy improves with each new moment measure (post-training and follow-up), though not because of the type of training received. Fourth, participants who receive training through the programme that combine the other four gave a task performance appraisal that was closer to the one undertaken by the judges-experts than the other groups. And finally, students' citizenship performance appraisal does not vary according to type of training or to different moment measures, whereas the group of employees who received all four types of training gave a more accurate citizenship performance assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2973974823,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a distinctive biphasic developmental cycle that alternates between two distinct cell types; the extracellular infectious elementary body (EB) and the intracellular replicating reticulate body (RB). Members of the genus Chlamydia are dependent on the formation and degradation of protein disulfide bonds. Moreover, disulfide cross-linking of EB envelope proteins is critical for the infection phase of the developmental cycle. We have identified in C. trachomatis a homologue of the Disulfide Bond forming membrane protein Escherichia coli (E. coli) DsbB (hereafter named CtDsbB) and—using recombinant purified proteins—demonstrated that it is the redox partner of the previously characterised periplasmic oxidase C. trachomatis Disulfide Bond protein A (CtDsbA). CtDsbA protein was detected in C. trachomatis inclusion vacuoles at 20 h post infection, with more detected at 32 and similar levels at 44 h post infection as the developmental cycle proceeds. As a redox pair, CtDsbA and CtDsbB largely resemble their homologous counterparts in E. coli; CtDsbA is directly oxidised by CtDsbB, in a reaction in which both periplasmic cysteine pairs of CtDsbB are required for complete activity. In our hands, this reaction is slow relative to that observed for E. coli equivalents, although this may reflect a non-native expression system and use of a surrogate quinone cofactor. CtDsbA has a second non-catalytic disulfide bond, which has a small stabilising effect on the protein’s thermal stability, but which does not appear to influence the interaction of CtDsbA with its partner protein CtDsbB. Expression of CtDsbA during the RB replicative phase and during RB to EB differentiation coincided with the oxidation of the chlamydial outer membrane complex (COMC). Together with our demonstration of an active redox pairing, our findings suggest a potential role for CtDsbA and CtDsbB in the critical disulfide bond formation step in the highly regulated development cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2974433468,"In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new severe influenza surveillance case definition, which has not been evaluated in a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence setting. Our study aimed to assess the performance of this proposed case definition in identifying influenza among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children aged <5 years in South Africa. We prospectively enrolled children aged <5 years hospitalised with physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at two surveillance sites from January 2011 to December 2015. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected. We tested nasopharyngeal aspirates for influenza using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We used logistic regression to assess factors associated with influenza positivity among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children. We calculated sensitivity and specificity for different signs and symptoms and combinations of these for laboratory-confirmed influenza. We enrolled 2,582 children <5 years of age with LRTI of whom 87% (2,257) had influenza and HIV results, of these 14% (318) were HIV-infected. The influenza detection rate was 5% (104/1,939) in HIV-uninfected and 5% (16/318) in HIV-infected children. Children with measured fever (≥38°C) were two times more likely to test positive for influenza than those without measured fever among the HIV-uninfected (OR 2.2, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.5-3.4; p<0.001). No significant association was observed between fever and influenza infection among HIV-infected children. Cough alone had sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89-98%) in HIV-uninfected and of 100% (95% CI 79-100%) in HIV-infected children but low specificity: 7% (95% CI 6-8%) and 6% (95% CI 3-9%) in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children, respectively. The WHO post-2014 case definition for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI-an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38°C and cough; with onset within the last ten days and requires hospitalization), had a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 56-76%) and specificity of 46% (95% CI 44-48%) among HIV-uninfected and a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI 35-84%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI 36-48%) among HIV-infected children. The sensitivity and specificity of the WHO post-2014 case definition for SARI were similar among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children. Our findings support the adoption of the 2014 WHO case definition for children aged <5 years irrespective of HIV infection status."
https://openalex.org/W2974639737,"The Duffy blood group plays a key role in Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax invasion into human erythrocytes. The geographical distribution of the Duffy alleles differs between regions with the FY*A allele having high frequencies in many Asian populations, the FY*B allele is found predominately in European populations and the FY*Bes allele found predominantly in African regions. A previous study in Peninsular Malaysia indicated high homogeneity of the dominant FY*A/FY*A genotype. However, the distribution of the Duffy genotypes in Malaysian Borneo is currently unknown. In the present study, the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes and allelic frequencies among P. knowlesi infected patients as well as healthy individuals in Malaysian Borneo were determined. A total of 79 P. knowlesi patient blood samples and 76 healthy donor samples were genotyped using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). Subsequently a P. knowlesi invasion assay was carried out on FY*AB/ FY*A and FY*A/ FY*A Duffy genotype blood to investigate if either genotype conferred increased susceptibility to P. knowlesi invasion. Our results show almost equal distribution between the homozygous FY*A/FY*A and heterozygous FY*A/FY*B genotypes. This is in stark contrast to the Duffy distribution in Peninsular Malaysia and the surrounding Southeast Asian region which is dominantly FY*A/FY*A. The mean percent invasion of FY*A/FY*A and FY*A/FY*B blood was not significantly different indicating that neither blood group confers increased susceptibility to P. knowlesi invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2973280170,"The inverse association between mortality and individual socioeconomic status is well-documented. Due to the lack of appropriate data, little is known about the nature of this association among individuals with long-term care (LTC) needs.We aim to fill in this knowledge gap by estimating life expectancy (LE), life expectancy without (CFLE) and with (CLE) long-term care by education for older German men; and by assessing the trends in the education-LE/CFLE/CLE gradient over time.We apply survival analysis and Gompertz regression to German Socioeconomic Panel data (1997-2012) to estimate the mortality levels and to construct the life tables for three educational categories. Using the administrative data from the health insurance, we adjust mortality rates upward to account for the institutionalized population. We estimate age-specific LTC prevalence from the German Microcensus data (2004, 2012) and compute life expectancy with and without LTC by employing Sullivan's method. Slope and Relative Indices of Inequality are computed to evaluate the magnitude of educational inequalities in CFLE.There is a clear and growing educational gradient in LE and CFLE among older men in Germany. In 2004, LE at age 65 among men with low education was 14.2 years, or 3.3 years lower than among highly educated individuals. The CFLE of these two educational categories ranged from 13.6 to almost 17 years. The gradient increased over time and in 2012 the difference constituted 4.6 years. The gaps between educational groups were not pronounced for CLE. The declining health ratio of years without LTC to remaining LE suggests the expansion of LTC needs, irrespective of the educational level.Growing inequalities by educational status among older German men with care needs demand the attention of policy-makers. Prompt actions are needed to increase the survival chances of the most vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W2973494180,"At some point early in the vertebrate lineage, two whole genome duplication events (1R, 2R) took place that allowed for the diversification and sub-/neo-functionalization of the glycoprotein hormones (GpHs). All jawed vertebrates possess the GpHs luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), each of which are heterodimers with a common alpha subunit and unique beta subunits. In 2002, a novel glycoprotein hormone named thyrostimulin was described to have unique GpA2 and GpB5 subunits that were homologous to the vertebrate alpha and beta subunits. The presence of GpA2 and GpB5 in representative protostomes and deuterostomes indicates their ancestry in the GpH family. There are several reports of GpH subunit evolution, but none have included GpA2 and GpB5 for species in each major vertebrate class. Thus, we addressed the ancestry of two paralogous GpB5 subunits (GpB5a and GpB5b) that were previously only recognized in two teleost species. Our search for orthologous GpB5a and GpB5b sequences in representative vertebrates and phylogenetic analysis, in addition to the currently published evolutionary scenarios of the GpH family, supports that GpB5a and GpB5b are paralogs that arose from the first vertebrate whole genome duplication event (1R). Syntenic analysis supports lineage specific losses of GpB5a in chondrichthyes, basal actinopterygians, and tetrapods, and retention in coelacanth and teleosts. Additionally, we were unable to identify GpA2 transcripts from tilapia mRNA, suggesting that this species does not produce heterodimeric thyrostimulin. While the conserved or even species-specific functional role of thyrostimulin or its individual subunits are still unknown in vertebrates, the analyses presented here provide context for future studies on the functional divergence of the GpH family."
https://openalex.org/W2973894996,"Classical null hypothesis significance tests are not appropriate in corpus linguistics, because the randomness assumption underlying these testing procedures is not fulfilled. Nevertheless, there are numerous scenarios where it would be beneficial to have some kind of test in order to judge the relevance of a result (e.g. a difference between two corpora) by answering the question whether the attribute of interest is pronounced enough to warrant the conclusion that it is substantial and not due to chance. In this paper, I outline such a test."
