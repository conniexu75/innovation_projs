To test these observations by an additional approach, similar samples were chromatographed on ‘Dowex’1 and the results are reported here."

https://openalex.org/W152719716,"In the preceding papers (1, 2) the preparation and properties of sulfonium salts of methionine were described. The ease of formation of the methylsulfonium salt and the solubility properties of its phosphotungstate suggest utilization for the characterization of methionine in amino acid mixtures, since the phosphotungstates of other a-amino acids are readily soluble in cold aqueous alcohol while ammonium phosphotungstate is insoluble in both aqueous alcohol and aqueous acetone (3). However, in protein hydrolysates the solubility relationships were found to be complex and the separation of phosphotungstates was not sharply delineated. The preliminary removal of ammonia particularly appeared to be desirable, and it was found that both ammonia and the basic amino acids could be precipitated by phosphotungstic acid from hydrochloric acid hydrolysates of protein with only minor losses of methionine. Methionine was then converted to the methylsulfonium salt and isolated without further difficulty. The procedure as finally evolved consists of the following steps: (1) hydrolysis of the protein with hydrochloric acid; (2) dilution and removal of ammonia and basic amino acids by phosphotungstic acid; (3) replacement of hydrochloric by sulfuric acid; (4) conversion of methionine to the methylsulfonium salt and precipitation with phosphotungstic acid; (5) conversion of the phosphotungstate to the bromide by means of tetraethylammonium bromide; (6) isolation of methionine methylsulfonium bromide from aqueous alcohol. Application of this procedure to casein resulted in isolation of 65 per cent of the methionine as L-methionine methylsulfonium bromide. With zein, recrystallization of the product was necessary and a yield of 45 per cent of the theory was obtained. The procedure may be modified, depending on the material under investigation and one’s needs. In many cases the phosphotungstate, which can be recrystallized from hot acidic"

https://openalex.org/W2082107387,"IT is commonly accepted that, in nitrogen excretion, urea—and more especially uric acid—are wasteful to the organism in that they involve the loss of carbon and, moreover, chemical energy (see, for example, Needham1). Compared with ammonia, these substances are regarded as inefficient and as only resorted to under the exigencies of water conservation. Table 1 summarizes data from the literature, from which it is seen that, per nitrogen atom, the order of carbon waste (column c) is : ammonia < urea < uric acid (or 0; 0.5; 1.25). But the amounts involved are scarcely significant; for example, for a man to excrete 30 gm. urea plus 0.7 gm. uric acid per day (Starling2) means the loss of 6.25 gm. carbon, which can be made up by the intake of 15.6 gm. glucose or equivalent. Similar calculations may be made for other non-ammonotelic animals."

https://openalex.org/W2015225865,"SEVERAL investigators1–3 have attempted to calculate the energy required to maintain steady-state exchanges of ions between animal tissues and their environments. Thus, Krebs, Eggleston and Terner1 concluded that about 2.5 per cent of the respiratory energy was required for potassium exchange in brain cortex slices at 40° C., and Bernstein2 calculated that the steady-state exchanges of sodium and potassium in red blood cells at 37° C. may require up to one-third of the free energy from glycolysis. These calculations1,2 were based on the assumptions that there was 100 per cent efficiency in the utilization of metabolic energy for ion transport, that the losses and gains of the same ion were independent, and that the movements of different ions were also independent of one another. These assumptions are not necessarily valid."

https://openalex.org/W2008956599,SEVERAL comprehensive morphological studies of Trichomonas vaginalis have been published1. In none is mention made of a striking morphological character I have observed in three different strains of T. vaginalis. These strains were originally isolated from vaginal material gathered at the Whitechapel Clinic from patients with vaginitis and are now growing on artificial culture media2.
https://openalex.org/W2029658847,Elliott and Crichton1 claimed that ‘bent-leg’ is of widespread distribution in Scotland. They found that cod-liver oil added daily to the diet of young rams less than a year old prevented the appearance of the rachitic condition. These observations were confirmed by Auchinachie and Fraser2 and by Dunlop3. Recent experimental work by Ewer4 has shown that the rachitic condition occurring in Welsh lambs brought to Cambridge could be prevented by the administration of a single dose of vitamin D2 (25 mgm. calciferol in 10 ml. arachis oil) given orally to each animal. The protective action of this large dose lasted approximately two months.

Brown1 isolated two chromogenic penicillia and a,Fusarium from discoloured areas of spotted crêpe. Fullerton2 attributed the spotting of smoked sheet and crêpe to species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and unidentified bacteria. Schade3 obtained Monascus ruber and M. purpureus from smoked sheet. More recently, Shaposhnikov et al.4 isolated four species of Aspergillus and three species of Penicillium from smoked sheet, and obtained vigorous growth from inoculations with other common surface moulds."
