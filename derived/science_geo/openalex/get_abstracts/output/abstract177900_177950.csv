https://openalex.org/W2006174530,"Commercial silkworm silk is presumed to be much weaker and less extensible than spider dragline silk, which has been hailed as a 'super-fibre'. But we show here that the mechanical properties of silkworm silks can approach those of spider dragline silk when reeled under controlled conditions. We suggest that silkworms might be able to produce threads that compare well with spider silk by changing their spinning habits, rather than by having their silk genes altered."

https://openalex.org/W2121207891,"Ecological orthodoxy suggests that old-growth forests should be close to dynamic equilibrium, but this view has been challenged by recent findings that neotropical forests are accumulating carbon and biomass, possibly in response to the increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. However, it is unclear whether the recent increase in tree biomass has been accompanied by a shift in community composition. Such changes could reduce or enhance the carbon storage potential of old-growth forests in the long term. Here we show that non-fragmented Amazon forests are experiencing a concerted increase in the density, basal area and mean size of woody climbing plants (lianas). Over the last two decades of the twentieth century the dominance of large lianas relative to trees has increased by 1.7-4.6% a year. Lianas enhance tree mortality and suppress tree growth, so their rapid increase implies that the tropical terrestrial carbon sink may shut down sooner than current models suggest. Predictions of future tropical carbon fluxes will need to account for the changing composition and dynamics of supposedly undisturbed forests."

https://openalex.org/W1978947775,"Macroscopically ordered arrays of vortices in quantum liquids, such as superconductors, He-II, and atom Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC), demonstrate macroscopic coherence in flowing superfluids [1-4]. Despite of the rich variety of systems where quantum liquids reveal macroscopic ordering, experimental observation of a macroscopically ordered electronic state in semiconductors has remained a challenging unexplored problem. A system of excitons is a promising candidate for the realization of macroscopic ordering in a quantum liquid in semiconductors. An exciton is a bound pair of an electron and a hole. At low densities, it is a Bose quasi-particle. At low temperatures, of the order of a few Kelvins, excitons can form a quantum liquid, i.e., a statistically degenerate Bose gas and eventually BEC [5-9]. Here, we report the experimental observation of a macroscopically ordered state in an exciton system."
https://openalex.org/W2000065704,"The transcriptional coactivator PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) has been characterized as a broad regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Although PGC-1α functions through many transcription factors, the PGC-1α partners identified to date are unlikely to account for all of its biologic actions. The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cardiac cDNA library as a novel PGC-1α-binding protein. ERRα was implicated previously in regulating the gene encoding medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which catalyzes the initial step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The cardiac perinatal expression pattern of ERRα paralleled that of PGC-1α and MCAD. Adenoviral-mediated ERRα overexpression in primary neonatal cardiac mycoytes induced endogenous MCAD expression. Furthermore, PGC-1α enhanced the transactivation of reporter plasmids containing an estrogen response element or the MCAD gene promoter by ERRα and the related isoform ERRγ. <i>In vitro</i> binding experiments demonstrated that ERRα interacts with PGC-1α via its activation function-2 homology region. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the L<i>XX</i>LL motif at amino acid position 142–146 of PGC-1α (L2), necessary for PGC-1α interactions with other nuclear receptors, is not required for the PGC-1α·ERRα interaction. Rather, ERRα binds PGC-1α primarily through a Leu-rich motif at amino acids 209–213 (Leu-3) and utilizes additional L<i>XX</i>LL-containing domains as accessory binding sites. Thus, the PGC-1α·ERRα interaction is distinct from that of other nuclear receptor PGC-1α partners, including PPARα, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, and estrogen receptor α. These results identify ERRα and ERRγ as novel PGC-1α interacting proteins, implicate ERR isoforms in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, and suggest a potential mechanism whereby PGC-1α selectively binds transcription factor partners."

In the fibril, extensive regions of the peptide show an in-register, parallel arrangement. Based on the parallel arrangement and side chain mobility analysis we find the amyloid structure to be mostly ordered and specific, but we also identify more dynamic regions (N and C termini) and likely turn or bend regions (around residues 23–26). Despite their different aggregation properties and roles in disease, the two peptides, Aβ40 and Aβ42, homogeneously co-mix in amyloid fibrils suggesting that they possess the same structural architecture."

https://openalex.org/W2127562514,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor induced by hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, site-specific proline hydroxylation of the α subunits of HIF allows recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets these subunits for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions, this hydroxylation is inhibited, allowing the α subunits of HIF to escape VHL-mediated degradation. Three enzymes, prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins 1, 2, and 3 (PHD1, -2, and -3; also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase 3, 2, and 1, respectively), have recently been identified that catalyze proline hydroxylation of HIF α subunits. These enzymes hydroxylate specific prolines in HIF α subunits in the context of a strongly conserved LXXLAP sequence motif (where Xindicates any amino acid and P indicates the hydroxylacceptor proline). We report here that PHD2 has the highest specific activity toward the primary hydroxylation site of HIF-1α. Furthermore, and unexpectedly, mutations can be tolerated at the −5, −2, and −1 positions (relative to proline) of the LXXLAP motif.

Low oxygen tension (1% O2) induces a battery of genes that allow cells to increase their uptake of glucose (through up-regulation of specific isoforms of the glucose transporter) and shift utilization of this energy source from aerobic to glycolytic metabolism (through up-regulation of genes such as phosphofructokinase, aldolase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, among others) (4Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Low oxygen tension also induces the up-regulation of genes involved in local and systemic responses to hypoxia. An example of the former is vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent angiogenic agent, whereas an example of the latter is erythropoietin, the central regulator of red blood cell maturation. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1 is a transcription factor that is the master regulator of all of the above genes (1Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin.

HIF is heterodimeric and comprises an α and a β subunit, both of which in turn are members of the PAS family of transcription factors. The β subunit is a member of the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator family of proteins. Three α subunit isoforms have been identified, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α (5Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A.

The central mechanism by which HIF is activated by hypoxia is by regulated stabilization of the α subunit.

The site-specific hydroxylation of the proline residues in HIF is catalyzed by a recently described family of enzymes, PHD1/HPH3, PHD2/HPH2, and PHD3/HPH1 (hereafter referred to in the PHD nomenclature) (30Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). These enzymes bear homology to the collagen hydroxylases that catalyze the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen and to a larger family of iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyze a variety of hydroxylation reactions using both protein and nonprotein substrates (32Schofield C.J. Zhang Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These enzymes employ molecular oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as substrates in addition to the hydroxylacceptor proline residue (33Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). In this reaction, 2-oxoglutarate undergoes stoichiometric decarboxylation that is coupled to hydroxylation of the proline substrate. Ascorbic acid serves as a distinct cosubstrate, providing an alternative oxygen acceptor in uncoupled decarboxylation cycles (33Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). This enzymatic reaction provides a means by which oxygen tension can be coupled to HIF stabilization. Under normoxic conditions, proline hydroxylation occurs constitutively, thereby promoting the VHL-mediated degradation of HIF. Under hypoxic conditions, proline hydroxylation of HIF does not proceed, allowing HIF to escape degradation (30Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M.

Mutagenesis studies have provided evidence that PHDs require only a short stretch of HIF amino acids for selective recognition (10Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar, 11Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). HIF-1α peptides as short as 20 residues in length, in fact, can support both site-specific proline hydroxylation and subsequent binding to VHL. The sites of proline hydroxylation reside within an LXXLAP sequence motif that is strongly conserved between the two hydroxylation target sites of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and between HIF isoforms from different species (10–13,31). These considerations raise the possibility that PHDs recognize with absolute specificity the LXXLAP motif, implying that the alanine and two leucines in this motif may be strictly required for recognition by PHDs. Using assays for site-specific hydroxylation of HIF-1α, we report here that mutations can unexpectedly be tolerated at each of these three positions. Indeed, proline appears to be the only residue in this motif that is absolutely required. We furthermore show that, among the PHD isoforms, PHD2 has the highest activity toward the HIF-1α peptide. COS-1 cells were cultured as described previously (34Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4136-4142PubMed Google Scholar). Iron chloride (FeCl2), cobalt chloride (CoCl2), 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbic acid were obtained from Sigma. pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD1 was constructed by first subcloning the 1.1-kb SmaI fragment of Gene Connection Discovery CloneC10485 (Stratagene) into the XhoI (blunt) site of pcDNA3-FLAG, a vector derived from pcDNA3 containing the coding sequence for the FLAG epitope. Sequencing revealed the presence of a codon encoding for serine at residue 30 in this particular clone. Inspection of the published sequences for PHD1 (30Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Therefore, we changed the codon for residue 30 to one encoding for glycine using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The final product was designated pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD1. pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2 was constructed in several steps. First, the NcoI (blunt)/NotI fragment of IMAGE clone 3916773 was subcloned into the XhoI (blunt)/NotI site of pcDNA3-FLAG. An oligonucleotide duplex comprised of the following sequences: 5′-GGCCGCGTCGCCCTGCAGAGCGGCCGGAGACGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGACGTCTCCGGCCGCTCTGCAGGGCGACGC-3′ was then subcloned into theNotI/XbaI site of the product from the previous step to yield pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2-N. Next, the 0.4-kbNcoI/XbaI fragment of IMAGE clone 2094232 was subcloned into the NcoI/XbaI site of IMAGE clone 2448834. The 0.9-kb NotI/XbaI fragment of the product from this step was then subcloned into theNotI/XbaI site of pcDNA3 to yield pcDNA3-PHD2-C. Finally, the 1.3-kbBglII/BsmBI fragment of pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2-N was subcloned into the BglII/NotI site of pcDNA3-PHD2-C to yield pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2. pcDNA3-FLAG- PHD3 was constructed by subcloning the 0.8-kbBamHI (partial)/EcoRI fragment of Gene Connection Discovery Clone C20430 (Stratagene) into theBamHI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3-FLAG. The H297A, R383A, and H135A mutants of PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, respectively, were prepared using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pBXG-HIF-1α-(531–652)-P564A was constructed by subcloning the 0.36-kb EcoRI/SpeI fragment of pcDNA3-HA-HIF-1α P564A (12Yu F.

The L562A, A563G, and Y565F mutants of pcDNA3-GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) were prepared in an analogous manner using corresponding mutants of pBXG-HIF-1α-(531–575) (12Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The L559V, L562V, A563S, D558A/E560Q, D569N/D570N/D571N, D569A/D570A/D571A, and D558A/E560Q/D569N/D570N/D571N mutants were prepared by subcloning synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes encoding the desired mutations into the XbaI/MfeI site of pcDNA3-GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652). pcDNA3-HA-VHL, which contains the coding sequence for a hemagglutinin tag fused to the N terminus of VHL, was prepared by standard recombinant DNA methods. Sequences of recombinant plasmids were confirmed using a Big Dye Terminator kit and an ABI automated sequencer. The sources of pSX/g7F, pcDNA3-HA-HIF-1α, pGEX-HIF-1α-(531–575), pcDNA3-FLAG-VHL, and (eHRE)3-Luc have been described previously (12Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The coding sequences of PHD1, PHD2, and PHD2 (both FLAG-tagged and untagged versions) were subcloned into pFastBacHT (Invitrogen). Preparation of recombinant baculovirus and purification of recombinant proteins using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose were performed according the manufacturer's instructions. VBC was expressed as a polyhistidine- and FLAG-tagged protein using the baculovirus system. pFastBacHT-VHL was constructed in the following manner. First, the 0.7-kb BsmI (blunt)/SalI fragment of pUC18-VHL (a gift of Dr. Richard Klausner, NCI, National Institutes of Health) was subcloned into the EcoRI (blunt)/SalI site of pGEX-5X-1 to yield pGEX-VHL. Next, the 0.2-kb BamHI/NotI fragment of pGEX-VHL was subcloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pFastBacHTc. Finally, the 0.5-kb NotI/BamHI (blunt) fragment of pSX/g7F was subcloned into theNotI/XbaI (blunt) site of the product from the previous step to yield pFastBacHT-FLAG-VHL. pFastBacDUAL-Elongin B-Elongin C was constructed by sequentially subcloning the 0.35-kb XbaI/HindIII and 0.43-kbBamHI fragments of pST37-HisTrxVBC (35Tan S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Song Tan, Pennsylvania State University) that encode Elongin C (residues 17–112) and Elongin B, respectively, into theXbaI/HindIII and BbsI sites of pFastBacDUAL, respectively. In the resulting construct, the expression of Elongin B and that of Elongin C are driven by separate polyhedrin and p10 promoters, respectively. His6-FLAG-VBC was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Sf9 cells coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing His6-FLAG-VHL and Elongin B/Elongin C. GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) was purified from E. coli DH5α transformed with pGEX-HIF-1α-(531–575) (12Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose (36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). For most experiments, 35S-labeled, in vitro translated wild type or mutant GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) or HA-HIF-1α was prepared using a wheat germ TnT kit (Promega) and the appropriate pcDNA3-GAL4- HIF-1α-(531–652) vector or pcDNA3-HA-HIF-1α, respectively. In the experiment shown in Fig.1B, it was prepared using a reticulocyte lysate TnT Quick kit (Promega). 35S-labeled, in vitro translated VHL or PHD was prepared using a reticulocyte lysate TnT Quick kit and either pcDNA3-HA-VHL or the appropriate pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD vector, respectively. Recombinant PHD was incubated with35S-labeled, in vitro translated wild type or mutant GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) or HA-HIF-1α in 10 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 100 μm FeCl2, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 5 mm ascorbate for 1 h at 30 °C. Reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro translated,35S-labeled wild type or mutant GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) or HA-HIF-1α was incubated with recombinant PHD as just described. Hydroxylated reaction product was then isolated by first incubating with 1 μg of His6-FLAG-VBC in 500 μl of buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking, and then immunoprecipitating the His6-FLAG-VBC complex with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose (M2-agarose, Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The resins were washed three times with buffer A, eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the eluates then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. COS-1 cells were seeded in six-well plates at 80% confluency, and some cells were then treated with 100 μm CoCl2 for 2 h. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Following centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, the whole cell extracts were incubated with GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) (20 μg) prebound to GSH-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The resins were washed two times with buffer B and then two times with buffer A. The resins were then incubated in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer A supplemented with 100 μm FeCl2, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 5 mm ascorbate for 1 h at 30 °C. Resins were then washed once with buffer A and incubated with 5 μl of 35S-labeled, in vitrotranslated VHL in 500 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Resins were washed three times with buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the eluates then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Five microliters of35S-labeled, in vitro translated wild type or mutant GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) was incubated with 1 μg of His6-FLAG-PHD1, His6-FLAG-PHD2, or His6-FLAG-PHD3 in 500 μl of buffer A supplemented with 100 μm FeCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The PHD was then immunoprecipitated by the addition of 10 μl of M2-agarose, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed three times with buffer A, eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Twenty micrograms of GST or GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) prebound to 10 μl of GSH-agarose was incubated with rocking for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled PHD in 500 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mg/ml BSA. The resins were washed three times with buffer A, eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer, and the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The day prior to transfection, COS-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates so as to achieve 80% confluency. The cells were then cotransfected using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested typically after 24 h. Luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Wallac LB9507 luminometer. Aliquots of cell extracts were also analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GAL4 (RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) monoclonal antibodies as described previously (34Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4136-4142PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were plated on glass culture slides (Falcon) at 80% confluency and then cotransfected using Fugene6 with various combinations of pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD1, pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2, pcDNA3- FLAG-PHD3, pcDNA3-HA-HIF-1α, pcDNA3-HA-VHL, or pcDNA3. Twenty hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min), permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min), and blocked (2% BSA/PBS for 2 h) (37Marchetti S. Gimond C. Iljin K. Bourcier C. Alitalo K. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2075-2085PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M2, Sigma) and/or anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and/or Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse IgG. Preparations were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images of a single color or an overlay of two colors were taken using Bio-Rad 1024-ES and Nikon Eclipse E-600 confocal microscope system (Biomedical Imaging Core Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). The hydroxylation of HIF-1α was first identified at Pro-564 (10Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), which is present in the context of a LXXLAP sequence motif that is also present at the secondary site of hydroxylation (Pro-402) (13Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). We employed the sequence surrounding Pro-564 as the basis of our studies, and focused on the −1, −2, and −5 positions (relative to Pro-564) containing alanine, leucine, and leucine, respectively. Toward this end, we prepared the following point mutants in the context of a GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) fusion protein: L559V, L562A, L562V, A563G, A563S, and P564A (Fig.1 A). In addition, a Y565F mutant was examined to determine the stringency for Tyr at the +1 position. Finally, we prepared the following four mutants to examine potential roles for acidic residues, which are characteristically seen in the vicinity of the sites of proline hydroxylation in HIF: D558A/E560Q/D569N/D570N/D571N (hereafter referred to as acid1), D558A/E560Q (acid2), D569N/D570N/D571N (acid3), and D569A/D570A/D571A (acid4). Reticulocyte lysates, in comparison to wheat germ extracts, induce a more rapidly migrating species upon SDS-PAGE when employed to preparein vitro translated, 35S-labeled GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–652) (10Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). This more rapidly migrating species, in contrast to the more slowly migrating species, binds VHL (10Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar), consistent with this species representing the proline-hydroxylated species generated by one or more PHDs resident in the reticulocyte lysate. This notion is supported by the following observations. First, we show that inclusion of FeCl2 to the in vitrotranslation reaction converts the more slowly migrating species to the more rapidly migrating species (indicated by asterisk in Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2); previous studies have shown that the PHD(s) resident in the reticulocyte lysate are deficient in iron and that their activity can be augmented by inclusion of iron (11Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4391) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have not been able to detect a mobility shift when the substrate employed was GAL4 fused to shorter fragments of HIF-1α-(531–575) or -(549–575) (data not shown). Second, this iron-inducible mobility shift is abolished by the P564A mutation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). Third, we show that this mobility shift can be reproduced in a time-dependent manner by recombinant PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 isolated from baculovirus-infect"

Here we demonstrate that during rat liver development, amounts of HEPC transcripts were very low in fetal liver, strongly and transiently increased shortly after birth, and reappeared in adult liver. To gain insight into mechanisms that regulate hepatic expression of hepcidin, 5′-flanking regions of human and mouse HEPC genes were isolated and analyzed by functional and DNA binding assays. Human and mouseHEPC promoter-luciferase reporter vectors exhibited strong basal activity in hepatoma HuH-7 and mouse hepatocytes, respectively, but not in non-hepatic U-2OS cells. We found that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and C/EBPβ were respectively very potent and weak activators of both human and mouse promoters. In contrast, co-expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) failed to induce HEPC promoter activity. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that one putative C/EBP element found in the human HEPCpromoter (−250/−230) predominantly bound C/EBPα from rat liver nuclear extracts. Hepatic deletion of the C/EBPα gene resulted in reduced expression of HEPC transcripts in mouse liver. In contrast, amounts of HEPC transcripts increased in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. Decrease of hepcidin mRNA in mice lacking hepatic C/EBPα was accompanied by iron accumulation in periportal hepatocytes. Finally, iron overload led to a significant increase of C/EBPα protein and HEPC transcripts in mouse liver. Taken together, these data demonstrate that C/EBPα is likely to be a key regulator of HEPC gene transcription and provide a novel mechanism for cross-talk between the C/EBP pathway and iron metabolism.

To ward off infections by pathogenic microorganisms, mammals display two distinct but complementary lines of defense: the acquired immune system, characterized by highly specific but delayed onset of response to initial pathogen exposure and the non-targeted innate immunity acting as a first barrier host defense. The ability to avoid microbial infection relies for the major part on constitutive or inducible endogenous synthesis of a battery of microbicidal substances named antimicrobial peptides that behave as natural antibiotics of the organism (1Schroder J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E. Diamond G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 402-410Google Scholar). These molecular effectors, universally found in procaryotes, plants, and animals ranging from insects to mammals, exhibit a broad spectra of activities on bacteria and fungi (3Hoffmann J.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 4-10Google Scholar, 4Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Google Scholar, 5Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Google Scholar, 6Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides, typically 20–40 amino acids in length, are rich in cationic residues and adopt an amphipathic structure. Recently, we identified a novel mouse gene namedHEPC (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar) encoding a small 83-aa protein that shares significant homology in its C-terminal region with human peptide hepcidin (also termed LEAP-1) isolated in two parallel studies from human urine (8Park C.H. Valore E.V. Waring A.J. Ganz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7806-7810Google Scholar) and plasma ultrafiltrate (9Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Google Scholar). Hepcidin exhibits a broad range of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi (8Park C.H. Valore E.V. Waring A.J. Ganz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7806-7810Google Scholar, 9Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Google Scholar). However, in contrast to described mammalian antimicrobial peptides including α- and β-defensins (4Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Google Scholar, 5Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Google Scholar), which are expressed mainly in circulating neutrophil granulocytes and in various epithelia including gastrointestinal, urogenital, and respiratory tracts, hepcidin exhibits predominant liver expression. Because inDrosophila most antimicrobial peptides were produced in the fat body, a functional equivalent of the liver (10Sondergaard L. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 193Google Scholar), hepcidin could represent the first mammalian hepatic homologue of insect cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides. Hepcidin was identified as a gene induced in mouse liver by iron excess (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar). In addition, expression of hepcidin was enhanced in mouse hepatocytes both in vivo and in vitro after exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar) and was dramatically induced following bacterial challenge in bass liver (11Shike H. Lauth X. Westerman M.E. Ostland V.E. Carlberg J.M. Van Olst J.C. Shimizu C. Bulet P. Burns J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2232-2237Google Scholar). Induction of hepcidin in these two unrelated physiopathological situations could indicate that besides its antimicrobial functions this peptide exhibits other functions. Several antimicrobial peptides display functions not directly related to host defense including prevention from oxidative stress (12Wakabayashi H. Matsumoto H. Hashimoto K. Teraguchi S. Takase M. Hayasawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 955-957Google Scholar), antitumor activity (13Ohtake T. Fujimoto Y. Ikuta K. Saito H. Ohhira M. Ono M. Kohgo Y. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 393-403Google Scholar), and regulation of angiogenesis (14Li J. Post M. Volk R. Gao Y., Li, M. Metais C. Sato K. Tsai J. Aird W. Rosenberg R.D. Hampton T.G. Sellke F. Carmeliet P. Simons M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 49-55Google Scholar). Recent reports argue in favor of a role of hepcidin in iron metabolism. Indeed, analysis of upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) 1The abbreviations used are: USF2, upstream stimulatory factor 2; aa, amino acid; AFP, α-fetoprotein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α; MEM, minimum essential medium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. knockout mice revealed a development of iron overload in liver, pancreas, and heart. In these mice, it appeared that two very highly related mouse hepcidin genes, HEPC1 and HEPC2, lying in close proximity to the USF2 gene, were transcriptionally inactive, and livers of USF2 −/− mice did not contain HEPC transcripts. It has been suggested that the lack of hepcidin expression was responsible for the liver iron-overload phenotype observed inUSF2 −/− (15Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8780-8785Google Scholar, 16Fleming R.E. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8160-8162Google Scholar). Inversely, early liver expression of the HEPC1 gene in transgenic mice resulted in phenotypic traits of iron deficiency (17Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Porteu A. Mativet S. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4596-4601Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that hepcidin plays an important role in the regulation of iron homeostasis (15Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8780-8785Google Scholar, 16Fleming R.E. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8160-8162Google Scholar). In this study, to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of hepcidin in the liver, we have cloned and analyzed human and mouse HEPC promoters and investigated the transcriptional control of the HEPC gene in vitroand in vivo. We demonstrated that liver-enriched nuclear factor C/EBPα, a critical regulator of several hepatic metabolic processes (18Darlington G.J. Wang N. Hanson R.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 565-570Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is likely to play an essential role in the control ofHEPC gene expression. For fetal rat liver samples, pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River (St. Aubin-les-Elbeuf, France). Breeding was done by placing female rats with males of the same strain overnight, and the noon of the next day was considered as 0.5 day postcoitum. On the indicated days of gestation, rats were anesthetized, embryos were removed, livers were minced, and washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline. The mice with liver-specific deletion of the C/EBPα gene will be reported elsewhere. Briefly, C/EBPα-floxed allele described earlier (19Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Google Scholar) was bred with the rat albumin Cre transgene (20Yakar S. Liu J.L. Stannard B. Butler A. Accili D. Sauer B. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Google Scholar). The gene deletion commenced at about 2 weeks of age at the onset of expression of the albumin promoter and completely deleted at age 6 weeks when the promoter was maximally expressed (21Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Google Scholar). Liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were generated by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of exons 4 and 5 of theHNF4α gene as previously described (21Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Google Scholar, 22Inoue Y. Hayhurst G.P. Inoue J. Mori M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25257-25265Google Scholar). For experimental iron overload, 5-week-old BALB/cJ male mice were obtained from CERJ (Le Genet St. Ile, France). Minced rat and mice liver samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until further processing. Carbonyl iron overload was performed as previously described (23Pigeon C. Turlin B. Iancu T.C. Leroyer P., Le Lan J. Deugnier Y. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 926-934Google Scholar). Briefly, a group of five mice was iron-overloaded by 3% carbonyl iron supplemented in the diet (AO3, UAR, France) over 8 months. Control mice had a carbonyl iron-free diet. Under these experimental conditions, liver iron concentration was on average 13.8-fold higher than the control value (158.2 μmol of iron/g of dry weight liver versus 11.5 μmol, respectively). Hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure from normal male Sprague-Dawley rats or C57BL6 mice. Hepatocytes were seeded in a mixture of 75% minimum essential medium (MEM) and 25% medium 199, supplemented with 10% FCS and per ml: 100 IU of penicillin, 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 5 μg of bovine insulin. Four hours later, the medium was renewed with the same medium deprived of FCS and supplemented with 1 × 10−6m hydrocortisone hemisuccinate. It was changed every day thereafter. Rat hepatoma cell lines FAZA and HTC were grown in a mixture of 50% Ham's F-12 and 50% NCTC135 and in DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% FCS. Human osteosarcoma cells U-2OS were maintained in William's E medium containing 10% FCS. The human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5 were grown in a mixture of MEM (75%) and M199 (25%) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 5 × 10−7m hydrocortisone hemisuccinate. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate method following sedimentation through a cesium chloride cushion or using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Charbonnières, France). 10–20 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gel in 2.2m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting. Hybridization was carried out in the presence of32P-labeled cDNA probe. The equivalence of RNA loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining and/or hybridization with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Mouse hepcidin cDNA probe was prepared as described previously (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding rat and human hepcidin were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from reverse-transcribed rat liver and human hepatoma HepG2 mRNAs, respectively. Obtained PCR products were cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector (InVitrogen, NV Leek, The Netherlands) and sequenced. The cloned fragments were then released by EcoRI digestion and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. Rat α-fetoprotein (AFP) probe was obtained from J. Kruh. The mouse C/EBPα and HNF4α cDNA probes were generated as described in Refs. 19Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Google Scholar and 21Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Google Scholar, respectively. Mouse ApoC-III probe was amplified from mouse liver cDNAs using gene-specific primers and cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced. Total RNA extraction was carried out from normal human liver and HuH-7, HepG2, and U-2OS cells using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega), and cDNA first-strand synthesis was performed with the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Primers and probes were designed with the assistance of Primer Express Software (PE Biosystems). The following probes were used to detect human HEPC and β-actin amplification products: 5′-FAM-CTGCGGCTGCTGTCATCGATCAA-TAMRA-3′ and 5′-FAM-ATGGGACGACATGGAGAAAATCTGGC-TAMRA-3′, respectively. The relative expression of HEPC in the different samples was determined by standardization to its expression in U-2OS cells (which exhibits the lowest level of HEPC expression) using a two-step calculation method. First, for each sample, Ctactin value was subtracted from the corresponding CtHEPC. Then, these normalized values were used to calculate relative level of HEPC expression as follows: HEPC expression ratio(sample/U2OS) = 2ΔCtwhere ΔCt = (CtU2OS − Ctsample). The HEPC expression level in U-2OS cells was used as a reference and was set as 1-fold expression. All quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well microplates using qPCR™ Core reagent kit (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Biosystems). For each microplate the reactions contained target cDNAs, two standard curves (prepared from human liver), and two negative controls: no-template control (sterile water) and no-amplification control (omitting the RT step). The liver sample was obtained from a patient who underwent hepatic surgery for a liver metastasis of colonic adenocarcinoma. A sample of non-tumoral area of the liver was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° before use. Surgical procedures and collection of liver samples were performed under informed consent and in compliance with French law and regulations. Liver tissue lysates were prepared as follows: minced liver samples were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0,1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Total cellular proteins (100 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline). Rabbit polyclonal anti-C/EBPα antibody was a gift from G. Darlington (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). Following incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Denmark) as second antibodies, peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). 950- and 624-bp nucleotide fragments of the 5′-flanking genomic region of the human HEPC gene were obtained from human genomic DNA (Clontech) by PCR amplification using the following forward primers: 5′-GGCTCGAGGTACTCATCGGACTGTAGATGTTAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGCTGTGCTGGGCCATATTACTGCTGTC-3′, respectively, and the reverse primer: 5′-GGAAGCTTGTGACAGTCGCTTTTATGGGGCCTGC-3′ (the incorporated XhoI and HindIII sites are underlined). PCR fragments were digested withXhoI-HindIII and were inserted into the same sites of the promoter-less luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). These were designated pHEPC−960/−9 and pHEPC−633/−9. Constructs containing 5′-deletions of the human HEPCpromoter (pHEPC−327/−9, −275/−9, −223/−9, and −108/−9) were generated by PCR using pHEPC−633/−9 as template and specific primers containing XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. After digestion with XhoI-HindIII, PCR fragments were cloned in the pGL3-Basic vector. A 789-bp nucleotide fragment of the 5′-flanking genomic region of the mouse HEPC1 gene were obtained from mouse genomic DNA (Clontech) by PCR amplification using the forward primers: 5′-GCGCTCGAGGAATACATCGTCAAGCCAGAC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-GCGAAGCTTGTGTGGTGGCTGTCTAGGAGC-3′ (the incorporated XhoI and HindIII sites are underlined). The PCR fragment was digested withXhoI-HindIII and was inserted into the pGL3-Basic vector. The obtained construct was designated pmHEPC−783/+5. Similar to human HEPC promoter constructs, 5′-deletions of mouseHEPC1 promoter (pmHEPC−554/+5, −338/+5, and −267/+5) were generated by PCR. Details of constructs are available upon request. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Searches for transcription factor binding sites was performed using MatInspector (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar). U-2OS or HuH-7 cells were seeded in 35-mm-diameter dishes and grown to 50–70% confluency. Cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of promoter-less pGL3-Basic vector or positive control pGL3-Promoter vector or constructs containing 5′-flanking regions of the HEPC gene and 0.5 μg of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, HNF4α expression plasmids, or empty vector. The pEGFP-C3 vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) used as a co-transfectant (0.5 μg per dish) was served as the control for transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed using liposome-based transfection reagent Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in the presence of transfection reagent in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 16 h and then switched to growth medium. In all cases, the transfection efficiency was at least 10–15%. Primary mouse hepatocytes were transfected 24 h after seeding using GB12 reagent as previously described (25Gilot D. Miramon M.L. Benvegnu T. Ferrieres V. Loreal O. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Plusquellec D. Loyer P. J. Gene Med. 2002; 4: 415-427Google Scholar). The following expression plasmids were used for co-transfection: pCMV-C/EBPα and pCMV-NF-IL6 encoding C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, respectively (kindly provided by G. Darlington, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston) and a HNF4α expression vector pSG5/rHNF4. 42 or 30 h after transfection of cell lines or primary mouse hepatocytes, respectively, cells were lysed in luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and cellular extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity by liquid scintillation counting using the Luciferase assay system from Promega. The luciferase activity was expressed as cpm/μg of cellular protein. Rat liver nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Gorskiet al. (26Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Google Scholar). To prepare double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, equal amounts of complementary single-stranded DNA were heated to 85 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm spermidine, 10 mm MgCl2,5 mm dithiothreitol solution and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes in EMSA: the wild type C/EBP consensus sequence element as described in Ryden and Beemon (27Ryden T.A. Beemon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1155-1164Google Scholar) was used as a reference probe: 5′-CTAGGGCTTGCGCAATCTATATTCG-3′ and 3′-GATCCCGAACGCGTTAGATATAAGC-5′. The mutant form of the C/EBP consensus sequence element: 5′-CTAGGGCTTGCTACCCCTATATTCG-3′ and 3′-GATCCCGAACGATGGGGATATAAGC-5′. The oligonucleotide probe encompassing first putative C/EBP binding site in 5′-flanking region of the human HEPC gene, HEPC(−300/−280): 5′-CTTAACCGCTGAAGCAAAAGGGGGA-3′ and 3′-TGGCGACTTCGTTTTCCCCCTTGAA-5′. Second putative C/EBP binding site, HEPC(−250/−230): 5′-CATCGTGATGGGGAAAGGGCTCCCC-3′ and 3′-CACTACCCCTTTCCCGAGGGGTCTA-5′, and third putative C/EBP binding site, HEPC(−92/−72): 5′-CACCACCTTCTTGGAAATGAGACAG-3′ and 3′-TGGAAGAACCTTTACTCTGTCTCGT-5′. Double-stranded C/EBP wild type and mutant oligonucleotides were purchased from Geneka Biotechnology (Montréal, Canada). The single-stranded oligonucleotides, which contain the putative C/EBP binding site in the 5′-flanking region of the HEPC gene, were from InVitrogen. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were performed in 24 μl of binding buffer containing 6 μg of rat liver nuclear extract and 100 × 103 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probe. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and then was loaded onto a 6% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis was run in 0.5× Tris-Boric acid electrophoresis buffer. For competition experiments, cold competitors were included in the binding mixture before adding the nuclear extract. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the antibody to C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (Geneka Biotechnology) for 20 min at 4 °C. Livers from 2-month-old liver-specific C/EBPα-null and control mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Then, sections cut at a thickness of 5 μm were mounted on the slides. Iron staining was performed using Accustain iron stain kit (Sigma). Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used for estimation of statistical significance (p < 0.01 was considered as significant). Expression of theHEPC gene was analyzed during rat liver development from day 14.5 of embryonic age. HEPC transcripts were undetectable in 14.5- and 16.5-day fetal liver, appeared at 18.5 day of embryonic age, was very strongly induced shortly after birth, and then abruptly ceased from the third day of postnatal period. Then, amounts of HEPC mRNA began to accumulate from 28th day after the birth, reaching the highest levels in adult liver (Fig. 1 A). In parallel, expression of AFP, a well known liver-specific developmentally regulated gene, was studied. AFP transcripts were highly expressed in fetal and perinatal liver and abruptly shut off after 15 days, in accordance to previous studies (28Panduro A. Shalaby F. Shafritz D.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1172-1182Google Scholar). These observations, along with our previous analysis of HEPC expression (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar), suggested that this gene is liver-specific and its expression is related to the fully differentiated hepatocyte. To confirm this issue, we analyzed levels of HEPC transcripts by Northern blotting in normal hepatocytes and in a set of rat and human liver-derived cell lines. In accordance with our previous data on mice hepatocytes (7Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Google Scholar), freshly isolated rat hepatocytes contained higher amounts of HEPC transcripts in comparison with 48-h-old cultures (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, HEPC mRNAs could not be detected in rat hepatoma cell lines HTC and FAZA after a 2-week exposure. The survey of four human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5) for hepcidin expression by Northern blotting revealed a hybridization signal in HuH-7 and HepG2 cells following a 1-week exposure time. In contrast, HEPC transcripts from normal human liver were clearly detectable as early as 2 h after autoradiography (data not shown). In order to assess more accurately the relative level of hepcidin expression in adult liver in comparison to HuH-7 and HepG2 hepatoma cells and non-hepatic U-2OS cell line, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. Expression of the HEPCgene in adult human liver was found to be 142 times stronger than in HuH-7 hepatoma cells. (Fig. 1 C). To understand molecular mechanisms that confer liver specificity and are involved in transcriptional regulation of hepcidin during development and iron overload, we isolated and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human HEPC gene and analyzed its promoter activity. Analysis of genomic sequence data of human clones R30879 and F24108 (GenBankTM accession numbers AD000684 and AC002132, respectively) allowed us to map theHEPC gene to chromosome 19, band q13.1 between theUSF2 gene and the MAG gene encoding myelin-associated glycoprotein precursor (Fig.2). Interestingly, two liver-specific genes LISCH7 and C/EBPα are also mapped to 19q13.1. In particular, the LISCH7 gene is located immediately upstream of the USF2 gene. A 950-bp 5′-flanking genomic fragment of the human HEPC gene was cloned in the pGL3-Basic vector, sequenced, and analyzed using bioinformatic tools for the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites. This region contains a sequence with a TATA box homology. Among a number of putative response elements, we found binding sites for the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-4 (−75 to −62 and −602 to −589 from the predicted translation start site) and for members of C/EBP family (−249 to −236, −298 to −285 and −90 to −77) (Fig. 3). The proximal putative C/EBP binding site TTCTTGGAAATGA overlaps with the STAT consensus binding site TTCNNNGAA. Sequence analysis of a 789-bp nucleotide fragment of the 5′-flanking genomic region of the mouse HEPC1 gene revealed that, similarly to human HEPC promoter, it contains at least three putative binding sites for the C/EBP family of transcription factors, including the proximal C/EBP binding site that overlaps with the STAT site and a sequence related to the HNF4 binding site (data not shown). Two reporter vectors, pHEPC-960/−9 and pHEPC−633/−9, containing respectively 950-bp and 624-bp nucleotide fragments of the human HEPC 5′-flanking genomic region fused to a luciferase reporter gene were tested for transcriptional activity in human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and non-hepatic osteosarcoma U-2OS cells. Promoter-less pGL3-Basic vector and pGL3-Promoter vector containing SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Transfection of reporter vector containing 950 bp of the HEPC 5′-flanking region (pHEPC−960/−9) resulted in high luciferase activity in HuH-7 cells whereas the promoter activity was very low in non-hepatic U-2OS cells. Likewise, the truncated 624-bp HEPCpromoter construct exhibited a very low luciferase activity in U-2OS cells; however, in HuH-7 cells it was even more active than the 950-bp construct (Fig. 4 A) suggesting that the region between"
https://openalex.org/W1974452612,"The influenza virus M2proton-selective ion channel is known to be essential for acidifying the interior of virions during virus uncoating in the lumen of endosomes. The M2 protein is a homotetramer that contains four 19-residue transmembrane (TM) domains. These TM domains are multifunctional, because they contain the channel pore and also anchor the protein in membranes. The M2 protein is gated by pH, and thus we have measured pH-gated currents, the accessibility of the pore to Cu2+, and the effect of a protein-modifying reagent for a series of TM domain mutant M2 proteins. The results indicate that gating of the M2 ion channel is governed by a single side chain at residue 41 of the TM domain and that this property is mediated by an indole moiety. Unlike many ion channels where the gate is formed by a whole segment of a protein, our data suggest a model of striking simplicity for the M2 ion channel protein, with the side chain of Trp41 blocking the pore of the M2 channel when pHout is high and with this side chain leaving the pore when pHout is low. Thus, the Trp41 side chain acts as the gate that opens and closes the pore.

The M2 protein is an integral membrane protein that is expressed at the plasma membrane of influenza virus-infected cells and is incorporated in small amounts into budding virions (4Lamb R.A.

Studies on the mechanism of action of the anti-viral drug, amantadine (1-aminoadamantine hydrochloride), indicated that viral escape mutants resistant to the drug mapped to the transmembrane (TM)1 domain of the M2 protein (6Hay A.J.

The effect of amantadine on inhibition of uncoating is general to all strains of influenza A virus (7Bukrinskaya A.G. Vorkunova N.K. Kornilayeva G.V. Narmanbetova R.A. Vorkunova G.K. J. Gen.

Virology. 1997; 229: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When a virion has entered the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the virus particle is in the acidic environment of the endosomal lumen, the M2 ion channel is activated and conducts protons across the viral membrane. The lowered internal virion pH is thought to weaken protein-protein interactions between the viral matrix protein (M1) and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core (7Bukrinskaya A.G. Vorkunova N.K.

In the presence of amantadine, influenza virus uncoating is incomplete, because the M1 protein is not released from the RNPs and the RNPs fail to enter the nucleus. Normally, influenza virus RNPs are transcribed and replicated in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 10Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4 Ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1487-1531Google Scholar). For some influenza virus subtypes, amantadine inhibits a “late” step in virus replication. The M2 ion channel activity is activated during transport of the M2 protein through the exocytic pathway; this ion channel activity raises the lumenal pH of thetrans Golgi network (TGN), equilibrating pH with that of the cytoplasm (1Sugrue R.J.

Thus, the intralumenal pH of the TGN is kept above the threshold at which the hemagglutinin (HA) conformational change to the low pH-induced form occurs, therefore preventing HA aggregation, which blocks virus release from cells.

The coding regions for the M2 protein have been conserved in all known strains of avian, swine, equine, and human influenza A viruses, and the amino acid sequence of the M2 protein TM domain has been conserved to a greater extent than the remainder of the protein (44Ito T. Gorman O.T. Kawaoka Y. Bean W.J. Webster R.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5491-5498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TM domain consists of 19 residues, and a considerable body of experimental evidence indicates that the M2 protein TM domain constitutes the proteinaceous core (the channel pore) that allows a flux of protons across the membrane. M2 protein TM domain histidine 37 is essential for both ion selectivity and activation by a low pH environment at the M2 N-terminal ectodomain that resides external to the virion (pHout) (25Pinto L.H.

Activation of most ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels is a process that requires detection of the activating signal and coupling to a “gate,” the portion of the protein that prevents conduction while in the unactivated state (45Flynn G.E.

The gate of Shaker-type channels has been studied by comparing atomic structures of the closed state of the KcsA channel with the open state of the calcium-activated MthK channel (57Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 58Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The gate is postulated to be formed by the cytoplasmic residues of the “inner” transmembrane helix. In the closed state the cytoplasmic residues of this helix appose one another closely at a conserved Ala residue, and opening results from a splaying apart of the cytoplasmic residues starting from a conserved Gly residue that serves as a “hinge.” This postulated splaying open of the helices in the open state is consistent with the increased accessibility of the internal residues to organic reagents that occurs when the Shaker family channels are activated (52Holmgren M.

The influenza virus M2 protein is a model of minimalism because it has only a single multifunctional TM domain, which contains the pore of the channel (25Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), acts both to target the protein initially to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and anchor the protein in the ER membrane (61Hull J.D. Gilmore R. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and, as we show here, contains the activation gate. The cDNA encoding the influenza virus A/Udorn/72 M2 protein was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using four-primer PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region of the altered cDNAs was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Oocytes were removed from female X. laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), defolliculated by treatment with collagenase B (2 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mg/ml gentamicin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, osmolality ∼210 mOs/kg) at 19 °C. Oocytes at stage V were microinjected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 ng/nl) on the day after defolliculation, incubated for 24 h in ND96 (pH 7.6), and finally incubated for 24 h in ND96 (pH 8.5) at 19 °C before use (25Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl, and the oocytes were bathed in either Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmNaNO3, 0.71 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, osmolality ∼210 mOs/kg) or a modified solution during the recording. Continuous current-voltage relationships were measured with ramps of membrane voltage, because the M2 channel shows no rapid voltage or time-dependent gating. These ramps typically spanned a range of 120 mV in 2 s. Oocyte holding potential was −20 mV unless stated otherwise. Voltage clamping was achieved with a two-electrode voltage clamp apparatus and the PCLAMP7 program. Intracellular injections of CuCl2, hydroxybenzyl methanethiosulfonate, and their water controls were confirmed by inclusion of a small quantity of 6-carboxyfluorescein. The quantity of fluorescent dye present in the oocyte lysates was measured by fluorometry. To identify the region of the M2 ion channel protein that serves as its activation gate and to assess the extent to which the M2 ion channel gate was open, oocytes of X. laevis expressing the M2 protein were used. Because the M2 ion channel is both activated by elevated [H+]out and conducts H+ (31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the absence of inward H+ currents in the presence of low [H+]out does not permit the determination that the channel is closed. One effective way to show that the channel is closed is to show that in the presence of a deliberately induced high [H+] inside the cell there is no outward current while membrane voltage is held at a constant value with high driving force for H+. Thus, we assessed gating by measuring the presence of outward currents using two different acidification/alkalinization protocols while membrane potential was clamped to a constant value. Both these procedures showed the gate of the wt M2 ion channel to be closed in high pH medium (Fig.1, A and B). First, the oocytes were bathed in acidic (pH 5.9) medium, imposing an inward current sufficient to acidify the ooplasm by about one pH unit (31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and then the medium was switched rapidly to an alkaline medium (pH 8.5; Fig. 1 A). The outward current expected if the gate were open in the alkaline medium was not observed (Fig. 1 A). Secondly, HCl was injected into oocytes that were bathed in alkaline medium (Fig.1 B), and again outward currents were not observed. In earlier experiments we had observed that the currents of oocytes expressing the M2-W41C mutant protein were larger than those for wt M2 protein (62Shuck K. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7755-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), leading us to suspect that the large indole group of the highly conserved Trp41residue might limit current amplitude. Thus, to test the possibility that Trp41 acts as the channel gate, mutant proteins containing residues at position 41 with less bulky side chains were examined for outward current. When Ala, Cys, or Phe were substituted for tryptophan, outward currents were able to flow from acidified oocytes (Fig. 1 A, arrow). Two findings supported the conclusion that this difference between mutant and wt M2 proteins was due to gating by pHout and not due to a general inability of the wt M2 protein to conduct outward current (rectification). First, the membrane conductance of oocytes expressing the wt protein, measured upon reintroduction of bathing solution of pH 8.5 following bathing in low pH solution, returned to nearly the low value measured at pH 8.5 prior to acidification. Secondly, the wt M2 channel protein has been demonstrated to conduct outward current when pHout is low and the membrane voltage is sufficiently positive (26Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Outward currents were also observed for oocytes expressing M2-W41C (7 oocytes) and M2-W41F (8 oocytes) mutant proteins when HCl was injected intracellularly. In contrast to oocytes expressing the wt protein, the conductance of oocytes expressing each of these three mutant proteins, measured upon reintroduction of bathing solution of pH 8.5 following bathing in low pH solution, remained at the elevated value measured during the acidification in low pH solution. To better understand the gating of the M2 proton channel, we compared the data obtained from M2 protein with data obtained from a H+-transporting compound that does not have the ability to be gated, the protonophore FCCP. In contrast to the findings for wt M2 protein, current did flow from acidified oocytes treated with FCCP when pHout was increased (Fig.1 A; see also Ref. 31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This result is similar to that obtained when the indole side chain of Trp41 of the M2 protein was replaced with Ala, Cys, or Phe. We also measured currents for acidified oocytes expressing the M2-W41Y mutant protein and found that outward H+ current did not flow after the transition from low to high pHout (see Fig. 4). We ascertained that the outward currents of oocytes expressing the M2 protein were specific to the M2 protein by applying the specific M2ion channel inhibitor, amantadine (100 μm) (25Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 29Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The outward currents from oocytes expressing the mutant M2proteins (Fig. 2 A), but not the currents from oocytes treated with FCCP (31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), were inhibited by amantadine. Thus, these data indicate the gating properties of the M2 ion channel protein are determined by the side chain of the residue at position 41 of the TM domain and can be influenced by a single hydroxyl moiety.Figure 4Cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the M2 ion channel protein in the TM region from the His37 selectivity filter to the cytoplasmic end. For each residue, outward H+ current was measured and its amplitude normalized to the amount of prior oocyte acidification (as measured by the change in Vrev, as described in Fig.2 C). The numerals below each residue are the number of cells from which recordings were made. Mutation to cysteine of only residue 41 resulted in the presence of detectable outward currents (p <0.01, two-way ANOVA Student-Newmann-Keuls).Asterisks indicate mutations for which deviation from wt is significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Outward current of M2-W41F mutant protein is amantadine-sensitive, and its amplitude is proportional to prior acidification. A, amantadine sensitivity of the outward H+ currents was evaluated by bathing an oocyte that had an outward current of at least 0.5 μA (such as shown in Fig.1 A) in solution of pH 5.9 with amantadine for 1 min prior to return to high pHout or by returning the oocyte immediately from pH 5.9 solution without amantadine to pH 8.5 solution containing amantadine. Outward H+ current was not detectable in the former case and was attenuated by 90% in the latter case, consistent with the known forward reaction rate constant for amantadine (29Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).B, oocytes were bathed in solutions of pH 5.9 for various times (Vhold = −20 mV), and the charge carried by the outward H+ currents that flowed upon return to high pHout was measured (area above interrupted line). C, the charge carried by outward H+current was proportional to oocyte acidification as judged by the shift in Vrev of this highly H+- selective channel. The finding that the amplitude of the outward charge and current was proportional to prior acidification made it possible to compare the outward currents of different cells expressing different proteins in later experiments. To allow comparison between individual cells (see “Results”), the amplitude of the outward current was divided by the change in Vrev to yield a normalized outward current.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The amplitude of the charge carried by the outward current (Fig.2 B) and the extent of acidification of the oocyte while it was bathed in low pH medium were quantified for each of several values of acidification. The acidification was measured from the change in reversal voltage, Vrev, of the amantadine-sensitive current (31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It was found that the charge was proportional to the extent of the acidification that occurred while the oocyte was bathed in solution of low pH (Fig. 2 C). This relationship was very useful because it allowed the comparison of the outward currents from different oocytes that have different levels of expression of the M2 protein. Given that Trp41 functions as a gate for outward current, it was important to determine whether this residue also influences the openness of the channel at high values of pHout. Thus the relationship between conductance and pHout of the wt channel protein with that of the M2-W41A, -C, -F, and -Y mutant proteins was compared. If the gate of the M2 ion channel protein is removed by a mutation that does not remove its selectivity filter, then the relationship between conductance and pHout ought to show a greater degree of openness at high pHout for the residue 41 mutant channels than for the wt M2 channel. As shown in Fig.3, the relationship between conductance and pHout was shifted to higher pH values for all the M2 mutant ion channels, indicating a greater degree of openness for the mutant channels at high pHout(see below for discussion of M2-W41Y mutant). The conductance measured at pH 8.2, normalized to the value at pH 4.5, was consistently higher for oocytes expressing the mutant proteins than for oocytes expressing the wt protein. We were unable to measure this small conductance with sufficient precision to tell whether there was a biologically significant difference among the mutant proteins in their minimum conductance. We also compared the Vrev of the currents of oocytes expressing these four mutant proteins with that of the wt protein. The measurement was made 10 s after switching from bathing medium of pH 8.5 to bathing medium of pH 5.9, at which time some acidification of the oocyte had already begun (31Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31038-31050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The values for Vrev were in the range of 35–42 mV and did not differ between wt and the various M2-W41 mutants tested (ANOVA p = 0.28, 28 oocytes), indicating that the ion selectivity of these four mutant proteins does not differ significantly from that of the wt protein. Thus, the observed shift to higher values of pHout (Fig. 3) is consistent with the mutant M2 proteins lacking a region that blocks the pore at high pHout. Although these results confirmed our suspicion that the bulky indole side chain of Trp41 is the gate of the channel, it is possible nevertheless that other amino acids in the inner TM-spanning region of the protein, but not the wider amantadine-accessible outer region of the TM domain (29Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Duff K.C. Gilchrist P.J. Saxena A.M. Bradshaw J.P. Virology. 1994; 202: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), also participate in the gating process. Therefore, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis for the residues that form the cytoplasmic-proximal α-helical turns of the TM domain (42Sakaguchi T., Tu, Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 62Shuck K. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7755-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We used the presence of outward currents into alkaline solutions as an indication that the gate was open. It was found that replacement by cysteine at only one position, Trp41, produced a protein that allowed significant outward currents to flow (Fig. 4). To determine whether mutation to cysteine at residue 41 causes large scale changes in the conformation of the protein, a cysteine-specific reagent was injected into oocytes expressing the M2-W41C mutant protein, and the gating properties were examined to see whether they were altered in a manner consistent with the known biology. Ideally, one would prefer to restore the function of the wt M2 channel, but the reagent necessary to produce a Trp-like side chain, 7-indole methanthiosulfonate, was not commercially available. We thus resorted to restoring the function of the M2-W41Y mutant channel from the M2-W41C mutant channel, because the M2-W41Y mutant channel resembled the wt M2 channel by not permitting outward currents to flow from acidified oocytes into solutions of high pHout. The reagent chosen to do this, hydroxybenzyl methanethiosulfonate, was expected to produce an altered channel that mimicked the M2-W41Y mutant channel by forming a Tyr-like side chain consisting of a phenol adduct with cysteine. It was considered likely that this adduct would alter the function of the M2-W41C mutant channel protein, causing it to mimic the M2-W41Y mutant channel protein if the conformation of the M2-W41C mutant protein permits the reagent to react with its cysteine side chain. Amantadine-sensitive currents were recorded 30 min after injection of 50 nl of 40 mm reagent during a 2-min period in pH 6.2; during the 30-min period, oocytes were bathed in medium of pH 7.5. Intracellular injection of this reagent significantly decreased the amplitude of outward currents from acidified oocytes (see Fig.5, 30% reduction; ANOVA p<0.05), consistent with the data obtained for the M2-W41Y mutant protein. The currents of control oocytes expressing M2-W41F mutant protein were not affected by intracellular injection of hydroxybenzyl methanethiosulfonate (ANOVAp = 0.48, n = 6; injections confirmed by co-injection of fluorescent tracer). This result confirms the notion that the nature of the side chain at M2 residue 41 determines the gating properties of the M2 ion channel. To add support to the notion that the indole side chain of M2-Trp41 is capable of preventing current flow through the conducting pore of the M2 protein, we investigated whether this side chain prevented a reagent applied intracellularly from accessing the cytoplasmic portion of the channel pore. Advantage was taken of our finding (64Gandhi C.S. Shuck K. Lear J.D. Dieckmann G.R. DeGrado W.F. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5474-5482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that Cu2+, but not Cu1+, applied extracellularly, is capable of inhibiting the M2 ion channel. The mechanism of inhibition is by coordination with the His37 selectivity filter, located closer to the lipid interior of the membrane than M2-Trp41. The accessibility of intracellularly applied Cu2+ to the His37 residue in the wt M2 and M2-W41A mutant proteins was tested. The mutant M2-W41A was chosen for study because alanine has the smallest side chain among the residue 41 mutant proteins that were constructed, and indeed M2-W41A has larger currents than the wt M2 protein. Oocytes expressing the wt M2channel and the M2-W41A mutant were bathed in low pH solution to activate the M2 ion channel, and the conductance of the oocytes was measured every minute (Fig.6). After the first conductance measurement, Cu2+ was injected intracellularly, and the effect of Cu2+ injection on oocyte conductance was measured. For control oocytes expressing either the wt M2protein or the M2-W41A mutant protein that were not injected with Cu2+, conductance increased with time while they were bathed in solutions of low pH because the cytoplasm of the oocytes became acidified and the concentration of conducting ions near the membrane increased. The currents for the M2-W41A mutant channel increased more than for the wt M2 channel, because the mutant channel allowed more protons to pass. For oocytes expressing the wt M2 protein, the conductance continued to increase even after the injection of Cu2+ (injections confirmed by co-injection of fluorescent tracer). However, for oocytes expressing the M2-W41A mutant protein, the conductance decreased after intracellular injection of Cu2+ (two-way ANOVA p<0.01). These results indicate that accessibility of the His37 selectivity filter to intracellularly injected Cu2+ is limited by the bulky indole side chain of M2-Trp41. Taken together, these data suggest a model for the activation of the M2 ion channel (Fig. 7). In the presence of high pHout the channel pore is obstructed by the indole side chain of Trp41. When pHout is lowered, the His37 H+selectivity filter becomes protonated; as a result, the indole of Trp41 rotates to permit H+ to flow. This movement may be accomplished by cation-pi interactions (65Okada A. Miura T. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6053-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 66Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y., Li, L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). After returning to high pHout, outward current will not flow because the deprotonation of the His37 selectivity filter in high pH medium causes the indole of Trp41 to return to its pore-blocking position. If Trp41 is mutated to have a smaller side chain, pore blockage cannot occur. Thus, His37acts as the detector of low pHout, and Trp41acts as the gate. These data are consistent with the notion that the Trp41 region of the M2 ion channel undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes as deduced from cysteine-scanning mutagenesis experiments. It was observed that residues 40–43 showed a pH-dependent propensity to form inter-subunit disulfide bonds on oxidation (67Bauer C.M. Pinto L.H. Cross T.A. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1999; 254: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our data do not allow us to determine the contribution made to the gating process by the positively charged nitrogen atom of the imidazole side chain of His37. Furthermore, we cannot distinguish which of the four His residues of each tetramer participate in transport of H+ from those that participate in interactions with Trp. Our observation that the M2-W41Y mutant channel is more similar to the wt M2 channel in its gating behavior than the M2-W41F mutant channel is consistent with our proposed mechanism of His-Trp interactions mediating channel gating. For the small ribonuclease, barnase, interactions among amino acids have been studied by measuring the stability of the protein. The pH- dependent interaction between His18 and Tyr94 was observed to be stronger than the interaction in a barnase mutant between His18 and Phe94 (68Loewenthal R. Sancho J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 759-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This difference between Phe and Tyr is also consistent with the increase in electronegativity of the aromatic ring of phenol that results from interaction of the phenolic hydroxyl with a hydrogen bond acceptor (69Mecozzi S. West A.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), an interaction that is possible for Tyr but not Phe. However, we do not completely understand the behavior of the M2-W41Y mutant protein because it requires greater reductions of pH than the M2-W41C mutant protein to be activated (Fig. 3) but does not permit the passage of outward current into solutions of high pH. Our data are also consistent with a model in which M2-Trp41 does not physically block the pore but instead chemically interacts with His37 in such a fashion as to prevent His37 from binding either H+ or Cu2+ presented from the cytoplasmic end of the pore. Thus, our model is consistent with a change in conformation of the side chain of a single amino acid altering the activation state of the channel.

This proposed mechanism for influenza virus M2 ion channel gating has the following advantages for the virus: 1) The functions of selectivity and activation are built into only two residues of this small viral protein. 2) Transient exposure to low pHout will result in lasting acidification of the virion because protons are retained by the tryptophan gate, increasing the effectiveness of the small number of M2 molecules found in the virion. This mechanism for gating of the M2 ion channel protein may also serve as a model to help understand the gating interactions that occur in more complicated ion channels. We thank Drs. T. Cross, D.

Emerging evidence implicates Rho GTPases in these biological events. However, Plexins lack any known catalytic activity in their conserved cytoplasmic tails, and how they transduce signals from semaphorins to Rho is still unknown. Here we show that Plexin B2 associates directly with two members of a recently identified family of Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho, PDZ-RhoGEF, and Leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG). This physical interaction is mediated by their PDZ domains and a PDZ-binding motif found only in Plexins of the B family. In addition, we show that ligand-induced dimerization of Plexin B is sufficient to stimulate endogenous RhoA potently and to induce the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, overexpression of the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF but not its regulator of G protein signaling domain prevents cell rounding and neurite retraction of differentiated PC12 cells induced by activation of endogenous Plexin B1 by semaphorin 4D. The association of Plexins with LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF thus provides a direct molecular mechanism by which semaphorins acting on Plexin B can control Rho, thereby regulating the actin-cytoskeleton during axonal guidance and cell migration.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5229) Google Scholar and 2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family is tightly regulated. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 act as activators by promoting the conversion of the inactive GDP-bound to the active GTP-bound species. All known GEFs for GTP-binding proteins have in common a 250-amino acid stretch of significant similarity with Dbl, called Dbl homology (DH) domain, that is critical for their ability to stimulate nucleotide exchange toward GTPases of the Rho family and is often adjacent to a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (reviewed in Ref.3Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In turn, these GEFs link a variety of cell surface receptors to the activation of Rho proteins, thereby regulating the dynamic remodeling of actin-containing cytostructures and gene expression. Recently, a new family of DH-domain containing RhoGEFs, including PDZ-RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), and p115RhoGEF, has been identified (4Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W.

In addition to their DH/PH domains, these GEFs exhibit a number of structural motifs suggestive of a role in signal transduction. Indeed, these GEFs associate with Gα12 and Gα13 through a regulators of Gprotein signaling (RGSs)-like domain (5Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Of interest, PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, but not p115RhoGEF, exhibit in their amino-terminal part a PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain, a modular protein-protein interaction domain that binds to a consensus motif (S/TXV) in the carboxyl terminus of partner proteins or, alternatively, to other PDZ domains (9Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). As the precise nature of the GEFs by which most cell surface receptors promote Rho activation is still largely unknown, we hypothesized that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG may utilize their PDZ domain to interact with novel signaling molecules, thereby leading to Rho activation in response to extracellular stimuli in addition to those mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins. In the present study, we found that LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF bind through their PDZ-domain to all members of the B class of Plexins, which are a recently identified family of transmembrane proteins that participate in axon guidance and cell migration in response to semaphorins (10Winberg M.L.

Indeed, an emerging body of information indicates that Rho-dependent pathways are essential for Plexin B1 function (14Driessens M.H., Hu, H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Hu H. Marton T.F. Goodman C.S.

Our findings indicate that the association of Plexin B with PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG provides a direct mechanism by which Plexins and semaphorins can promote RhoA activation, thereby regulating the cytoskeleton during axonal and dendritic guidance, as well as in an array of biological process that involve cell migration. A human bone marrow cDNA library was screened using the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF as a bait using the Matchmaker system III (Clontech), following the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were obtained under high stringency conditions using growth media lacking −Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed using a Gβ-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and phosducin, which binds Gβ strongly (18Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), as a control bait and prey, respectively. The cDNAs corresponding to Plexin B1 (KIAA 0407), B2 (KIAA 0315), B3 (KIAA 1206), and D1 (KIAA 0620) were kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan). Their cytoplasmic domain were amplified by PCR and ligated into the NheI and NotI restriction sites of pCEFL-EGFP. The extracellular and transmembrane regions of a myc-tagged TrkA (19Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. D. Martin-Zanca (University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain), was amplified and subcloned in the expression vector pCEFL. Chimeric receptors containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of TrkA and the cytoplasmic part of Plexin B1, B2, or B2 lacking its PDZ-binding region were prepared by conventional DNA recombination techniques. An expression plasmid for semaphorin 4D was obtained from ResGen (Invitrogen). Human kidney 293T and mouse fibroblasts Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and calf serum, respectively. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, kindly provided by Dr. H. Kleinman (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% equine serum and 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described (5Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies to AU1, GFP, myc (9E10), and HA tags were purchased from Covance. Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE PlusTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. After fixation with paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with Triton X-100, cells were stained using Texas red X-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes).In vivo Rho activity was assessed according to Ref. 20Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar after modifications (21Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells plated on poly-l-lysine and transfected with EGFP or EGFP-PDZ or EGFP-RGS domains of PDZ-RhoGEF using LipofectAMINE PlusTM were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 days to induce their differentiation. Differentiated PC12 cells were then co-cultured with HEK-293T cells previously transfected with red fluorescent protein with or without semaphorin 4D. After 24 h, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and visualized using a confocal microscope. The number of transfected (green) PC12 cells in contact with 293T cells (red) exhibiting neurite extensions or lacking neurites and displaying a round morphology were counted in a series of independent experiments and expressed as a percentage of total transfected PC12 cells. To identify proteins that may interact with the PDZ domain of RGS-containing Rho GEFs, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a bone marrow cDNA library using the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF as a bait. Among the transformants obtained under high stringency condition (−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp), we identified 3 clones corresponding to the last 61 (clone 4) and 96 (clones 12 and 91) amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin B2, a member of a novel family of cell surface receptors for semaphorins (22Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura F. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig.1 A, clones 4 and 91 interact specifically with the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF in yeast, as judged by their ability to support yeast growth under high stringent conditions and to promote the expression of α-galactosidase from an integrated reporter system. The interaction of Plexin B2 with the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF observed in yeast was confirmed in eukaryotic cells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1,B and C, clone 4 and 91 when expressed as EGFP chimeras in 293T cells were co-immunoprecipitated with both a tagged PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF and the full-length PDZ-RhoGEF, respectively. Plexin B2 belongs to a recently discovered large family of transmembrane proteins that is organized into four subfamilies, known as Plexin A, B, C, and D (12Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H., He, Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether PDZ-RhoGEF could bind to other members of this family. As shown in Fig.2 A, in addition to Plexin B2, PDZ-RhoGEF was also able to interact with Plexin B1 and B3, but not with Plexin D1, both in yeast and in eukaryotic cells (Fig.2 B). The cytoplasmic domain of Plexins is composed of two conserved regions separated by a variable linker, named Sex-Plexin domain, which is unique and not related to any other protein domain. It lacks signaling domains except for a PDZ-binding motif present at the carboxyl terminus of only members of the Plexin B subfamily. To determine whether PDZ-RhoGEF binds to the PDZ-binding motif of Plexin, we generated Plexin mutants in which this motif has been deleted (Plexin-B1ΔPDZ and Plexin-B2ΔPDZ) or added (Plexin D1-PDZ) (Fig. 2 C). As seen in Fig. 2 D, the interaction of PDZ-RhoGEF with Plexin B1 and B2 was lost when the PDZ-binding motif was removed. In contrast, PDZ-RhoGEF interacted with Plexin D1 upon addition of this motif. These results indicate that the PDZ-binding motif of Plexin B is required for its ability to associate with PDZ-RhoGEF. As the PDZ-binding motif is only present in B-type Plexins, this observation may provide a structural base for their signaling selectivity. Based on these findings, we next examined the specificity of the interaction of Plexin B1 and B2 for other GEFs. As shown in Fig.3 A, in addition to PDZ-RhoGEF, Plexin B1 and B2 were also able to interact with LARG but not with p115RhoGEF, which lacks a PDZ domain. Furthermore, this interaction was specific, as Plexins did not interact with the Rac GEF, Tiam 1, which also contains a PDZ domain. Because PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG are multidomain-containing proteins, we asked which region of these GEFs participates in the binding to Plexin B by co-expressing the EGFP-Plexin chimeras with epitope-tagged constructs corresponding to wild-type, Δ-N (which lacks the PDZ domain), Δ-C (which lacks the carboxyl-terminal part), and the isolated DH/PH domain of PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. As shown in Fig. 3 B, removal of the PDZ-containing amino-terminal part of PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG abolished the binding to Plexin B2. However, neither the carboxyl-terminal nor the DH/PH domain of these GEFs was required for interaction with this Plexin. Similar results were obtained with Plexin B1 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that B-type Plexins bind specifically to PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG and that the amino-terminal region of these RhoGEFs, which includes the PDZ domain, is critical for this interaction. The nature of the signaling molecules acting downstream of Plexins has not yet been characterized. Plexins lack any demonstrable catalytic activity in their intracellular region, but a direct association between active Rac (14Driessens M.H., Hu, H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Hu H. Marton T.F. Goodman C.S.

A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) to the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin B1 was recently demonstrated. However, Plexin B1 does not promote Rac activation (Ref. 25Vikis H.G., Li, W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and data not shown), and this association has a regulatory function; binding of GTP-Rac to Plexin B1 enhances the binding of Sema4D to its receptor and prevents the activation of Rac by p21-activated kinase (PAK). Instead, recent data suggest that Plexin B1 may stimulate Rho-dependent pathways (14Driessens M.H., Hu, H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although the nature of the intervening molecular events leading to Rho activation by Plexins still remains unknown. To begin exploring whether Plexin B can induce the activation of Rho, and whether this process involves the association to PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, we first examined whether activation of Plexin B can lead to cytoskeletal changes that are characteristic of those elicited by this small GTPase. As the ligand for Plexin B1, semaphorin 4D (Sema4D, also known as CD100) (12Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H., He, Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), is a membrane-bound semaphorin, and the ligand for Plexin B2 is still unknown, we took advantage of the recent observation that signaling by Plexins can be initiated by ligand-dependent dimerization of their intracellular tails (14Driessens M.H., Hu, H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) to engineer a cellular system in which Plexins can be readily activated in response to a soluble ligand. As an approach, we constructed a chimeric receptor in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of a myc-tagged TrkA (19Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was fused to the intracellular domain of wild-type Plexin B2 or its ΔPDZ deletion mutant (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, although the activation of a truncated TrkA itself did not affect the actin cytoskeleton, the addition of NGF was sufficient to induce the rapid formation of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells expressing the chimeric TrkA-Plexin B2 construct, a cytoskeletal response that is characteristic of RhoA activation. This remarkable effect required an intact PDZ-binding motif, as NGF did not promote stress fiber formation in TrkA-Plexin B2ΔPDZ- expressing cells. These observations prompted us to ask whether Plexin B can indeed activate Rho using a recently developed highly sensitive in vivo Rho guanine nucleotide exchange assay that allows the detection of the GTP-bound form of endogenous Rho in 293T cells (20Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar,21Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, activation of a truncated TrkA by NGF did not stimulate Rho, even if co-expressed with PDZ RhoGEF. In contrast, addition of NGF to TrkA-Plexin B2-expressing cells led to the rapid activation of Rho, which peaked at 1 min and remained elevated for up to 10 min (Fig. 4 C and data not shown). This response was prevented by the EGFP-PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF (not shown) and enhanced dramatically when the full-length of PDZ-RhoGEF was overexpressed (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, when its PDZ-binding motif was deleted, TrkA-Plexin B2 was no longer able to activate Rho, even when PDZ-RhoGEF was overexpressed. Together, these data provide evidence that Plexin B2 can stimulate RhoA and that this process may involve the recruitment of PDZ-RhoGEF through its PDZ-binding motif. Recent work (26Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) has provided evidence that Plexins B provide attractive and repulsive cues necessary for axon guidance. Of interest, Rho can promote neurite retraction and growth cone collapse in neuronal cells (reviewed in Ref. 26Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the biological significance of the interaction between PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG with B-type Plexins using differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which exhibit dendritic extensions that collapse in response to Rho activation (27Aoki J. Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Nakamura K. Hasegawa H. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 365-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed by Western-blotting that Plexin B1 is endogenously expressed in PC12 cells and that these cells also express LARG (data not shown). As neuronal Plexin B1 is activated upon interaction with membrane-bound Sema4D, we next developed a cellular assay system in which 293T cells expressing Sema4D or control plasmids together with red fluorescent protein were co-cultured with differentiated PC12 cells transfected with EGFP or EGFP fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 D, differentiated PC12 cells (green) exhibit extensive neurites, which were not affected after making contact with untransfected (Fig. 4 D,a) or control transfected 293T cells (red) (Fig.4 D, b). In contrast, contact with Sema4D-expressing 293T cells induced the retraction of neurites and cell rounding in more than 85% of differentiated PC12 cells (Fig.4 D, c). Remarkably, expression of the EGFP-PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF in PC12 cells was sufficient to block cell rounding induced by Sema4D (Fig. 4 D, d–e), as only 22% of cells expressing this construct retracted when in contact with Sema4D-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 4 E). Expression of its EGFP-RGS domain did not have any effect on neurite retraction (Fig.4, D, f, and E). Together, these observations indicate that the interaction of Plexin B with PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG provides a molecular mechanism by which these cell surface receptors transduce signals to Rho, thus promoting neurite retraction and cell rounding. Although the precise mechanism by which Plexin B activates the in vivo GEF activity of PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG is still unknown, we can postulate that the formation of a molecular complex at the plasma membrane through the interaction of the PDZ-binding motif of Plexin B with the PDZ-domain of LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF results in Rho activation, thus causing the retraction of growth cones and extending neurites in response to semaphorins. Moreover, semaphorins and Plexins have been found in a large variety of tissues in addition to the central nervous system and have been recently implicated in a variety of biological functions including cellular and humoral immune response (28Bismuth G. Boumsell L. Sci. STKE. 2002; (2002) RE4PubMed Google Scholar), cell migration (28Bismuth G. Boumsell L. Sci. STKE. 2002; (2002) RE4PubMed Google Scholar), and tumor growth (29Christensen C.R. Klingelhofer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1238-1244PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our findings indicating that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG link Plexin B to Rho activation may now provide a molecular understanding of the role of Plexin B in axonal and dendritic guidance and likely in a growing array of normal and pathological biological processes initiated by semaphorins that involve rapid changes in the actin-cytoskeleton and cell migration.

We investigated how ALP is taken up by cells, how it affectsde novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), and how critical this is to initiate apoptosis. We compared an ALP-sensitive mouse lymphoma cell line, S49, with an ALP-resistant variant, S49AR. ALP inhibited PC synthesis at the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) step in S49 cells, but not in S49AR cells. Exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine, providing cells with an alternative way (acylation) to generate PC, rescued cells from ALP-induced apoptosis, indicating that continuous rapid PC turnover is essential for cell survival. Apoptosis induced by other stimuli that do not target PC synthesis remained unaffected by lysophosphatidylcholine. Using monensin, low temperature and albumin back-extraction, we demonstrated that ALP is internalized by endocytosis, a process defective in S49AR cells. This defect neither involved clathrin-coated pit- nor fluid-phase endocytosis, but depended on lipid rafts, because disruption of these microdomains with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or filipin (sequestering cholesterol) or bacterial sphingomyelinase reduced uptake of ALP. Furthermore, ALP was found accumulated in isolated rafts and disruption of rafts also prevented the inhibition of PC synthesis and apoptosis induction in S49 cells. In summary, ALP is internalized by raft-dependent endocytosis to inhibit PC synthesis, which triggers apoptosis.

Verheij M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2457-2463PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike most conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, ALP does not target the DNA but acts at the level of cell membranes. Because of its ether bonds ALP is resistant to phospholipases, and therefore accumulates in the plasma membrane as well as other subcellular membranes (3van Blitterswijk W.J. Hilkmann H. Storme G.A. Lipids. 1987; 22: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), where it inhibits mitogenic and survival signaling pathways and activates the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress pathway (2Ruiter G.A.

The mechanism by which ALP affects these pathways and induces apoptosis may relate to its disturbing effect on lipid metabolism and lipid signaling in cell membranes (5Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C.

Several studies have suggested that maintenance of PC biosynthesis is important for cell survival. A genetic defect in PC biosynthesis induced apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Cui Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas choline deficiency (via the culture medium) led to decreased PC levels and induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and in primary neural cultures (9Yen C.L.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1704-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PC biosynthesis occurs predominantly via the Kennedy pathway in which the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, catalyzed by CT, is the rate-limiting step, and the condensation of CDP-choline with diacylglycerol by choline phosphotransferase constitutes the final step. Inhibition of either of these enzymatic steps may lead to apoptosis (11Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2169-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we determined the effect of ALP on PC synthesis in S49 mouse lymphoma cells, and found an inhibition at the CT step. This enzyme resides in the nucleus and the cytoplasm and translocates to the ER when activated (13Clement J.M. Kent C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We questioned how ALP can reach this intracellular target from outside the cell and how this subsequently initiates apoptosis. There are reports on uptake of ALP correlating with apoptosis induction (1Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zoeller R.A. Layne M.D. Modest E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1866-1875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ALP is internalized has remained uncertain. ALP is not taken up via a specific receptor (such as for the structurally related platelet-activating factor or lyso-PC) (1Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bazill G.W. Dexter T.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7505-7512PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kabarowski J.H. Zhu K., Le, L.Q.

Cancer. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Some investigators argue that endocytosis is not a major pathway by which ALP is taken up (1Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zoeller R.A. Layne M.D. Modest E.J. J.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2435-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas others reach the opposite conclusion (15Bazill G.W. Dexter T.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7505-7512PubMed Google Scholar, 19Small G.W. Strum J.C. Daniel L.W. Lipids. 1997; 32: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To address this issue in more detail, we investigated the uptake and action of ALP in S49 cells in comparison with an ALP-resistant variant cell line S49AR. We report here that PC synthesis in S49AR cells remains undisturbed because these cells are unable to internalize ALP as efficiently as the parental cells. We provide evidence that ALP concentrates in cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich membrane microdomains, known as lipid rafts (20Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar), that ALP is endocytosed via intact rafts, and that reduced internalization of ALP in the S49AR cells must be because of a defect in raft-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inhibition of PC biosynthesis in S49 cells depends on intact rafts and is the direct trigger for initiation of apoptosis. Maintenance of PC synthesis, for example, by providing the cell with an alternative route of PC synthesis, is a factor that contributes to cell survival. Methyl-[14C]choline chloride (58 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [14C]Choline-lysoPC (LPC) (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO). ALP was purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [3H]Et-18-OCH3 ([3H]ALP; 58 Ci/mmol), was synthesized by Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Alexa-488 fluorescently labeled human transferrin and Sulforhodamine 101 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Reagents for lipid extraction and subsequent analyses, as well as Silica 60 TLC plates (20 × 20 cm) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Cholera toxin B, rabbit anti-cholera toxin B, sphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus), filipin, and MβCD were purchased from Sigma (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and the peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig was obtained from DAKO A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Mouse S49.1 lymphoma cells (S49) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ALP-resistant variants (S49AR) were isolated in two selection rounds of growth in 15 μm ALP (Et-18-OCH3) for 72 h, followed by plating in semisolid medium and isolation of colonies of surviving cells, as described by Smets et al. (21Smets L.A. Van Rooij H. Salomons G.S. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The selective S49AR clone could be grown continuously in 15 μm ALP with a doubling time of 12 h, similar to that of the parent S49 cells. All experiments with S49AR cells were performed with cells grown without the selection agent for at least 1 week. Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, cultured overnight, and incubated for the indicated time periods with various concentrations of Et-18-OCH3 (ALP). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed overnight at 4 °C in 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (22Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using Lysis software. Cells were grown to a density of 2.5 × 106/ml and ALP was added in the apoptotic concentration of 15 μm, supplemented with 0.2 μCi of [3H]ALP/ml. At given time points samples were taken followed by a 2-min incubation on ice and three washes with cold PBS. Samples were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH for scintillation counting. Back-extraction of ALP was performed by washing the cells with PBS containing 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. Cells were grown to a density of 2.5 × 106/ml and incubated for 30 min with Alexa-488 fluorescently labeled human transferrin (1 μg/ml) or with the fluorescent fluid-phase marker, Sulforhodamine 101 (25 μg/ml). Endocytosis of these compounds was stopped on ice. Cells were washed thoroughly with cold PBS and the fluorescence measured by FACScan analysis (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FCS express software. Cells at 2.5 × 106cells/ml were incubated with [methyl- 14C]choline chloride (1 μCi/ml) or [14C]LPC (0.1 μCi/ml). At the given time points, aliquots of cells were taken, washed, and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and phase separation was induced using 1 m NaCl. The organic phase was washed in a solution of methanol/H2O/chloroform (235:245:15, v/v/v), and separated by silica TLC, using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (60:30:8:5, v/v/v/v). Radioactive lipids were visualized and quantified using a Fuji BAS 2000 TR PhosphorImager and identified using internal standards, which were visualized by iodine staining. A lipid raft fraction was prepared by detergent extraction of cells and sucrose gradient centrifugation, essentially as described (23Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to a density of 2.0 × 106/ml, spun down, and washed with 2× 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized into 2 ml of ice-cold MBST buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc) and homogenized with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes). The extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS (lacking Triton X-100) and put on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was prepared by overlaying 5 ml of 40% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS), respectively. The tubes were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 16–18 h at 4 °C and 12× 1.0-ml fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient. For incorporation of ALP in lipid rafts, cells were incubated with [3H]Et-18-OCH3 (ALP; 0.2 μCi/ml; 15 μm) for 5 min to allow insertion into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Sphingomyelin levels in each fraction were determined after 24 h radiolabeling with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-14C]choline-HCl, after Triton X-100 solubilization and sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by TLC separation (system, see above). The ganglioside, GM1, level in each fraction was determined by a dot-blot technique using cholera toxin B binding. In short, 2.5 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, air-dried, and washed with PBS. Membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS, and incubated with 1 μg/ml cholera toxin B for 30 min at 4 °C. Blots were washed and incubated with rabbit anticholera toxin B in a 1:500 dilution and followed by an incubation at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig (1:7500). Spots were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Amersham ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthetic ether lipid Et-18-OCH3 (Edelfosine; ALP) induces apoptosis in S49 cells in a dose-dependent fashion, with an EC50 of about 12 μm (Fig. 1,A and B). The onset of apoptosis in the S49 cell population was already apparent after 3 h. Apoptosis was maximal (80%) at 7 h, whereas half-maximal values were reached after 4 h (data not shown). The ALP-resistant variant S49ARdid not undergo apoptosis during the time period of the experiment and at the ALP concentration range tested (Fig. 1 A). To understand how ALP induces apoptosis in S49 cells and why S49AR cells are resistant, we followed the suggestion that ALP would inhibit thede novo synthesis of PC (7Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Using [14C]choline pulse-chase labeling, we found that ALP blocks [14C]choline incorporation into the PC and CDP-choline pools in S49 cells, but virtually not in S49ARcells (data not shown). ALP had virtually no effect on [14C]phosphocholine levels. These results are consistent with the notion that ALP inhibits the rate-determining enzyme in the Kennedy pathway of PC synthesis, CT (7Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Contrary to S49 cells, this enzyme does not appear to be a target of ALP in the resistant S49AR variant. Because apoptosis induction by ALP correlated with inhibition of de novo PC synthesis, we questioned whether this lack of newly generated PC is the direct trigger that initiates the apoptotic machinery. To test this, we provided the cell with an alternative way to generate PC, that is by adding LPC via the culture medium. LPC, structurally related to ALP, readily incorporates in the plasma membrane and is very rapidly acylated to PC in S49 cells (Fig.2), but notably much slower in S49AR cells. (The latter is of interest, and may be because of reduced endocytic uptake of LPC, as will be clarified below.) ALP has no effect on the rate of LPC acylation. Fig. 1 B shows the effect of exogenous LPC on ALP-induced apoptosis. In the Nicoletti (FACScan) apoptosis assay (22Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar), ALP induces the appearance of a subdiploid peak of nuclear fragments (Fig. 1 B). Addition of LPC (25 μm) prevents the formation of this apoptotic population. Of note, ALP with or without LPC does not change the distribution among G1/S/G2 of the cell cycle, which is at variance with published data in a different cell system (24Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11612-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that LPC rescues S49 cells from ALP-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion, with 25 μm being the most effective concentration. This effect of LPC is specific for ALP-induced apoptosis, because apoptosis induced by other treatments (etoposide and γ-radiation) remained unaffected by the addition of LPC (data not shown). Unlike ALP, these treatments had no effect on PC synthesis (data not shown). From these observations we conclude that inhibition of PC synthesis is sufficient to induce apoptosis, and that continual, unimpeded PC synthesis/turnover is important for cell survival. LPC, through conversion to cellular PC, alleviates ALP inhibition of PC synthesis and consequently rescues cells from ALP-induced apoptosis. LPC does not affect apoptosis induced by agents that have no direct effect on PC turnover. CT, the target of ALP, is known to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus (13Clement J.M. Kent C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the questions how ALP is internalized in S49 cells and if the resistance of S49AR cells might be because of their inability to internalize the ether lipid. Fig.3 shows that, in time, the uptake of radiolabeled ALP in the S49AR cells was considerably less than in S49 cells. Initially, the two cell types bound the same amount of label. However, after 30 min the uptake of ALP leveled off in S49AR cells but not in S49 cells. Because the uptake of ALP in S49 cells does not reach saturation, it is unlikely that it would be mediated by a receptor (like that for PAF), which agrees with other reports (1Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bazill G.W. Dexter T.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7505-7512PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruiter G.A. Verheij M. Zerp S. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Instead, we envision that ALP, because of its single long alkyl chain, easily inserts into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer, prior to and/or during internalization. Employing the strong binding of ALP to albumin, we determined with albumin back-extraction (25van Meer G. Stelzer E.H. Wijnaendts-van-Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) the fraction of [3H]ALP that remained located in this outer leaflet, and how much was internalized in time. Fig. 3 shows that, initially, most of the [3H]ALP associated to S49AR cells could be back-extracted by albumin, particularly during the first 30 min (this is also shown in an alternative way in the inset of Fig. 3). In contrast, in S49 cells, the majority of ALP remained cell-associated after back-extraction at all times, indicating that, in these cells, ALP is rapidly internalized. Interestingly in this respect, exogenous LPC (being structurally similar to ALP) is only slowly converted to PC in S49AR cells compared with S49 cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that S49AR cells, which show reduced ALP internalization, likewise show a reduced LPC internalization. Of note, ALP does not affect LPC uptake (conversion to PC; Fig. 2). The same holds for the reverse: addition of LPC does not affect the uptake of ALP by the cells (data not shown). We conclude that addition of ALP to S49 cells leads to its almost instantaneous internalization, in contrast to S49AR cells where ALP internalization is significantly delayed and occurs in lower amounts. We next addressed the question how this rapid internalization in S49 cells occurs. Basically, two mechanisms could be envisioned: (a) passive diffusion involving plasma membrane transbilayer movement (flip-flop), which is unlikely because it is a relatively slow process (26Sprong H. van Der S.P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), at least when it occurs spontaneously; (b) via formation, budding off, and intracellular release of membrane vesicles from the plasma membrane, i.e. endocytosis. We tested the latter, a more likely mechanism by two different ways to block endocytosis. First, cells were kept at 4 °C. Indeed, an ∼80% reduced uptake of ALP was observed in S49 cells during a 2-h time period (data not shown). In the cold, the amount of ALP associated to S49 cells was the same as to the S49AR cells. Moreover, under these conditions the same amount (about 90%) of ALP could be back-extracted from these cells by albumin (data not shown), indicative of the same outer leaflet plasma membrane location of ALP in the two cell types in the cold. Therefore, the difference of (nonextractable) ALP retention seen in Fig. 3 (first 30 min at 37 °C) between the two cell types is likely to be ascribed to endocytosis in the S49 cells. The second way by which we blocked endocytosis was with monensin, which acts via altering membrane electropotential and pH (27Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Also this treatment reduced ALP uptake in S49 cells (∼50%), reaching the low level of uptake in the S49AR cells (Fig.4 A). Uptake in S49AR cells was not further affected by monensin, suggesting that the low level of ALP internalization in these resistant cells does not occur via endocytosis (at least not sensitive to monensin), but possibly via transbilayer movement. Importantly, monensin blocks ALP-induced apoptosis of S49 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 B), which further supports the notion that monensin, through inhibition of endocytosis, prevents ALP to reach its target (CT) in the ER for initiation of apoptosis. Together, these results strongly suggest that in S49 cells, ALP is taken up by endocytosis, whereas in S49AR cells, endocytosis of ALP is impaired. Cells can make use of clathrin-dependent or -independent routes of endocytosis, for signal transduction or uptake of nutrients. Fig. 5 (upper panel) shows that the ALP-resistant S49AR cells have normal receptor-mediated uptake of (fluorescent) transferrin, known to occur via clathrin-coated pits. Also the uptake of Sulforhodamine 101, a fluorescent marker for clathrin-independent fluid-phase endocytosis, does not differ between S49 and S49AR cells (Fig. 5,lower panel). Thus, the difference in ALP uptake between the two cell types must be because of a different mechanism of endocytosis. Therefore, we tested another clathrin-independent route of endocytosis, more recently discovered, that is via lipid rafts (28Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 29Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 30Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Based on its structure, with an ether bond and a single saturated alkyl chain, ALP (Et-18-OCH3) is predicted to accommodate to the rigid, sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched membrane rafts (31Mattjus P. Bittman R. Slotte J.P. Langmuir. 1996; 12: 1284-1290Crossref Google Scholar, 32van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Meer B.W. Hilkmann H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We tested this directly by isolation of rafts using the well established method of Triton X-100 solubilization and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (23Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). When cells were incubated with radiolabeled ALP for 5 min, most of the ether lipid was found accumulated in raft fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 6 C), and in equal amounts for S49 and S49AR cells. ALP co-distributed with the typical raft marker sphingomyelin (Fig.6 A). Another raft marker, the ganglioside GM1, visualized by cholera toxin B labeling using a dot-blot technique (Fig.6 B), accumulated in the same region of the gradient albeit consistently at a slightly higher density. Disruption of rafts by treatment of cells with MβCD, which extracts cholesterol, resulted in the redistribution of GM1 and ALP to non-raft fractions (Fig. 6,B and D). From the data so far, we have concluded that ALP, after insertion into the plasma membrane, reaches its intracellular target, CT, by an endocytotic mechanism that does not involve clathrin-coated pits nor fluid-phase endocytosis. Because ALP accumulates in lipid rafts, we tested the involvement of these microdomains in the endocytic uptake of ALP by disrupting the rafts in three different ways. First, by MβCD, which extracts cholesterol; second, by filipin, which forms lateral complexes with cholesterol within the membrane; third, with bacterial sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes the major raft component sphingomyelin (33Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Each treatment abrogated to different extents the capability of S49 cells to take up ALP (Fig. 7, at 120 min), without causing plasma membrane leakage (as determined by the lack of trypan blue uptake) or altering cell morphology (controls not shown). Fig. 7 also shows that the initial binding of ALP to the plasma membrane, measured at 10 min, was not affected by raft disruption. Although this disruption caused a partial displacement of ALP of the rafts (Fig.6 D), the overall initial binding of ALP to the plasma membrane remained the same. Only the subsequent cellular uptake through internalization was blocked by the raft disruption. We next tested whether raft disruption abrogated the inhibitory action of ALP on the de novo synthesis of PC and the induction of apoptosis. Fig. 8 A shows, in S49 cells, the time-dependent incorporation of [14C]choline into PC, which is 50% inhibited by ALP. This inhibition of PC synthesis is prevented by prior disruption of lipid rafts by bacterial sphingomyelinase or MβCD. These treatments alone did not affect PC synthesis (controls not shown). Fig.8 B shows that raft disruption by MβCD prevents ALP-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We thus conclude that intact rafts are required for the endocytic uptake of ALP by S49 cells, and the subsequent inhibition of PC synthesis that leads to the induction of apoptosis. Given that ALP partitions equally well in the raft fraction of S49AR cells (Fig. 6 C), it remains to be investigated why rafts in these cells do not mediate ALP internalization. In this paper, we have shown that apoptosis induction by ALP requires its endocytosis, depending on intact lipid rafts, to inhibitde novo biosynthesis of PC at the level of CT inside the cell. Because an alternative pathway of PC synthesis, i.e.the acylation of exogenous LPC, alleviates shortage of newly produced PC and rescues cells fro"

Here we analyze the pore forming activity of poliovirus 2B and several of its variants. Solubilization of 2B protein was achieved by generating a fusion protein comprised of poliovirus 2B attached to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) as an N-terminal solubilization partner. MBP-2B was assayed using large unilamellar vesicles as target membranes. This fusion protein was able to assemble into discrete structures that disrupted the permeability barrier of vesicles composed of anionic phospholipids. The transbilayer aqueous connections generated by MBP-2B were stable over time, allowing the passage of solutes of molecular mass under 1,000 Da. Oligomerization was investigated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our data indicate that MBP-2B aggregation occurs at the membrane surface. Moreover, MBP-2B binding to membranes promoted the formation of SDS-resistant tetramers. We conclude that MBP-2B forms oligomers capable of generating a tetrameric aqueous pore in lipid bilayers. These findings are the first evidence of viroporin activity shown by a protein from a naked animal virus.

These findings are the first evidence of viroporin activity shown by a protein from a naked animal virus. Enteroviruses are nonenveloped animal viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Infection by species of theEnterovirus genus leads to significant alterations in cell membranes, including morphological changes and functional modifications (for review, see Refs. 1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Google Scholar and 2Carrasco L. Guinea R. Irurzun A. Barco A. Semler B. Wimmer E. The Picornaviruses. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 337-354Google Scholar). Of the cellular alterations induced by viral infection, enhancement of plasma membrane permeability is among the most relevant. Increased membrane permeability occurs at two well defined times during the viral infection cycle: at an early stage, when virus particles enter cells, and late during infection, when most viral products are being synthesized (1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Google Scholar, 2Carrasco L. Guinea R. Irurzun A. Barco A. Semler B. Wimmer E. The Picornaviruses.

Sanz M.A. Ayala M.J. Carrasco L. Sonenberg N. Wimmer E. Regulation of Gene Expression in Animal Viruses. Plenum Publishing Corp., London1993: 283-305Google Scholar). Late membrane leakiness, occurring from the 3rd h postinfection, requires viral gene expression. Initially it involves the diffusion of ions and small molecules, but not macromolecules, through the plasma membrane (4Carrasco L. Smith A.E. Nature. 1976; 264: 807-809Google Scholar, 5Carrasco L. Nature. 1978; 272: 694-699Google Scholar). Intense efforts have been made to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Some years ago, it was argued that the intracellular accumulation of viral particles and/or massive expression of viral products might be the triggering factors for enhanced permeability and eventual lysis of the cell. Contrary to this idea, cumulative evidence suggests that the sole expression of certain enterovirus proteins might be responsible for the increase in membrane permeability (6Lama J. Carrasco L. J.

Particularly, the individual expression of 2B and 2BC proteins of coxsackie virus B3 and poliovirus has been shown to reproduce several late infection effects, such as changes in plasma membrane permeability (7Aldabe R.

Because of their capacity to alter the permeability barrier of cell membranes, these enteroviral proteins have been proposed to represent the first examples of “viroporins” from naked viruses (7Aldabe R.

Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Google Scholar). Enterovirus 2B proteins are hydrophobic overall and rather small (∼100 amino acids). Hydrophobicity within the 2B sequence appears to be distributed across two main domains (2Carrasco L. Guinea R. Irurzun A. Barco A. Semler B. Wimmer E. The Picornaviruses. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 337-354Google Scholar, 15Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Google Scholar): a first stretch (amino acids 32–55 in poliovirus), which is partially amphipathic as a cationic α-helix at the N terminus (amino acids 34–49 in poliovirus), and a second hydrophobic region, which might constitute a transmembrane domain (TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: ANTS, 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid sodium salt; DOPG, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol; DPPG, dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol; DPX, p-xylenebis(pyridinium)bromide; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; IANBD, N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine; Kx , apparent mol fraction partition coefficient; LUV(s), large unilamellar vesicle(s); MBP, maltose-binding protein; N-NBD-PE, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine; SAPG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylglycerol. (amino acids 61–81 in poliovirus). This distribution seems to be functionally meaningful because mutations altering either first domain amphipathicity or second domain hydrophobicity have been shown to interfere with the ability of 2B to increase permeability (7Aldabe R.

In an effort to gain further insight into the cytolytic processes that occur during enteroviral infection, we explored the molecular mechanism used by poliovirus 2B protein to disrupt the permeability barrier of phospholipid vesicles. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) encapsulating different solutes in their aqueous compartments were employed to monitor the kinetics of solute release and entry into the membrane-bound aqueous compartments. This model system allowed the definition of several requirements for pore formation by 2B in terms of individual lipids, protein doses, and limiting size of the solutes able to cross the membrane. The experimental data presented here indicate that poliovirus 2B may assemble into tetrameric aqueous pores of diameter in the range of 5–10 Å in anionic bilayers. Our experimental approach and findings contribute to a better knowledge of the structural and functional features of viroporins (1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Google Scholar). N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine (N-NBD-PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylglycerol (SAPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) andN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD), 8aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid sodium salt (ANTS), and p-xylenebis(pyridinium)bromide (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). Plasmids encoding maltose binding protein (MBP)-2B fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning poliovirus 2B-encoding DNA into pMALc2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Mutants were subsequently obtained by PCR as described previously (17Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All constructs were produced as MBP fusion proteins from pMALc2 vectors using Escherichia coli BL21 as the host strain. A 20-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, which was incubated further at 37 °C until an A 600value of 0.5 was achieved. The cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for an additional 3 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in a 5 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) buffer solution with protease inhibitors and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant was applied to an affinity amylose-agarose column. MBP proteins were eluted with Hepes buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose. Eluted fractions were subsequently subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min). Purified proteins obtained from the supernatants were characterized by SDS-PAGE in 3–13% gradient gels followed by silver staining (Pierce Chemical Co.). LUVs were prepared according to the extrusion method of Hope et al. (18Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Google Scholar) in 5 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). The lipid concentrations of the liposome suspensions were determined by phosphate analysis (19Böttcher C.S.F. van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Google Scholar). The mean diameter of vesicles was 95 nm as estimated by quasielastic light scattering using a Malvern Zeta-Sizer instrument. The average vesicle size did not change upon treatment with MBP-2B at any of the tested doses. Release of vesicular contents into the medium was monitored routinely by the ANTS/DPX assay (20Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Google Scholar). LUVs containing 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mmHepes were obtained by separating the unencapsulated material by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-75 column eluted with 5 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Osmolarities were adjusted to 200 milliosmolar in a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Fluorescence measurements were performed by setting the ANTS emission at 520 nm and the excitation at 355 nm. A cutoff filter (470 nm) was placed between the sample and the emission monochromator. The absence of leakage (0%) corresponded to fluorescence of the vesicles at time zero; 100% leakage was taken as the fluorescence value obtained after addition of 0.5% v/v Triton X-100. The degree of permeabilization was then inferred from Equation1 %leakage=((Ff−F0)/(F100−F0))×100Equation 1 where F f is the fluorescence determined after the addition of protein, F 0 is the initial fluorescence of the intact LUV suspension, andF 100 is the fluorescence value after the addition of Triton X-100. The extent of ANTS release was determined after fluorescence intensity reached a plateau (routinely >60 min). Vesicles were stored at 4 °C and used within 1–2 days. No spontaneous leakage of entrapped material was observed for vesicles stored at 4 °C for at least 1 week. Release of aqueous contents induced by MBP-2B was complementarily assessed after trapping Evans blue and NADH into the LUVs. Leakage of these compounds into the medium was assayed by absorbance as described elsewhere (21De los Rios V. Mancheño J.M. Lanio M.E. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 284-289Google Scholar). Entry of solutes into vesicles was evaluated through selective reduction of the NBD probe residing in the inner leaflet of vesicle membranes according to the method described by McIntyre and Sleight (22McIntyre J.C. Sleight R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Google Scholar). Vesicles symmetrically labeled with N-NBD-PE (0.6 mol %) were incubated with protein for 30 min at 37 °C. Dithionite (10 mm) was then added to the protein-vesicle mixtures. The degree of vesicle permeabilization was inferred from the percentage of reduced internal (NBDi). This value was calculated using Equation 2 %reduced NBDi=((F0−Ff)/(F0−F100))×100Equation 2 where F 0 and F fcorrespond to the NBD fluorescence values after the addition of dithionite to sealed and protein-treated vesicles, respectively, andF 100 is the fluorescence value of vesicles solubilized with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and incubated with dithionite. MBP-2B protein contains two single Cys residues within the 2B sequence (positions 73 and 86). This allowed the specific labeling of 2B with thiol-reacting NBD (MBP-2B-NBD) and ANS (MBP-2B-ANS) fluorophores. Briefly, iodoacetamide derivatives IANBD and IAEDANS were added to 6 μm dithiothreitol-free preparations of 2B at a final 6:1 molar ratio and incubated overnight in the dark at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mmdithiothreitol. The unreacted probe fraction was separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column eluted with 5 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Eluted protein samples were subsequently concentrated by filtration-centrifugation (4,000 ×g) using a Centricon system (Amicon-Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a cutoff of 10,000 Da. Labeling efficiency was estimated as described elsewhere (23Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Hozeman L. van-der-Brink E. Pap E.H. Egmond M.R. Verheij H. Dekker N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7398-7405Google Scholar). For MBP-2B-ANS, excitation and emission maxima were observed at 339 and 482 nm, respectively; for MBP-2B-NBD, the maxima were 481 (excitation) and 529 nm (emission). MBP-2B-NBD was subsequently used to estimate the apparent mol fraction partition coefficient, Kx. Partitioning curves were produced by monitoring the fractional change in emitted NBD fluorescence from MBP-2B-NBD titrated with increasing lipid concentrations. Fluorescence was recorded in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MPF-66 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission monochromators set at 480 and 530 nm, respectively, and corresponding slits of 5 nm. Values of Kx were determined by fitting the experimental values to the hyperbolic function F/F0=1+((Fmax/F0)−1)[L]Kd+[L]Equation 3 where [L] is the lipid concentration andKd is the apparent dissociation constant, or lipid concentration at which the bound protein fraction is 0.5. Thus,Kx = [W]/K dwhere [W] is the molar concentration of water (24White S. Wimley W.C. Ladokhin A.S. Hristova K. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 62-87Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions in solution and at membrane surfaces were monitored through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from MBP-2B-ANS to MBP-2B-NBD. FRET was measured by the donor quenching method (23Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Hozeman L. van-der-Brink E. Pap E.H. Egmond M.R. Verheij H. Dekker N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7398-7405Google Scholar), comparing MBP-2B-ANS emission spectra in the presence and absence of the acceptor MBP-2B-NBD. Corrected spectra were recorded in a MPF-66 spectrofluorometer with excitation set at 339 nm and slits of 5 nm (excitation) and 10 nm (emission). The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined according to Stryer (25Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Google Scholar) from the relative fluorescence intensity of the ANS in the absence (Q0) and presence (QT) of MBP-2B-NBD in the vesicles as shown in Equation 4. E=1−(QT/Q0)Equation 4 Oligomerization in the membranes was also evaluated using SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Samples consisted of 0.1 nm protein incubated with increasing lipid concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C. Silver-stained gels were digitalized, and the relative amount of MBP-2B oligomers produced was quantified using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Poliovirus 2B is a small, hydrophobic protein. To characterize its porin-like activity, recombinant 2B versions that were suitable for purification and stable in aqueous solution had to be prepared using several approaches. Solubilization of 2B alone overexpressed in bacteria requires the presence of high amounts of detergent in the medium, which interferes with leakage measurements in a vesicular system (data not shown). From the different possibilities considered for the production of aqueous soluble 2B fusion proteins, MBP was selected as the best option on the basis of its weak affinity for anionic membranes (see below). In consequence, MBP-2B constructs were expressed in bacteria and the fusion protein purified as an aqueous soluble species. In a further effort to obtain pure 2B versions from these fusion constructs, samples were subjected to proteolysis with factor Xa. MBP-2B cleavage by Xa to produce free 2B resulted in low yields and reduced the solubility of the 2B product. An additional attempt to generate isolated 2B involved treating the membrane-bound MBP-2B with the Xa protease. However, this protease readily induced clotting of the lipid vesicles, preventing the progression of the reaction. Synthesis of MBP-2B allowed characterization of the porin-like activity of 2B in a vesicular system. Thus, for the experiments described below in which we evaluated the particular features of MBP-2B interaction with vesicle membranes (permeabilization, partitioning, and surface oligomerization), it should be noted that under similar conditions, control experiments confirmed that MBP alone showed no detectable effect. The data shown in Fig. 1 reveal the ability of MBP-2B to permeabilize LUVs composed of anionic phospholipid. Coencapsulation of ANTS and DPX probes in vesicles extinguishes most of the ANTS fluorescence. Release of this probe to the medium may be followed by increased fluorescence because of the relief of DPX quenching upon dilution (20Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Google Scholar). The size of these solutes (molecular mass, ∼425 Da) is in the range of that of the aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B (molecular mass, 527.5 Da) widely used for 2B-induced cell permeability measurements (6Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Google Scholar, 7Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Google Scholar, 9Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Google Scholar, 12Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Google Scholar,14Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3560-3570Google Scholar). However, we caution here that experimental evidence for 2B localized at the plasma membrane has only been obtained for coxsackie virus 2B in both transfected COS cells and infected HeLa cells (8Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Kijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar). In poliovirus 2B-expressing cells the protein has been localized at intracellular membranes (7Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Google Scholar, 13Sandoval I.V. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4679-4693Google Scholar), and therefore the possibility that internal membrane permeabilization is indirectly responsible for enhanced permeability of the plasma membrane should not be excluded. Fig. 1 A shows the typical kinetics of the aqueous contents of liposomes spilling into the medium upon incubation with MBP-2B. It may be seen that a plateau was reached, depending on the protein:lipid mol ratio (Fig. 1 B). Saturation with time is consistent with a permeabilization process mediated by structures irreversibly attached to the lipid bilayers, i.e. not interchanging in the different vesicles in the samples. 2B-induced permeabilization in PI vesicles started at protein:lipid mol ratios >1:50,000. According to the apparent mol fraction partition coefficient estimated for this system (see below), ∼70% of the added protein was associated with lipid vesicles under these measuring conditions. Initiation of leakage at such low protein doses in the membrane suggests that lysis was mediated by a highly specific mechanism. Thus, lysis was not a mere consequence of adding massive amounts of protein to the bounding vesicle membrane. To validate the previous assay as specifically measuring 2B lytic function, we next explored the effects of 2B variants (Fig.2). The changes in the protein sequence of the mutant MBP-2B proteins generated were reported previously to affect the ability of 2B to permeabilize cell membranes. The K39E/K42E/K46E mutation, affecting the cationic amphipathic α-helix, reduces plasma membrane permeability toward hygromycin B as well as the capacity of 2B to disrupt intracellular Ca2+homeostasis (8Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Kijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar, 12Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, this MBP-2B variant showed severely impaired induction of the release of the LUV solute contents to the medium. As shown in Fig. 2 this triple amino acid substitution in 2B reduced both the extent and the initial rate of vesicle permeabilization by ∼80 and ∼90%, respectively. V52D/I54K polar substitution within the hydrophobic residue cluster at the C-terminal end of the amphipathic helix has been shown to interfere with 2B ability to enhance membrane permeability in HeLa cells (7Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Google Scholar). This nonconservative mutation reduced both the extent and the initial rates of vesicle permeabilization by ∼40 and ∼65%, respectively. In comparison, a conservative/nonconservative A66G/L68R double substitution within the second hydrophobic domain of 2B (14Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3560-3570Google Scholar) had no effect on the permeabilization levels attained, although the initial rate of vesicle permeabilization was reduced by ∼30%. A further double A69E/I71E polar substitution that decreases second domain hydrophobicity in the 2B protein (16Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Google Scholar) reduced the extent of permeabilization by ∼50% and slowed the process by ∼70%. In summary, the data derived from the set of MBP-2B variants tested appear to reinforce the functional significance of the hydrophobic domains within 2B sequences, highlighting the physiological relevance of thein vitro vesicle assay. The permeabilization phenomenon described above showed a strict requirement for anionic phospholipids in the membrane composition (Table I). Vesicles made of electrically neutral PC were not permeabilized efficiently by MBP-2B. Mixing PC with PE and/or cholesterol did not result in efficient permeabilization either (data not shown). Among the negatively charged PI and PS species present in cell membranes, the highest efficiency was observed for vesicles made of pure PI, whereas PS was a poor substrate for the lytic activity of the protein. To ascertain whether the PI effect was caused by the specific recognition of inositol by MBP-2B versus the serine polar head group, or different acyl chains predominantly present in both lipids (see Table I), 2B lytic activity was assayed in negatively charged vesicles made from synthetic PGs containing acyl chains of different length and degree of saturation. The data shown in Table I indicate that MBP-2B was unable to permeabilize PG with acyl chains comparable with those mainly present in PS. In contrast, vesicles made of synthetic SAPG with a fatty acid composition similar to that of PI were readily permeabilized by the protein. It is of note that most of PC lipid acyl chains were also similar to those present in PI. Thus, according to these results it seems that the combination of negatively charged polar head groups with a minimal amount of long unsaturated acyl chains was required to sustain an optimal 2B lytic activity in vitro.Table IEffect of lipid composition on MBP-2B-induced LUV permeabilizationLUV compositionHead group chargeHydrocarbon chainaPrevalent acyl chains according to the supplier specifications.% LeakagebPercent changes in extents of ANTS/DPX leakage induced at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:8,000 (mol:mol) are given, relative to pure PI.

Mean values of two independent measurements are indicated. Open table in a new tab The experiments described in Fig. 3 were designed to assess the stability and size of the permeabilizing structures assembled by MBP-2B. Several prerequisites need to be satisfied to be able to conclude that leakage takes place via the irreversible assembly of discrete lytic pores: (i) the complex should not interchange from one vesicle to another once inserted in the lipid bilayer; (ii) the pore should allow continuous passage of solutes,i.e. membrane integrity is not to be transiently perturbed as a consequence of the mere insertion of the protein; and (iii) there has to be a size limit for molecules able to leak out from the vesicles. MBP-2B exchange between vesicles was analyzed in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 A. The results show that the ability of MBP-2B to permeabilize ANTS-containing PI vesicles was reduced with the time of preincubation with empty PI vesicles (Fig. 3 A). No inhibition was detected using empty PC vesicles, indicating that the blocking effect is probably induced by the irreversible attachment of MBP-2B to the anionic PI membranes. The stability of the MBP-2B lytic structure was evaluated by combining solute leakage out with solute entry assays (Fig. 3 B). The rationale behind these experiments was that if leakage out reflects the formation of discrete pores, they should also allow the entry of solutes once the pores have formed. Permeable vesicles were produced by preincubating PI LUVs wit"

Here we show that noscapine does not compete with paclitaxel for tubulin binding and can efficiently inhibit the proliferation of both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells (i.e. the parental cell line 1A9 and two derivative cell lines, 1A9PTX10 and 1A9PTX22, which harbor β-tubulin mutations that impair paclitaxel-tubulin interaction (Giannakakou, P., Sackett, D. L., Kang, Y. K., Zhan, Z., Buters, J. T., Fojo, T., and Poruchynsky, M. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17118–17125). Strikingly, these cells undergo apoptotic death upon noscapine treatment, accompanied by activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK). Furthermore, inhibition of JNK activity by treatment with antisense oligonucleotide or transfection with dominant-negative JNK blocks noscapine-induced apoptosis. These findings thus indicate a great potential for noscapine in the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant human cancers. In addition, our results suggest that the JNK pathway plays an essential role in microtubule inhibitor-induced apoptosis.

During cell division, microtubules form a bipolar microtubule array, called the mitotic spindle, that functions in the distribution of chromosomes into two daughter cells (1McIntosh J.R. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 413-434Google Scholar). Assembled from αβ-tubulin heterodimers, microtubules are highly dynamic structures that alternate between periods of growth and shortening (2Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar), and the dynamic instability property is crucial for microtubules to carry out many of their cellular functions (3Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Disruption of microtubule dynamics can lead to the formation of abnormally stable or unstable microtubules, thereby preventing the normal dynamic rearrangements of the microtubule network required for cell proliferation (4Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).One group of agents that target microtubules, such as colchicine, nocodazole, and the vinca alkaloids, inhibit microtubule polymerization. Another group of agents, such as taxoids and epothilones, however, promote microtubule polymerization and stabilize microtubules. Nevertheless, they all disrupt microtubule dynamics, block cell cycle progression at mitosis, and then cause cell death (4Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This provides the molecular basis for the use of microtubule targeting compounds in chemotherapeutic treatment of human cancers.Microtubule drugs currently in clinical use for cancer chemotherapy include paclitaxel (Fig. 1 A), docetaxel, and the vinca alkaloids. Specifically, paclitaxel has proven effective against refractory ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (5Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 353-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 6Crown J. O'Leary M. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1176-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and the vinca alkaloids are effective against cancer types such as lymphoma, leukemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma (7van Tellingen O. Sips J.H. Beijnen J.H. Bult A. Nooijen W.J. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1699-1715PubMed Google Scholar, 8Haskell C.M. Haskell C.M. Cancer Treatment. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 78-165Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the toxicity and low aqueous solubility have limited the applicability of taxoids and vinca alkaloids in cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, their use has been hampered by the development of drug resistance contributed by multifactorial mechanisms, such as overexpression of P-glycoprotein (9Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar, 10Bradley G. Ling V. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), altered expression of tubulin isotypes (11Burkhart C.A. Kavallaris M. Horwitz S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: O1-O9PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of tubulin mutations (12Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Therefore, development and/or discovery of microtubule-based compounds are in demand, especially for the treatment of human cancers resistant to currently used drugs.We have previously identified noscapine (Fig. 1 A), an opium alkaloid, as a microtubule targeting agent that binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and alters tubulin conformation (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Like many other microtubule drugs, noscapine suppresses microtubule dynamics, arrests mammalian cells at mitosis, causes apoptosis, and exhibits potent antitumor activity (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Ye K. Zhou J. Landen J.W. Bradbury E.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, distinct from other microtubule drugs, noscapine does not affect the total polymer mass of tubulin and does not cause gross deformation of cellular microtubules even at high concentrations (15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, the low toxicity, water solubility, and feasibility for oral administration are very valuable advantages of noscapine over many other microtubule drugs for future clinical use in cancer chemotherapy (16Dahlstrom B. Mellstrand T. Lofdahl C.G. Johansson M. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Haikala V. Sothmann A. Marvola M. Eur. J. Clin.

Immunother. 2000; 49: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In this study, we find that noscapine does not compete with paclitaxel for tubulin binding and can efficiently inhibit the proliferation of both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. In addition, noscapine causes these cells to die through the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1-mediated apoptosis pathway. These findings thus not only offer a rationale for the use of noscapine in the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant human cancers, but they also provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which microtubule targeting agents inhibit cell proliferation and cause cell death.DISCUSSIONMicrotubules are highly dynamic polymers that are crucial for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis through formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. To ensure faithful chromosome transmission, eukaryotic cells have evolved a surveillance mechanism called the spindle assembly checkpoint, which halts mitotic progression when the spindle has a defect or chromosomes are not properly attached by spindle microtubules (45Zhou J. Yao J. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not surprising then that many chemical compounds that target microtubules can arrest cells at mitosis, a property attributed to the use of microtubule targeting agents in cancer chemotherapy. Notable examples are paclitaxel, docetaxel, and the vinca alkaloids, which have proven successful in clinical use (5Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 353-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 6Crown J. O'Leary M. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1176-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7van Tellingen O. Sips J.H. Beijnen J.H. Bult A. Nooijen W.J. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1699-1715PubMed Google Scholar, 8Haskell C.M. Haskell C.M. Cancer Treatment. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 78-165Google Scholar). However, the clinical applicability of these microtubule targeting drugs is hampered by their low aqueous solubility and toxicity. Moreover, although patients have impressive initial response to these drugs, many of them relapse after treatment because of the development of drug resistance. Consequently, considerable effort has been made over the past decade to develop and/or discover novel antimicrotubule agents that have similar modes of action to the currently used drugs but with improved biological and pharmaceutical features.During a systematic screen based on structural similarity of known microtubule targeting agents, we have identified the opium alkaloid noscapine as a microtubule targeting agent (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Noscapine acts mechanistically similar to many other microtubule agents, in that it binds to the tubulin subunit of microtubules, alters microtubule dynamics, blocks mitotic progression, causes apoptosis, and has potent antitumor activity (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Ye K. Zhou J. Landen J.W. Bradbury E.M. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46697-46700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that noscapine can effectively inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant (because of β-tubulin mutations that affect paclitaxel binding) human ovarian carcinoma cells. This is in agreement with the assumption that noscapine binds to tubulin at a site different from the paclitaxel-binding site, as indicated by the noninhibitory effect of noscapine on paclitaxel binding to tubulin (Fig. 1). It will be of great importance to test in the nude mice model whether noscapine can inhibit the growth of tumors formed from the transplantation of paclitaxel-resistant human cancer cells.Unlike many other microtubule targeting drugs, noscapine does not significantly promote or inhibit microtubule polymerization even at high concentrations, nor does it affect the total polymer mass of tubulin (15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When applied to tissue culture cells, noscapine does not cause gross deformations of cellular microtubules. Instead, noscapine alters the steady-state dynamics of microtubule assembly, which is sufficient to arrest mitosis (15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This unique feature of noscapine would assume that other microtubule-dependent cellular events such as organelle distribution and axonal transport are not affected, which are serious concerns for many currently used microtubule-targeting anticancer drugs. Indeed, noscapine has been found to cause little or no toxicity to the kidney, heart, liver, bone marrow, spleen, or small intestine, and does not inhibit primary humoral immune responses in mice (19Ke Y., Ye, K. Grossniklaus H.E. Archer D.R. Joshi H.C. Kapp J.A. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 49: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because noscapine is water-soluble and absorbed after oral administration (16Dahlstrom B. Mellstrand T. Lofdahl C.G. Johansson M. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Haikala V. Sothmann A. Marvola M. Eur. J. Clin.

Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), its chemotherapeutic potential in the treatment of human cancers merits thorough evaluation, particularly for cancers that are resistant to the currently used drugs.Several lines of compelling evidence suggest that antimicrotubule agents are able to induce both morphological and biochemical features of the typical apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, cell membrane blebbing, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (46Bhalla K. Ibrado A.M. Tourkina E. Tang C. Mahoney M.E. Huang Y. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 563-568PubMed Google Scholar, 47Jordan M.A. Toso R.J. Thrower D. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been thought that this might result from the inhibition of microtubule polymerization or depolymerization. Because noscapine suppresses microtubule dynamics without obvious effects on microtubule polymerization or depolymerization (15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), yet can induce characteristic apoptosis in a variety of cell types (Fig. 4; also see Refs. 13Ye K., Ke, Y.

Bradbury E.M. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46697-46700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we propose that apoptotic cell death caused by anti-microtubule agents might reflect the disruption of the normal physiological balance in microtubule dynamics rather than the action of them on the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules.It has been suggested that antimicrotubule agents might trigger apoptosis through a variety of phosphoregulatory pathways. For example, signal transduction pathways mediated by Ras, Raf-1, and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase) have been implicated in apoptosis induced by paclitaxel (29Wang T.H. Wang H.S.

The JNK pathway, which was initially thought to participate in apoptosis induced by environmental stress, proinflammatory cytokines, or growth factor withdrawal (40Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar), has been recently shown to play a role in microtubule dysfunction-induced apoptosis as well (41Wang T.H.

Goodwin M.E. Birrer M.J. Chambers T.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4450-4458PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus understandable that noscapine, being a microtubule targeting agent, induces apoptosis through a similar mechanism.JNK activation has been observed in cells treated with microtubule targeting agents such as paclitaxel and vinblastine (28Stone A.A.

In addition, activation of JNK by paclitaxel has been suggested to require interactions between microtubules and paclitaxel (29Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T.

We find that noscapine causes nearly equal JNK activation among human ovarian carcinoma cell lines 1A9 and the two derivative, β-tubulin mutant cell lines, 1A9PTX10 and 1A9PTX22 (Figs. 5 and 6). This finding is consistent with the observation that paclitaxel caused JNK activation only in the parental 1A9 line but not in the two derivative lines harboring β-tubulin mutations that impair paclitaxel binding to tubulin (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Our data suggest that these mutations do not affect noscapine interactions with tubulin nor the downstream effects leading to apoptosis. In addition, our data also support the notion that noscapine does not bind at the paclitaxel site on tubulin. At present, it remains unclear how the microtubule interactions of microtubule targeting agents mediates the activation of JNK, which in turn leads to the occurrence of apoptosis. The level of JNK activity in the untreated ovarian carcinoma cells may appear slightly high relative to some other reports in the field (see for example, Ref. 41Wang T.H. Popp D.M. Wang H.S. Saitoh M. Mural J.G. Henley D.C. Ichijo H. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8208-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the JNK pathway may be already slightly activated in these cells before the experiments start because of their being cultured in paclitaxel-containing medium 7 days prior to the experiments.Taken together, we describe here that the antimicrotubule agent noscapine is highly effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in human ovarian carcinoma cells sensitive or resistant to paclitaxel. In addition, we demonstrate that the JNK pathway plays a role in noscapine-induced apoptosis. In the future, it will be of great interest to explore the use of noscapine in the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant human cancers. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which JNK mediates the apoptotic cell death induced by noscapine may also facilitate its use in cancer chemotherapy. Microtubules are cytoskeletal components that play a critical role in many cellular processes, such as maintenance of cell shape and polarity, intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles, and beating of cilia and flagella. During cell division, microtubules form a bipolar microtubule array, called the mitotic spindle, that functions in the distribution of chromosomes into two daughter cells (1McIntosh J.R. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 413-434Google Scholar). Assembled from αβ-tubulin heterodimers, microtubules are highly dynamic structures that alternate between periods of growth and shortening (2Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar), and the dynamic instability property is crucial for microtubules to carry out many of their cellular functions (3Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Disruption of microtubule dynamics can lead to the formation of abnormally stable or unstable microtubules, thereby preventing the normal dynamic rearrangements of the microtubule network required for cell proliferation (4Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One group of agents that target microtubules, such as colchicine, nocodazole, and the vinca alkaloids, inhibit microtubule polymerization. Another group of agents, such as taxoids and epothilones, however, promote microtubule polymerization and stabilize microtubules. Nevertheless, they all disrupt microtubule dynamics, block cell cycle progression at mitosis, and then cause cell death (4Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This provides the molecular basis for the use of microtubule targeting compounds in chemotherapeutic treatment of human cancers. Microtubule drugs currently in clinical use for cancer chemotherapy include paclitaxel (Fig. 1 A), docetaxel, and the vinca alkaloids. Specifically, paclitaxel has proven effective against refractory ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (5Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 353-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 6Crown J. O'Leary M. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1176-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and the vinca alkaloids are effective against cancer types such as lymphoma, leukemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma (7van Tellingen O. Sips J.H. Beijnen J.H. Bult A. Nooijen W.J. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1699-1715PubMed Google Scholar, 8Haskell C.M. Haskell C.M. Cancer Treatment. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 78-165Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the toxicity and low aqueous solubility have limited the applicability of taxoids and vinca alkaloids in cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, their use has been hampered by the development of drug resistance contributed by multifactorial mechanisms, such as overexpression of P-glycoprotein (9Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar, 10Bradley G. Ling V. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), altered expression of tubulin isotypes (11Burkhart C.A. Kavallaris M. Horwitz S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: O1-O9PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of tubulin mutations (12Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Therefore, development and/or discovery of microtubule-based compounds are in demand, especially for the treatment of human cancers resistant to currently used drugs. We have previously identified noscapine (Fig. 1 A), an opium alkaloid, as a microtubule targeting agent that binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and alters tubulin conformation (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Like many other microtubule drugs, noscapine suppresses microtubule dynamics, arrests mammalian cells at mitosis, causes apoptosis, and exhibits potent antitumor activity (13Ye K., Ke, Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Ye K. Zhou J. Landen J.W. Bradbury E.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, distinct from other microtubule drugs, noscapine does not affect the total polymer mass of tubulin and does not cause gross deformation of cellular microtubules even at high concentrations (15Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, the low toxicity, water solubility, and feasibility for oral administration are very valuable advantages of noscapine over many other microtubule drugs for future clinical use in cancer chemotherapy (16Dahlstrom B. Mellstrand T. Lofdahl C.G. Johansson M. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Haikala V. Sothmann A. Marvola M. Eur. J. Clin.

Immunother. 2000; 49: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that noscapine does not compete with paclitaxel for tubulin binding and can efficiently inhibit the proliferation of both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. In addition, noscapine causes these cells to die through the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1-mediated apoptosis pathway. These findings thus not only offer a rationale for the use of noscapine in the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant human cancers, but they also provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which microtubule targeting agents inhibit cell proliferation and cause cell death. DISCUSSIONMicrotubules are highly dynamic polymers that are crucial for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis through formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. To ensure faithful chromosome transmission, eukaryotic cells have evolved a surveillance mechanism called the spindle assembly checkpoint, which halts mitotic progression when the spindle has a defect or chromosomes are not properly attached by spindle microtubules (45Zhou J. Yao J. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not surprising then that many chemical compounds that target microtubules can arrest cells at mitosis, a property attributed to the use of microtubule targeting agents in cancer chemotherapy.

However, the specifics of this interaction are unknown. It has been suggested that amphipathic helices of apoA-I bind to a lipid domain created by the ABCA1 transporter. Alternatively, apoA-I may bind directly to ABCA1 itself. To better understand this interaction, we created several truncation mutants of apoA-I and then followed up with more specific point mutants and helix translocation mutants to identify and characterize the locations of apoA-I required for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We found that deletion of residues 221–243 (helix 10) abolished ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from cultured RAW mouse macrophages treated with 8-bromo-cAMP. Point mutations in helix 10 that affected the helical charge distribution reduced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol effluxversus the wild type. We noted a strong positive correlation between cholesterol efflux and the lipid binding characteristics of apoA-I when mutations were made in helix 10. However, there was no such correlation for helix translocations in other areas of the protein as long as helix 10 remained intact at the C terminus.

Castelli W.P. Hjortland M.C. Kannel W.B. Dawber T.R. Am. J. Med. 1977; 62: 707-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). ApoA-I, a 28-kDa protein, is critical to HDL function in reverse cholesterol transport, the delivery of peripheral tissue cholesterol to the liver for catabolism. ApoA-I is thought to mobilize cellular cholesterol by at least two general mechanisms. The first is passive diffusion of cell membrane cholesterol down a concentration gradient to a phospholipid-containing lipoprotein (for a review, see Ref. 2Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that lipid-poor forms of apoA-I can actively remove cholesterol by directly interacting with the cell membrane to form a nascent HDL particle in a process called apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux (3Mendez A.J.

Studies on a rare genetic disorder, Tangier disease, have shown that active apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transfer is necessary for the initial formation of the HDL particle. Tangier patients exhibit extremely low HDL levels and low plasma apoA-I and accumulate cholesteryl esters in many macrophage-containing tissues such as tonsils, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen (7Schaefer E.J. Zech L.A. Schwartz D.E. Brewer H.B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses on Tangier kindreds have implicated the ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA1) as the molecular defect (8Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H.

It is likely that lipid-free apoA-I is rapidly cleared from plasma unless it becomes associated with lipid through interaction with the ABCA1 transporter, making the ABCA1/apoA-I interaction critical for the initial formation of HDL particles (11Horowitz B.S.

There are two prevailing hypotheses describing the interaction. First, several investigators have argued that a direct protein-protein binding event occurs between apoA-I and the ABCA1 transporter (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

However, numerous studies have shown that a majority of the plasma apolipoproteins containing lipophilic class A amphipathic helices can promote lipid efflux (4Yancey P.G. Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J.

Lipids. 1992; 27: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious common binding sequence among these apolipoproteins has cast doubt on the idea of a highly specific interaction with ABCA1. In light of these studies, a second hypothesis has been proposed suggesting an interaction between apoA-I and lipid domains in the cell membrane formed by ABCA1, a suspected membrane lipid translocase (5Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 281Google Scholar). In addition, several of the studies on non-apoA-I acceptors have shown a strong correlation between lipid binding affinity/helical contentversus measured apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux (3Mendez A.J.

Knowledge of the necessary regions of apoA-I and the characteristics that make them critical for the interaction would provide valuable information on the mechanism of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux. Two previous studies have used deletion mutants to suggest that the extreme C terminus of apoA-I is required for lipid efflux via this mechanism in human fibroblasts (5Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

However, the deletion of a large region of apoA-I could be envisioned to have profound effects on long range structural interactions within the tertiary structure of the free protein, i.e. the structure of some other active region of the protein could have been perturbed. In addition, the C terminus of apoA-I is well known to be responsible for lipid binding (23Minnich A. Collet X. Roghani A. Cladaras C. Hamilton R.L. Fielding C.J. Zannis V.I. J. Biol.

Because the ultimate product of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux is a lipidated form of apoA-I, it is perhaps not surprising that a protein lacking its best lipid-binding region did not perform well in the assay. To further study this question, we employed three mutagenesis strategies. First, we performed deletion mutagenesis to confirm the results from the studies mentioned above. Second, we followed up these studies with subtle point mutagenesis in the active region to reduce the likelihood of large changes in protein structure. Finally, we made “helix swap” mutants in which one helix of apoA-I was replaced with another to maintain protein length and number of helical domains. We found that helix 10 of apoA-I is critical for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from RAW macrophages and that its unique charge characteristics are critical in this role. Furthermore, we show that the lipid affinity of mutants containing helix 10 mutations correlates positively with lipid release from cells. However, we found no such correlation when other areas of the protein were mutated as long as an intact helix 10 was present at the C terminus. From these observations, we propose a new model for the apoA-I/ABCA1 interaction that we believe fits the majority of the available data. IgA protease was purchased from Mobitech (Marco Island, FL). BL-21(DE3) Escherichia coli and the pET30 vector were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was from Fisher. 1-Palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 8-Bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cAMP was from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum and phosphate-buffered saline were from Invitrogen. RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All chemical reagents were of the highest quality available. The manipulations to the DNA sequence of the apoA-I cDNA were accomplished in the pET30 vector using standard PCR techniques. The construct contained a histidine tag sequence with an IgA protease cleavage site (for a detailed description of the protein expression and purification protocol see Ref. 26Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R. Horace E.M. Nicholas M.J. Sean D.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the mutant Δ1–43, the forward primer 2For primer information please contact the corresponding author. included a clamp region complimentary to helix 1 of the gene (as numbered by Roberts et al. (27Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader M.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7615-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), a flap region with the sequence for an IgA protease cleavage site, and an NcoI cleavage site for ligation of the PCR product into the pET30 expression vector. The reverse primer was the M13 reverse primer. The [email protected] mutant was created in a similar fashion. Note: the [email protected] notation refers to the replacement of the sequence for helix X with the sequence for helix Y (see Fig. 3). The [email protected] mutant was designed with a clamp region complimentary to helix 9 and a flap region with the sequence of helix 1; this primer was the antisense primer, and the T7 promoter primer was the forward primer. The [email protected] and was made by inserting a PCR-amplified product of helix 10 into the new location, using the Fsp1 and Nar I sites. Δ165–220 was created by simply placing a stop codon after the first repeat of helix 10 in the [email protected] construct. For the latter mutants, PCR amplification was carried out using a Perkin Elmer thermocycler: 1 min hold at 94 °C; 30 rounds of 94 °C for 1.5 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min; followed by a hold for 10 min at 72 °C to ensure full extension. Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) was utilized for the reactions. The PCR product was cut with NcoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and HindIII (Invitrogen) and ligated into the pET30 vector cut with the same enzymes. The sequence of each construct was verified on an Applied Biotechnology System DNA sequencer at the University of Cincinnati DNA core. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Novagen, Madison, WI) was utilized to make the point mutations in apoA-I. The PCR was performed directly in the pET30 vector (94 °C, 1 min; 18 cycles of 94 °C, 1 min, 72 °C 1 min, 68 °C 10 min; followed by an additional 10 min at 68 °C to assure full extension). Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to create the C-terminal truncation mutants by adding a stop codon at the indicated location. The pET30 vectors containing the mutant apoA-I constructs were transfected into BL-21E. coli cells, expressed, and purified according to established methods (26Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R.

The transformed mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The cells were grown to 75% of confluence in a 48-well plate, then growth medium was removed, and [3H]cholesterol labeling medium was added for 24 h (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (Amersham Biosciences); 0.5 ml/well). After 24 h, the labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% BSA and once with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. Efflux medium was added (DMEM, 0.2% BSA, 10 μg/ml acceptor (apoA-I or specified mutant), with or with out 0.3 mm cAMP). A 100-μl sample of efflux medium was removed after 24 h and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove any floating cells. The amount of [3H]cholesterol in the medium was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of efflux was calculated by dividing the counts in the medium by total counts in the cells at time 0 (28Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N.

DMPC in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) was dried in a glass tube and brought up in 1 ml of standard Tris buffer at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Multilamellar liposomes were formed by sonication for 30 s with a model 550 sonic dismembrator at level 5 with a microtip (Fisher). The experiments were performed in a AmershamBiosciences Ultraspec 4000 at a constant temperature of 25 °C, as maintained by circulating water bath, by adding the acceptor apolipoproteins to the liposomes (in standard Tris buffer) at a mass ratio of 2.5:1 (DMPC:protein). The change in light scattering was recorded over 30 min at 325 nm. The curves were normalized by calculating the percentage of turbidity clearance as a percentage of original light scatter at T 0 (before lipid-free acceptor was added). The rates were calculated for the first 5 min of the assay. The data were fit to a single exponential decay curve as a function of time (t): f(t) =a −kt using Sigma Plot 2000 (29McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). rHDL particles were prepared using 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at lipid to protein molar ratios of 110:1 according to the method of Jonas (30Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The lipids were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in Tris salt buffer. Deoxycholate (1.3:1, w/w, deoxycholate:lipid) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h with mild vortexing every 15 min. The protein was then added and incubated a 37 °C for 1 h. The cholate was dialyzed against standard Tris buffer (five changes of 2 liters). The particles were analyzed on a nondenaturing, native polyacrylamide gel using the Phast gel electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences) (31Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The samples were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml on 20 mm phosphate buffer. The spectra were taken in a Jasco S-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path-length quartz cuvette. The spectra were accumulated over wavelengths of 250–185 nm. The percentage of α-helix was calculated from mean residual ellipticity at λ = 222 nm (32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). For guanidine denaturation studies, the samples were prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) with increasing amounts of guanidine (ranging from 0 to 5.85 m) for guanidine denaturation curves and incubated for 3 days at 4 °C (33Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We chose the RAW 264 mouse macrophage cell line for these studies because ABCA1 is up-regulated in both message and protein by incubation with cAMP analogs. This has been well documented by others (16Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as well as confirmed in our lab (data not shown). This system is well suited to our study because the ability of the various mutants to promote cholesterol efflux could be compared in the presence or comparative absence of ABCA1 by incubating with or without the cAMP analog. We made two deletions in the C terminus of human apoA-I by inserting stop codons at amino acids 220 and 208. We also deleted the N-terminal 43 amino acids, which likely exist in a globular conformation (35Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and have not been implicated in cholesterol efflux as a positive control for the deletion process (Fig.1, top panel). The ABCA1-mediated efflux (Fig. 1, open bars) is distinguished from nonspecific levels of cholesterol efflux by comparison with samples without the cAMP analog (Fig. 1, hatched bars). Importantly, plasma apoA-I and our recombinant wild type apoA-I (WT) exhibited similar abilities to promote apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, demonstrating that the recombinant protein was fully functional in this assay (26Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R. Horace E.M. Nicholas M.J. Sean D.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The removal of the N-terminal 43 amino acids did not perturb apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux. However, the C-terminal truncations within apoA-I mutants reduced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux nearly to background levels. This confirms studies in other cell types (5Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

We used site-directed mutagenesis to make more subtle point mutants that perturbed charge on the polar face of helix 10. The polar face was targeted because our experience indicated that changes in this region are less likely to perturb the overall structure of the lipid-free protein than those targeting the nonpolar face (data not shown). We selected sites for mutation based on the unique properties of helix 10 versus the other 22-amino acid helices within apoA-I (Fig. 2; see “Discussion”). The following point mutants were generated: the positively charged Lys at position 238 (Fig. 2, *, K238E) was changed to negatively charged Glu. This change occurs at helical wheel position 19 (when Pro220 is considered the 1 position) in helix 10 and changes the class Y character of the helix to more like the class A helices in the protein. The neutrally charged Ser at position 224 (Fig.2, $, S224D) was changed to a negatively charged Asp because this position (helical wheel position 5) contains an acidic residue in every other 22-amino acid helix of apoA-I. Additionally, a negatively charged Glu at position 235, near the edge of the polar face at helical wheel position 16, was changed to a positively charged Lys (Fig. 2, @, E235K), to further change the charge distributions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed to analyze the effects of the mutations on the total secondary structure of the protein. The average helical content for S224D, E235K, and the WT protein in the lipid-free form was 53 ± 5%, with no major differences apparent among them, indicating that the charge mutations did not have a major effect on the secondary structural content of the protein. This observation was not surprising because we have previously shown that the C terminus does not contribute substantial helicity to the protein in the lipid free state (24Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). K238E consistently exhibited a slightly lower helical content of about 48%, indicating that this change may have had a slight effect on the secondary structure of the protein. In addition, all three mutants exhibited similar free energies of denaturation (all three proteins averaged together of 3.1 kcal/mol ± 0.5) to the WT protein (2.8 kcal/mol ± 0.2) and human plasma apoA-I (2.9 kcal/mol ± 0.3). All three mutants formed rHDL particles of similar diameter as the WT protein when reconstituted with 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine at a molar ratio of phos"

Using an E. coli two-hybrid system, together with BIAcore apparatus, we investigated the ability of three proteins, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), RhlB RNA helicase, and enolase, a glycolytic protein, to interact physically and functionally independently of RNase E. Here we report that Rh1B can physically bind to PNPase, both in vitro and in vivo, and can also form homodimers with itself.

BIAcore analysis revealed real-time, direct binding for bimolecular interactions between Rh1B units and for the RhlB interaction with PNPase. Furthermore, in the absence of RNase E, purified RhlB can carry out ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded RNA and consequently modulate degradation of double-stranded RNA together with the exonuclease activity of PNPase. These results provide evidence for the first time that both functional and physical interactions of individual degradosome protein components can occur in the absence of RNase E and raise the prospect that the RNase E-independent complexes of RhlB RNA helicase and PNPase, detected in vivo, may constitute mini-machines that assist in the degradation of duplex RNA in structures physically distinct from multicomponent RNA degradosomes.

Interestingly, in addition to mRNAs, highly structured, stable RNA fragments have also been found to be associated with RNA degradosome complexes (3Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Google Scholar, 23Bessarab D.A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.-L. Liou G.-G. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Degradosome complexity and its cooperation with individual protein components acting on degradation-targeted RNA, in vivo, remains to be discovered. Various approaches revealing protein-protein interactions in the degradosome indicate that the C-terminal region of RNase E serves as a scaffold that directly binds PNPase, RhlB RNA helicase, and enolase (24Kaberdin V.R. Miczak A. Jakobsen J.S. Lin-Chao S. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11637-11642Google Scholar, 25Vanzo N.F., Li, Y.S., Py, B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C.

Raynal L.C. Krish H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Google Scholar) or reported. Recently, a mini-degradosome complex (26Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Google Scholar) containing the scaffold region (without the N-terminal enzymatic region of RNase E), RhlB RNA helicase, and PNPase was reconstitutedin vitro. These experiments revealed a functional interaction between RhlB RNA helicase and PNPase: RhlB helicase bound to the RNase E C-terminal region leads to subsequent ATP-activated degradation of a stem-loop segment intermediate RNA by PNPase. In the absence of the RNase E C-terminal region, RNA degradation does not occur. This led to the proposal that interaction between both RNase E-bound PNPase and RhlB helicase attacks the 3′-end of a structured mRNA (26Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that, in vivo, the steady state levels of individual component degradosome proteins differ and that degradosome protein components can exist both bound and unbound to RNase E (27Liou G.-G. Jane W.-N. Cohen S.N. Lin N.-S. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 63-68Google Scholar). Thus the potential exists for the formation of protein complexes other than those formed on the RNase E scaffold to target RNAs for degradation. Here, we have addressed this question by investigating possible interactions among degradosome protein components independently of RNase E. We show, both in vivoand in vitro, that RhlB RNA helicase binds directly to PNPase and that the binding aids double-stranded RNA degradation by PNPase. These findings indicate that functionally important interactions between degradosome components can occur in the absence of the degradosome scaffold and suggest the existence of a dynamic network of degradosome components in vivo that targets various kinds of structured RNAs for rapid degradation by PNPase-RhlB complexes. The E. colistrains BZ99 (his ΔtrpE5 mukB106 smbB199(λ))(28) and DHP1 (F− glnV44(AS) recA1 endA1 gyrA96(Nalr) thi1 hsdR17 spoT1 rfbD1 cya)(29) were used to overexpress degradosome protein components and study in vivoprotein-protein interactions, respectively. BZ99 contains a truncatedrne gene that encodes amino acids 1–602 of the Rne protein. DHP1 is an adenylate cyclase (cya)-deficient derivative of DH1 (30Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Google Scholar). The plasmid pGP1–2, containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a temperature-sensitive bacteriophage λ repressor (31Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar), was used to conditionally induce the synthesis of individual proteins. A PCR-generated EcoRI-XhoI fragment encoding full-length PNPase or RhlB RNA helicase and aNdeI-BamHI fragment encoding full-length enolase, were individually inserted into FLAG-containing vectors (the corresponding plasmids were termed pflag-PNP, pflag-RhlB and pflag-ENO). Proteins were purified using an M2 affinity column as described (3Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Google Scholar). To study protein-protein interactions, a series of pT18- or pT25-based vectors (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar) encoding genes of interest were constructed: pT25RE12, pT25PNP, pT25ENO, pT25RhlB, pT25RhlB1, pT25RhlB2, pT25RhlB3, pT25RhlB12, pT25RhlB13, and pT25RhlB23. These constructs were generated by the insertions of a PCR-generated PstI-BamHI fragment encoding truncated peptides of Rne (i.e. RE12: residues 684–784), full-length PNPase, enolase, RhlB RNA helicase and some distinct motifs of RhlB polypeptide (i.e. RhlB1: residues 1–194; RhlB2: residues 194–368; RhlB3: residues 351–421; RhlB12: residues 1–368; RhlB13: residues 1–194, and 368–421; RhlB23: residues 194–421, respectively), into the pT25-based vector. Plasmids pPNPT18, pRhlBT18, and pENOT18, were generated by the insertions of a PCR-generated XhoI-HindIII fragment encoding full-length PNPase, RhlB, helicase and enolase, respectively, into the pT18-based vector (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were partially sequenced to confirm correct open reading frames. E. coli two-hybrid assays were performed on MacConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose as described (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar). Antibiotic concentrations were 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for ∼2–3 days; photographs of individual plates were taken using the Kodak DC120 digital camera (Eastman Kodak) with KDS1D program (Eastman Kodak). The strength of interactions between individual pairs of proteins was determined by assaying β-galactosidase activity on bacterial suspensions as previously described (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). For individual protein assays, log-phase 30 °C bacterial cultures at cell densities of ∼2–5 × 108 cells/ml (A 600 of ∼0.3–0.7) were used. Under identical experimental condition, we also carried out β-galactosidase activity measurements, resulting from the interaction between T25-zip and T18-zip leucine zipper motifs (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar) to normalize individual protein assays. For individual pairs of protein-protein interactions, triplicate samples or more were studied. The FLAG-tagged PNPase, RhlB RNA helicase, and enolase were purified as previously described (3Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Google Scholar) except that cell debris was removed from cell lysate by centrifugation at 18,000 × g(versus 10,000 × g) for 15 min. To purify unbound protein components, the supernatant was precipitated with 60% (instead of 40%) saturation of ammonium sulfate, incubated on ice for 15–30 min and pelleted down by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was dissolved in buffer A containing 20% glycerol, adjusted to 12.5 ml, and filtered with a 0.45-μm filter. The protein was then purified on an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) column according to the manufacturer's instruction by using 1 ml of solution of synthetic FLAG oligopeptide (1 mg/ml) (PAN Laboratory, Stanford University). Prior to elution, 1 ml of 0.1 mg/ml FLAG oligopeptide solution and 2 ml of buffer A containing 20% glycerol were used to remove/wash weakly interacting proteins. For BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analysis, the purified proteins were then dialyzed against 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight. The enzymatic activities were monitored as described (see later section on activity assays). Real time protein-protein interactions were examined on a BIAcore instrument (BIAcore X). RhlB RNA helicase and bovine serum albumin were immobilized on different flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip using an amine-coupling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, the chip surface was first activated by injection of 35 μl of 1:1 mixture of 0.4 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Native RhlB RNA helicase (70 μl of 35 μg/ml) in 100 mmphosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, (optimal buffer components as determined by trial preconcentration experiments) was immobilized on one flow cell, and an additional flow cell was prepared as a blank background by immobilization of bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml) under the same buffer conditions. Remaining activated groups on each flow cell were blocked by injection of 35 μl of 1m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. The chip was then washed twice with 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH to remove any non-covalently bound proteins. Finally, the system was primed with the running buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mmNaCl). The interaction assays were performed with a constant (10, 20, or 30 μl/min as indicated) flow rate at 25 °C. Individually distinct concentrations, ranging from 5 to 50 nm (as shown in Fig.3) of purified native RhlB RNA helicase, PNPase, or enolase were injected as analytes. The chemical binding groups were regenerated by sequentially washing the analytes with 10 μl of injection of 0.1m NaOH, 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 3.5) and 10% ethanol until a background level was attained. RNA oligonucleotides used for RNA helicase unwinding and the PNPase degradation assay were double-stranded substrates that resulted from the annealing of a short single-stranded oligo 5′-AGC GCA GUA CC and its complementary longer single stranded oligo 5′-ACA GUA UUUGGUACUGCGCUC U (synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc.). Underlined nucleotides indicate the complementary region with the short strand RNA oligo. The RNA sequences of long strand RNA are identical to the 5′-end sequences of RNAI, the antisense RNA of ColEI-type plasmids (18Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Google Scholar), and contain an RNase E cleavage site (33Lin-Chao S. Wong T.T. McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10797-10803Google Scholar, 34McDowall K.J. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10790-10796Google Scholar, 35McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R., Wu, S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Google Scholar). Both strands were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (35McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R., Wu, S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Google Scholar). The labeled RNA strands were hybridized to form duplex RNA substrates made by combining “short” and “long” RNA in a 1:1.5 ratio. The excess of long RNA ensured that the majority of the labeled RNA formed duplex RNA substrates. RNA annealing was performed by adding equal volumes of 2× hybridization buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA) to long and short RNA mixtures, in which samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The duplex RNAs (25 fmol) were incubated with purified RhlB RNA helicase alone or with mixtures of PNPase and RhlB RNA helicase at 37 °C in final reaction volumes of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 3 mmATP. Each reaction was terminated by adding a 2 μl of stop solution (2.2% Ficoll 400, 0.11 m EDTA, 1.1% SDS, 0.275% bromphenol blue, 0.275% xylene cyanol FF). Samples were separated on a 16% polyacrylamide native gel (19:1 bisacrylamide) in 1× TBE. Labeled RNAs were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by LAS-1000 plus (Fuji Film). General methods to identify interacting proteins or to study protein-protein interactions have been developed extensively. Among them, the two-hybrid systems currently represent the most powerful in vivo approaches. Here, we applied theE. coli two-hybrid approach (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar) to study possible interactions among degradosome protein components. Individual degradosome component proteins were fused to two complementary fragments of the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussisadenylate cyclase into plasmids pT25- and pT18-based vectors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig.1 A, the pink/red phenotypes displayed on MacConkey/maltose plates demonstrates that RhlB RNA helicase is able to interact not only with the RE12 fragment (residues 684–784 of RNase E region are sufficient for interaction with the helicase) 1G.-G. Liou, H.-Y. Chang, C.-S. Lin, and S. Lin-Chao, unpublished data. but also with itself and the PNPase. However, under the same conditions, no interactions between the RhlB and enolase or enolase and PNPase (Fig.1 C) were detected. We quantified the β-galactosidase activity in individual transformants grown to log-phase culture to determine the efficiency of adenylate cyclase functional complementation, representative of the strength of functional interactions between two protein components (29Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 B, the strength of functional interactions is similar between RhlB RNA helicase-RE12 and RhlB-RhlB RNA helicases and both are stronger (about 4-fold) than that of the RhlB RNA helicase-PNPase interaction. Consistently, the β-galactosidase activity assay indicated a lack of any interaction between enolase and the two degradosome component proteins, RhlB and PNPase (Fig. 1, Band C). To identify the regions of RhlB RNA helicase directly responsible for its protein-protein interactions, several truncated RhlB derivatives were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” based on the predicted conserved sequence and functional motifs of a DEAD box helicase family (36de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Google Scholar, 37Lüking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, RhlB1 consists of the ATPase motif. RhlB2 consists of the RhlB RNA helicase region including helicase and RNA interaction motifs. RhlB3 consists of the C-terminal region and lacks any conserved motifs. RhlB12, RhlB13, and RhlB23 consist of RhlB1 and -2, RhlB1 and -3, and RhlB2 and -3, respectively. In the E. coli two-hybrid system, both color phenotypes on MacConkey/maltose plates and β-galactosidase activity assays showed that RhlB23 was sufficient to interact with RE12 and PNPase (Fig. 2,B–D, E–G, respectively). Interestingly, the region of RhlB sufficient for interaction with PNPase and RE12 fails to interact with itself. RhlB RNA helicase self-interaction requires full-length RhlB RNA helicase (Fig. 2, H andJ). The β-galactosidase activity assay indicates that the strength of interaction between RhlB23 and RE12 is a little weaker than that between full-length RhlB RNA helicase and RE12 (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, the strength of interaction between RhlB23 and PNPase is similar to that between full-length RhlB RNA helicase and PNPase (Fig.2 G). To examine direct interactions between components of the degradosome, we used purified component proteins and an in vitro real-time binding assay using BIAcore apparatus (38Hutchinson A.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 47-54Google Scholar). The unbound and FLAG-tagged protein components PNP, RhlB RNA helicase, and enolase were purified from BZ99 (an E. coli mutant containing only the RNase E N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–602)), and their enzymatic activities were confirmed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3 A shows Coomassie Blue staining of high purity purified proteins. For the BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analyses (38Hutchinson A.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 47-54Google Scholar), RhlB RNA helicase was first immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and different concentrations of three distinct native degradosome proteins, enolase, RhlB helicase, and PNPase (Fig. 3, B–D), were individually injected over the chip surface, and the sensorgrams recorded. In these analyses, the sensorgrams, in general, show an initial rapid increase in response units upon protein injection followed by the association of injected proteins with molecules coated on the chip and a slower association phase characteristic of reversible protein interaction, resulting in a plateau indicative of interacting saturation or equilibrium (Fig. 3). After a change of buffer, there is a rapid decrease in response unit/signal followed by the dissociation phase. As shown in Fig.3 B, the sensorgrams did not detect any RhlB-enolase interaction, whereas significant interaction responses were detected for RhlB with itself and with PNPase (Fig. 3, C andD, respectively). These results indicated that RhlB helicase was able to directly interact with PNPase and itself but not with enolase (Fig. 3 B). The sensorgrams (Fig. 3, C–E) also indicated that the affinity of the RhlB RNA helicase interaction with itself was higher than that of its interaction with PNPase (only 12.5 nm is shown in Fig. 3 E). These results are consistent with the results of our E. coli two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B). We further addressed whether the non-monomeric form of RhlB RNA helicase can directly interact with PNPase. As shown by sensorgrams, purified RhlB RNA helicase interacted with itself, after which these self-associated molecules of RhlB RNA helicase were still able to bind to PNPase (Fig. 4). Thus, these results illustrated that under the experimental conditions carried out, a dimeric (or multimeric) form of RhlB RNA helicase can physically bind to PNPase. In contrast to previously reported degradosome studies, which used a mini-degradosome complex containing the C-terminal region of RNase E, here we assessed the possibility of functional interaction between RhlB and PNPase in the absence of RNase E. The unwinding activity of RhlB RNA helicase was examined using classical gel electrophoresis assays (39Matson S.W. Bean D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 389-405Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P and annealed to form a double-stranded RNA substrate (labeled as double-stranded RNA). As shown in Fig. 5 RhlB RNA helicase was able to unwind duplex RNA (Fig. 5, lanes 2–7), and this effect was RhlB-concentration-dependent (comparelanes 6 and 7 versus 5). As a result of the unwinding activity of RhlB, a decrease in double-stranded RNA and an increase in single-stranded RNA were observed. In the absence of RhlB under the same reaction conditions PNPase quickly degraded single stranded RNA (labeled as long or short) but not double-stranded RNA (Fig. 5, lanes 8–10 versus 11). Collectively, these experiments indicate that the unwinding ability of RhlB enables PNPase to rapidly degrade duplex double-stranded RNA. Here we report that RNA degradosome protein component RhlB interacts with PNPase independently of RNase E, which up to this point has been believed to be the necessary building scaffold for interactions among degradosome proteins. RhlB and PNPase interact through the C-terminal region of RhlB RNA helicase enabling PNPase to degrade double-stranded RNA substrates. We also show that monomers of RhlB interact among themselves, although at a site distinct from the one that interacts with PNPase. It is interesting that Rh1B binds more strongly to itself and to an RNase E fragment than it does to PNPase. There are a number of reasons, both biochemical and cellular, that may explain this result. First, the interaction surface (between the two proteins) may be more favorable for RhlB binding to RNase E than for the RhlB-PNPase interaction. Second, from a cellular perspective, RNase E is a membrane-associated protein of relatively low abundance compared with the highly abundant cytoplasmic PNPase; PNPase is present in E. coli in excess of RNase E and has been detected in cells unattached to the RNase E scaffold (27Liou G.-G. Jane W.-N. Cohen S.N. Lin N.-S. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 63-68Google Scholar). If the RhlB-PNPase interaction is stronger than the RhlB-RNase E interaction, this may affect the availability of RhlB to bind to RNase E and form degradosome complexes. This in turn could compromise RNA degradation via a membrane-associated degradosome response. Our results indicate that to degrade double-stranded RNA, PNPase would need to recruit Rh1B helicase to open the double-stranded RNA secondary structure, thereby allowing the exonuclease action of PNPase to degrade the RNA, lending support to the hypothesis that DEAD box RhlB helicase function is necessary for degradosome-mediated RNA decay. Our findings also suggest that multimers of Rh1B RNA helicase may form and bind directly to molecules of PNPase, independently of RNase E, to form mini-degradation engines in E. coli capable of removing RNA degradation intermediates (products) that have secondary structures. A 3′–5′ exonuclease complex, termed the “exosome,” has been identified in yeast cells (41Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevcheno A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Google Scholar, 42Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 843-846Google Scholar) with exosome protein component equivalents also discovered in mammalian cells (43Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Google Scholar). Recent modeling experiments (44Aloy P. Ciccarelli F.D. Leutwein C. Gavin A.C. Superti-Furga G. Bork P. Böttcher B. Russell R.B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 628-635Google Scholar) suggest that exosomes may use the 3′–5′ exonuclease PNPase at their core. Although, E. coli degradosome models have considered RNase E to be at the core of this bacterial ribonucleolytic complex (25Vanzo N.F., Li, Y.S., Py, B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krish H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Google Scholar), our discovery of PNPase-based complexes that do not include RNase E, provides a molecular basis for alternative pathways of E. coli RNA decay independent of RNase E-mediated endonucleolytic cleavages. Recent evidence suggesting that functional inactivation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA in E. coli cell extracts occurs by a mechanism other than endonucleolytic cleavage (45Lee K. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23268-23274Google Scholar), and earlier findings showing that mutations of the RNase E-encoding rne gene affects chemical half-life but not functional decay (13Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 343-357Google Scholar) are consistent with this view. It has been suggested that enolase is the β subunit of α3β2 form PNPase (PNPase is the α subunit) (4Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Google Scholar), although no experimental proof has been forthcoming. However, our results indicate that RhlB RNA helicase, not enolase, is a native component of the PNPase complex. We detected no binding between enolase and PNPase (a similar conclusion also has been discussed by Kühnel and Luisi (Ref. 46Kühnel K. Luisi B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 583-592Google Scholar; see “Discussion”)). The yeast two-hybrid system also failed to detect any interaction between the two proteins (25Vanzo N.F., Li, Y.S., Py, B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krish H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown in this study that RhlB contains as ATP-dependent RNA unwinding ability (not demonstrated prior to this study) and that this ATP-activated unwinding activity enables PNPase to degrade double-stranded RNA; whether the binding of RhlB to PNPase regulates PNPase catalytic activity or vise versa remains to be clarified. Far Western and yeast two-hybrid analyses of interactions between RNase E truncated polypeptides and RhlB have shown that RhlB binds directly to both the central (500–752) and C-terminal (734–1061) regions of RNase E, suggesting that important determinants for the binding are located in the small overlap region (734–752) of RNase E segments; other interactions among degradosome protein components were not detected (25Vanzo N.F., Li, Y.S., Py, B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krish H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Google Scholar). Using E. coli two hybrid and BIAcore biosensor analyses, we detected RhlB self-interaction and direct binding to PNPase, in addition to its interaction with the RNase E (684–784). These results indicate that the protein conformation of various fusion products of RhlB and PNPase used for yeast and E. coli two-hybrid analyses differ and thus that it is appropriate to explore multiple approaches for the study of protein-protein interactions. Use of the BIAcore biosensor to analyze real time interactions among degradosome protein components and between protein component and RNA substrates to determine their kinetic constants may help to elucidate the mechanism by which the dynamic processes of degradosome assembly and RNA degradation interrelate.

https://openalex.org/W2141887017,"Previous studies have demonstrated that U937 cells are able to mobilize arachidonic acid (AA) and synthesize prostaglandins in response to receptor-directed and soluble stimuli by a mechanism that involves the activation of Group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2α. In this paper we show that these cells also mobilize AA in response to an oxidative stress induced by H2O2 through a mechanism that appears not to be mediated by cytosolic phospholipase A2α but by the calcium-independent Group VI phospholipase A2(iPLA2). This is supported by the following lines of evidence: (i) the response is essentially calcium-independent, (ii) it is inhibited by bromoenol lactone, and (iii) it is inhibited by an iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide. Enzyme assays conducted under a variety of conditions reveal that the specific activity of the iPLA2 does not change as a result of H2O2 exposure, which argues against the activation of a specific signaling cascade ending in the iPLA2. Rather, the oxidant acts to perturb membrane homeostasis in a way that the enzyme susceptibility/accessibility to its substrate increases, and this results in altered fatty acid release. In support of this view, not only AA, but also other fatty acids, were found to be liberated in an iPLA2-dependent manner in the H2O2-treated cells. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of the iPLA2 in modulating homeostatic fatty acid deacylation reactions and document a potentially important route under pathophysiological conditions for increasing free fatty acid levels during oxidative stress."

The VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1 (a kinase domain receptor) mediates various biological activities of VEGF related to proliferation, differentiation, and migration of endothelial cells. Here we present a novel peptide designated K237-(HTMYYHHYQHHL), which was isolated from a phage-displayed peptide library, binding to KDR with high affinity and specificity.

The generation of new capillaries involves a multistep process involving dissolution of the membrane of the originating vessel, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and formation of a new vascular tube (3Cliff W.J.

Suppression of any one of these steps would inhibit the formation of new vessels and would therefore affect tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor angiogenesis appears to be achieved by the expression of angiogenic agents within solid tumors that stimulate host vascular endothelial cell mitogenesis and possibly chemotaxis. So far, several angiogenic factors have been identified (6Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar) including the particularly potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 which acts as an endothelial cell-specific mitogen and plays important roles during tumor angiogenesis (7Terman B.I.

Inhibition of VEGF using specific antagonists such as VEGF-specific monoclonal antibodies can therefore result in the blockade of tumor growth and metastasis in experimental animal model systems (10Asano M.

As a result, VEGF antagonists have been believed to have significant potential in the context of cancer therapy. The screening of phage-displayed libraries is a powerful technique for identifying peptides with desirable biological or physical properties, particularly when it is combined with iterative cycles of phage selection and amplification (17Felici F.

Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and examples include the RGD-containing peptides that bind to specific cell surface integrins and inhibit integrin-mediated cell adhesion (19O'Neil K.T.

Peptide display libraries have also been used to derive a peptide-(ATWLPPR), which specifically inhibited human endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and totally abolished VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo (21Binetruy-Tournaire R. Demangel C. Malavaud B. Vassy R. Rouyre S. Kraemer M. Plouet J. Derbin C. Perret G. Mazie J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, phage-displayed technology has been shown to be an effective to the identification of novel peptides that may inhibit cell adhesion or angiogenesis. In this study, we attempted to identify peptides that might block the binding of VEGF to KDR. A random 12-mer peptide library displayed on the surface of filamentous phage (M13) was screened by biopanning against the extracellular domain of KDR. This led to the isolation of peptide K237-(HTMYYHHYQHHL), which not only competed with VEGF binding to KDR but also specifically inhibited human endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, this peptide inhibited angiogenesis in the chick embryo choroallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assay and significantly reduced the tumor growth and metastasis in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Primers for amplifying KDR cDNA coding the immunoglobulin (Ig) similar to domains I–IV (sense, 5′-AAGGGATCCCCCAGGCTCAGCATACAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCGAATTCGGGTGGGACATACACAAC-3′) were synthesized by the Sangon Company (Shanghai, China). Human umbilical cord was obtained from Peking Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Beijing, China). Type II collagenase, TriZOL reagent, reverse transcription kit, fetal calf serum (FCS), RPMI 1640 medium, and [125I]VEGF were obtained from Invitrogen. The 12-mer phage-displayed library was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human VEGF165(rhVEGF165) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 phage antibody were obtained from Sigma. Peptides K237-(HTMYYHHYQHHL) and control random peptide-(WHDPTPWWSWET) were synthesized by Bio-Scientific Inc. (Xian, China). [3H] was purchased from the Institute of Atomic Energy, Chinese Academy (Beijing, China). SCID mice were provided by the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). The cDNA coding the Ig-like domains I–IV of the VEGF receptor KDR (22Terman B.I. Carrion M.E. Kovacs E. Rasmussen B.A. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar) was obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by reverse transcription-PCR according to manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA was then cloned into glutathioneS-transferase (GST) expression vector pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences) and sequenced. Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells were transformed with pGEX-2T-KDR, cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 60 μg/ml ampicillin, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C to allow expression of fusion protein GST-KDR. The pellets from 200 ml of induced bacteria were ultrasonicated on ice in 2 ml of TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in 2 ml of 2% sodium deoxycholate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of denaturation buffer (10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 m urea) and shaken gently for 3 h at room temperature. Soluble GST-KDR (sKDR) was obtained by gradually diluting the denatured protein with 8–10 ml of refolding buffer (5 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm oxidized glutathione, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and shaking for 4 h at room temperature. The supernatant containing the sKDR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and shown to correspond to a single detectable protein species as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For direct binding of [125I]VEGF, the sKDR (0.2 g/liter, 0.01 mphosphate buffer, pH 6.2) was coated on 96-well plates (50 μl/well) and kept at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed with washing buffer (0.9% NaCl, 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.2) and then blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, for 3 h at room temperature. [125I]VEGF at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ng/ml) was added to wells followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with the blocking buffer, bound radioactivity was measured by a γ-counter (Beckman 2000, Fullerton, CA). The competitive binding of [125I]VEGF to both immobilized and free sKDR was also determined. sKDR was coated onto 96-well plates as described above. [125I]VEGF (8 ng/ml, determined as the saturation point from the direct binding assay) was then mixed with sKDR at different concentrations and added to the sKDR-coated wells. After 3 h at room temperature, the wells were washed and [125I]VEGF bound to coated KDR was measured. The procedure for screening the phage-displayed library was modified according to instructions of the manufacturer of the kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The cell culture dishes (60-mm-diameter) were coated with GST-p21, GST-VEGF, GST-Flt-1 (these fusion proteins were produced by our laboratory), or GST-KDR. All proteins were added at 100 μg/ml in 3-ml volume/dish and incubated at room temperature for 2 h prior to blocking with phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The phage library containing 1012 clones was sequentially added to non-bait-coated dishes (those coated with GST-p21, GST-VEGF, and GST-Flt-1) for preabsorption. In each case, the library was shaken gently at room temperature for 1 h. Finally the preabsorbed library was applied to sKDR-coated dishes for specific screening. After thorough washing, plate-bound phage clones were eluted with elution buffer (0.22m Gly-HCl, pH 2.2) and neutralized immediately. Four rounds of selection were performed, after which individual plaque was picked up at random and subjected to analysis by phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and DNA sequencing following amplification in E. coli ER2537. Human umbilical cords were digested with 0.1% collagenase II, and the HUVECs were collected and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS. The control cells (NIH-3T3) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For phage ELISA assays, HUVECs and NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103 cells/well. After an overnight incubation, cells were fixed with ice-cold glutaraldehyde (0.125%) in phosphate-buffed saline for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with phosphate-buffed saline. Phosphate-buffed saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin was used to block the plates by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After blocking, phages (5 × 1012 pfu/ml) were added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed 10 times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20, and bound phage were detected by ELISA using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody. sKDR was immobilized on 96-well plates and blocked as described above. Seven different phage clones, which were selected by the above phage ELISA, were then incubated with the sKDR-coated plates for 1 h at room temperature at a concentration of 1013pfu/ml. After this preincubation, [125I]VEGF (2 μg/liter, 50 μl) was added directly to the wells without the removal of the phage. An additional 2-h incubation at room temperature was then performed followed by thorough washing. Bound radioactivity was then counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Co., Turku, Finland). For the two phage clones, which exhibited the most promising results, synthetic peptides were generated that corresponded to the encoded displayed peptide motifs. These peptides were then used in the competition assay with [125I]VEGF (see above). HUVECs were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS (NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 4% FCS (for NIH 3T3 cells, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4% FCS). Cells were cultured for another 24 h and then incubated in the presence of rhVEGF165 (2 ng/ml) together with peptide K237 or control peptide at various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 μm). 48 h later, [3H]thymidine was added to the cells, and after a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, harvested, and analyzed for their incorporation of [3H]thymidine using a scintillation counter. NIH 3T3 cells were used as the control in this experiment. The CAM angiogenesis assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (24Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D.

Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After the fertilized eggs had been incubated for 3 days and then opened, the embryos were incubated in Petri dishes (100-mm-diameter) at 37 °C with 100% humidity. After 3 days, round glass cellulose filters (3-mm-diameter) soaked with either 10 μl of rhVEGF165 (2 ng/ml) alone or with 10 μl of rhVEGF165 (2 ng/ml) plus 20 μl of peptide K237 or control peptide at various concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5 μm) were placed on the surface of CAM. Filters were replaced daily with new filters with the fresh rhVEGF165 and peptide until angiogenic response peaked. CAMs were examined and documented by photomicroscope. A SCID mouse model was used to further investigate the effects of K237 on tumor growth and metastasis. For this purpose, BICR-H1 cells (1 × 107) were injected beneath the breasts of SCID mice (BICR-H1 cells correspond to a breast carcinoma cell line, which has the ability to generate spontaneous lung metastasis). On the next day, the peptide K237 and control peptide were injected (60 μl, 0.5 mm, respectively), around tumor sites. Peptide injections continued every 2 days for a period of 3 weeks, and tumor size was measured every 3 days with Vernier caliper. Tumor volume was calculated by the following formula: π/6 × (long diameter) × (short diameter)2. On the 48th day of post-cell injection, mice were sacrificed. Nodules formed by implanted tumors at injection sites were isolated and then weighed. The lungs were also removed, fixed with 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cross-sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and analyzed microscopically for the presence of tumor metastasis. Statistical significance between test and control groups was determined using the Student's t test (26Goldman C.K. Kendall R.L. Cabrera G. Soroceanu L. Heike Y. Gillespie G.Y. Siegal G.P. Mao X. Bett A.J. Huckle W.R. Thomas K.A. Curiel D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8795-8800Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs, and a cDNA fragment encoding the extracellular Ig-like domains I–IV of KDR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into vector pGEX-2T. After sequence analysis of the inserted cDNA, the GST-KDR fusion protein was expressed in E. coli JM109. After denaturation and refolding, the purity of the prepared sKDR was estimated to be 85–90% as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). sKDR was then examined for its ability to bind to [125I]VEGF using a solid-phase binding assay. This analysis revealed that the binding of sKDR became saturated when [125I]VEGF was at the concentration of 8 ng/ml, indicating a specific interaction between the soluble receptor and the ligand (Fig. 1 A). The binding of [125I] VEGF to immobilized sKDR was reduced when free sKDR was added in competition binding experiments (Fig.1 B). The sKDR was used to develop receptor antagonists. To do this, a random 12-mer peptide library composed of 2 × 109 independent phage clones was screened through biopanning against plate-bound sKDR. The sKDR-binding phage population became enriched over the course of four cycles of biopannings, and after the fourth round of selection, roughly 40% of the phage clones analyzed exhibited sKDR binding activity (125 of 300 clones that were analyzed; data not shown). Of the 125 sKDR-binding clones that were identified, eight clones were able to bind specifically to plate-immobilized sKDR and HUVECs (Fig.2 A). Sequences of the displayed peptides that were encoded by these phage clones were determined through sequencing of the phage DNA (the DNA sequence of peptide K93 was not available because of the quality of the sequencing gel) (Table I). A multiple alignment analysis on all selected sequences was performed using the DNAStar sequence analysis package (DNAStar, Inc. Madison, WI) to identify possible consensus motifs, which might be responsible for binding to KDR. No such consensus sequences could be identified, but it was noted that all of the selected peptides contained one or multiple histidines and that all of the peptides were rather hydrophobic.Table ISequences of the peptides selected by binding to sKDRPhage cloneEncoded insertK112MHNHHNHPRPSSK57MHSDMHAPVSDIK150HTKPHAWHLMSHK237HTMYYHHYQHHLK202LPNPISPRWWVGK212CDPLLKHHTHPKK25NHPAVVEPAPSLThe phage-display peptide library was subjected to four rounds of biopanning against plate-immobilized recombinant GST-KDR fusion protein (sKDR). Individual phage clones selected by this procedure were then analyzed for their ability to bind to immobilized sKDR and to HUVEC monolayers in a phage-ELISA assay. This resulted in the identification of eight individual phage clones, which scored positively in all of these assays. The sequences of seven of these clones are shown below. Open table in a new tab The phage-display peptide library was subjected to four rounds of biopanning against plate-immobilized recombinant GST-KDR fusion protein (sKDR). Individual phage clones selected by this procedure were then analyzed for their ability to bind to immobilized sKDR and to HUVEC monolayers in a phage-ELISA assay. This resulted in the identification of eight individual phage clones, which scored positively in all of these assays. The sequences of seven of these clones are shown below. In light of the ability of the selected peptides to bind sKDR, we examined the ability of these peptides to block the interaction between KDR and its ligand, VEGF. To do this, a fixed amount of phage particles (1013 pfu/ml) was added to sKDR-coated wells, and its ability to block the binding of [125I]VEGF was then examined. This analysis revealed that phage-K237 could inhibit the binding of [125I]VEGF to sKDR (Fig. 2 B), whereas phage-K93 inhibited the interaction to a somewhat lesser extent; the other clones did not interfere with [125I]VEGF binding to sKDR. Based on the results of the competition assay, phage clone K237 was chosen for further study. The phage-encoded peptide was synthesized and used in an in vitro competition assay as described above. This analysis revealed that the peptide K237 could antagonize the binding of [125I]VEGF to sKDR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). It is well known that VEGF stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells through the KDR receptor. Because peptide K237 had the ability to block interaction between VEGF and KDR, we therefore decided to test whether peptide K237 might also suppress endothelial cell proliferation in response to rhVEGF165. As shown in Fig. 4, peptide K237 significantly suppressed the mitogenic response of HUVEC to rhVEGF165in a dose-dependent manner. Cellular proliferation was reduced by >90% when peptide K237 was present at a concentration of 300 μm, whereas an equivalent concentration of the control peptide had no significant effect on the cell growth (Fig.4). Using the same in vitro proliferation assay, we also examined the effect of K237 on NIH 3T3 cells to confirm the specificity of the growth inhibition that we observed in HUVECs treated with rhVEGF165. This analysis revealed that the proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells was not modified by peptide K237 (data not shown). The effect of peptide K237 on angiogenesis was tested by a CAM vascularization assay. For this experiment, a round glass cellulose filter was impregnated with rhVEGF165 alone or with rhVEGF165 plus either peptide K237 or the control peptide at varying concentrations. These filters were then directly applied to the CAM, and angiogenesis was measured 3 days later. This experiment revealed that vascularization around the treated sites was significantly reduced in CAMs that received rhVEGF165 plus peptide K237 (5 μm) versus CAMs that received rhVEGF165 plus the control group or rhVEGF165alone (Fig. 5). To determine the effect of peptide K237 on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with human breast carcinoma cells (BICR-H1 cell line). The tumor sites were subcutaneously subjected to injections with peptide K237 or control peptide every 2 days, and the growth of the tumors was then assessed over time. The results of this analysis showed that there was a significant (70%) reduction in the weight of implanted tumors (p < 0.05) that were injected with peptide K237versus the control group whose five-tumor weight was 1.56 g as measured at sacrifice (the 48th day following implantation of the tumor cells) (Fig. 6,panels 1and 2). The SCID mouse lungs were also examined at sacrifice by histological staining and microscopic inspection. The mean numbers of metastasized nodules per mouse were calculated from three inspected cross-lung sections. The results revealed that all animals injected with the control peptide developed intrapulmonary metastatic tumor nodules (identified as clusters of over five tumor cells), and there were 16 tumor nodules in total (Fig. 6, panel 3, C andD). In contrast, only three of the five animals injected with the peptide K237 developed detectable pulmonary nodules, and seven nodules could be observed in total (Fig. 6, panel 3,A and B). Based on the number of the pulmonary nodules per mouse in the two treatment groups, peptide K237 was determined to reduce the total number of metastasis by 53% (p < 0.05) as compared with the control peptide. Previous studies have demonstrated that antiangiogenic therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of cancer (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar), in part because solid tumor growth and metastasis are dependent on tumor vascularization. Furthermore, it has been shown that blocking the interaction between VEGF and its receptor can result in the regression of murine and human tumors (8Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Feder J. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a VEGF peptide antagonist that we identified by screening a phage-displayed peptide library. Direct screening of phage-displayed peptide libraries with soluble receptors is a relative new area of research, and there are only limited reports of such analysis in the literature. A major challenge is the removal of clones with nonspecific binding properties. In this study, we performed three rounds of negative selection to eliminate nonspecific binding clones using three recombinant fusion proteins (GST-p21, GST-VEGF, and GST-Flt-1), which contained the GST moiety that was fused to our bait protein (GST-KDR). This resulted in the depletion of non-KDR-specific binding clones from the phage library. To isolate specific VEGF antagonists, the phage-displayed library was then subjected to four rounds of biopanning against plate-bound sKDR. 125 individual clones, which exhibited the ability to bind to sKDR, were then tested in a phage ELISA assay using HUVECs as targets. This resulted in the identification of eight individual phage clones, which could bind specifically both to recombinant sKDR and to primary HUVECs. Sequence analysis revealed that eight clones were histidine-rich and hydrophobic, but no clear conservative motif was identified. Furthermore, attempts to align the individual selected peptide sequences with the primary sequence of the VEGF did not identify any homology. However, it remains possible that one or more of the peptides might be a structural mimic of a discontinuous or conformational epitope with VEGF. This is potentially important because Mulleret al. (27Muller Y.A., Li, B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) have recently solved the crystal structure of VEGF and have mapped the region responsible for KDR binding to a series of discontinuous residues. When the eight selected phage clones were analyzed for their ability to successfully compete with [125I]VEGF for binding to immobilized sKDR, only two clones showed detectable activity. The most efficient one of these, peptide K237 HTMYYHHYQHHL was selected for further analysis. This peptide was not only capable of specific binding to sKDR and to HUVECs, but it also inhibited the VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs. However, it did not modify the growth of a fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, indicating that its inhibitory effect on HUVEC proliferation is not a result of nonspecific cellular cytotoxicity but an effect of K237 blocking the interaction between VEGF and its receptor KDR. Finally, peptide K237 was able to inhibit the growth and metastasis of a breast carcinoma cell line in SCID mice. This suggests that this peptide as a VEGF antagonist might have potential application for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The small size of this peptide also offers the possibility of generating structurally similar molecules via standard organic synthesis. This could result in the production of inexpensive orally available drugs analogous to the RGD-peptidomimetic compound SCH221153, which binds to both αvβ3 and αvβ5integrin receptor and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth (28Kumar C.C. Malkowski M. Yin Z. Tanghetti E. Yaremko B. Nechuta T. Varner J. Liu M. Smith E.M. Neustadt B. Presta M. Armstrong L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2232-2238PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our results demonstrate that the peptide K237 is an effective VEGF antagonist. It functioned as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo and reduced tumor growth and metastasis in a small animal model system. Thus, this molecule (or its derivatives) may have utility in clinical applications that might include cancer biotherapy, a treatment of diabetic retinopathy and other angiogenic or proliferative disorders that involve endothelial cells."

Native VSOACs are believed to be a major pathway for regulatory volume decrease (RVD) through efflux of chloride and organic osmolytes. ClC-3 has been proposed to encode native VSOACs in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in some mammalian cells, including cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. The relationship between the ClC-3 chloride channel, the native volume-sensitive osmolyte and anion channel (VSOAC) currents, and cell volume regulation in HeLa cells andX. laevis oocytes was investigated using ClC-3 antisense.

Most vertebrate cells respond to hypoosmotically induced cell swelling by actively decreasing their volume, a process known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD)1 (1Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The RVD response occurs by efflux of K+, Cl−, and organic osmolytes accompanied by osmotically obliged water loss. Approximately 70% of the osmolyte loss during the RVD response is accounted for by loss of KCl via separate conductive pathways (2Lang F. Busch G.L. Volkl H. Cell. Physiol.

Biol. 1997; 68: 69-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the current debate as to whether a group of channel proteins rather than just one protein may comprise the overall biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of VSOACs described in different cell types (11Stutzin A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The protein or proteins conclusively responsible for the native VSOAC current have yet to be identified. Several proteins have been implicated as candidates for VSOAC, including P-glycoprotein (13Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F.

P-glycoprotein is now thought to be a regulator of this channel (18Valverde M.A. Bond T.D. Hardy S.P. Taylor J.C. Higgins C.F. Altamirano J. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J.

Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Botta G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Li C. Breton S.

ClC-2, when expressed, has been shown to display biophysical and pharmacological characteristics that differ from native VSOACs and has also been shown not to contribute to RVD (15Thiemann A.

ClC-3 cloned from guinea pig ventricular myocytes was proposed to be the molecular candidate responsible for cardiac VSOACs (16Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). When expressed in NIH3T3 cells ClC-3 gave rise to a basally active chloride conductance that was modulated by cell volume, strongly inhibited by protein kinase C, displayed outward rectification with a unitary slope conductance of 40 pS, an anion selectivity sequence of I > Cl > Asp, voltage-dependent inactivation at positive potentials, and similar pharmacological characteristics as native VSOACs (27Duan D. Cowley S. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wang et al. (17Wang L. Chen L. Jacob T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 63-75Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed in bovine epithelial cells that ClC-3 antisense treatment delayed the rate of activation of native VSOAC and reduced its amplitude by up to 60% in a dose-dependent manner. Also, a polyclonal anti-ClC-3 antibody (Ab) was shown to functionally inhibit native VSOACs in guinea pig cardiac cells, canine pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, andXenopus laevis oocytes (28Duan D.

Although the ClC-3 hypothesis has received additional experimental support from other laboratories, (29Coca-Prados M. Sanchez-Torres J. Peterson-Yantorno K. Civan M.M. J. Membr.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of endogenous ClC-3 in native VSOAC activation and the RVD mechanism intrinsic to HeLa cells and X. laevis oocytes. HeLa cells or X. laevis oocytes were transiently treated with an antisense oligonucleotide or injected with antisense cRNA against ClC-3, respectively, to abolish endogenous protein expression. Our results demonstrate that antisense treatment abolished both mRNA and protein expression of ClC-3 in HeLa cells andX. laevis oocytes, significantly reduced native VSOAC current density, and significantly diminished the ability of cells to undergo RVD. All experiments on HeLa cells were performed at the Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile, and all oocyte experiments were conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine. HeLa cells were grown to ∼70% confluence at 37 °C in an 5%/95%: CO2/air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 80,000 IU/liter penicillin, and 50 μg/liter streptomycin. Oocytes were collected as previously described (28Duan D. Zhong J. Hermoso M. Satterwhite C.M. Rossow C.F. Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Oocytes were removed and incubated in ND96 solution containing, in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2.8 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, and 1 mg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5. Follicle-enclosed oocytes were used in all experiments. 733-bp in situhybridization probes were obtained from HeLa cells cDNA, complementary to the human ClC-3 mRNA initiation codon region (37Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An antisense probe was obtained using conventional procedures. HeLa cells were grown up to 70% confluence and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Excess fixative was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fixed HeLa cells were pre-hybridized with Denhardt's solution for 30 min and hybridized overnight with 10 ng/μl ClC-3 antisense or sense RNA probes at 65 °C. After washing in 2× SSC/0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2× SSC/0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated overnight with a rabbit anti-digoxigenin (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated) Ab at 4 °C. After excess Ab was washed away, cells were incubated with NTP/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates, mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific, NJ) and examined under a light microscope. The antisense (ASO) or mismatched (MMO) oligonucleotides used for HeLa cell transfection were second generation chimeras high-performance liquid chromatography-purified (Oligos Etc. Inc., Wilsonville, OR). The ASO and MMO sequence was 5′-CGTCCCTCTTTAACTGGTT-3′ and 5′-CTGCCTCCATTTGTCATTG-3′, respectively. The ASO sequence was complementary to the human ClC-3 mRNA initiation codon region (37Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), starting from the second base before the initiation codon (ATG corresponding to the third open reading frame). For electrophysiological and volume measurement experiments, the transfection efficiency was assessed with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or a rhodamine derivative (TAMRA)-labeled oligonucleotides at bases 1 and 19, or 1 and 2, respectively. Confluent HeLa cell cultures were acutely transfected with 1 μm ASO- or MMO-ClC-3 in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cells were then grown for another 24, 48, or 72 h until electrophysiological recordings, cell volume measurements, and ClC-3 mRNA and protein content determinations were conducted. Antisense cRNA was used to abolish ClC-3 mRNA transcription in X. laevis oocytes. X. laevis oocyte ClC-3 (xClC-3) cDNA, corresponding to a 211-bp fragment (15–225 bp, GenBankTM accession numberY09941) in either the sense or antisense direction, was subcloned into a TA cloning vector PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). The sequence includes the start codon of xClC-3 mRNA and is not homologous to other known ClC channels. The constructs were linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI and complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized by the bacteriophage RNA polymerase T7 using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Injection pipettes with tips of ∼1 μm in diameter were baked at >150 °C overnight to destroy RNases and were mounted in a Drummound Nanoject autoinjector (Drummound Scientific, Broomall, PA). Oocytes were injected with 9 ng of either sense or antisense cRNA in 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Total RNA was isolated from either HeLa cells transfected with ASO- or MMO-ClC-3 orX. laevis oocytes injected with sense or antisense ClC-3 cRNA by the use of a TRIzol® total RNA isolation reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer, and the 260/280 absorbance ratio was determined for purity. Total RNA was incubated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 20 min at 25 °C followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C. cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA reverse-transcribed with 200 units of Superscript IITMreverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 primer (HeLa cells) or random hexamer primer (oocytes), 500 μm each of dNTP, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. For ClC-3 transcript content determination in transfected HeLa cells, a 570-bp product, including the 5′ ClC3 coding region was amplified by PCR. The specific primers used to quantitate ClC-3 expression in HeLa cells were as follows: ClC-3 (GenBankTM accession number X78520), forward 5′-CATGTCAATGGGGAGG-3′ (sense, nt 633–680) and reverse 5′-GCAAGAAAGGCAAAACT-3′ (antisense, nt 1233–1216). For ClC-3 semiquantification, a 208-bp product was amplified from the housekeeping gene glutaraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and used as an internal standard. The specific primers used to amplify glutaraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in HeLa cells were as follows: (GenBankTM accession number U51572), forward 5′-GCCCACCAGAACATCATCC-3′ (sense, nt 207–227) and reverse 5′-GCCATCCCTGTCAGCTTC-3′ (antisense, nt 478–460). PCR reactions were carried out in Taq polymerase buffer (Invitrogen) with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTP, and 10 pmol of each primer. Amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, model 2400) with 2 units ofTaq polymerase/tube (50-μl final volume). The thermal profile used was 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with a total of 30 cycles. The quantification of X. laevis oocyte ClC-3 mRNA content was done using real-time PCR. The specific primers used to quantitate xClC-3 expression in X. laevisoocytes were as follows: xClC-3 (GenBankTM accession numberY09941), forward 5′-CCCAATGGATATCTCTTCAGATC-3′ (sense, nt 87–109) and reverse 5′-CAATAGGTGAGTCGTGCTGT-3′ (antisense, nt 225–206), amplicon 138 bp; 18 S rRNA (GenBankTMaccession number K01373), forward 5′-ACAGTGAAACTGCGAATGGCT-3′ (sense, nt 77–97) and reverse 5′-GCTCGTCGGCATGTATTAGCT-3′ (antisense, nt 183–163), amplicon 107 bp. The amplification profile for these primer pairs was as follows: 95 °C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq polymerase, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min, performed in a GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with the use of SYBR® Green chemistry on an ABI 5700 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Standard curves were generated for xClC-3 and the constitutively expressed 18 S rRNA from regression analysis of the mean values of RT-PCR values for the log10 diluted cDNA. Unknown quantities relative to the standard curve for the xClC-3 primers were calculated, yielding transcriptional quantitation of xClC-3 cDNA relative to the endogenous standard (18 S rRNA). Each cDNA sample was tested in triplicate, and cDNA was obtained from at least five different frogs. The reproducibility of the assay was tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing repeat runs of samples, and mean values generated at individual time points were compared by Student's t test. The PCR products were resolved in 1.5 and 2.5% agarose/ethidium bromide gels, for the HeLa and X. laevis ClC-3 amplification products, respectively. Bands were observed under an UV transilluminator and analyzed with Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Net intensity values were obtained for each band resolved in the agarose gels. Crude and membrane protein from HeLa cells and X. laevis oocytes were extracted as described previously (28Duan D. Zhong J. Hermoso M. Satterwhite C.M. Rossow C.F. Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein content in HeLa cells and X. laevis oocytes was determined by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic acid method (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar), respectively. Total protein was dissolved in sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis in parallel to prestained low range molecular weight standards on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were then blotted to nitrocellulose, and proteins were electrically transferred (41Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% dried nonfat milk, 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.2. Blots were then initially incubated with the commercially available anti-ClC-3 Ab (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) raised against a C terminus epitope (amino acids 592–661) at a final concentration of 7.5 μg. Due to recent concerns (35Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) regarding the specificity of this Ab, some blots were incubated with a new rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified anti-ClC-3 Ab (42Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I. Hume J.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 242aGoogle Scholar) raised against a different C terminus epitope (amino acids 670–687 of the mouse sequence) at a final concentration of 25 μg. The peptide used to generate the C670–687 Ab is similar to the ClC-3 epitope previously used to generate a specific C terminus anti-ClC-3 Ab, which exhibited no cross-reactivity with human ClC-1, rat ClC-2, or human ClC-4 (43Huang P. Liu J., Di, A. Robinson N.C. Musch M.W. Kaetzel M.A. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20093-20100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ab excess was removed with 0.1% Tween 20-TBS, and specific ClC-3 reactivity was determined with a goat-anti rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The peroxidase activity was detected by the ECL chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and revealed with Kodak films. Immunoreactive bands present in the films were observed under a visible light transilluminator and digitized with a Kodak DC40/DC120 camera. Images were analyzed with the Kodak digital science 1D program (KdS 1d, Kodak). Phosphatase activity was detected with Nitro BT/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate tablets. Net intensity values for each band were analyzed with Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Solutions were chosen to facilitate Cl− currents in HeLa cells and in X. laevis oocytes. The isotonic solution for HeLa cells current recordings contained, in mm: 140N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 70 mannitol, pH 7.4. All whole cell recordings were in either isotonic (300 mosm) or hypotonic (220 mosm, by exclusion of mannitol) bath solutions. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, and 2 ATP, pH 7.3 (285 mosm). The same isotonic and hypotonic bath solutions were used in cell volume experiments. The isotonic solution (ND72) for X. laevis oocyte current recordings contained, in mm: 72 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, and 55 mannitol, pH 7.5. 100 μm niflumic acid was added to all solutions to eliminate contamination by endogenous ICl.Ca. All whole cell recordings were in either isotonic (220 mosm) or hypotonic (165 mosm, by exclusion of mannitol) bath solutions. For cell volume measurements, NaCl was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride at a concentration of 100 mm adjusting the solution to be 50% hypotonic. All solutions were tested with a freezing point depression osmometer. HeLa cells transfected with FITC-ASO-ClC-3 or FITC-MMO-ClC-3 were plated on 25-mm round coverslips and placed in a microchamber mounted on a fluorescent inverted microscope. The bath was grounded via an agar bridge. Standard whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using the Axopatch 200 B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) amplifier. Patch-clamp pipettes were made from thin borosilicate (hard) glass capillary tubing with an outside diameter of 1.5 or 1.7 mm (Clark Electromedical, Edenbridge, UK) using a BB-CH puller (Mecanex, Geneva, Switzerland) and had resistances of 3–5 MΩ. Voltage and current signals from the amplifier were recorded on a digital tape recorder (DTR-1204, Biologic, France), digitized using a computer equipped with a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog interface and analyzed with Axon software. Changes in liquid junction potentials, which occurred as a result of bath solution changes during an experiment, were calculated (44Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and current-voltage relations were corrected accordingly. HeLa cells were clamped at a 0-mV holding potential, and voltage steps were applied from −80 to +120 mV for 500 ms in 40-mV increments unless otherwise stated. Membrane currents from X. laevis oocytes 0–3 days post surgery were recorded using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp system (GeneClamp 500B, Axon Instruments). Double-blind recordings were performed in all experiments. Microelectrodes, filled with 3 m KCl, had resistances of 0.5–3 MΩ. Voltages are reported with reference to the bath. Membrane currents were filtered at 1.0 kHz, digitized on-line, and stored on a computer. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were clamped at a −30mV holding potential and voltage steps were applied from −100 to +120 mV for 400 ms in +20-mV increments unless otherwise stated. Cell water volume was assessed in single HeLa cells by measuring changes in concentration of an intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye (45Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with TAMRA-ASO-ClC-3 or TAMRA-MMO-ClC-3 were loaded with 5 μm calcein-AM/10% pluronic acid for 5 min at 22 °C, and volume measurements were performed using a confocal laser imaging system (LSM, Carl Zeiss). Excitation light was 488 and 523 nm, for calcein and TAMRA, respectively, and emitted light was measured at wavelengths longer than 515 nm. Images of transfected HeLa cells were obtained at 10-s intervals, and fluorescence of a ∼10-μm2 area in the cell center was measured and subsequent correction for fluorescence decay was depicted. The data are presented as V t/V 0, the ratio between the cell water volume in isoosmotic solution at time = 0 and time = t, calculated fromF 0/F t (F= fluorescence intensity) as described (45Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell volume was estimated in oocytes by diameter measurements (46Furukawa T. Ogura T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C500-C512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte diameters were measured using a digital video line measurement system (Ionoptix, Milton, MA) with contrast analysis of digitized image data. The measurement system was mounted to a stereo-optic microscope (Cambridge Instruments). Oocytes were illuminated with focused broad-spectrum light emitted from a halogen lamp. Specifically, the left and right edges of the oocyte were measured independently using separate video lines placed at the peripheral edges of the oocyte. These lines were stripped out of the image, and intensity was displayed following online smoothing with digital filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio."

It has been hypothesized that in the absence of or under nonsaturating levels of l-arginine where O2 reduction is the primary outcome of NOS activation, H4B promotes the generation of H2O2 at the expense of O2˙¯. The experiments were designed to test this hypothesis. To test this theory, two different enzyme preparations, H4B-bound NOS I and H4B-free NOS I, were used. Initial rates of NADPH turnover and O2 utilization were found to be considerably greater in the H4B-bound NOS I preparation than in the H4B-free NOS I preparation. In contrast, the initial generation of O2˙¯ from the H4B-free NOS I preparation was found to be substantially greater than that measured using the H4B-bound NOS I preparation. Finally, by spin trapping nearly all of the NOS I produced O2˙¯, we found that the initial rate of H2O2 production by H4B-bound NOS I was considerably greater than that for H4B-free NOS I.

Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 2Masters B.S.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Google Scholar), contains an N-terminal oxidase domain with binding sites for l-arginine and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B) and a C-terminal reductase domain with binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH. The domains are connected by a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding region that allows electron transport through the enzyme (3Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Google Scholar). One rather interesting finding is that H4B, although not essential for heme reduction (4Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Google Scholar), is nevertheless necessary for significant production of NO⋅ froml-arginine (5Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Google Scholar). This co-factor stabilizes the dimeric structure of NOS (6Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Google Scholar), promotes destabilization of the NOS-Fe2+O2 species (12Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Google Scholar), and regulates the mid-point potential of NOS heme (4Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Google Scholar). In 1992, we discovered that NOS I generates O2˙¯ in the absence of l-arginine (13Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Google Scholar). More recently, NOS II and NOS III, like NOS I, have been found to generate O2˙¯ during enzymic cycling (14Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Google Scholar, 15Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Google Scholar, 16Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Google Scholar). In the presence of l-arginine, NOS I generates NO⋅ and O2˙¯; the ratio of these free radicals is dependent upon the concentration of l-arginine (17Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Google Scholar, 18Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Google Scholar). Thus, l-arginine is one of the controlling factors that dictate the selectivity of free radicals produced by NOS. However, in the absence of substrate, NOS uses O2 as the terminal electron acceptor, generating O2˙¯ and H2O2 by sequential one-electron reductive steps (see Fig. 1). Under these conditions, there is undoubtedly an alternative mechanism by which NOS regulates the formation of each of these cell-signaling products of O2 reduction. One possibility is that H4B controls production of O2˙¯ by increasing the reduction rate of the NOS-Fe2+O2 species (Refs. 19Wei C.-C. Wang Z.-Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Google Scholar, 20Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Google Scholar, 21Gorren A.C.F. Bec N. Schrammel A.

Evidence to support this theory comes from experiments where the addition of H4B to purified NOS I diminished the spin trapping of O2˙¯ (17Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Google Scholar, 18Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Google Scholar, 23Yoneyama H. Yamamoto A. Kosaka H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 247-253Google Scholar). However, these findings must be viewed with caution, because H4B in aqueous solution has been reported to scavenge O2˙¯ (24Wever R.M.F. van Dam T. van Rijn H.J.M. de Groot F. Rabelink T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 340-344Google Scholar, 25Nakamura K. Bindokas V.P. Kowlessur D. Elas M. Milstein S. Marks J.D. Halpern H.J. Kang U.J. J. Biol.

Med. 2001; 31: 975-985Google Scholar) with a rate constant of 3.9 × 105m−1s−1 (26Vásquez-Vivar J. Whitsett J. Martásek P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 975-985Google Scholar). Thus, the conclusion drawn from the earlier studies (17Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Google Scholar, 18Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Google Scholar, 23Yoneyama H. Yamamoto A. Kosaka H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 247-253Google Scholar) that H4B regulates NOS production of O2˙¯ is unsubstantiated, because free H4B and the spin trap compete for NOS-produced O2˙¯ (26Vásquez-Vivar J. Whitsett J. Martásek P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 975-985Google Scholar). In contrast, when H4B is bound to NOS at the heme near the dimer interface (27Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R., Wu, C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Google Scholar, 28Raman C.S., Li, H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Google Scholar), this pterin is thought not to undergo such reactions. This paper describes a series of experiments designed to test whether H4B bound to NOS is pivotal in shifting the rate of electron flow to the NOS-Fe2+O2 species, thereby promoting formation of H2O2 at the expense of O2˙¯. NADPH, calmodulin, l-arginine, calcium chloride, H2O2, and horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Superoxide dismutase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). H4B was obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland).l-[U-14C]Arginine monohydrochloride ([14C]l-arginine) was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Dowex® 50W-X8 cation exchange resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Amplex Red was dissolved in Me2SO and stored under N2 at −80 °C until use. The spin trap for O2˙¯, 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (BMPO) was prepared according to the method described by Zhao et al. (29Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Google Scholar). All other chemicals were used as purchased without further purification. NOS I was expressed and purified essentially as described by Roman et al. (30Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Google Scholar), with the modification that the culture volume was 500 ml rather than 1000 ml. The effluent from the ADP-Sepharose column was divided into two fractions: one that was reconstituted with H4B (250 μm) at 4 °C and one that was not. Neither fraction was exposed to l-arginine at any point during purification. After overnight incubation on ice, both of the fractions were applied to an S-200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Corp.) to remove excess H4B and to further purify the enzyme. The dimer peak was collected and concentrated. The enzyme concentration was determined by its CO difference spectrum, as described in Ref. 30Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Google Scholar, using an extinction coefficient of 100 mm−1cm−1 at Δε 444–475 nm. Neither fraction was ever frozen but was stored on ice and used the next day. Oxidation of NADPH was performed in a reaction using potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTPA, 1 mm EGTA), CaCl2 (2 mm), calmodulin (100 units/ml), and NADPH (150 μm) at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NOS I (0.40 μm). A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Uvikon, model 940, Research Instruments International, San Diego, CA) was used to monitor the reaction spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The initial rate of NADPH oxidation was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Oxygen consumption was measured with a commercial oxygen monitoring system (Hansatech). The system was composed of a membrane-coated Clark-type electrode fitted in a glass body reaction chamber and equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and an air-tight stopper. Data acquisition was performed with proprietary hardware and software (Hansatech). All of the measurements were performed at 25 °C. In a typical experiment, NADPH (150 μm) was added to either a solution of H4B-bound NOS I (0.40 μm) or H4B-free NOS I (0.40 μm). The initial rate of O2 consumption was measured, assuming an initial O2 concentration equal to 253.4 nmol/ml (31Truesdale G.A. Downing A.L. Nature. 1954; 173: 1236Google Scholar). Spin trapping of O2˙¯ from purified H4B-free NOS I and H4B-bound NOS I was conducted by mixing all components described in the text to a final volume of 0.25 ml. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a flat quartz cell and placed into the cavity of an EPR spectrometer (model E-109; Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The EPR cell was open to the air, allowing O2 to enter the quartz cell. EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature. Instrument settings were: microwave power, 20 mW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 0.5 G; sweep time, 12.5 G/min; and response time, 0.5 s. The receiver gain is given in the legend to Fig. 2. The apparent rate constant for the spin trapping of O2˙¯ by BMPO, generating the corresponding spin-trapped adduct of O2˙¯, BMPO-OOH, was estimated using the model O2˙¯ generating system of xanthine/xanthine oxidase. The reaction mixture contained BMPO (60 mm), hypoxanthine (400 μm), and sufficient xanthine oxidase to generate 1 μm/min of O2˙¯ as determined by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec (80 μm) at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1(32Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Google Scholar). Ferricytochrome c (0–23 μm) was used as a competitive inhibitor (33Asada K. Takahashi M. Nagate M. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1974; 38: 471-473Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were immediately transferred to an EPR flat quartz cell and introduced into the cavity of the EPR spectrometer (model E-109; Varian Medical Systems, Inc.). EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature 3 min after the reaction was initiated by the addition of xanthine oxidase. Instrument settings were: microwave power, 20 mW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 0.5 G; sweep time, 12.5 G/min; and response time, 0.5 s. The half-life of BMPO-OOH was determined by monitoring the decrease in the first line of the EPR spectrum of BMPO-OOH as a function of time. The reaction mixture contained BMPO (50 mm) and hypoxanthine (400 μm) in potassium phosphate buffer (chelexed, 50 mm, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTPA) for 10 min, and then SOD (30 units/ml, as defined in Ref. 34McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Google Scholar) was added. The reaction mixture was immediately transferred to an EPR flat quartz cell and introduced into the cavity of the EPR spectrometer (model E-109; Varian Medical Systems, Inc.). EPR spectra were recorded at various time intervals for 60 min. Estimation of H2O2 production was obtained by fluorometric analyses (fluorometer, Hitachi model F2500, High Technologies America, Inc., San Jose, CA). A modified method utilizing the dye Amplex Red was adopted (35Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Google Scholar, 36Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Google Scholar, 37Zhou M. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 169-174Google Scholar). The incubation medium was supplemented with Amplex Red (1 μm) and horseradish peroxidase (5 units/ml) in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture contained NADPH (160 μm), CaCl2 (0.5 mm), calmodulin (100 units/ml), BMPO (100 mm), and SOD (0.04–80 units/ml). SOD (0.04 unit/ml) was added to each reaction to suppress initial fluorescence seen from the inclusion of NADPH, and SOD (0.14–80 units/ml) was used in control experiments described under “Results and Discussion.” The reaction was initiated by the addition of purified H4B-free NOS I (4 nm) or H4B-bound NOS I (4 nm) into the reaction mixture. The initial rate of H2O2generation was recorded as an increase in fluorescence of the dye at 585 nm with the excitation set at 550 nm. The fluorescence was calibrated by generating a standard curve with known concentrations of H2O2. The concentration of the commercial 30% H2O2 solution was calculated from light absorbance at 240 nm employing an extinction coefficient of 0.0436 mm−1 cm−1; the stock solution was diluted to 50 μm with water and used for calibration immediately. The specificity of horseradish peroxidase/Amplex Red toward H2O2 was confirmed, becausetert-butyl hydroperoxide was not found to be a substrate. The enzymatic activity of purified NOS I was determined by its ability to catalyze the formation of l-citrulline froml-arginine as previously reported (17Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Google Scholar) with modifications. The reaction mixture contained purified NOS I (0.15 μm), CaCl2 (2 mm), and mixture solution ([14C]l-arginine (0.6 μCi/ml) in the presence of NADPH (1 mm), l-arginine (50 μm), and calmodulin (100 units/ml)) in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the mixture solution into the reaction mixture containing purified NOS I and CaCl2 in the presence of various concentrations of BMPO ranging from 50 to 150 mm. The reaction mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 10 min and terminated with 2 ml of stop solution (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 5.5). The product [14C]l-citrulline was separated by passing the reaction mixture through columns containing Dowex® 50W-X8 cation exchange resin preactivated with a NaOH solution (1 m), and radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter (model LS 6500; Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). In the absence of l-arginine, NOS I generates O2˙¯ and H2O2; the latter was from either self-dismutation from O2˙¯ or direct enzymic formation of H2O2. These reduction products of O2 mediate different cell signaling pathways. Thus, it is important to understand how NOS I regulates formation of O2˙¯ and H2O2. Clearly, one controlling factor isl-arginine, which upon oxidation by NOS tol-citrulline and NO⋅ decreases the production of O2˙¯ (13Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Google Scholar, 18Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Google Scholar, 23Yoneyama H. Yamamoto A. Kosaka H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 247-253Google Scholar). Another limiting factor may be H4B, because this pterin appears to be a critical element in shifting the competition between O2˙¯ generation and direct production of H2O2. Here, the experiments are aimed at testing this hypothesis. As a source of NOS I, we used recombinant enzyme expressed inEscherichia coli. When isolated from this bacterium, NOS does not contain H4B. For these studies, H4B (250 μm) was added to a portion of the isolated NOS and incubated overnight at 4 °C, and this mixture was subsequently passed through an S-200 gel filtration column to remove excess H4B. Nitric-oxide synthase I isolated in this manner is complemented with about 0.65 nmol H4B/nmol enzyme,i.e. 65% saturated (30Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Google Scholar). No excess, unbound H4B is present. With these two preparations, H4B-free NOS I and H4B-bound NOS I, we investigated whether H4B regulates O2˙¯ generation. In our first series of experiments, we estimated the initial rate of NADPH oxidation by incubating NADPH (150 μm) with either H4B-free NOS I (0.40 μm) or H4B-bound NOS I (0.40 μm) and CaCl2 (2 mm)/calmodulin (100 units/ml). These are important rates to measure, because both enzyme preparations generate O2˙¯ in the absence of l-arginine. Thus, the flux of O2˙¯ and the direct enzymic formation of H2O2 from H4B-free NOS and H4B-bound NOS is dependent on the initial rate of NADPH turnover. We found that the initial rate of NADPH oxidation with H4B-bound NOS I was 164 ± 24 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas with H4B-free NOS I, the initial rate of NADPH consumed was 59 ± 7 nmol/min/mg protein. This enhanced rate of NADPH oxidation when H4B is bound to NOS I was similar to that previously reported (11Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Google Scholar). In the absence of l-arginine, the final electron acceptor from the NADPH/NOS reduction is O2, yielding O2˙¯ and H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide can arise from the dismutation of O2˙¯ as well as the one-electron reduction of NOS-Fe2+O2 followed by release of H2O2 (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, according to O2 consumption experiments, we found that independent of the NOS preparation, 1 mol of NADPH oxidized resulted in 1 mol of O2 consumed (data not shown); the difference is in the ratio of the initial O2 reduction products. The experiments were then designed to determine the onset of O2˙¯ production and the initial rate of H2O2 formation from H4B-free NOS I and H4B-bound NOS I. We first explored the production of O2˙¯ by both enzyme preparations. For the detection of O2˙¯, we used spin trapping and EPR spectroscopy as alternative methods to determine whether NOS-derived O2˙¯ are artifact prone (13Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Google Scholar). For instance, we have previously demonstrated that NOS I will reduce ferricytochromec at a rate faster than its reaction with O2˙¯ (13Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Google Scholar). For these experiments, the nitrone BMPO was used because recent publications (29Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Google Scholar, 38Weaver J. Porasuphatana S. Tsai P. Cao G.-L. Budzichowski T.A. Roman L.J. Rosen G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 781-786Google Scholar) suggested that this compound is the best of the next generation of spin traps for O2˙¯. Surprisingly, the rate constant for the reaction of BMPO with O2˙¯ was not calculated (29Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Google Scholar). Because this is an important factor in assessing the efficiency of spin trapping O2˙¯, this constant was determined. An apparent rate constant for spin trapping O2˙¯ by BMPO was estimated using ferricytochrome c as a competitive inhibitor (33Asada K. Takahashi M. Nagate M. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1974; 38: 471-473Google Scholar), because the rate constant for its reaction with O2˙¯ is known (39Koppenol W.H. Van Burren K.J.H. Butler J. Braams R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 449: 157-168Google Scholar). Further, ferricytochrome c does not interfere with the EPR spectrum of BMPO-OOH. The reaction of BMPO and ferricytochrome c with O2˙¯ can be expressed as follows. O2⨪+BMPO→BMPO­OOHEquation 1 O2⨪+cyto­Fe3+→cyto­Fe2++O2Equation 2 From Equations 1 and 2, the rate of O2˙¯ elimination in the presence of ferricytochrome c can be represented as follows. −d[O2⋅¯]/dt=kapp[BMPO][O2⋅¯]+kcyto­Fe2+[cyto­Fe3+][O2⋅¯]Equation 3 In the absence of cytochrome c, Equation 3 can be described as follows. d[BMBO­OOH]/dt=kapp[BMPO][O2⋅¯]Equation 4 By dividing Equation 4 into Equation 3 and rearranging the terms, the competing reactions become the following. d[O2˙¯]/dt)/(d[BMPO­OOH]/dt)=1+kcyto­Fe2+[cyto­Fe3+]/kapp[BMPO]Equation 5 Under our experimental conditions, the concentration of BMPO is in great excess with respect to the concentration of O2˙¯. Therefore, the relative concentration of the spin-trapped adduct, as determined by EPR spectral peak height, is directly related tok app andk cyto-Fe2+, the rate constants for the spin trapping of O2˙¯ by BMPO and ferricytochromec, respectively, at a given concentration of BMPO. Thus, Equation 5 can be represented as follows. Ao/A=1+kcyto­Fe2+[cyto­Fe3+]/kapp[BMPO]Equation 6 where A o and A represent the rate of spin trapping O2˙¯ (EPR spectral peak height) in the absence and presence of ferricytochrome c, respectively (33Asada K. Takahashi M. Nagate M. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1974; 38: 471-473Google Scholar). If the concentration of the BMPO is fixed, then a plot ofA o/A versus[cyto-Fe3+] generates a straight line, and the slope isk cyto-Fe2+/k app[BMPO]) (40Tsai P. Pou S. Straus R. Rosen G.M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1999; 2: 1759-1763Google Scholar). By using the known rate constant for the reduction of ferricytochrome c by O2˙¯ to ferrocytochromec, k cyto-Fe2+ = 1.1 × 106m−1 s−1 (39Koppenol W.H. Van Burren K.J.H. Butler J. Braams R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 449: 157-168Google Scholar), the k app for BMPO can be calculated. We found k app = 77 ± 5m−1 s−1 (n = 6). We then determined the stability of BMPO-OOH. For these experiments, xanthine/xanthine oxidase was used as a continuous source of O2˙¯, which in these studies afforded a low flux of 1 μm O2˙¯/min. After 10 min, SOD (30 units/ml) was added to quench the reaction. We found the half-life of BMPO-OOH to be 22.8 ± 0.9 min (n = 6) at pH 7.4 (SchemeFS1). In choosing the best spin trap to estimate O2˙¯ production from both enzyme preparations, we need a nitrone whose corresponding spin-trapped adduct of O2˙¯ displays an EPR spectrum that is sufficiently robust to allow accurate measurements of spectral peak heights as a function of time. It appears that BMPO is the appropriate spin trap for these studies. We arrive at this decision based on three important findings. First, the rate constant for the reaction of BMPO with O2˙¯ exceeded that of DMPO, which had been reported to be 15 m−1 s−1 (41Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4994-4999Google Scholar), and it was slightly slower than that found for DEPMPO at 90m−1 s−1 (42Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1994; : 1793-1794Google Scholar). Second, the half-life of BMPO-OOH was considerably greater than for that of DMPO-OOH at 53 s (43Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. Paxton J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 676-685Google Scholar) and in the same range as that for DEPMPO-OOH at 18 min (44Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Google Scholar). Third, the EPR spectrum of BMPO-OOH exhibited a greater signal-to-noise ratio than that found for DEPMPO-OOH. The small signal-to-noise ratio of DEPMPO-OOH was the result of additional hyperfine splitting associated with the phosphorous atom located at the α-carbon on the pyrroline ring. Next, we explored the difference in O2˙¯ production from H4B-bound NOS I and H4B-free NOS I. For these experiments, BMPO (50 mm) was added to a solution containing either H4B-bound NOS I (0.31 μm) or H4B-free NOS I (0.31 μm), NADPH (1 mm), and CaCl2 (2 mm)/calmodulin (100 units/ml). We estimated the rate of producing O2˙¯ by measuring the low field EPR spectral peak height as a function of time (see inset in Fig. 2). Fig. 2 reveals several novel findings. First, H4B-bound NOS I and H4B-free NOS I generated O2˙¯ in the absence of l-arginine. Second, at early time points, within the first several min after the reaction had commenced, H4B-free NOS I produced more O2˙¯ than that found for H4B-bound NOS. This result is remarkable when one considers that the turnover rate for H4B-bound NOS is 2.8 times faster than that for H4B-free NOS. Over time, the difference in the EPR spectral peak heights of BMPO-OOH from H4B-free NOS I and H4B-bound NOS I disappeared, approaching equality after only 4–5 min. When equilibrium had been reached, at ∼8 min, the amount of O2˙¯ spin-trapped by BMPO from H4B-bound NOS I had far exceeded that from H4B-free NOS I. We then investigated the source of H2O2 from H4B-bound NOS and H4B-free NOS. Hydrogen peroxide can be generated from the one-electron reduction of the NOS-Fe2+O2 species followed by release of H2O2 (Fig. 1). Alternatively, this peroxide can arise from the dismutation of O2˙¯, in which the rate constant at pH 7.4 is 3.0 × 105m−1s−1 (45Bielski B.H.J. Allen A.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 1048-1050Google Scholar). It is therefore by no means a trivial task to separate these disparate pathways. After considering several options, we settled on an approach that required increasing the concentration of BMPO to a level so that this nitrone would spin trap most, if not all, of the O2˙¯ produced (41Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4994-4999Google Scholar). Thereupon, the only source of NOS-derived H2O2 would be from the one-electron reduction of the NOS-Fe2+O2 species. We then had to find a method that would meet the following criteria. First, the assay had to detect H2O2 in real time, not at some arbitrary time after the reaction had commenced. Second, the method must not interfere with the spin trapping of O2˙¯. Third, given that NOS can easily transfer electrons to a wide variety of one-electron acceptors, such as ferricytochromec (13Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Google Scholar), the assay had to be an oxidative process. Fourth, the method had to be sensitive and selective for H2O2. Given these limitations, we settled on a fluorometric assay developed by Zhou et al. (36Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Google Scholar, 37Zhou M. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 169-174Google Scholar). The overall mechanism, shown below, involves three distinct reactions, as presented by Chance (46Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Google Scholar). In the first step, H2O2 is reduced by horseradish peroxidase to Compound I. In the second step, Amplex Red is then oxidized by Compound I to give Compound II and the Amplex Red free radical intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with Compound II to regenerate horseradish peroxidase and the corresponding quinone, resorufin, which is the source of the fluorescent measurement (35Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Google Scholar, 36Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Google Scholar), the rate constants for the sequential one-electron reduction of Compounds I and II to the fluorescent resorufin from Amplex Red are unknown. However, based on similar reactions reported in the literature (46Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Google Scholar) involving Compound I and II with other donor molecules, we estimate that the rate constant would not be above 1 × 105m−1s−1, and most likely it is close to 1 × 103m−1 s−1, too slow to allow quantitative estimates of the initial rate of H2O2 production. Therefore, the initial rate of NADPH consumption measured does not have a direct 1:1 relationship with the initial rate of H2O2 generated, as estimated by this fluorescent technique. Rather, only the ratio of initial rates of H2O2 formation can be used to draw conclusions about the relative fluxes of direct H2O2 generated by H4B-bound NOS and H4B-free NOS preparations. Before we could measure the rate of H2O2production from H4B-bound NOS I and H4B-free NOS I, however, a series of control experiments were conducted. Initially, we determined the appropriate concentration of BMPO for the fluorescent assay. Our goal was to find a concentration of BMPO that would maximally spin trap O2˙¯ without inhibiting NOS. For these studies, we added NADPH (1 mm) and CaCl2 (2 mm)/calmodulin (100 units/ml) to H4B-bound NOS I (0.40 μm) while we varied the concentration of BMPO from 50 to 150 mm. We found that at BMPO concentrations above 125 mm, there was no increase in the EPR spectral peak height of BMPO-OOH (data not shown). Under identical experimental conditions, NOS I activity was assessed by determining what effect, if any, BMPO had on enzymatic activity. We incubated NADPH (1 mm), CaCl2 (2 mm)/calmodulin (100 units/ml), l-arginine (50 μm), [14C]l-arginine (0.6 μCi/ml) with H4B-bound NOS I (0.15 μm), and BMPO (ranging from 0 to 150 mm). At concentrations of BMPO greater than 100 mm, significant inhibition in NOS activity was observed. Therefore, we chose a concentration of BMPO at 100 mm for the fluorescent experiments. Next, we determined the effectiveness of BMPO (100 mm) to compete with SOD for NOS-derived O2˙¯ in the fluorescent assay. For these experiments, we mixed NADPH (160 μm) with H4B-bound NOS I (57 nm), CaCl2 (500 μm)/calmodulin (100 units/ml), and SOD (ranging from 0.14 to 80 units/ml). We found that the rate of H2O2production, as measured by an increase in fluorescence, was constant over this range of SOD used in the experiment (data not shown). Thus, where appropriate SOD (0.14 units/ml) was included in each reaction. When BMPO (100 mm) was added to the above reaction mixture, without and with SOD (0.14 units/ml), we found that BMPO spin-trapped ∼90% of the O2˙¯ generated by NOS. Based on these control experiments, we were confident that by inclusion of BMPO in the reaction mixture, most of the NOS-produced O2˙¯ was spin-trapped. It is important to reiterate that although this fluorometric assay is very sensitive and selective for H2O2, the efficiency of this method is unknown. Nevertheless, when the reaction was conducted using only 4 nm of H4B-bound NOS I and H4B-free NOS I, we obtained an initial rate of H2O2formation of 28.7 ± 8.6 and 12.5 ± 2.5 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The experiments presented here were designed to examine whether H4B, bound to NOS I, regulates O2˙¯ production. In previous studies (17Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Google Scholar, 18Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Google Scholar, 23Yoneyama H. Yamamoto A. Kosaka H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 247-253Google Scholar), H4B was added to a NOS I preparation. The observed diminished spin trapping of O2˙¯ may have been the result of excess H4B, which may not have been bound to NOS, that scavenged O2˙¯. In the experiments conducted, unbound H4B was removed by passing the H4B-containing NOS I preparation through a gel filtration column, isolating only H4B-bound NOS I."
https://openalex.org/W1992069812,"Phosphorylation of the highly conserved hydrophobic motif site in AGC kinases is necessary for phosphotransferase activity. Phosphorylation of this motif (FLGFT389Y) in p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) is both rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive, suggesting a role for both mammalian target of rapamycin- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways. We report here that co-expression of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated atypical protein kinase Cζ cooperate to increase both phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif site Thr<sup>389</sup>, as well as the activation loop site Thr<sup>229</sup>. Interestingly, although PDK1 alone can promote an increase in Thr<sup>389</sup> phosphorylation in both wild type S6K1 and a kinase-inactive mutant of S6K1, the cooperative effect between PDK1 and protein kinase Cζ required S6K1 activity. Furthermore, Akt, another phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector and regulator of S6K1, also increased Thr<sup>389</sup>phosphorylation in a S6K1 activity-dependent manner. Consistent with this, epidermal growth factor-induced Thr<sup>389</sup> phosphorylation in wild type S6K1 persisted for up to 120 min, whereas kinase-inactive mutants of S6K1 displayed only a reduced and transient increase in Thr<sup>389</sup> phosphorylation. We conclude that S6K1 activity is required for maximal Thr<sup>389</sup> phosphorylation by mitogens and by multiple phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent inputs including PDK1, PKCζ, and Akt, and we propose that autophosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism for phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif Thr<sup>389</sup> site in S6K1."
https://openalex.org/W2061243481,"We recently generated a transgenic rat model for acute pancreatitis, which was apparently caused by a massive depletion of pancreatic polyamines spermidine and spermine due to inducible activation of their catabolism (Alhonen, L., Parkkinen, J. J., Keinänen, T., Sinervirta, R., Herzig, K. H., and Jänne, J. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 8290–8295). When subjected to partial hepatectomy, these animals showed striking activation of polyamine catabolism at 24 h postoperatively with a profound decrease in hepatic spermidine and spermine pools and failure to initiate liver regeneration. Here we show that pancreatitis in this model could be totally prevented, as judged by histopathology and plasma α-amylase activity, by administration of 1-methylspermidine, a metabolically stable analogue of spermidine. Similarly, the analogue, given prior to partial hepatectomy, restored early liver regeneration in the transgenic rats, as indicated by a dramatic increase in the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive hepatocytes from about 1% to more than 40% in response to the drug. The present results suggest that the extremely high concentration of spermidine in the pancreas, in fact the highest in the mammalian body, may have a critical role in maintaining organ integrity. The failure to initiate liver regeneration in the absence of sufficient hepatic polyamine pools similarly indicates that polyamines are required for proper commencement of the regenerative process."

Transactivation of the classical MHC class I genes is mediated by two groups of juxtaposed cis-acting elements that can be viewed as regulatory modules.

They are essential in the immune response as they present antigen-derived peptides to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and are important in protection against natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

The differential expression of HLA-G and classical HLA class I molecules in trophoblasts suggests a tight transcriptional control, which favors the expression of HLA-G and represses the expression of the classical class I genes HLA-A andHLA-B. Transcriptional control of classical MHC class I genes is mediated by conserved cis-acting regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region. These regulatory elements include enhancer A, the ISRE, and the SXY module (14Van den Elsen P.J. Gobin S.J. van Eggermond M.C. Peijnenburg A. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Enhancer A and the ISRE mediate the constitutive and cytokine-induced expression of MHC class I (15Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Woltman A.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J.

Immunol. 2000; 61: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the regulation of HLA-Gtransactivation and searched for alternative regulatory pathways. We assessed the capacity of putative regulatory elements in the promoter of HLA-G to bind transcription factors and to mediate transcriptional regulation of HLA-G. This search lead to the identification of three CRE/TRE elements, which bind proteins of the CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun families of transcription factors. CREB1 was able to stimulate HLA-G promoter activity in vitro, and the coactivators CBP and p300 enhanced this effect, revealing thatHLA-G is under the transcriptional control of the CREB/ATF family of proteins. The trophoblast-derived cell lines JEG-3 and JAR, the teratocarcinoma cell line Tera-2, the cervical carcinoma HeLa (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji, and the T leukemia cell line Jurkat were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 international units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Luciferase reporter plasmids used were generated by cloning genomic promoter fragments into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). These constructs contain, respectively, a 1438-bp promoter fragment ofHLA-G (pGL3-G1500), a 302-bpβ 2 m PCR-generated promoter fragment (pGL3-β2m), and a 269-bp AspI-AhaIIHLA-B7 promoter fragment (pGL3-HLA-B). The mutant promoter constructs of HLA-G were generated by overlap extension PCR and are based on pGL3-G1500. In the mutant promoter constructs, the putative CRE/TRE site(s) (underlined) were disrupted by introducing aSmaI site or related sequence (bold). The most upstream putative CRE/TRE site (CRE−1380) was flanked by an additional putative CRE/TRE site (both underlined). Therefore, in pGL3-Gm1, both CRE/TRE sites were mutated, changing the CRE−1380 from 5′-GAGAAATGACACACTCTGACTCATAGTAGCAGG-3′ into 5′-GAGAAACCGCCCACTCCCGGGCATAGTAGCAGG-3′. In pGL3-Gm2, the CRE−930 was changed from 5′-GGGGCATTGTGACTGCACTGAACAC-3′ into 5′-GGGGCATTGTCCCGGGGCACTGAACAC-3′, and in pGL3-Gm3, the CRE−770 was changed from 5′-AAACAAGCGGGAGTCACAGATACACT-3′ into 5′-AAACAAGCGCCCGGGACAGATACACT-3′. The mutant pGL3-Gm1–2-3 contained all three mutations in the CRE/TRE sites. All inserts were verified by sequence analysis. The expression vectors Rc/RSV-CREB1 and pECE/RSV-ATF1, Rc/RSV-CBP, and Rc/RSV-p300 and the Renilla luciferase control plasmid pRL-actin were described previously (19Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5175-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The expression vector pSG5-ICER was a kind gift of Dr. P. Quinn. Adherent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with a DNA precipitate of 1 μg of pGL3 reporter plasmid, 1 or 0.5 μg of expression vector, and 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase control plasmid (pRL-actin) per well. The cells were harvested 3 days after transfection. Luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Tropix, Badford, MA) and corrected for transfection efficiency with the Renilla luciferase activity values. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (16Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Woltman A.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1428-1434PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (about 5 μg of protein) were incubated in DNA/protein binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 200 ng of poly(dI·dC), 200 ng of sonicated single stranded herring sperm DNA, and 1 ng of32P-radiolabeled probe for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were run on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at 200 V for 2 h. The gels were fixed with a 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid solution, dried onto Whatman 3M paper, and exposed to an x-ray film. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes and contained the putative CRE/TRE sites of HLA-G: CRE−1380, 5′-GAGAAATGACACACTCTGACTCATAGTAGCAGG-3′; CRE−930, 5′-GGGGCATTGTGACTGCACTGAACAC-3′; and CRE−770, 5′-AAACAAGCGGGAGTCACAGATACACT-3′. In addition, the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes for the putative ISRE and GAS sites: ISRE−754, 5′-CACTGTCTGGGAAAGTGAAACTTAAGAGCTTTGTGAGTC-3′; GAS−1020, 5′-ACTAAGTATTCCTAAAAAATATACAC-3′ and GAS−985, 5′-GTGGATACTTCCTAAAAACAGGCAGTG-3′. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used as consensus probes were: GASc, 5′-CCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGATG-3′ and CREc, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′. For the supershift assays, 1 μg of each Ab specifically directed against a member of the ATF/CREB or IRF families of transcription factors was added 30 min after the nuclear extract had been incubated with the probe, and this mixture was incubated for an extra hour at 4 °C. The antibodies used were directed against CREB1 (a kind gift of Dr. J. M. Boss; 20), CREB/ATF (sc-270), ATF1 (sc-243), CREB1 (sc-271), c-Fos (sc-52), c-Jun (sc-822), CBP (sc-7300), and mouse IRF-1 (sc-640) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, except the first CREB1 antibody). Formaldehyde-crosslinked chromatin was prepared from 2 × 107 cells as described (20Moreno C.S. Beresford G.W. Louis-Plence P. Morris A.C. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The chromatin suspension was precipitated with 5 μg of Ab and pulled-down with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ig-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal, Olso, Norway) or with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After several wash steps, the samples were analyzed by PCR using the primers specific for the promoter region of HLA-G around CRE−1380 (GF−1461, 5′-TGCTCAAGTGCCTGACATTCTAGAAGCTTCACAAGAATGAGGTGGAGCC-3′; GR−1202, 5′-GCTCCTTTTCCTCACCTCCTGCTCCTCCAGCCCCTTCC-3′). The amplified PCR product is 259 bp. Human placenta tissue sections were prepared short after caesarian section delivery and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (tissue material kindly provided by Dr. C. A. Van Meir, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands). Tissue sections were stored at −80 °C. Serial 5-μm-thick cryostat sections of placenta tissue were cut at −25 °C and collected on gelatin-coated glass slides. Tissue sections were dried overnight at 50 °C, fixed in acetone for 10 min, and blocked with 40% human serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Next, the sections were incubated with primary Abs against keratin-7 (OVTL/12/30; IgG1, 1:400; DAKO, Carpintera, CA), HLA-G (G233, IgG2a, 1:200, kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Loke and Dr. A. King), CREB/ATF (sc-270, 4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and CBP (sc-7300, 4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The Abs DAK-G01 (IgG1; 1:50) and DAK-G05 (IgG2a, 1:100; DAKO) were used as isotype controls. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the tissue sections were further incubated with labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Envision+ System, DAKO) for 30 min. Tissue sections were washed three times and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.03% H2O2 for 5 min to give a brown-colored reaction product. The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Our previous studies have shown that the classical regulatory elements found in other MHC class I proximal promoter regions, such as enhancer A, the ISRE, and SXY module, were not intact in the HLA-G promoter. Since HLA-G lacked these conserved regulatory regions in its proximal promoter region, we searched for putative regulatory elements in the extended promoter region of HLA-G that could provide for alternative transcriptional control mechanisms. A computer-aided search in the promoter region first led to the identification of one putative ISRE and two putative GAS sites. The two putative GAS sites (designated GAS−1020 and GAS−985) did not show any detectable STAT1 binding after IFNγ stimulation in JEG-3 nuclear extracts, whereas STAT1 binding to a consensus STAT1 binding site was readily detectable (data not shown). In contrast, the putative ISRE site (designated ISRE−754) showed binding of IRF1 using nuclear extracts from IFNγ-stimulated JEG-3 cells, but no binding of IRF2, IRF3, and STAT1 was detected (Fig.1 A). This IRF1 binding to ISRE−754 raised the possibility of this site to mediate IFNγ-induced transactivation of HLA-G. However, in transient transfection assays, no effect has been detected of IFNγ onHLA-G promoter activity in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, induction of HLA-G promoter activity by IFNα and IFNβ was negligible in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1 B). Previously, a repression of ISRE-mediated induction by IFNγ was detected in trophoblast-derived cell lines (18Gobin S.J.P. Van den Elsen P.J. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since this trophoblast-specific repression could be the cause of the repressed IFN induction of HLA-G in JEG-3 cells, we also tested IFN responses in Tera-2 cells, in which classical MHC class I genes are readily induced by IFNγ (16Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Woltman A.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1428-1434PubMed Google Scholar). However, also in this cell type, the promoter activity of HLA-G by IFNβ or IFNγ was not induced at greater than 2-fold (Fig. 1 C) despite a strong induction of HLA-B and β 2 mpromoter activity by these IFNs. This shows that these ISRE and GAS boxes do not play a significant role in HLA-Gtransactivation. A further search revealed the presence of three potential CRE/TRE sites (designated CRE−1380, CRE−930, and CRE−770) in the promoter of HLA-G. The most upstream of the three sequences (CRE−1380) was flanked by a second potential CRE/TRE site. Interestingly, this double CRE/TRE site (CRE−1380) was positioned in the region shown previously to be important for the tissue-specific expression of HLA-Gin transgenic mice (21Schmidt C.M. Ehlenfeldt R.G. Athanasiou M.C. Duvick L.A. Heinrichs H. David C.S. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2633-2645PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested the three CRE/TRE sites (CRE−1380, CRE−930, and CRE−770) for binding activity of proteins of the CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun families of transcription factors in vitro. The most upstream CRE/TRE site (CRE−1380) showed binding of complexes containing CREB1, ATF1, and c-Jun (Fig. 2). The second CRE/TRE site (CRE−930) predominantly showed binding of a complex that contained predominantly CREB1, whereas the third CRE/TRE site (CRE−770) showed binding of CREB1 and ATF1 (Fig. 2). This implies that the CRE/TRE sites bind different heterodimers, which could be formed between CREB1, ATF1, and c-Jun, and that CREB1 was the predominant factor in the complexes binding to these sites. To establish the in vivo binding of CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun proteins, we performed a ChIP assay. Using this assay, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked JEG-3 DNA with Abs recognizing CREB/ATF, CREB, c-Fos, or c-Jun showed the in vivo binding of CREB-1 and c-Jun to the upstream of the HLA-G promoter region around CRE−1380 in JEG-3 cells (Fig.3). However, this binding appeared not to be tissue-specific because in vivo CREB binding to theHLA-G promoter was also detected in Tera-2 and Raji cells (data not shown). The contribution of these CRE/TRE sites to HLA-G transactivation was tested in a reporter gene assay using a construct encompassing the 1438-bp promoter region of HLA-G. Both CREB1 and ATF1 could enhanceHLA-G promoter activity (Fig.4 A). However, co-transfection of CREB1 with ATF1 could not further enhance transactivation (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly,HLA-B promoter activity was not significantly induced by CREB1 in JEG-3 cells (data not shown). Co-transfection of CREB1 with the coactivators CBP and p300 also enhanced CREB1-induced transactivation of HLA-G (Fig. 4 B). Neither c-Fos nor c-Jun could significantly stimulate promoter activity ofHLA-G (data not shown). CREB1 could also enhanceHLA-G promoter activity in Tera-2 cells, indicating that for this CREB-mediated transactivation, no trophoblast-specific transcription factors are required (data not shown). The role of CREB in the transactivation of HLA-G was further investigated by testing the effect of ICER, which can repress CREB-mediated transcription (22Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In transient co-transfection experiments, ICER strongly inhibited the CREB-induced transactivation of HLA-G(Fig. 4 C). At higher concentrations (1–8 μg/well), ICER was also able to reduce the basal promoter activity of HLA-G(88–28% of normal; data not shown). To investigate the importance of the individual CRE/TRE sites in the transactivation of HLA-G, we introduced mutations in the CRE/TRE sites CRE−1380, CRE−930, and CRE−770. Transient transfection assays of these modifiedHLA-G constructs, bearing a mutation in the individual CRE/TRE sites (pGL3-Gm1, pGL3-Gm2, and pGL3-Gm3) or in all three CRE/TRE sites (pGL3-Gm1–2-3), revealed that mutation in only one of the three CRE sites resulted only in a strong reduction of transactivation, whereas mutation of all three CRE sites abrogated the ability of CREB to enhance the transactivation of HLA-G(Fig. 4 D). Furthermore, the basal levels of HLA-Gtransactivation of the mutation constructs were reduced to a various extent, being the lowest for the HLA-G construct with CRE−1380 mutated (pGL3-Gm1; Fig. 4 D). This indicates that the contribution of CRE−1380 was most important followed by CRE−930 and CRE−770. Similar results were observed in other cell lines, indicating that the importance of the three CRE/TRE sites for the basal level of promoter activity was ubiquitous (data not shown). Together, this demonstrates that the three CRE/TRE sites in the promoter region of HLA-Gare important for the CREB-mediated transactivation ofHLA-G. The promoter binding and regulation ofHLA-G by CREB in the trophoblast cell line JEG-3 inferred co-expression of HLA-G with its regulating transcription factors in trophoblast tissue. To investigate the physiological relevance of this transactivation pathway, we tested for the in situexpression of CREB, CBP, and HLA-G by immunohistochemical analysis. In caesarian section-derived placenta tissue, the extravillous cytotrophoblast cells were identified on the basis of their morphology and their strong staining for keratin-7 (data not shown). These extravillous cytotrophoblasts also stained strongly for HLA-G, particularly on the cell membrane (Fig.5 B). This expression of HLA-G in the cells coincided with the predominantly nuclear staining of CREB/ATF and CBP (Fig. 5, C and D). The in situnuclear localization of CREB/ATF and CBP indicates that these transcription factors could fulfil their role in HLA-Gtransactivation in trophoblast cells. Detailed studies have shown that HLA-G is found in extravillous cytotrophoblasts and few other tissues. The limited tissue distribution suggests that HLA-G has specialized immunological functions during pregnancy (3Le Bouteiller P. Solier C. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Carosella E.D. Dausset J. Kirszenbaum M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 407-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Le Bouteiller P. Solier C. Pröll J. Aguerre-Girr M. Fournel S. Lenfant F. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Among the MHC class I molecules, the regulation HLA-G is not well understood. HLA-G is not regulated by the transactivation pathways that govern the expression of the classical MHC class I molecules (Fig. 6). Conservedcis-acting regulatory elements that are known to govern the transcription of the classical class I molecules, such as enhancer A, the ISRE, and the SXY module, diverge significantly in HLA-G(18Gobin S.J.P. Van den Elsen P.J. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The two putative κB sites of enhancer A of HLA-Ghave been shown to bind predominantly the p50 homodimer of NF-κB using nuclear extract of B cells (15Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar). However, in trophoblast cells, there is no (basal) NF-κB expression, and it is barely induced by tumor necrosis factor-α. 2S. J. P. Gobin, J. E. M. de Steenwinkel, P. Biesta, and P. J. Van den Elsen, unpublished results. Furthermore, p50 homodimers do not posses transactivation properties, which explains the lack of response to tumor necrosis factor-α and the lack of activation by cotransfected NF-κB in reporter gene assays.2 In addition, the most upstream of the two κB sites (κB2) has been found to bind also Sp1 (15Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar). The directly flanking and downstream positioned ISRE region is partly deleted and has no binding affinity for IRF1, IRF2, p48, or STAT1 (16Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Woltman A.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1428-1434PubMed Google Scholar). However, a probe encompassing this ISRE region was able to bind Sp1. It is possible that Sp1 acting through these sites could contribute to the basal level of HLA-G transactivation. The SXY module ofHLA-G is also different from the consensus sequences of the X1, X2, and Y boxes. Although others have detected a weak binding of RFX to the X1 box of HLA-G (24Rousseau P. Paul P. O'Brien M. Dausset J. Carosella E.D. Moreau P. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), our efforts to determine binding of protein complexes to the SXY module with electrophoretic mobility shift assay favoring multiprotein complex formation did not reveal any significant binding of the RFX·CREB/ATF·NFY complex, such as that observed for classical MHC class I genes (19Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5175-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).2 Also, individual binding of CREB/ATF to the X2 box or NFY binding to the Y box of HLA-G was not observed in contrast to the binding of CREB/ATF and NFY to the X and Y boxes of HLA-B (19Gobin S.J.P. Van Zutphen M. Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5175-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).2 This explains the lack of induction of HLA-G by CIITA (14Van den Elsen P.J. Gobin S.J. van Eggermond M.C. Peijnenburg A. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Gobin S.J.P. Van den Elsen P.J. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There is still much debate as to whether HLA-G is responsive to IFN. Previous reports have indicated that HLA-G is weakly induced by IFNγ and IFNβ (25Lefebvre S. Berrih-Aknin S. Adrian F. Moreau P. Poea S. Gourand L. Dausset J. Carosella E.D. Paul P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6133-61399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified one putative ISRE and two putative GAS sites. Indeed, the putative ISRE site (ISRE−754) showed binding of IRF1 using nuclear extracts from IFNγ-stimulated JEG-3 cells. However, no STAT1 binding was detected to the two putative GAS sites (GAS−1020 and GAS−985), which is in line with findings by others (26Chu W. Gao J. Murphy W.J. Hunt J.S. Hum Immunol. 1999; 60: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The binding of IRF1 to the ISRE−754 raised the possibility that IFNγ could induce transactivation of HLA-G. However, in transient transfection assays, no effect was detected of IFNγ onHLA-G promoter activity in JEG-3 cells. Similarly, induction of HLA-G promoter activity by IFNα and IFNβ was negligible in JEG-3 cells. Also in Tera-2 cells, the promoter activity of HLA-G was never induced more strongly than 2-fold by IFNβ or IFNγ, which was in contrast to the strong induction of the promoter activity of HLA-B andβ 2 m by these IFNs. We therefore concluded that the extended promoter of HLA-G is not significantly responsive to stimulation by IFN. In our search for alternative regulatory pathways that control the transcription of HLA-G, we identified three CRE/TRE elements in the promoter region of HLA-G (Fig. 6). Using the trophoblast-derived cell line JEG-3, the sites bound CREB1, ATF1, and c-Jun in vitro. The binding of different proteins of the CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun families of proteins allows the formation of various dimers. However, the precise composition of the protein complexes binding to the promoter is not certain, and the participation of other transcription factors cannot be excluded. Furthermore, in ChIP assays, CREB1 and c-Jun were found associated to the upstream promoter region (containing CRE−1380) in vivo. Previously, this region has been associated with the tissue-specific expression of HLA-G in transgenic mice and was shown to display protein binding activity (21Schmidt C.M. Ehlenfeldt R.G. Athanasiou M.C. Duvick L.A. Heinrichs H. David C.S. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2633-2645PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moreau P. Paul P. Gourand L. Prost S. Dausset J. Carosella E. Kirszenbaum M. Hum. Immunol. 1997; 52: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our data show that HLA-G transactivation is regulated by CREB since CREB augmented promoter activity and ICER reduced CREB-mediated promoter activity in reporter assays. In addition, the activation by CREB was further enhanced by overexpression of the coactivators CBP/p300. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed the importance of all three CRE/TRE sites in the regulation ofHLA-G transcription by CREB and the basal level of promoter activity of HLA-G. CREB1 could also enhance HLA-Gpromoter activity in non-trophoblast cell lines, indicating that for this CREB-mediated transactivation, no trophoblast-specific transcription factors are required. However, HLA-B promoter activity was not significantly induced by CREB1 in JEG-3 cells, suggesting a differential regulation of HLA-G versus classical MHC class I promoters in trophoblasts. CREB is thought to be an important factor for the expression of genes in trophoblasts and during differentiation. Similar toHLA-G, the α subunit of glycoprotein hormone is regulated by multiple sites including CRE (28Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31650-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Knöpfler M. Saleh L. Bauer S Vasicek R. Griesinger G. Strohmer H. Helmer H. Husslein P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3737-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Budworth P.R. Quinn P.G. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue-specific expression of the α subunit of glycoprotein hormone was controlled by an additional regulatory element mediating the trophoblast-specific expression that is not found in the HLA-G promoter. Moreover, CREB/ATF proteins are ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, and ChIP analysis revealed the binding of CREB to theHLA-G promoter in several cell lines not expressing HLA-G. Therefore, they are not likely to account for tissue-specific expression, although it cannot be excluded that a difference between trophoblasts and other cells in the composition of the CREB/ATF dimer complex binding the CRE sites contributes to the trophoblast-specific expression (31Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Servillo G. Della Fazia M.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether a specific regulatory site or transcription factor(s) is responsible for the trophoblast-specific expression of HLA-G. It could also be envisaged that more general mechanisms play a role in the tissue-specific expression or silencing of HLA-G, such as promoter methylation. Indeed, treatment with 5-azacytidine brought about expression of HLA-G in several cell lines lacking HLA-G expression (JAR, HeLa) as detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR, whereas in other cell lines, no induction of HLA-G expression was observed. 3S. J. P. Gobin, P. Biesta, and P. J. Van den Elsen, unpublished results. However, in vitro promoter methylation of the pGL3-G1438 reporter construct only resulted in a weak reduction of promoter activity and of CREB-induced transactivation.3 Moreover, in several cell lines lacking HLA-G expression (Tera-2, Jurkat), no methylation of the HLA-G promoter was observed.3This suggests that, although it may contribute, promoter methylation is certainly not the sole mechanism securing a tissue-specific expression of HLA-G (33Guillaudeux T. D'Almeide M. Girr M. Rodriguez A.M. Pontarotti P. Fauchet R. Le Bouteiller P. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1993; 30: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Another general epigenetic mechanism that could play a role in the trophoblast-specific expression of HLA-G is the recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. As stated before, the HLA-G promoter contains two κB sites in enhancer A, which display binding affinity specifically for p50 homodimers (15Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar). Since the p50 subunit of NF-κB does not possess transactivating activity and NF-κB factors are present in most cell types but not in trophoblast cells, the functional relevance of this binding in non-trophoblast cells has remained unclear. However, a recent study has attributed a role for p50 to establish transcriptional silencing through its recruitment of HDAC1 (34Zhong H. May M, J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It could be speculated that in non-trophoblast cells, p50 homodimer binding to the κB sites of HLA-G recruits HDAC1, which represses HLA-G transcription and as such contributes to the tissue-specific expression of HLA-G. Taken together, multiple CRE/TRE sites in the promoter region of HLA-G mediate its regulation by CREB/ATF factors.

Six major adducts are formed as shown in mouse mammary tumor cells and their precise molecular structures have been elucidated (4Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Musser S.M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 479-488Google Scholar). Very recently, the MC derivative decarbamoyl mitomycin C (DMC; Chart FC1) was shown to generate an array of DNA cross-links and monoadducts in EMT6 mouse mammary tumor cells that had similar or identical structures to those formed with MC. 2Palom, Y., Suresh Kumar, G., Tang, L.-Q., Paz, M. M., Musser, S. M., Rockwell, S., and Tomasz, M. (2002)Chem. Res. Toxicol., in press. One of these, a monoadduct that is a stereoisomer of one of the monoadducts formed by MC is formed predominantly upon treatment with DMC.2 In contrast, another mitomycin derivative, 2,7-diaminomitosene (2,7-DAM), the major metabolite of MC in tumor cells (10Chirrey L. Cummings J. Halbert G.W. Smyth J.F. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 318-322Google Scholar), forms only monofunctional DNA adducts in the same cell line (4Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Musser S.M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 479-488Google Scholar, 11Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Kumar G.S. Arai H. Kasai M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Oncol.

A comparison of the three drugs with respect to their DNA cross-linking and monoalkylating activities and their specific DNA adducts formed in the EMT6 cells is summarized in Table I and the corresponding DNA adducts are shown in ChartFC2.Table IFrequencies of DNA monoadducts and cross-links formed in EMT6 mouse mammary tumor cells treated with MC, DMC, or 2,7-DAM at 10 μm concentrationDrugMonoadduct frequencyCross-link frequencySpecific DNA adducts formed (Chart FC2)1234567mol/mol DNA nucleotideMCaFrom data in Ref. 9; error limits are omitted.1.4 × 10−64.8 × 10−7++++++−DMCaFrom data in Ref. 9; error limits are omitted.5.3 × 10−53.4 × 10−7+−+−−−+2,7-DAMbFrom data in Ref. 11; linearly extrapolated from treatment with 40 μm 2,7-DAM to that with 10 μm 2,7-DAM.9.5 × 10−60−−−−++−a From data in Ref. 9Chen X.

Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 39-47Google Scholar, 13Carrano A.V. Thompson L.H. Stetka D.G. Minkler J.L. Mazrimas J.A. Fong S. Mutat. Res. 1979; 63: 175-188Google Scholar, 14Hoban P.R. Walton M.I. Robson C.N. Godden J. Stratford I.J. Workman P. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4692-4697Google Scholar), whereas 2,7-DAM is essentially noncytotoxic in the cell lines tested (11Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Kumar G.S. Arai H. Kasai M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 509-521Google Scholar, 15Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Tang L.Q. Mehta S.S. Sartorelli A.C. Pritsos C.A. Pritsos K.L. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1517-1529Google Scholar). Because the cytotoxicity of these drugs correlates with the frequencies of the DNA cross-link adducts but not with the DNA monoadducts, these findings point to cross-links as being the lesions primarily responsible for the cytotoxicities of the mitomycins.2 It is therefore apparent that the specific structures of the various DNA adducts play a differential role in the cytotoxicity of MC. The basis for a differential cytotoxic activity of the individual DNA adducts of MC is not known. However, p53 induction has been correlated in many instances with the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs (16Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L. Ruley H.E. Fisher D.E. Housman D.E. Jacks T. Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Google Scholar). Although it was known that treatment of mammalian cells with MC results in an increase in the level of p53 (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar) the outcome on p53 induction by DMC and 2,7-DAM had not been investigated. Little is known about how particular DNA adducts can activate a signal transduction program that culminates in p53 accumulation. Furthermore, studies focused on the cytotoxic activities of MC, DMC, or 2,7-DAM have not addressed the possible involvement of the tumor suppressor p53 in mediating the cytotoxic or apoptotic response. It may be hypothesized that the cytotoxic mechanism of MC is mediated, at least in part, by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar,18Inoue T. Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 196-201Google Scholar). The ability of DNA adducts to induce p53 has been implicated by the fact that agents that generate multiple type DNA adducts also cause the accumulation of p53 (19Khan Q.A. Agarwal R. Seidel A. Frank H. Vousden K.H. Dipple A. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 115-120Google Scholar, 20Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2117-2124Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to recognize a general correlation between cytotoxicities and the induction of p53 thus far (Ref. 21Zamble D.B. Jacks T. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6163-6168Google Scholar and references therein). The lack of cytotoxicity of 2,7-DAM in contrast to MC and DMC may be explained by the hypothesis that 2,7-DAM-DNA monoadducts are unable to induce a signal transduction pathway that culminates in the induction of p53. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the induction of p53 in a wild-type p53 containing myeloid leukemia cell line (ML-1) by MC, DMC, and 2,7-DAM. We report here a dramatic differential p53 response in ML-1 cells treated with MC and DMC versus treatment with 2,7-DAM. We further show that a human myeloid leukemia cell line (K562), lacking functional p53 is resistant to MC but not DMC cytotoxic effects. Camptothecin, propidium iodide, MTT assay reagents, and anti-actin were purchased from Sigma. Zeocin was purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. D. M. Vyas (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) supplied MC. 2,7-DAM and DMC were synthesized from MC as previously described (12Kim S.Y. Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 39-47Google Scholar, 22Suresh Kumar G. Musser S.M. Cummings J. Tomasz M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9209-9217Google Scholar). The ML-1 cells were a generous gift from Michael Kastan. This myeloid leukemia cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 5% CO2. The K562 leukemia cell line was purchased from ATCC and does not contain p53 (23Law J.C. Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Leder G.H. Ferrell R.E. Leuk. Res. 1993; 17: 1045-1050Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105/ml and exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. ML-1 or K562 cells were grown in 1× RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Exponentially growing cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105/ml in 24-well plates and either left untreated or treated with graded dosages of MC, DMC, or 2,7-DAM for 24 h. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in 0.5 ml of MTT containing medium (0.5 mg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.04n HCl in isopropyl alcohol to lyse the cells. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were spun down and 250-μl aliquots were used for absorbance measurements. Cell viability was measured as the difference in the absorbance 550 and 620 nm. The assay detects living, but not dead cells. Data are expressed as a percent of the control healthy growing strain. FACS analysis was carried out on a BD Biosciences scan. Cells were spun down at 2300 rpm for 7 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. Ethanol (9 ml) was then added dropwise while vortexing. Propidium iodide staining and RNase treatment were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min 24 h prior to flow cytometry. Nuclear extract was prepared using a variation on the Dignam Protocol (24Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Google Scholar). Cells were spun down and resuspended in 5 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). They were then put on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 2 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (volume prior to the initial wash). The cells were run through a 25-gauge needle twice and nuclei were then spun down at 2,000 rpm for 10 min followed by an additional 20-min spin at the 15,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended at 109 cells per 3 ml of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) by running it through a 25-gauge needle twice. The suspension was rocked gently for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific to p53 (pAbs 1801, 240, and 421). PARP cleavage was detected using a monoclonal anti-PARP antibody from Pharmingen. The blots were probed with anti-actin (Sigma) to normalize for gel loading. The signals were visualized after incubation with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody using ECL solutions. For each sample, 3 μg of cytoplasmic RNA obtained with TRISOL (Sigma) was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min with 200 pmol of oligo(dT)15 primer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 10 μl. After cooling on ice, 10 μl of reverse transcriptase mixture was added: 2× AMV buffer, 12.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 mm dNTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor RNasin (Promega). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Heating samples at 95 °C for 1 min stopped reactions. Sample volumes were then adjusted to 100 μl with H2O and samples were stored at −80 °C. PCR primer pairs were designed to anneal to their target at the same temperature (55 °C) and to amplify DNA fragments of ∼100 bp as described previously (25Xiao G. Chicas A. Olivier M. Taya Y. Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Bargonetti J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1711-1719Google Scholar). For PCR with molecular beacons, 10 μl of the diluted RT products were used. The reactions were carried out under the following conditions. 1× TaqMan buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm dNTP, 15 pmol of each primers, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 125 ng of the appropriate molecular beacon. Forty cycles of amplification (94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 55 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C elongation for 30 s) were carried out in sealed tubes in an Applied Biosystems 7700 Prism spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence was measured during the annealing step and plotted automatically for each sample. The primer pairs used for the PCR reactions were synthesized by Operon and were the following:P21, forward primer, 5′-ACCTTCCAGCTCCTGTAACATACT-3′, antisense primer, 5′-GTCTAGGTGGAGAAACGGGAA-3′; Gadd45, forward primer, 5′-CCATGCAGGAAGGAAAACTATG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-CCCAAACTATGGCTGCACACT-3′; GAPDH, forward primer, 5′-AGAGCACAAGAGGAAGAGAGAGACC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-AACTGTGAGGAGGGGAGATTCAG-3′. The sequences of the molecular beacons were the following: P21, 5′-CGCTGCAGGACACATGGGGAGCCGAGCAGCG-3′; Gadd45, 5′-CGCTGCAGAATGGTTGAGTTACATTAAAATAAACCGCAGCG-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-GGACGCGGTGGGGGACTGAGTGTGGCGTCC-3′. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased for this study from Operon. The superconsensus site contained three adjacent p53 half-sites (26Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Google Scholar). The sequence of this oligonucleotide was 5′-TCGAGCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTC-3′. Labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I and [32P]dCTP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (30 μl) were carried out in reaction mixtures with 150 pmol of 32P-oligonucleotide. 10 μg of nuclear extract was added and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of pAb421 as indicated. Samples were separated by 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gels were pre-run at 100 V for 15 min at 4 °C) at 200 V for 3–3.5 h. Gels were dried for 1 h at 55 °C and autoradiography was performed. The noncytotoxic effect of 2,7-DAM suggested that the DNA monoadducts produced in cells after treatment with this compound were unable to induce a signal transduction pathway that culminated in the induction of p53. We tested this hypothesis by treating the ML-1 cell line (a well established line for its p53 response to various different DNA damaging drugs) with MC, DMC, and 2,7-DAM, as well as with two other drugs shown previously to induce p53 (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). Treatment was carried out with the mitomycins at a concentration of 5 μm for 3 and 6 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot as shown in Fig.1. Both MC and DMC induced a robust stabilization of p53 (Fig. 1, lanes 2–5) at both time points, whereas no p53 stabilization was detected in cells that had been treated with the same concentration of 2,7-DAM (Fig. 1,lanes 6 and 7). Higher doses of 2,7-DAM (50–100 μm) also failed to induce detectable levels of p53 (data not shown). It can be stated with high certainty that 2,7-DAM was unable to induce p53 as the Western blot analysis was carried out using a mixture of p53 monoclonal antibodies specific to the central domain as well as the carboxyl and amino terminus (pAb240, pAb421, and pAb1801, respectively). It is therefore highly unlikely that any p53 induced by 2,7-DAM would go undetected by the Western blot procedure employed. Both MC and DMC were able to induce p53 to levels comparable with those induced by treatment of the ML-1 cells with camptothecin (a topoisomerase targeting poison) and Zeocin (a member of the family of bleomycins) (Fig. 1, lanes 8–11). The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that activates a multitude of downstream target genes (27Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Google Scholar). Two p53 downstream target genes that are well characterized are p21waf1 and gadd45 (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar, 29Kastan M.B. Zhan Q., El- Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Google Scholar). We analyzed the transactivation of the endogenous p21 andgadd45 genes in the ML-1 cell line in response to the chemotherapeutic drug treatments shown above. The drugs able to result in the stabilization of p53 (MC, DMC, Cpt, and Zeocin) also induced significant transactivation of the endogenous p21 and gadd45genes as monitored by RT-PCR with molecular beacons (Fig.2, A and B, respectively). The ML-1 cells treated with 2,7-DAM on the other hand showed very limited transactivation of the endogenous p53 target genes tested and this limited activation decreased at the longer time point (Fig. 2, A and B). The treatment of ML-1 cells with both MC and DMC was able to induce p53 and also resulted in the activation of p21 and gadd45 transcription. This suggested that treatment of the ML-1 cells with both drugs resulted in stabilization of the p53 species that were able to bind to DNA. We analyzed the DNA binding ability of p53 in nuclear extracts derived from ML-1 cells treated with MC, DMC, and 2,7-DAM by EMSA (Fig.3 A). Although MC and DMC form different DNA adducts (Table I) both resulted in an increase in the level of p53 (Fig. 1) and an increase in the p53 DNA binding ability (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and3) when ML-1 cells were treated with a drug concentration of 5 μm for 6 h. Not surprisingly, no p53-specific gel shift was detected in nuclear extract derived from ML-1 cells treated with 5 μm 2,7-DAM for 6 h (Fig. 3 A,lane 4). The pAb421 induced gel shift species detected in the ML-1 nuclear extract from drug-treated cells has been determined to be specific by competition analysis with nonlabeled specific and nonspecific oligonucleotide and a representative example is shown (Fig.3 B). Because treatment of ML-1 cells with MC and DMC, but not 2,7-DAM, was able to result in the stabilization of p53 we asked if this correlated with the ability of MC and DMC, but not 2,7-DAM, to induce apoptosis. ML-1 cells were treated with 5 μm MC, DMC, or 2,7-DAM for 24 h and the cells were then fixed and stained with propidium iodide. The samples were analyzed by FACS and compared with nondrug-treated cells to assess the increase in sub-G1 DNA content (Fig.4 A). Both the MC- and DMC-treated ML-1 cells showed a substantial increase in sub-G1 DNA content (although not as dramatic as that seen with Cpt), indicating that the ML-1 cells initiated apoptosis in response to these drugs. The ML-1 cells treated with 2,7-DAM on the other hand showed no increase in sub-G1 DNA content after 24 h of treatment, indicating that these cells were in fact not undergoing cell death. Apoptosis was also monitored by PARP cleavage and this further confirmed the induction of apoptosis by MC and DMC but not by 2,7-DAM treatment (Fig. 4 D). To address the ability of MC and DMC to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53, the K562 cell line (a line without p53 (23Law J.C. Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Leder G.H. Ferrell R.E. Leuk. Res. 1993; 17: 1045-1050Google Scholar)) was treated and analyzed in the same way. No substantial increase in sub-G1 DNA content was observed when the K562 cells were treated for 24 h with MC or 2,7-DAM (Fig.4, B and E). Surprisingly, although K562 cells did not undergo apoptosis when treated with MC, a substantial increase in apoptotic cells resulted after DMC treatment as determined by FACS analysis and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4, B andE). This demonstrates that DMC was able to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner whereas MC was not. Therefore, although DMC is able to induce p53, its entire cytotoxic effect does not require p53. Cytotoxicity can be observed in the absence of apoptotosis (30Gardner A.M., Xu, F.H. Fady C. Jacoby F.J. Duffey D.C., Tu, Y. Lichtenstein A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 73-83Google Scholar) and therefore the cytotoxicities of the panel of mitomycins were compared utilizing the ML-1 cells to confirm that 2,7-DAM was not cytotoxic. Cytotoxicity of the three mitomycins was monitored by the MTT cytotoxicity assay (Fig.5) as well as by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Cytotoxicity was observed when ML-1 cells were treated with MC and DMC but not when they were treated with 2,7-DAM (Fig. 5 A). Therefore 2,7-DAM treatment of ML-1 cells did not induce p53, did not induce apoptosis, and was not cytotoxic to the ML-1 cells. We also analyzed the cytotoxicity of these drugs in the p53 null cell line K562 to investigate their p53 independent cytotoxicities. Under these conditions 2,7-DAM was observed to be noncytotoxic, whereas MC demonstrated limited cytotoxicity and DMC was cytotoxic at the 5 and 10 μm drug concentrations (Fig. 5 B). This correlated with the observation that DMC was able to induce PARP cleavage in the K562 cell (Fig. 4 E). Although Fig. 5demonstrates that DMC is not as cytotoxic to K562 cells as it is to ML-1 cells, it is clearly more cytotoxic to K562 cells than either MC or 2,7-DAM. It is often stated that DNA damage activates the tumor suppressor p53. Normally p53 is present at low levels and specific stimuli are able to elicit signal transduction pathways that allow for the stabilization of p53. Chemotherapeutic drugs that damage DNA function to a great extent by activating pathways that result in p53 stabilization (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). MC is a clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drug whose mode of action continues to be investigated. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to the DNA adducts induced by MC and DMC, the monofunctional derivative of MC 2,7-DAM allows for DNA adducts that are unable to activate p53. Thus this form of DNA damage evades the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and is not cytotoxic. Previously it was shown that MC and DMC are equally cytotoxic in various rodent cell lines (12Kim S.Y. Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 39-47Google Scholar, 13Carrano A.V. Thompson L.H. Stetka D.G. Minkler J.L. Mazrimas J.A. Fong S. Mutat. Res. 1979; 63: 175-188Google Scholar, 14Hoban P.R. Walton M.I. Robson C.N. Godden J. Stratford I.J. Workman P. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4692-4697Google Scholar). The present work extends this finding to human myeloid leukemia cells. The cytotoxicity of MC has been attributed mainly to the generation of lethal DNA cross-links. DMC was initially thought to be devoid of DNA cross-linking activity, based on chemical considerations and on tests carried out in cell-free systems that employed chemical reductive drug activation (13Carrano A.V. Thompson L.H. Stetka D.G. Minkler J.L. Mazrimas J.A. Fong S. Mutat. Res. 1979; 63: 175-188Google Scholar, 31Tomasz M. Lipman R. McGuinness B.F. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5892-5896Google Scholar). Consequently, DMC has traditionally been regarded as the monofunctional counterpart of MC; however, this is not the case. We demonstrated recently, using a mouse mammary tumor cell line, that DMC generates the DNA cross-link adduct 3 (see Chart FC2) at frequencies comparable with those observed with MC under equidose drug treatment conditions. In contrast, the frequencies of monoadducts, also generated by both drugs, are widely different, with DMC displaying 20–50-fold greater monoadduct frequencies than MC2 (see Table I and Chart FC2). These findings suggest that the DNA cross-links, common to both drugs, are major determinants of the drugs cytotoxicity and possibly of their abilities to induce the stabilization of p53. We show here that the ability of the two cytotoxic mitomycins to form DNA cross-links correlates with the ability of these drugs to induce the p53 pathway. The 2,7-DAM-DNA adducts do not contribute to cytotoxicity of MC (11Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Kumar G.S. Arai H. Kasai M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 509-521Google Scholar, 15Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Tang L.Q. Mehta S.S. Sartorelli A.C. Pritsos C.A. Pritsos K.L. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1517-1529Google Scholar). In keeping with this lack of cytotoxicity of 2,7-DAM we show here that this compound is also unable to induce p53, suggesting that there is a connection between MC cytotoxicity and the ability to induce p53 in ML-1 cells. Indeed, of the three mitomycin drugs MC, DMC, and 2,7-DAM investigated here, only MC and DMC are significantly cytotoxic and only the same two drugs elicit the accumulation of p53. Therefore the ability of MC and DMC to signal for the induction of p53 may require the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links. However, the work presented here does not rule out the possibility that monoadducts, as long as they are not the ones produced by 2,7-DAM, might have the ability to activate the p53 pathway. In fact, no direct relationship seems to exist between the structural nature of the DNA damage and stabilization of p53. UV light-induced DNA structural damage does not include DNA cross-links, yet p53 is stabilized as a result (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). O 6-Methylguanine lesions of DNA, produced by the simple alkylating agentN-methyl-N′-nitro-nitrosoguanidine induce p53 efficiently (32Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Google Scholar); antibenzo[a]pyrene-diolepoxide, which forms bulky N2-guanine monoadducts also induces p53 (33Wani M.A. Zhu Q., El- Mahdy M. Venkatachalam S. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2273-2280Google Scholar). Thus, p53 induction can occur by specific types of monofunctional DNA lesions. It is likely to be mediated by the action of proteins specific to the particular structure of the lesion (see Ref. 32Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Google Scholar). Highly relevant to the present findings, it has been shown that DNA interstrand cross-links, formed by psoralen, induce “futile repair synthesis” (34Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Google Scholar), and the authors suggest that this process, rather than the cross-links per se, is responsible for inducing the p53 pathway. It is conceivable that the differential effects of the three mitomycin derivatives originate from the analogous phenomenon. The fact that a mechanism exists in cells through reductive conversion of MC to 2,7-DAM to evade the cytotoxic potential of MC (11Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Kumar G.S. Arai H. Kasai M. Sartorelli A.C. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 509-521Google Scholar, 15Palom Y. Belcourt M.F. Tang L.Q. Mehta S.S. Sartorelli A.C. Pritsos C.A. Pritsos K.L. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1517-1529Google Scholar) should be considered. It is likely that cells defective in this conversion will be more sensitive to MC treatment. Furthermore, derivatives of MC and/or MC analogues that cannot be metabolized (and thereby inactivated) to 2,7-DAM may be more effective in treating malignancies. Because of this DMC may be considered a more compelling clinical choice for use as a chemotherapeutic. DMC is cytotoxic, can induce p53 and does so in the absence of producing DNA adducts that can be evaded. In contrast to MC, DMC was also capable of inducing apoptosis in the absence of p53 (as observed by drug treatment of the K562 myeloid leukemia cell line lacking p53). Although DMC was not as cytotoxic to K562 cells as it was to ML-1 cells, DMC was more cytotoxic to K562 cells than either MC or 2,7-DAM. This may be clinically relevant especially given the fact that over 50% of total human cancers have defective or mutated p53 genes (35Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Presinger C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Google Scholar). Perhaps this cytotoxicity results because DMC is able to activate an alternative DNA damage pathway that utilizes either p73 or BRCA1 (9Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Google Scholar,36Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Google Scholar). This may be a reason for considering DMC for use in cancer chemotherapy. When choosing drugs to treat specific cancers it will be important in general to consider alternate DNA damage-mediated pathways.

Here we show that thermoregulation, in which the transcription of select RNAs is upregulated at cooler temperatures, is crucial to the developmental transition that occurs during the transmission of P. falciparum from human to mosquito. Our findings offer new insight into how the malaria parasite senses and reacts to its environment."
https://openalex.org/W2030813770,"Hsp70 chaperones assist protein folding processes through nucleotide-controlled cycles of substrate binding and release. In our effort to understand the structure-function relationship within the Hsp70 family of proteins, we characterized the Escherichia coli member of a novel Hsp70 subfamily, HscC, and identified considerable differences to the well studied E. colihomologue, DnaK, which together suggest that HscC is a specialized chaperone. The basal ATPase cycle of HscC hadk cat and K m values that were 8- and 10,000-fold higher than for DnaK. The HscC ATPase was not affected by the nucleotide exchange factor of DnaK GrpE and stimulated 8-fold by DjlC, a DnaJ protein with a putative transmembrane domain, but not by other DnaJ proteins tested. Substrate binding dynamics and substrate specificity differed significantly between HscC and DnaK. These differences are explicable by distinct structural variations. HscC does not have general chaperone activity because it did not assist refolding of a denatured model substrate. In vivo, HscC failed to complement temperature sensitivity of ΔdnaKcells. Deletion of hscC caused a slow growth phenotype that was suppressed after several generations. Triple knock-outs of allE. coli genes encoding Hsp70 proteins (ΔdnaKΔhscA ΔhscC) were viable, indicating that Hsp70 proteins are not strictly essential for viability. An extensive search for ΔhscC phenotypes revealed a hypersensitivity to Cd2+ ions and UV irradiation, suggesting roles of HscC in the cellular response to these stress treatments.

The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; IAANS, 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)-anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; IAANS, 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)-anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. constitute a large family of highly conserved chaperones that assist a multitude of protein folding processes including de novo folding of proteins, prevention of aggregation and refolding of stress denatured proteins, disaggregation of protein aggregates, control of activity and stability of regulatory proteins, and degradation of unfolded proteins (1Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Horwich A.L. Advances in Protein Chemistry: Protein Folding in the Cell. 59. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 1-44Google Scholar). Such a large and diverse array of functions has been attributed to no other class of chaperones. The chaperone activity of the Hsp70 proteins is based on several properties: (i) The C-terminal substrate-binding domain of Hsp70s interacts with substrates by binding to short peptide stretches of ∼5 amino acids in length (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Google Scholar). (ii) This interaction is controlled by the nucleotide status of the adjacent N-terminal ATPase domain (5Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar). (iii) The nucleotide status is regulated by co-chaperones of the DnaJ protein family and a nucleotide exchange factor (GrpE in bacteria, Bag in eukaryotic cytosol) (3Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gässler C.S. Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Advances in Protein Chemistry: Protein Folding in the Cell. 59. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 1-44Google Scholar, 6Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Google Scholar). This mode of action of Hsp70 chaperones and their co-chaperones has been elucidated mainly using Escherichia coli DnaK with DnaJ and GrpE and mammalian Hsc70 with Hdj-1, the human DnaJ homologue, and Bag-1 M as model systems. However, more recently it was found that there are significant differences between the Hsp70 systems. In the yeast cytosol Ssa1 and Ssb1 and in E. coli DnaK and HscA (Hsc66) differ greatly with respect to their ATPase cycle. HscA and Ssb1 have much lower affinities for ATP than DnaK and Ssa1 (7Lopez-Buesa P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15253-15258Google Scholar, 8Silberg J.J.

Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Google Scholar). These differences go along with differences in the cellular functions of these proteins, although it is not clear whether a causal correlation exists. Although Ssa1 is involved in a large variety of protein folding processes, Ssb1 seems to be mainly engaged in the translation process and the de novo folding of proteins (10Craig E. Yan W. James P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts: Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1999: 139-162Google Scholar, 11Pfund C.

Similarly, whereas DnaK is involved in many different folding processes in E. coli, HscA seems to be specialized for the assembly of iron-sulfur cluster proteins (12Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Google Scholar). Sequencing of the E. coli genome identified a third Hsp70 homologue, termed HscC (Hsc62). HscC shares approximately 30% amino acid identity with DnaK and HscA, which is much lower than the sequence identity between DnaK and human Hsc70 of approximately 50% (13Itoh T. Matsuda H. Mori H. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 299-305Google Scholar). HscC thus belongs to the most distant Hsp70 relatives of DnaK and is therefore anticipated to exhibit strong differences to DnaK in functional and mechanistic features. In an effort to dissect the molecular basis for the functional variability among Hsp70 chaperones and to understand the roles for this newly identified third Hsp70 homologue of E. coli, we characterized the HscC proteinin vitro and searched for its function in vivo. Routinely, the bacterial strains listed in Table I were cultured at 30 °C in NZY medium (10 g·liter−1 NZ-amine (Interorgana Chemiehandel, Köln, Germany), 5 g·liter−1 yeast extract, 5 g·l−1 NaCl). The antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, spectinomycin, and tetracycline (Sigma) were used at final concentrations of 100, 15, 25, 50, and 10 μg·ml−1, respectively. λ plaque formation was tested using λvir and, as control, a dnaK anddnaJ transducing λ phage (a generous gift from C.

The vector contains a strong IPTG-regulatable promoter. HscC was produced in ΔdnaK52mutant cells (BB1553) and purified as follows. The hscCexpressing strain was grown in 2× YT at 30 °C to mid-log phase and induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm for 5 h. The cells were disrupted using a French Press, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The cleared lysate was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 35% saturation. The pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A (25 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm N-octylglucopyranosid) and chromatographed on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. HscC-containing fractions were pooled and applied onto a DMAE-Fractogel anion exchange column (Merck) equilibrated in buffer A. HscC was eluted using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm KCl. The pooled HscC containing fractions were divided in aliquots and stored at −80 °C. To produce DjlCΔTM as a C-terminal fusion with intein and chitin-binding protein, the DjlCΔTM encoding DNA sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into vector pTYB2 (New England Biolabs). DjlCΔTM-intein-chitin-binding protein was produced at 15 °C in BL21(DE3) cells grown in 2× YT medium and purified in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 on a chitin column according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Cleavage of the intein portion was performed in 50 mm dithiothreitol for 36 h at 4 °C. DnaK, DnaJ, CbpA, HscB, and GrpE were expressed in E. coli and purified according to published protocols (14Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct.

Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Google Scholar). Peptide binding to HscC was determined using a IAANS-labeled peptide (ς32-Q132-Q144-C) as published (19McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Google Scholar). Peptide library scanning was performed essentially as described (20Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar). Briefly, DnaK (0.2 μm) and HscC (0.8 μm) were incubated with cellulose membranes onto which 13-mer peptides scanning the sequences of EF-Tu, MetE, and GlnRS were synthesized by peptide spot synthesis (557 peptides total). The membranes were washed, and bound protein was transferred by fractionated electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection using the ECFTM detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of all spots using MacBas software (v2.5 Fuji) resulted in values corresponding to the affinity of the peptides to DnaK and HscC, respectively. To determine the contribution of each amino acid to binding affinity, the peptides were sorted according to decreasing affinity (peptide 1, highest affinity; peptide 557, lowest affinity), and for each of the 20 amino acids the cumulative frequency (f X(m)) was calculated separately according to the following equation. fx(m)=1m∑i=1mNx(i)1n∑i=1nNx(i)Equation 1 where N X(i) is the total number of the amino acid X in peptide i, n is the total number of peptides in the library (557), and m is a number between 1 and n, e.g. thef A(1) is the number of alanines in peptide 1 divided by the average number of A in the library;f A(2) is the average number of alanines in peptides 1 and 2 divided by the average number of alanines in the library; f A(557) is the average occurrence of alanines in peptides 1–557 divided by the average number of alanines in the library, which is equal to 1. These cumulative frequencies (f X(m)) were plottedversus m (see Fig. 4 B), and them values between 100 and 400 were analyzed by linear regression analysis. The resulting intercepts represent the relative occurrence of each amino acid in a theoretical peptide with the characteristics of the library that has the highest affinity to DnaK and HscC, respectively. Steady-state ATP hydrolysis rates were determined as described for DnaK (21Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Google Scholar). The reactions were performed at 30 °C in mixtures containing buffer HKM (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2), 0.2–0.3 μm HscC, 0.4–0.6 μm DnaJ, CbpA, HscB, DjlCΔTM, 10–1000 μm ATP, and 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). ATP/ADP binding and release assays were performed as described (22Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Google Scholar, 23Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Google Scholar). Prevention of aggregation and refolding of chemically denatured Luciferase were performed essentially as described (24Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Google Scholar) except that light scattering was measured at 550 nm and 25 °C. To guide our biochemical studies of HscC we first analyzed its amino acid sequence using ClustalW and Swiss Model (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar, 26Peitsch M.C. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 658-660Google Scholar, 27Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Google Scholar). To search for elements that had been shown for other Hsp70 homologues to be important for the ATPase cycle and the interactions with co-chaperones and substrates, the HscC sequence was aligned with the sequences of E. coliDnaK, E. coli HscA, and human Hsc70 as representatives of the three recently identified subfamilies of the Hsp70 chaperones (9Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). The ATPase domain of HscC is overall well conserved, including the residues, which coordinate the phosphate groups of ATP and are important for catalysis (e.g. Lys70, Glu171, Thr199; numbering according to DnaK throughout the paper unless otherwise stated; for review see Ref. 28Ha J.-H. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Sousa M.C. Takeda S. Wilbanks S.M. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts: Regulation, Cellular Function, and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1999: 573-607Google Scholar). However, it was surprising to discern a deletion of 19 amino acids corresponding to residues 93–111 of DnaK that otherwise exclusively occurs in Hsp70s of Gram-positive bacteria and archeans (29Gupta R.S. Golding G.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 37: 573-582Google Scholar), the functional consequences of which are unknown so far (not shown). In addition, the structural elements that were identified in DnaK to be important for the tight binding of nucleotides and interaction with GrpE, including two salt bridges and an exposed loop (9Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Google Scholar), are absent in HscC. HscC is therefore expected to have high nucleotide dissociation rates and to be incapable of interacting with GrpE (Fig. 1 Band data not shown). The residues in DnaK that are important for the interaction with DnaJ (Tyr145, Asn147, Asp148, Arg167, Glu217, and Val218) (30Gässler C.S. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Valencia A. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15229-15234Google Scholar, 31Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F., Lu, C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Google Scholar) are all conserved in HscC except Asn147, which is conservatively exchanged by serine. It therefore seems likely that this Hsp70 also interacts with a DnaJ protein. The substrate-binding domain (residues Val354–Pro556) is less well conserved. A homology model of residues Val354–Arg486 of HscC using Swiss Model and all available structures of the substrate-binding domain of Hsp70 proteins as template is shown in Fig.1 D. The helical lid domain (residues Gln538–Ala607 in DnaK) also seems to be present, although helices A and/or B are probably shorter by a total of four turns because of a deletion in this region (corresponding to residues 514–526 in DnaK). The substrate-interacting residues are reasonably well conserved except amino acids that form an arch over the substrate backbone in the DnaK crystal structure (Fig. 1 C) (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Google Scholar, 32Rüdiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Google Scholar). A striking difference to DnaK and Hsc70 is an insertion of four residues in the loop L1,2 and a small deletion of two amino acids in loop L5,6 leading to a displacement of the opening of the substrate-binding cavity in direction of the outer loops (Fig. 1, C and D). Together with helix B, which has probably been shortened, this could have profound influences on substrate binding by HscC compared with DnaK and most other Hsp70s, in particular because we recently showed that residues in L1,2 and L3,4 modulate substrate specificity (33Rüdiger S. Mayer M.P. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 245-251Google Scholar). Using these characteristics in the substrate-binding domain of HscC, we performed a Blast search for homologues. Homologues with an insertion of 4 amino acids in loop L1,2 were found in the closely related enterohemeoragic E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella enteritis. These Hsp70 proteins have a high degree of identity over the whole sequence and are therefore HscC orthologues. In addition, we found Hsp70 homologues with an even larger insertion of 8 or 9 residues in L1,2 inBurkholderia fungorum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, Bacillus anthracis, and Ralstonia solanacearum (Fig. 1, A–C). Whether these Hsp70 homologues belong to the HscC type will be discussed below. To analyze the ATPase cycle of HscC, we first determined K m andk cat of the basal steady-state ATPase activity and found that K m and k cat of HscC were 112 ± 6 μm and 0.0046 ± 0.0002 s−1 (Fig. 2 A). Although the k cat is almost 8- and 3-fold higher than the values for DnaK and HscA, the catalytic efficiencyk cat/K m is much lower for HscC (41 m−1·s−1) than for DnaK (30,000–70,000 m−1·s−1) or even HscA (109 m−1·s−1). It is surprising that Hsp70 proteins vary that much in their basal ATPase activity. The K m for ATP is 10,000-fold higher for HscC than for DnaK and still 10-fold higher than for HscA, indicating that the affinity of HscC for nucleotide is relatively low, consistent with a high nucleotide dissociation rate as predicted above. To confirm this result, we tried to determine the dissociation rate for ADP directly using the fluorescently labeled nucleotide analogue (N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8 aminoadenosine 5′-diphosphat (MABA- ADP) and indirectly using intrinsic tryptophane fluorescence (22Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Google Scholar, 23Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Google Scholar, 34Gässler C.S. Wiederkehr T. Brehmer D. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32538-32544Google Scholar). However, the measured fluorescence differences between the free and nucleotide-bound forms were too small to give reliable results (not shown). Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggests that the dissociation rates for nucleotides are relatively high. First, HscC (like HscA) does not bind to ATP-agarose; second, a complex of ATP with HscC cannot be isolated by rapid gel filtration. Both properties are in contrast to the behavior of DnaK and mammalian Hsp70s. The ATPase rate of HscC was not stimulated significantly by DnaJ, GrpE, or a combination of both (Fig. 2 B and data not shown), arguing that neither DnaJ nor GrpE functionally interacts with HscC. In the view of our sequence analysis, this was not surprising for GrpE (Fig.1 B). In the case of DnaJ, however, the result was unexpected, and we conclude that DnaJ is not the appropriate co-chaperone for HscC. Aside from DnaJ there are five additional DnaJ proteins in E. coli: CbpA, DjlA, HscB, YbeS, and YbeV. The unique common feature of all the DnaJ homologues is a short sequence of about 75 amino acid residues called the J-domain, which is essential for the interaction with an Hsp70 chaperone partner and for the stimulation of its ATPase activity (Fig. 1 E) (6Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Google Scholar, 35Laufen T. Zuber U. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Proteins: Structure, function, and Mode of Action. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 241-274Google Scholar). It has been shown genetically and/or biochemically that CbpA and DjlA interact with DnaK and HscB with HscA (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Google Scholar, 36Genevaux P. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7906-7912Google Scholar, 37Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5747-5750Google Scholar, 38Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Google Scholar). They are therefore not likely to interact functionally with HscC. The remaining DnaJ proteins, YbeS and YbeV, which exhibit 50% amino acid identity, are encoded by two open reading frames that are in close proximity to the HscC encoding genehscC (ybeW) on the E. coli chromosome (13Itoh T. Matsuda H. Mori H. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 299-305Google Scholar). Because we show here (see below) that YbeV is a bona fide DnaJ protein, we propose to change the sequencing project names of YbeS and YbeV into DjlB and DjlC (DnaJ-like proteins Band C) in analogy to DjlA. The coding sequences of both potential co-chaperones were cloned and expressed from a regulatable promoter. Overproduction of DjlB was toxic. DjlC was very unstablein vivo, and after overproduction it was found in the insoluble membrane fraction. Both proteins are predicted to have a transmembrane domain at their C terminus. Therefore, we produced DjlC without the potential transmembrane domain (DjlCΔTM) fused C-terminally to intein and chitin-binding protein and purified it by affinity chromatography over a chitin column and dithiothreitol-induced cleavage from the intein. DjlCΔTM stimulated the ATPase activity of HscC about 8-fold and therefore seems to be the appropriate DnaJ co-chaperone for HscC (Fig. 2 B). However, it did not stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, nor was the J-domain of DjlC when grafted onto the C-terminal domains of DnaJ able to replace DnaJin vivo (data not shown). Therefore, DjlC is not cooperating with DnaK and is most likely specific for an interaction with HscC. Addition of GrpE did not increase the DjlC-stimulated ATPase activity of HscC (not shown). Sequence analysis and modeling have suggested that the interaction of HscC with substrates might be significantly different from the DnaK-substrate interaction. Because peptides are good model substrates for Hsp70 chaperones (39Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Google Scholar, 40McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Google Scholar), we used a fluorescently labeled peptide to analyze the HscC-substrate interaction. The peptide ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS (19McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Google Scholar) was found to bind with good affinity to HscC, and the binding resulted in an increase in fluorescence at 420 nm when excited at 335 nm. Using this peptide we determined the dissociation equilibrium constant (K d) in the absence and presence of ATP. Both values were very similar, approximately 1.5 μm (Fig.3 A and TableII). This contrasts with the affinity of this peptide to DnaK, which is about 20 times higher in the absence (K d = 0.08 μm) than in the presence of ATP (K d = 1.8 μm) (41Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Google Scholar). Because theK d for the peptide-HscC complex in all nucleotide states is comparable with the K d of the peptide-DnaK complex in the ATP state, we determined for ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS whether the substrate-binding domain of HscC is in a constitutively open conformation with high association and dissociation rate constants (k ass and k diss) (Fig.3 B). In the absence of ATP the k dissof the peptide-HscC complex (1.4 × 10−3s−1) was similar to the k dissmeasured for the peptide-DnaK complex (0.9 × 10−3s−1) (41Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Google Scholar), indicating that HscC is not in an open conformation but that k ass is very low. ATP increased k diss by a factor of 19 as compared with the factor of 440–2500 determined for DnaK (39Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Google Scholar, 41Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP does influence the conformation of the substrate-binding domain of HscC, but it increases the k diss andk ass to a similar extent, thereby not influencing the equilibrium constant. We conclude that the kinetics of the HscC-substrate interaction is significantly different from the DnaK-substrate interaction.Table IIHscC interaction with a substrate peptideWithout nucleotideWith ATPFold increaseK d(μm)1.5 ± 0.61.4 ± 1.50.93k off,1(s−1)0.0014 ± 0.000020.0269 ± 0.007319.2k off,2 (s−1)0.0013 ± 0.00030.93k on(m−1 · s−1)aCalculated fromK d and k off values.9331921420.6K d values were determined by equilibrium titration of the fluorescent labeled peptide ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS with HscC.

The k off values were determined by following the decrease of fluorescence of the HscC-ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS complex after addition of unlabeled peptide. Because our sequence alignment showed that residues contributing to substrate specificity in DnaK are replaced in HscC by different residues (Fig. 1 C; Met404 → Asn-Arg-Gln-Gly-Val; Ala429→ Met), we investigated the substrate specificity of HscC using the peptide library approach employed earlier for DnaK (20Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar) and compared HscC with DnaK. For this approach we choose peptides scanning the sequences of three E. coli proteins, EF-Tu, MetE, and GlnRS, that are thermolabile proteins and substrates of DnaK (42Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1998071278,"Highly conserved amino acids that form crucial structural elements of the catalytic apparatus can be used to account for the evolutionary history of serine proteases and the cascades into which they are organized. One such evolutionary marker in chymotrypsin-like proteases is Ser214, located adjacent to the active site and forming part of the primary specificity pocket. Here we report the mutation of Ser214 in thrombin to Ala, Thr, Cys, Asp, Glu, and Lys. None of the mutants seriously compromises active site catalytic function as measured by the kinetic parameter k cat. However, the least conservative mutations result in large increases in K m because of lower rates of substrate diffusion into the active site. Therefore, the role of Ser214 is to promote the productive formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S214C mutant is catalytically inactive, which suggests that during evolution the TCN→AGY codon transitions for Ser214 occurred through Thr intermediates.

The S214C mutant is catalytically inactive, which suggests that during evolution the TCN→AGY codon transitions for Ser214 occurred through Thr intermediates. Serine proteases have been classified into evolutionarily and structurally unrelated clans (1Barrett A.J. Rawlings R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Google Scholar), which nevertheless maintain a strictly conserved active site geometry among their catalytic Ser, His, and Asp residues. This shared catalytic structure suggests that common architectural motifs can be found in the molecular design of active sites utilizing a Ser-His-Asp triad. The identification of discrete evolutionary markers encountered in the sequences contributing to the catalytic apparatus has shed light on both crucial structural motifs and evolutionary events in the history of serine protease families (2Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Google Scholar) and serine protease cascades (3Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 26: 67-74Google Scholar). One such structural motif common to chymotrypsin-like, subtilisin-like, and α/β-hydrolase-fold serine proteases is the presence of a highly conserved fourth active site residue whose backbone atoms form contacts with the substrate and whose polar side chain extends into the catalytic pocket. Among chymotrypsin-like proteases, the backbone of Ser214contributes to the S1 binding pocket (4Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar). The side chain of the same residue is hypothesized to generate a polar environment for the catalytic Asp102 of trypsin (5McGrath M.E. Vasquez J.R. Craik C.S. Yang A.S. Honig B. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3059-3064Google Scholar), and both oxygens of Ser214 form H-bonds with waters located in the active site cleft of duodenase (6Pletnev V.Z. Zamolodchikova T.S. Pangborn W.A. Duax W.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 8-16Google Scholar). Ser125 (subtilisin BPN′ numbering) in subtilisin-type proteases (4Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar, 7Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Google Scholar) and the unpaired Cys341(yeast carboxypeptidase W numbering) in α/β-hydrolase-fold proteases (8Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1249-1259Google Scholar, 9Shilton B.H. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9002-9012Google Scholar) play similar roles. Each of these residues (Ser214, Ser125, and Cys341) serves as an evolutionary marker and appears to contribute to catalytic function in its respective protease clan (2Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Google Scholar). The role of Ser214 in chymotrypsin-like proteases has been addressed in previous studies (5McGrath M.E. Vasquez J.R. Craik C.S. Yang A.S. Honig B. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3059-3064Google Scholar). The trypsin mutants S214E and S214K disrupted the environment of the catalytic Asp102 as demonstrated kinetically and crystallographically. However, the S214A mutant described in the same report had improved specificity (k cat/K m) compared with wild type, calling into question the requirement for the Ser214side chain in catalysis. More importantly, previous studies on trypsin have not addressed how mutations of Ser214 affect the individual steps of the catalytic mechanism of substrate hydrolysis and have left the precise origin of the perturbation unanswered. Here we report the effect of several substitutions (Ala, Asp, Glu, Lys, Thr, and Cys) of Ser214 in thrombin by dissecting the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis using a novel and powerful approach (10Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Google Scholar). Considering the TCN→AGY Ser codon transitions that must have taken place at Ser214 (2Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Google Scholar), it has now become relevant to also generate S214T and S214C mutants as the codons for Thr and Cys (ACN and TGY, respectively) represent intermediates in the single nucleotide transitions between TCN and AGY. In addition to trypsin, thrombin is a most relevant system for studying the contribution of Ser214 to serine protease catalysis. Thrombin is a Na+-activated enzyme, which adds complexity to the mechanism of substrate recognition, and has a more stringent specificity profile than trypsin that may be more sensitive to mutations that alter k cat orK m. Hence, the mutation of Ser214 in thrombin would reveal whether that evolutionary marker is linked to Na+ binding in serine proteases and would test whether previous results on trypsin can be generalized to the majority of chymotrypsin-like proteases. Site-directed mutagenesis of human α-thrombin was carried out in a HPC4-pNUT expression vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression of thrombin mutants was carried out in baby hamster kidney cells as described previously (11Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar). Mutants were activated with the prothrombinase complex between 40 and 60 min at 37 °C. Enzymes used in the activation were supplied by Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). Mutants were purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m choline chloride (ChCl), 5 mmMES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; ChCl, choline chloride; FPR, H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PAR, protease-activated receptor. pH 6.0, at room temperature. Active site concentrations were determined by titration with hirudin. The substrate H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR) was synthesized by Midwest Biotech (Carmel, IN). Individual rate constants defining the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by serine proteases were extracted from the values of k catand k cat/K m obtained as a function of temperature (10Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Google Scholar) from 5 to 45 °C under solution conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, 200 mmNaCl, pH 8.0. The values for the Na+-free slow form of wild type were obtained by replacing NaCl with ChCl in the buffer. Substrate hydrolysis entails the binding of substrate S to the enzyme E with a second-order rate constant k 1. After the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex ES, the substrate can either dissociate back into the solution with a rate constant ofk −1 or become acylated with a rate constant ofk 2. The portion of substrate distal to the scissile bond, P′, is released at this stage. The acyl intermediate EP is subsequently hydrolyzed to release the portion of substrate proximal to the scissile bond, P“, with a rate constant ofk 3 as shown in Scheme 1. The acylation step is typically rate-determining for amide substrates. The Michaelis-Menten parameters s =k cat/K m andk cat accessible to direct experimental measurements are composite functions of the individual kinetic rates in Scheme 1. The explicit expressions as a function of temperature are shown in Equations 1 and 2 (10Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Google Scholar), s=k1k2exp{−E1+E2R(1T−1T0)}k−1exp{−E−1R(1T−1T0)}+k2exp{−E2R(1T−1T0)}=k1exp{−E1R(1T−1T0)}αexp{EαR(1T−1T0)}1+αexp{EαR(1T−1T0)}Equation 1 kcat=k2k3exp{−E2+E3R(1T−1T0)}k2exp{−E2R(1T−1T0)}+k3exp{−E3R(1T−1T0)}=k2exp{−E2R(1T−1T0)}βexp{EβR(1T−1T0)}1+βexp{EβR(1T−1T0)}Equation 2 where E j is the activation energy associated with the rate constant k j,R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and the k values refer toT 0 = 298.15 K. The measurements of s and k cat as a function of temperature can resolve all the parameters in Equations 1 and 2 provided the plots show curvature. In the event ofk 3≫k 2 (β≫1) as typically observed for thrombin, k 3 andE 3 cannot be resolved and the plot of logk cat versus 1/T is a straight line. When k cat values cannot be determined because of high K m values, a plot of logsversus 1/T yields k 1,E 1, the ratio α =k 2/k −1, and the difference E α = E −1 − E 2, again provided the plot shows curvature. Physiologic substrates and inhibitors were studied under the conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. The cleavage of fibrinogen leading to the release of fibrinopeptides A and B and cleavage of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) peptides PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 were carried out by HPLC as described previously (12Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar). The activation of protein C in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 nm rabbit thrombomodulin was measured and analyzed as reported elsewhere (11Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar). Antithrombin inhibition was studied by changing the concentration of unfractionated heparin to determine the optimal inhibition of each mutant (13Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Google Scholar), monitored by following progress curves of FPR hydrolysis in which the antithrombin concentration was varied. The observed rate of inhibition, k on, was calculated as described previously (11Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants for Na+ binding were determined by fluorescence titration using a FluoroMax-3 SPEX spectrophotometer. Fluorescence titrations took place under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, 800 mm ionic strength, pH 8.0 at 10 °C. The temperature was chosen to maximize both the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme and the fluorescence increase induced by Na+ binding. Titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of thrombin in 800 mm NaCl to a solution containing the enzyme in 800 mm ChCl. Ionic strength (800 mm) and enzyme concentration (200 nm) were held constant, whereas [Na+] was varied. Excitation was at 295 nm, and emission was measured at 333 nm. The value of thrombin intrinsic fluorescence,F, as a function of [Na+] was fit according to the Equation 3, F=F0+F1[Na+]Kd1+[Na+]KdEquation 3 where F 0 and F 1are the values of F in the absence and under saturating [Na+] and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding. Na+ dissociation constants were alternately determined by following the linkage between thek cat/K m for FPR hydrolysis and [Na+] under conditions of 50 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. The value of s = k cat/K m was fit according to the Equation 4 (11Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar), s=s0+s1[Na+]Kd1+[Na+]KdEquation 4 where s 0 and s 1are the values of k cat/K m in the absence and under saturating [Na+], pertaining, respectively, to the Na+-free slow and Na+-bound fast forms and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding. Temperature melting curves were measured under conditions of 200 mm NaCl or ChCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% PEG-8000 over the temperature range of 15–80 °C. Denaturation was monitored by following absorbance at 280 nm. Experiments were conducted using sufficient enzyme to generate an absorbance of ∼0.05 absorbance units at 15 °C. Temperature was then gradually increased to 80 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min. The melting temperature was calculated from the midpoint of the melting transition. Ser214 thrombin mutants have reduced catalytic activity as measured by FPR hydrolysis with the most significant reductions corresponding to the mutants carrying the largest side chains at position 214 (Table I). Although the Ala, Thr, and Lys mutants have reducedk cat compared with wild type, the Asp and Glu mutants have increased k cat. Therefore, changes in k cat do not correlate with the size of the side chain placed at position 214. However, the presence of a residue other than Ser at position 214 dramatically increasesK m. The least conservative mutant, S214K, shows a 1000-fold increase in K m with only a 3-fold drop ink cat. Only limited kinetic data could be collected for the S214C mutant (see below).Table IKinetic rate constants and activation energies for FPR hydrolysis by wild type and mutant thrombinsFast formSlow formWTS214AS214DS214ES214KS214Tk 1 (μm−1s−1)120 ± 1516 ± 5100 ± 106 ± 13.9 ± 0.90.55 ± 0.090.036 ± 0.00310 ± 1k −1(s−1)11 ± 26.8 ± 0.96.4 ± 0.95.0 ± 0.925 ± 911 ± 12.0 ± 0.211 ± 2k 2 (s−1)29 ± 14.0 ± 0.225 ± 113 ± 146 ± 346 ± 1aValues were calculated from the k cat at 25 °C.9.0 ± 0.5aValues were calculated from the k cat at 25 °C.15 ± 1α =k 2/k −12.6 ± 0.30.59 ± 0.073.9 ± 0.52.6 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.94.5 ± 0.81.4 ± 0.2K m = (k −1 +k 2)/k 1(μm)0.33 ± 0.030.68 ± 0.060.31 ± 0.033.0 ± 0.318 ± 3100 ± 10300 ± 402.6 ± 0.4k cat =k 2 (s−1)29 ± 14.0 ± 0.225 ± 113 ± 146 ± 346 ± 1aValues were calculated from the k cat at 25 °C.9.0 ± 0.5aValues were calculated from the k cat at 25 °C.15 ± 1s = k cat/K m(μm−1 s−1)88 ± 65.9 ± 0.481 ± 54.3 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.20.44 ± 0.030.029 ± 0.0025.8 ± 0.4E 1 (kcal/mol)19 ± 221 ± 319 ± 26.0 ± 0.94.1 ± 0.98.0 ± 0.911 ± 15.0 ± 0.9E −1(kcal/mol)57 ± 369 ± 363 ± 454 ± 360 ± 4n.d.bn.d., not determined becausek cat and K m could not be measured individually over the entire temperature range.n.d.bn.d., not determined becausek cat and K m could not be measured individually over the entire temperature range.61 ± 2E 2 (kcal/mol)21 ± 131 ± 120 ± 122 ± 117 ± 1n.d.bn.d., not determined becausek cat and K m could not be measured individually over the entire temperature range.n.d.bn.d., not determined becausek cat and K m could not be measured individually over the entire temperature range.23 ± 1E −1-E 2(kcal/mol)36 ± 338 ± 343 ± 432 ± 343 ± 446 ± 440 ± 238 ± 2Values for the slow form were measured in the presence of 200 mm ChCl, whereas those for the fast form refer to the extrapolation [Na+]→∞ calculated as described elsewhere (16Pineda A.O.

Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). The impact of Ser214 on K m rather thank cat suggests a major role in substrate binding, which is confirmed by the individual rate constants gleaned from temperature dependence studies ofk cat/K m andk cat for FPR hydrolysis (Fig.1 and Table I). The increases inK m are primarily attributable to decreases in the rate of association k 1, which are most significant for the least conservative mutations. The values ofk 1 for the Ala and Thr mutants approach that of the slow form of wild type, whereas those of the Asp, Glu, and Lys mutants deviate more to the downside and underline more drastic structural perturbations of the accessibility of the active site. The reductions in k 1 tend to be linked to significant decreases in the activation energy,E 1, for this step. This suggests that wild-type thrombin undergoes an induced fit rearrangement on substrate binding that cannot be duplicated fully in the Ser214 mutants. The integrity of the Ser side chain ensures this structural change and optimizes the productive collision of substrate with the active site. When the catalytic rate constants are considered, all mutants are like wild type in thatk 3≫k 2 and the logk cat versus 1/T plot is linear. Interestingly, none of the mutants compromisesk cat significantly, and the presence of a negatively charged side chain at position 214 actually increases the acylation rate and k cat relative to wild type. There is an apparent dichotomy in the functional behavior of the mutants of Ser214, because they tend to behave like the Na+-free slow form of wild type when the rate of substrate diffusion into the active site is considered but mimic more closely the Na+-bound fast form in their catalytic rate constants. This finding suggests that Ser214 is energetically linked to Na+ binding especially in the steps that control substrate binding and formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. This expectation is confirmed by the inspection of the Na+ binding affinities of the Ser214 mutants as measured directly by intrinsic fluorescence titration (Fig.2) that are compromised to a significant extent (up to 50-fold). Consistent with these findings, Na+binding partially rescues the Ser214 mutants (TableII) because the value of the specificity constant s 0 in the absence of Na+ (slow form) is more compromised relative to wild type than the value s 1 obtained under saturating [Na+] (fast form). This finding demonstrates that the deleterious effect of replacing Ser214 is felt more on the Na+-free slow form.Table IISpecificity constants of wild type and mutant thrombins in the slow (Na+-free) and fast (Na+-bound) formsWTS214AS214DS214ES214KS214Ts 0 (μm−1s−1)4.8 ± 0.10.093 ± 0.0040.014 ± 0.0010.011 ± 0.0010.0016 ± 0.00010.065 ± 0.003s 1(μm−1 s−1)90 ± 316 ± 112 ± 11.0 ± 0.10.049 ± 0.00220 ± 1K d (mm)44 ± 5300 ± 301800 ± 200700 ± 100230 ± 20810 ± 30The parameters s 0 and s 1 are the values of k cat/K m for the slow and fast forms, respectively, whereas K d is the dissociation constant for Na+ binding (see also Equation 4under “Materials and Methods”). Open table in a new tab The parameters s 0 and s 1 are the values of k cat/K m for the slow and fast forms, respectively, whereas K d is the dissociation constant for Na+ binding (see also Equation 4under “Materials and Methods”). Ser214 thrombin mutants also demonstrate impaired cleavage of physiologic substrates (Table III). Specificity constants for the release of fibrinopeptides A and B, which measure the ability of thrombin to cleave fibrinogen to form a fibrin clot, are compromised to a similar degree. Protein C activation, an anticoagulant activity, is slightly less compromised with the exception of S214K. The cleavage of PAR peptides is reduced to a similar extent for PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4. Because of the severely impacted catalytic efficiency of the S214K mutant, specificity constants toward PAR3 and PAR4 could not be measured. The least conservative mutants show the greatest reduction in antithrombin inhibition as measured by the rate of inactivation k on. The mutants require slightly higher concentrations of heparin relative to wild type to ensure inhibition. The optimal heparin concentration for wild type is 0.5 USP units/ml, whereas the majority of the mutants require 1–2 USP units/ml heparin. Selected S2 and S3 specificity subsite mutants of thrombin also demonstrate increased requirements for heparin (13Rezaie A.R.

Open table in a new tab The S214C mutant could not be characterized extensively. During the first attempt at activation of S214C prethrombin-1, the mutant thrombin appeared to aggregate in solution. Despite this result, it was possible to purify a fraction of the mutant whose absorbance indicated a concentration of 700 nm. However, titration with hirudin indicated an active site concentration of ∼30 nm. Thus, 96% of the activated material was functionally inactive. A subsequent activation using a lower prothrombin concentration prevented aggregation, but once again the titration of the purified fraction revealed that nearly all of the activated material was catalytically inactive. The loss of activity seen for S214C is puzzling. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of aliquots from the activation reactions and purified fractions does not indicate proteolysis. As the unpaired Cys points into the active site and away from the surface of the of the enzyme, intermolecular disulfide bonding appears improbable. It is possible that the presence of the extra Cys at position 214 causes improper intramolecular disulfide bonds to form, resulting in an incorrectly folded enzyme. Temperature denaturation experiments were used to assess the relative stabilities of wild type, S214T, and S214C. The melting temperatures for the S214C and S214T mutants are 10 and 5 °C, respectively, lower than that for wild type (62 °C). The instability of S214C does not result from impaired Na+ binding as wild type has the same melting temperature in both NaCl (fast form) and ChCl (slow form) solutions. Ser214 appears to be an important residue for the folding of thrombin. The mutation to Thr slightly destabilizes the fold, but providing a free disulfide at this position destabilizes the fold enough to produce an inactive and presumably misfolded enzyme. The results presented here on the role of Ser214 in serine proteases extend those reported previously in the case of trypsin (5McGrath M.E. Vasquez J.R. Craik C.S. Yang A.S. Honig B. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3059-3064Google Scholar) that have left several basic questions unanswered. In particular, previous studies have characterized the kinetic origin of the perturbations only in terms of k cat andK m. Our study has examined the effect of Ser214 mutations on each step of the catalytic mechanism of substrate hydrolysis and has identified the precise events in which Ser214 is involved, namely the optimization of substrate diffusion in the active site, the induced fit rearrangement of the enzyme-substrate complex, and the unanticipated energetic linkage with Na+ binding. Ser214 is the only residue among the four with side chains in the active site that is not required for proper function of the Ser-His-Asp charge relay system. As such, it presents an opportunity to probe the environment of the active site around Asp102. The active site is extremely tolerant to substitution at position 214 as the presence of a buried Lys produces only a 3-fold reduction ink cat. However, it should be noted that in trypsin, the reduction in k cat was more dramatic. In α-lytic protease, the mutation of Ser214 to Ala brought about a 4900-fold reduction in specificity, but Epstein and Abeles (14Epstein D.M. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11216-11223Google Scholar) surmise that the catalytic function remained intact. Ser214 seems to play a minimal role in governing the catalytic rate reflected by the minor effects onk cat. Crystal structures of trypsin (5McGrath M.E. Vasquez J.R. Craik C.S. Yang A.S. Honig B. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3059-3064Google Scholar) and duodenase (6Pletnev V.Z. Zamolodchikova T.S. Pangborn W.A. Duax W.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 8-16Google Scholar) have led to the hypothesis that Ser214 helps position Asp102 of the charge relay system for optimal catalysis. Slight reductions in k cat for S214A, S214T, and S214K lend support to this idea but prove that Ser214 is not essential for effective catalysis. Catalytically, the most interesting mutants are S214D and S214E, which display increases in k cat despite the potential introduction of an additional charge into the active site. The Asp and Glu side chains may repel Asp102, pushing it closer to His57 and therefore increasing the potency of the charge relay system. The mutation of Ser214 primarily disturbs the S1 pocket as active site function (measured by k cat) does not appear to suffer from the energetic perturbation associated with Ser214 mutation. The decrease in k 1and the increase in K m would then be explained by displacement of the backbone atoms of residue 214, the carbonyl oxygen of which makes contact with substrate (4Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar). Ser is the appropriate connector at position 214 that ties the very stable active site to the S1 pocket to maintain optimal contact with substrate and correct alignment of the catalytic register. For trypsin substitutions involving large side chains (S214E and S214K), steric clashes with the side chain of Trp215 occur. This results in the Trp side chain “flipping” and blocking access to the S2 and S3 specificity pockets (5McGrath M.E. Vasquez J.R. Craik C.S. Yang A.S. Honig B. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3059-3064Google Scholar) and may explain the extremely poor specificity of S214K mutants in both thrombin and trypsin. In thrombin, Na+ binds in a water channel extending from the surface of the enzyme through the S1 specificity pocket into the active site and containing >20 water molecules interconnected by a hydrogen-bonding network that includes the protein (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar). The positions of these internal water molecules are highly conserved and well ordered. Several of those water molecules are involved in Na+ coordination, and the hydrogen bond connectivity of the S1 pocket water channel is altered when Na+ binds, accounting for the change in specificity associated with the Na+-triggered slow→fast transition (16Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). Residues that are linked to this water channel are thus energetically linked to Na+, and the perturbation of such residues may affect Na+ binding as well as specificity. As a result, Na+ binding is extremely sensitive to the architecture of the S1 pocket (16Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). Ser214 is not involved in Na+ coordination, and its side chain extends away from the Na+ site and into the active site. In fact, the Na+ binding site of thrombin resides 15 Å from Ser214 at the opposite end of the S1 specificity pocket. However, residues that are thermodynamically linked to Na+ binding need not be located near the Na+binding site. For example, the mutations of Trp60d and Trp215 located 17 and 10 Å away from the Na+site practically abolish Na+ binding (17Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 103-109Google Scholar, 18Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8095-8101Google Scholar). The backbone atoms of Trp215 adjacent to Ser214 make contact with two water molecules of the S1 channel (19Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Fütterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Google Scholar), and perturbations of Ser214 may be transmitted via Trp215 to the four water ligands coordinating the Na+ ion (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar, 16Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). The significantly reduced Na+ binding of Ser214mutants indicates the long range influence of that residue on the S1 pocket structure. Also, the structural perturbation caused by the replacement of Ser214 affects predominantly the Na+-free slow form (Table II) and is corrected by Na+ binding by virtue of the reciprocity of the linkage between this residue and Na+ as seen for mutants of residues Trp60d and Trp215 (17Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 103-109Google Scholar, 18Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8095-8101Google Scholar). The S214C mutant is 95% inactive. The residue presumably engages in an improper disulfide bond with another Cys residue; however, there is no outstanding candidate for this other residue because the nearest Cys to Ser214 is 9 Å away. Temperature denaturation studies also suggest that Ser214 plays a role in thrombin stability. Among α/β-hydrolase-fold serine proteases, the residue analogous to Ser214 is frequently the unpaired Cys341. A subtilisin-like protease with Cys at the analogous position 125 also exists (2Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Google Scholar). Therefore, unpaired Cys residues are easily tolerated adjacent to serine protease active sites except in the chymotrypsin-like clan. There are several instances of Thr usage at position 214 including human complement factor D. In factor D, Thr and Ser are interchangeable (20Kim S. Narayana S.V.L. Volanakis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24399-24405Google Scholar), indicating the viability of Thr at position 214. The unsuitability of Cys and the feasibility of Thr at position 214 of thrombin suggest the codon switch for Ser214 from TCN to AGY if occurring by single-nucleotide transitions utilized a Thr intermediate. The case for a true catalytic tetrad, at least in clan PA, now seems weaker than originally suggested by sequence data (2Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Google Scholar). Among chymotrypsin-like proteases, Ser214 appears to have been conserved because of its role in substrate recognition, ensuring optimal diffusion into the active site and proper induced fit rearrangement of the enzyme-substrate complex. Upon first glance, this function may not seem as crucial as that performed by the catalytic nucleophile Ser195, but Ser214 is conserved almost as strongly as Ser195, highlighting the evolutionary and physiologic importance of tight substrate binding (21Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19243-19246Google Scholar) in the vast majority of serine proteases."

Multidrug resistance can be conferred by a number of transporters (multidrug resistance transporters) that pump drugs of cells (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Certain multidrug transporters, such as the Lactococcus lactis protein LmrA, can transport an extreme diversity of structurally dissimilar drug molecules (reviewed in Ref. 5Poelarends G.J. Vigano C. Ruysschaert J.-M. Konings W.N. Holland B. Kuchler K. Higgins C. Cole S. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, London2002: 243-262Google Scholar). LmrA belongs to a superfamily of transporters that contain an ATP binding cassette (ABC)1 (6Van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It shares significant sequence similarity with members of the P-glycoprotein subfamily of ABC transporters, most notably the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (6Van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This human P-glycoprotein, which is also called MDR1, plays a crucial role in the resistance of cancer cells against cytotoxic agents used in chemotherapy (2Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial LmrA can functionally complement P-glycoprotein in human lung fibroblast cells, and both proteins have a very similar drug and modulator specificity (7Van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This remarkable conservation of function between these two ABC-type multidrug transporters implies a common overall structure and transport mechanism (8Poelarends G.J. Mazurkiewicz P. Putman M. Cool R.H. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Drug Resist. Updates. 2000; 3: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All ABC transporters, described so far, show a four-domain organization and consist of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two ABC domains (also called nucleotide binding domains). The TMDs are thought to form a pathway across the membrane through which solutes move. These domains consist of multiple membrane spanning segments (putative α-helices) and contain the substrate binding sites. The other two domains are located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation. Conformational changes, induced by ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, are transmitted from the nucleotide binding domains to the TMDs, which then most likely results in solute translocation. The four domains may be organized either in a multifunctional, single polypeptide chain, as found for P-glycoprotein, or as separate proteins. LmrA appears to be a half-transporter consisting of an amino-terminal transmembrane domain with six predicted membrane spanning segments fused to a nucleotide binding domain (Fig. 1) (6Van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence convincingly demonstrated that LmrA is functional as a homodimer, consistent with the general four-domain organization of ABC transporters (9Van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Most ABC transporters recognize and transport highly hydrophilic substrates, including sugars and inorganic ions, most likely via an aqueous pathway. An example is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, which unquestionably forms an aqueous pathway across the membrane through which chloride ions travel. However, multidrug transporters such as LmrA and P-glycoprotein translocate highly hydrophobic substrates and transport might occur via a hydrophobic, lipid-filled pathway. LmrA and P-glycoprotein have been shown to function as “hydrophobic vacuum cleaners” by extruding drug molecules from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer directly into the (external) aqueous phase (10Bolhuis H.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Google Scholar). These and other studies suggest that the translocation pathway has an opening to the extracellular milieu, and may be accessible from the membrane rather than from the internal aqueous phase. In this study we used a cysteine scanning accessibility approach to obtain information about the structural properties of LmrA. Cysteines were introduced in the cysteine-less wild-type LmrA in each hydrophilic loop and in TMS 6, and each membrane-embedded aromatic residue was mutated to cysteine. The accessibility was studied of these cysteines to fluorescein maleimide, a well characterized sulfhydryl reagent that reacts with cysteines that are located in polar environments, but not with those in nonpolar environments. The accessibilities of cysteine replacements of all amino acid residues in TMS 6 were studied in detail as the corresponding TMSs in P-glycoprotein (TMSs 6 and 12) have been strongly implicated in substrate binding (e.g. Refs. 12Greenberger L.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The membrane-embedded aromatic residues were chosen for study because aromatic rings can contribute to binding of aromatic cationic substrates through both aromatic-aromatic and π-cation interactions (14Pawagi A.B. Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R.A. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, aromatic residues lining an internal channel may provide a surface that is sterically compatible to the geometry of the drug and thus may promote the passage of a variety of ring-containing LmrA substrates (14Pawagi A.B. Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R.A. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, the results suggest the presence of a water-filled chamber, which in the nonenergized form of LmrA is open to the intracellular environment, within the membrane-embedded domain of this transporter for hydrophobic molecules.

Membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation were prepared by passage through a French pressure cell as described before (19Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To prepare randomly oriented membrane vesicles, inside-out membrane vesicles were sonicated 3 times for 5 s on ice. The vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. Expression levels of LmrA mutants were determined by analyzing membrane vesicles by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions on gels containing 10% polyacrylamide. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Inside-out membrane vesicles were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 2 ml of 50 mm(K)Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 8.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine. After a 1-min incubation at 30 °C, 2 μm2-[2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-6-benzimidazolyl]-6-(1-methyl)-(4-piperazil)-benzimidazole (Hoechst 33342, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added and the partitioning of the drug into the membrane vesicles was followed fluorimetrically until a steady state was reached. Subsequently, 2 mm Mg-ATP was added, and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was followed as a function of time. Fluorescence was monitored with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B fluorometer, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 3 nm each. To test the effect of thiol reagents on transport, inside-out membrane vesicles (1 mg of total protein) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) or 1 mm 2-aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA; Anatrace, Maumee, OH). Immediately after labeling, Hoechst 33342 transport assays were performed with these membrane vesicles. Unless stated otherwise, membrane vesicles (1 mg of total protein in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were incubated in the presence of 100 μm fluorescein maleimide (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding a 100-fold excess of dithiothreitol. When indicated, the reaction with fluorescein maleimide was preceded by incubation for 5 min at 20 °C with 1 mmNEM or 100 μm(2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, Anatrace). Purification of His-tagged LmrA from membrane vesicles was done essentially as described (19Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni-NTA, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence of proteins labeled with fluorescein maleimide was visualized by UV excitation using a Lumi-imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Wild-type LmrA is devoid of native cysteine residues, and, therefore, is excellently suited for a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a set of 41 single cysteine mutants. The codon for each residue in TMS 6 (residues 291–312) was mutated to that of cysteine, as well as the codon for each membrane-embedded aromatic residue (Fig.1). In addition, at least one single cysteine was introduced in each hydrophilic loop of LmrA (Fig. 1). The single cysteine mutants were expressed in L. lactis NZ9000 (lmrA−), a strain in which the chromosomallmrA gene was deleted. Of the 41 cysteine mutants, 40 could be expressed and were present in the membrane, albeit at different levels (Fig. 2). In general, most mutations introduced at the positions of aromatic residues in the predicted membrane domain do not significantly effect the expression level (Fig. 2 B), whereas most mutations introduced in the loop regions (Fig. 2 C) or in TMS 6 (Fig. 2 A) lower the expression level of LmrA. Mutant F37C (located in TMS 1) was observed to be highly susceptible to degradation suggesting that a major structural pertubation occurred upon substitution of this residue. Only one mutant, L301C, which is located in the middle of TMS 6, was not found in the membrane of L. lactis (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, after SDS-PAGE of membranes containing mutant Y279C (Fig. 2 B), a dominant protein band at about 130 kDa was observed. On the basis of its size, this band may represent an oxidized homodimer of LmrA. This hypothesis was tested by purifying His-tagged LmrA protein from membranes containing the Y279C mutant by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The putative cross-linked homodimer copurified with monomeric LmrA, indicating the presence of a His tag on the oxidized dimer. In addition, this putative cross-linked dimer was detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-His tag antibodies (data not shown). The cross-linked product disappeared upon incubation with dithiothreitol, concomitant with an increase in the monomeric form of LmrA (not shown), confirming the disulfide nature of the cross-link. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spontaneous oxidation of the single cysteine at position 279 results in a cross-linked homodimeric LmrA molecule. Previously, we have used Hoechst 33342 to monitor drug transport by wild-type LmrA in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis(19Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amphiphilic character and the high lipid-water partition coefficient of Hoechst 33342 result in partitioning of this drug into the lipid bilayer. Conveniently, Hoechst 33342 is strongly fluorescent when it resides in the lipid environment of the membrane, but is essentially nonfluorescent in the aqueous phase. These properties make it possible to follow fluorimetrically the presence of this compound in the membrane environment. ATP-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 from the membrane of inside-out oriented membrane vesicles prepared from wild-type LmrA expressing NZ9000 (lmrA−) cells resulted in a decrease in fluorescence (not shown). Such ATP-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 was not observed in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from NZ9000 (lmrA−) cells not expressing LmrA. At most of the positions of membrane-embedded aromatic residues, cysteine mutations were well tolerated by the transporter, resulting in similar or slightly reduced transport activities when compared with the wild-type protein (Table I). The proteinase-sensitive mutant F37C was found to be inactive. Cysteine mutations in the loop regions of the transporter were all well tolerated (Table I). Mutants S65C and T109C displayed wild-type transport activities, whereas mutants S132C, L174C, S206C, S234C, and S287C had slightly reduced transport activities. In contrast, several cysteine mutants in TMS 6 exhibited strongly reduced transport activities (Table I). This might be explained, at least in part, by the low expression levels of these mutants (Fig. 2 A). Two mutants in TMS 6, M299C and N300C, displayed no measurable transport activities.Table IHoechst 33342 transport activities and verapamil inhibition of cysteine mutants of LmrA in inside-out membrane vesiclesMutant/positionInitial transport rateInhibition by verapamilMutant/positionInitial transport rateInhibition by verapamil%%Membrane-embedded aromatic residuesTMS 6Y35C37+L291C30+F37C0L292C31+F38C68+G293C30+Y82C122+M294C37+F99C67+M295C78+F154C107+M296C16+F166C130+Y297C40+F190C92+L298C35−F195C75+M299C0F271C73+N300C0F276C67+L301C0 (i)ai, not expressed.Y279C35+I302C32+Y297C40+G303C28−F311C65+V304C29+F312C63+V305C28+Residues in loop regionsS65C96+P306C29−T109C101+T307C20+S132C54+V308C21−L174C53+A309C87+S206C55+T310C78+S234C54+F311C65+S287C60+F312C63+For clarity of presentation, activities are presented as initial rates of transport relative to wild-type LmrA (100%).

We have shown previously that verapamil is an inhibitor of LmrA-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport (19Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ability of verapamil to inhibit transport by the single cysteine mutants was examined (TableI). Verapamil (50 μm) inhibited Hoechst 33342 transport by wild-type LmrA and most mutants by more than 50%. In contrast, verapamil had only minor effects on Hoechst 33342 transport by mutants L298C, G303C, T307C, and A309C (Table I), suggesting that these mutants have reduced affinity for the inhibitor. The fluorophore fluorescein maleimide reacts with cysteine residues in polar environments, but not with cysteines in nonpolar environments (20Zhou J. Fazzio R.T. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cysteines in putative transmembrane domains were found to be nonaccessible to fluorescein maleimide, whereas cysteines in polar loop regions are readily labeled (e.g.Refs. 21Joseph-Liauzun E. Delmas P. Shire D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2146-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Mueller J. Rydström J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescein maleimide is therefore a suitable probe to determine whether the cysteine is situated in a polar loop region or within a lipidic membrane region. It was first tested whether fluorescein maleimide and MTSET (see below) might be substrates of multidrug transporter LmrA. Treatment of wild-type LmrA with fluorescein maleimide (0.25 mm) or MTSET (1 mm) did not affect LmrA-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport, indicating that these hydrophilic thiol reagents are not recognized as substrates by the LmrA transporter. The accessibility of the single cysteine residues in the putative hydrophilic loops of LmrA to fluorescein maleimide was tested in randomly oriented membrane vesicles and in membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation. His-tagged LmrA variants, solubilized from the membrane vesicles, were purified and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence of LmrA mutants labeled with fluorescein maleimide was detected by UV excitation. The wild-type, cysteine-less, LmrA was used as a negative control and was not modified by fluorescein maleimide in inside-out membrane vesicles (Fig. 3 A). The single cysteines at positions 109 and 132 (internal loop between TMS 2 and 3) and at positions 206 and 234 (internal loop between TMS 4 and 5) are located at the outside of inside-out membrane vesicles. These cysteines could be labeled by fluorescein maleimide in the membrane vesicles (Fig. 3 A) and this labeling could be prevented by preincubation with the charged, membrane-impermeable thiol-reagent MTSET (data not shown). This behavior indicates that cysteines at positions 109, 132, 206, and 234 are accessible from an aqueous environment that is consistent with a cytoplasmic location of the cysteines. The single cysteines in mutants S65C (external loop between TMS 1 and 2), L174C (external loop between TMS 3 and 4), and S287C (external loop between TMS 5 and 6) are located at the inside of inside-out membrane vesicles. In these membrane vesicles, these cysteines could not be labeled by fluorescein maleimide (Fig.3 A). Even when fluorescein-maleimide labeling experiments with mutants S65C and S287C were repeated at higher temperatures and prolonged incubation times, no modification was observed (Fig.3 B). However, when these cysteine mutants were solubilized from inside-out membrane vesicles using the detergentn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, they were readily labeled by fluorescein maleimide (Fig. 3 C). Also in randomly oriented membrane vesicles, prepared from inside-out membrane vesicles by sonication, mutants S65C, L174C, and S287C could be labeled by fluorescein maleimide (data not shown). When inside-out membrane vesicles containing mutants S65C, L174C, and S287C were first preincubated with MTSET and subsequently sonicated to generate randomly oriented membrane vesicles, all three cysteines could be labeled with fluorescein maleimide (data not shown). This behavior is in contrast to that of the cysteines at positions 109, 132, 206, and 234 and consistent with the extracellular location of the cysteines at positions 65, 174, and 287. These results, furthermore, demonstrate that fluorescein maleimide does not cross the membrane of inside-out vesicles under the conditions of the experiment. Using inside-out membrane vesicles, the accessibility of the single cysteine mutants in the region of TMS 6 to fluorescein maleimide was tested. Surprisingly, several of these cysteines were labeled by fluorescein maleimide (Fig.4). Although these residues are predicted to reside within the membrane domain of LmrA, the accessibility of these residues for fluorescein maleimide indicates a location in the protein structure, which is well exposed to the aqueous environment. The cysteine residues in the mutants that are not labeled are either buried in the protein structure or exposed to the lipid environment. The periodicity of fluorescein maleimide accessibility (Fig. 4) strongly suggests that the region between Leu-291 and Val-308 spans the membrane as an α-helix, which has one face of the helix accessible to an aqueous cavity. Indeed, when this region is modeled as an α-helix, the solvent accessible residues cluster on one face of the helix (Fig.5). The poorly expressed and transport inactive mutants also cluster on this face of the helix (Fig. 5).Figure 5Solvent accessible cysteine residues cluster on one face of transmembrane helix 6. Amino acid positions within the predicted TMS 6 (arranged as α-helical wheel) of LmrA are shown and viewed from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Positions of residues that when mutated to cysteine are readily modified by fluorescein maleimide are circled. Asterisksindicate the positions of residues that when mutated to cysteine are inactive (positions 299 and 300) or not expressed (position 301).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From the labeling pattern of the cysteines located in the external and internal loops of LmrA (Fig. 3 A), it appeared that fluorescein maleimide does not cross the membrane of inside-out vesicles. To confirm that the cysteine residues in helix 6 are accessible from the outside of inside-out membrane vesicles, the single cysteines were, prior to labeling with fluorescein maleimide, incubated with the charged and reportedly membrane-impermeable MTSET (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In all cases, labeling by fluorescein maleimide was blocked by MTSET (Fig.6), indicating that the cysteines in helix 6 are indeed accessible from the outside (corresponding to the cytoplasmic site of whole cells) of inside-out vesicles. The fluorescein maleimide-reactive positions periodically align the full-length of TMS 6, suggesting that one side of this transmembrane helix faces a water-filled transmembrane chamber. Other parts of transmembrane regions of LmrA are also needed to compose such a water-filled chamber. To obtain information about other potential components of this chamber, the accessibility for fluorescein maleimide of single cysteines introduced at positions of the membrane-embedded aromatic residues was tested. At least one single cysteine residue present in each TMS could be labeled by fluorescein maleimide (Fig.7), and this labeling was prevented by preincubation with MTSET (data not shown). These results suggest that several transmembrane segments of LmrA are involved in the formation of an aqueous chamber in the membrane that is accessible from the cytoplasm. The effect of cysteine modification on Hoechst 33342 transport was determined in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing the single cysteine mutants. Two small thiol reagents were used: NEM and MTSEA, which are both membrane permeable. Treatment of wild-type LmrA with NEM or MTSEA did not affect Hoechst 33342 transport. Four single cysteine mutants (S132C, L174C, S206C, and S234C) in the putative loop regions of LmrA were completely inactivated upon incubation with NEM (data not shown). The other three cysteine mutants in the loop regions were not affected by NEM treatment. To our surprise, none of the single cysteine mutants at positions of membrane-embedded aromatic residues was affected by NEM or MTSEA (data not shown), and only one mutant (L292C) in TMS 6 was inactivated by NEM (data not shown). The single cysteine mutants that were not affected by NEM either tolerated modification or could not be modified at all because they were not accessible. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the effect of NEM pretreatment on labeling of the mutant proteins with fluorescein maleimide was determined. For all single cysteine mutants tested, pretreatment with NEM prevents labeling by fluorescein maleimide, showing that these cysteine residues are accessible for NEM (Fig. 8, data not shown). The NEM accessibility of mutants that could not be modified by fluorescein maleimide was not determined. LmrA is an ABC multidrug transporter that mediates the extrusion of amphiphilic compounds from the inner leaflet of the membrane into the external water face. The major physicochemical characteristics of the substrates of LmrA are: hydrophobic ring structure, presence of a basic amino group, and a high potency to partition within membranes. It is therefore most likely that the translocation path of LmrA is lined with nonpolar residues (possibly aromatic side chains), in contrast to the translocation path of proteins that transport membrane-impermeable hydrophilic substrates. In this work we used a cysteine scanning mutagenesis approach in combination with thiol modification techniques to obtain structural information about LmrA and to determine whether residues in the membrane-embedded domain of this transporter for hydrophobic molecules are accessible to the solvent. To our surprise, only a very small number of residues appear to be essential to LmrA function. A set of 41 single cysteine mutants was constructed and nearly all mutants (37) showed a measurable transport activity. Only one protein of the inactive cysteine mutants (L301C) is not detectable at measurable levels, whereas two proteins (M299C and N300C) are poorly expressed, and one protein (F37C) is highly susceptible to proteinase activity. A role of these residues in catalytic activity is thus not evident. It is possible that they play a role in folding, insertion, or stability of the protein. It is noteworthy that cysteine replacements of residues in the middle of TMS 6 resulted in a drastic decrease in transport activity whereas replacements of membrane-embedded aromatic residues or residues in loop regions hardly affected the activity. Partially this might be explained by the reduced expression levels of these mutant proteins, but it also may reflect the role of TMS 6 in substrate binding. The finding that most residues of multidrug transporters can be replaced without serious impairment of function has previously been described and discussed for P-glycoprotein (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the secondary multidrug transporter EmrE fromEscherichia coli (26Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has also been observed that several single amino acid replacements in P-glycoprotein resulted in an altered substrate profile (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the mutated residues in LmrA needs to be studied further by a more detailed characterization of the substrate specificity of the mutant proteins. In our studies, mutagenesis of TMS 6 has generated proteins with modified specificity to at least one of the modulators of LmrA, which is most obvious for mutant A309C. This mutant displayed high Hoechst 33342 transport activity, but, in contrast to the wild-type protein, Hoechst 33342 transport was poorly inhibited by verapamil, suggesting that this mutant had lost the ability to bind verapamil with high affinity. Mutants L298C, G303C, and T307C also seem to be affected in their ability to bind verapamil. Loo and Clarke (27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) defined the verapamil binding site in P-glycoprotein using cysteine scanning mutagenesis and thiol modification with a methanethiosulfonate analog of verapamil. Their results suggested a role of residues in TMSs 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 in verapamil binding. Interestingly, one of these residues (Gly-984 in TMS 12 of P-glycoprotein) is conserved as Gly-303 in TMS 6 of LmrA. The decreased binding of verapamil to this mutant of LmrA suggests that at least some of the binding contacts for verapamil are conserved in human P-glycoprotein and bacterial LmrA. Further mutagenesis studies, which could be guided by the presumed analogies to the verapamil binding contacts in P-glycoprotein, are required to define all residues involved in binding of verapamil by LmrA. In previous studies, fluorescein maleimide, which at neutral pH is a dianion and membrane-impermeable, proved to be a useful fluorophore to determine the membrane topology of integral membrane proteins by modification of engineered cysteines (21Joseph-Liauzun E. Delmas P. Shire D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2146-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Mueller J. Rydström J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was found that this thiol reagent does not react with cysteines in the lipidic membrane environment, but readily reacts with cysteines in polar loop regions. Our results demonstrate that engineered cysteines in the putative hydrophilic loops of LmrA are indeed accessible to fluorescein maleimide, as expected. The difference in labeling between inside-out and randomly oriented membrane vesicles was used to discriminate between an intracellular or extracellular location of the residues. Previous studies demonstrated that both the N and C terminus of LmrA face the cytosolic side of the membrane (19Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy studies (28Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed a mainly α-helical structure of the TMD of LmrA. Our results support the presence of 6 TMSs in the membrane region of LmrA, and the periodicity of fluorescein maleimide accessibility of residues within TMS 6 shows that TMS 6 spans the membrane as an α-helix. TMS6 is a rather hydrophobic α-helix (H = 0.67) with the highest hydrophobicity at the site of tyrosine 297. To our surprise, the cysteine scanning accessibility studies demonstrated that several engineered cysteines in the membrane domain of LmrA are accessible to fluorescein maleimide. These reactive residues must therefore delineate water-filled cavities or, more likely, a water-filled chamber. Interestingly, the putative chamber in LmrA appears to be open to the intracellular environment. In a previous publication (9Van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we proposed a two-cylinder engine model for the excretion mechanism of LmrA. According to this model two monomeric LmrA molecules form a functional dimer. Each monomer catalyzes a transport cycle but the individual drug binding sites of the monomers interact allosterically. A transport cycle of a monomer starts by binding a lipophilic substrate to a high affinity substrate binding site exposed to the intracellular milieu. Subsequently, conformational changes induced by ATP-binding and/or hydrolysis result in an occluded state of this loaded substrate binding site followed by an exposure of the then low affinity binding site to the extracellular milieu where the substrate is released. According to the hydrophobic vacuum cleaner mechanism proposed for LmrA (10Bolhuis H. Van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the intracellular milieu is the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, whereas the extracellular milieu is the aqueous phase. Substrate translocation from the lipid phase to the aqueous phase could involve entering of the substrate in a lipid-filled chamber from the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, opening of the chamber to the extracellular milieu by an ATP hydrolysis-induced conformation change of the transporter, and release of the substrate into the extracellular aqueous phase. However, the results presented above indicate the presence of a water-filled chamber within the LmrA transporter, which under nonenergized conditions is exposed to the cytosol. This water-filled chamber is formed by one side of TMS 6 with contributions from other TMSs. The presence of this cytoplasmic exposed, water-filled chamber within the transporter implies that hydrophobic substrates are excreted from the membrane into the aqueous phase within the chamber, consistent with a vacuum cleaner mechanism, before being released into the extracellular aqueous phase. Significant conformational changes in LmrA upon hydrolysis of ATP have been detected by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (28Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Vigano C. Margolles A. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10962-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These conformational changes might lead to an opening of the water-filled chamber to the external surface as has been indicated by recent structural studies of a functional homolog of LmrA, P-glycoprotein (30Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Projection structures of P-glycoprotein showed that the TMDs of this protein can form a chamber within the membrane that opens to the extracellular milieu. Apparently, P-glycoprotein was trapped in the crystals in a conformation distinct from the one analyzed here for LmrA. Thus, most likely the lipophilic substrate is released into an externally exposed, water-filled chamber, formed as a result of ATP hydrolysis-induced conformational changes, from which it exits the cell. Taken the currently available data together, it appears that the TMDs of ABC multidrug (-like) transporters form a chamber within the membrane that alternates between at least two different conformations: one with the chamber exposed to the intracellular environment, and one in which the chamber has an opening to the extracellular environment. Our experimental results presented here and previous proton-deuterium exchange studies combined with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of LmrA (28Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) indicate that the chamber in these proteins is water-filled rather than lipid-filled.

https://openalex.org/W2094298301,"The survival and growth of epithelial cells depend on adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Because epidermal keratinocytes differentiate as they leave the basement membrane, an adhesion signal may regulate the initiation of differentiation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a fundamental signaling molecule that regulates the adhesion signal. Transfection of a dominant negative form of PI3K into keratinocytes using an adenovirus vector resulted in significant morphological changes comparable to differentiation and the induction of differentiation markers, keratin (K) 1 and K10. In turn, transfection with the constitutively active form of PI3K almost completely abolished the induction of K1 and K10 by differentiation in suspension cultures using polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate-coated dishes. PI3K activity was lost in suspension culture, except by cells bearing the constitutively active form of PI3K. These data demonstrate that blockade of PI3K results in differentiation and that activation of PI3K prevents differentiation. Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K significantly inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to the extracellular matrix and reduced the surface expression of α6 and β1 integrins in suspension culture. Moreover, expression of the active form of PI3K restored the mRNA levels of adhesion molecules that were reduced in suspension culture, including α3, α6, and β1 integrins, BP180, and BP230. In conclusion, loss of PI3K activity results in keratinocytes leaving the basement membrane and the initiation of a “default” differentiation mechanism. The survival and growth of epithelial cells depend on adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Because epidermal keratinocytes differentiate as they leave the basement membrane, an adhesion signal may regulate the initiation of differentiation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a fundamental signaling molecule that regulates the adhesion signal. Transfection of a dominant negative form of PI3K into keratinocytes using an adenovirus vector resulted in significant morphological changes comparable to differentiation and the induction of differentiation markers, keratin (K) 1 and K10. In turn, transfection with the constitutively active form of PI3K almost completely abolished the induction of K1 and K10 by differentiation in suspension cultures using polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate-coated dishes. PI3K activity was lost in suspension culture, except by cells bearing the constitutively active form of PI3K. These data demonstrate that blockade of PI3K results in differentiation and that activation of PI3K prevents differentiation. Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K significantly inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to the extracellular matrix and reduced the surface expression of α6 and β1 integrins in suspension culture. Moreover, expression of the active form of PI3K restored the mRNA levels of adhesion molecules that were reduced in suspension culture, including α3, α6, and β1 integrins, BP180, and BP230. In conclusion, loss of PI3K activity results in keratinocytes leaving the basement membrane and the initiation of a “default” differentiation mechanism. Many cellular functions are modulated by interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; K, keratin; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; Ax, adenovirus vector; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BP, bullous pemphigoid antigen; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; poly-HEMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; K, keratin; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; Ax, adenovirus vector; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BP, bullous pemphigoid antigen; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; poly-HEMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. The survival and growth of epithelial cells depends on adhesion to the ECM. Once cells leave the ECM, they may be eliminated by a form of apoptosis called anoikis (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Google Scholar). In malignant transformed cells, this apoptotic mechanism is likely lost, resulting in anchorage-independent cell growth. The epidermis is a multilayered epithelial tissue, maintained by the precise regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Cell growth is limited to the basal cell layer that attaches to the basement membrane. After leaving the basement membrane, keratinocytes differentiate and form a multilayered epidermis instead of undergoing apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic mechanisms, such as NF-κB or Bcl-x, might prevent premature apoptosis in the epidermis (2Seitz C.S. Freiberg R.A. Hinata K. Khavari P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 253-260Google Scholar, 3Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Wang H.G. Irie S. Fong L. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5501-5507Google Scholar), forming multilayers. Adhesion to the basement membrane is a negative regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, and the disruption of adhesion signals triggers terminal differentiation (4Watt F.M. Jordan P.W. O'Neill C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5576-5580Google Scholar). This suggests that there are mechanisms that regulate the adhesion signal for determining the onset of differentiation. PI3K might be involved in this mechanism. PI3K provides a universal survival signal that is involved in cell growth and anti-apoptosis. There are three classes of PI3K in mammalian cells (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Google Scholar, 6Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar, 7Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Google Scholar). Most studies have examined class I PI3K, primarily because it is generally coupled to extracellular stimuli. Class I PI3K consists of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. There are four isoforms of catalytic subunit p110 (α, β, γ, and δ) and five adaptor subunits: p85 (α and β), p55 (α and γ), and p50α (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Google Scholar, 6Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar, 7Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Google Scholar). Adhesion signals are transduced into intracellular signaling cascades via integrins through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in a PI3K-dependent manner (8Radeva G. Petrocelli T. Behrend E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Filmus J. Slingerland J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13937-13944Google Scholar, 9Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Google Scholar, 10Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Google Scholar). PI3K activates ILK by direct binding of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, a predominant lipid product of PI3K (11Hawkins P.T. Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 157-159Google Scholar), to ILK through a phosphatidylinositol phosphate-binding motif (9Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K is essential for ILK function. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in the anchorage-dependent cell survival system (12Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Google Scholar). Although FAK has been shown to interact with PI3K in vitro, the physiological link between FAK and PI3K remains unclear (13Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Google Scholar). These PI3K pathways via integrin are disrupted when cells detach from the ECM, and consequently “default” apoptotic or differentiation mechanisms may be initiated. Previously, we showed that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) regulates the late phase of keratinocyte differentiation (14Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling mechanism of the early phase of differentiation is poorly understood. Because epidermal keratinocytes undergo differentiation on leaving the ECM, we hypothesized that PI3K negatively regulates the early phase of differentiation by regulating the signals of adhesion to the ECM. Disruption of the interaction between integrins and the ECM results in a loss of PI3K activity (15King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Google Scholar,16Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Google Scholar). This negative signal may initiate keratinocyte differentiation. Here, we show that PI3K is a key regulator of early phase differentiation in keratinocytes. Adenovirus vectors (Ax) encoding a dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) and a myristoylated p110 subunit of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110, constitutively active form) were generous gifts from Dr. W. Ogawa, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine (17Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Google Scholar). Ax expressing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Axβ-gal) was used as a control to exclude the effect of Ax itself. Primary normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal-surgical discard skin. Normal human keratinocytes were cultured with MCDB153 medium supplemented with insulin (1 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), ethanolamine (0.1 mm), phosphoethanolamine (0.1 mm), bovine hypothalamic extract (50 μg/ml), and Ca2+ (0.1 mm). This supplement was as described elsewhere (18Sayama K. Shirakata Y. Midorikawa K. Hanakawa Y. Hashimoto K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 40-44Google Scholar). For suspension culture, 2 × 106 keratinocytes were plated onto 6-cm polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA)-coated dishes (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Google Scholar) in supplemented culture medium without bovine hypothalamic extract. Poly-HEMA-coated plates were made by adding 4 ml of a 10-mg/ml solution of poly-HEMA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in ethanol to the dish, drying, and repeating once, followed by extensive PBS washes. After the indicated time, cells were harvested by pipetting. After 24 h of Ax transfection at an m.o.i. of 10, keratinocytes were suspension-cultured for 6 h before cell adhesion. Then, 2 × 105 cells were allowed to adhere to 3-cm type-I collagen-coated dishes for 18 h in 2.0 ml of culture medium without bovine hypothalamic extract. Non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing the plates with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2. The number of adherent cells was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Briefly, 0.4 ml of 0.5% 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazole-2)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide in PBS was added to 2.0 ml of fresh culture medium and further incubated for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml of isopropyl alcohol containing 0.04 n HCl. The absorbance at 590 nm was measured, using the value of the medium alone as the background level. The data are given as the percentage of the control. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (n = 4). Total RNA was prepared using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan). Analysis was performed using the Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared by inserting PCR-amplified human cDNA corresponding to oligonucleotides 866–1133 of transglutaminase-1 (GenBankTMaccession number D90287), 966–1176 of loricrin (GenBankTMaccession number M61120), 74–249 of involucrin (GenBankTMaccession number M13903), 1129–1289 of keratin (K)1 (GenBankTM accession number M98776), 157–282 of K10 (GenBankTM accession number M19156), 2309–2678 of integrin α2 (GenBankTM accession number X17033), 1004–1317 of integrin α3 (GenBankTMaccession number D01038), 890–1165 of integrin α6(GenBankTM accession number X53586), 714–954 of integrin β1 (GenBankTM accession number X07979), 3810–4026 of integrin β4 (GenBankTMaccession number X52186), 5709–5892 of bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP) 230 (GenBankTM accession number L11690), or 2931–3092 of BP180 (GenBankTM accession number M91669) into theEcoRI and HindIII sites of the pPMG vector. Total RNA (5 μg) was hybridized with 32P-labeled riboprobe and digested with ribonuclease. The hybridization products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel, and exposed to film. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was the internal standard. The intensity of each band was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image and standardized with GAPDH. The data are presented as -fold induction, referring to the signal of the control as one unit. The analysis was performed using a Vistra ECF kit (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in rabbit anti-K1 (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) or monoclonal anti-K10 (Ab-1, NeoMarkers Inc., Fremont, CA) antibodies. After washing, the membrane was incubated with 1:2500 fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The signal was amplified with an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase followed by the fluorescent substrate AttoPhos (Amersham Biosciences). Then, the membrane was scanned using FluoroImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity of each band was quantified with ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics Inc.), referring to the control as one unit. Cell sorter analysis was performed as previously described (19Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were harvested from the dishes with trypsin-EDTA (adherent cells) or by pipetting (suspension culture) and filtered through a cell-strainer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells (1 × 106) were incubated with anti-α6 (4F10, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or anti-β1 (P5D2, Chemicon International) antibodies, or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 on ice for 30 min. After washing, the cells were reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 30 min on ice. The labeled cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Co., CA). The data are reported as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or percent MFI referring to the control as 100%. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test (n = 4). In vitro phosphorylation of PI was carried out as follows. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PI3K p110α antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complexes were re-suspended in 80 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl. The lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and applied to a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). These plates were developed in chloroform:methanol:H2O:ammonium (60:47:11.6:2, v/v), dried and visualized by autoradiography with x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). We infected normal human keratinocytes with Ax, at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. After 24 h, gene expression was found in almost all keratinocytes (data not shown). Transfection of Axβ-gal, AxCAMyr-p110, or AxCAΔp85 did not cause any apoptosis. Expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) in keratinocytes resulted in significant morphological changes comparable to differentiation (Fig. 1). There were no apparent morphological changes in keratinocytes transfected with either the constitutively active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110) or the control vector Axβ-gal, compared with the cells without Ax. After transfection of Ax, the expression of differentiation markers was analyzed by RPA (Fig. 2). The dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) significantly enhanced the expression of early phase differentiation markers, K1 and K10 mRNA. However, late phase differentiation markers, such as transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin mRNA, were not induced. Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, also enhanced K1 and K10 mRNA expression. Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of K1 and K10 protein by the dominant negative form of PI3K (Fig.3 A). We next analyzed the PI3K activity after the transfection of Ax (Fig. 3 B). The dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) almost completely inhibited the PI3K activity. By contrast, the active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110) enhanced the PI3K activity. This suggested that inhibition of PI3K activity induces early phase differentiation.Figure 3Induction of K1 and K10 protein (A) and inhibition of PI3K activity (B) by the dominant negative form of PI3K.A, normal human keratinocytes were infected with AxCAΔp85 (dominant negative form of PI3K), AxCAMyr-p110 (constitutively active form of PI3K), or Axβ-gal (control vector) at an m.o.i. of 10. After 48 h of Ax infection, the expression of K1 and K10 was analyzed by Western blotting. The intensity of each band was quantified and reported as -fold induction, referring to the signal of the control as 1 unit. Control: without Ax. B, after 24 h of Ax infection, the cells were harvested with lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-PI3K p110α antibodies. The immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 37 °C. The lipids were extracted and applied to a TLC plate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A suspension culture is a keratinocyte differentiation model, in which the interaction of keratinocytes with the ECM is disrupted (4Watt F.M. Jordan P.W. O'Neill C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5576-5580Google Scholar). We employed a suspension culture with poly-HEMA-coated culture plates, which inhibit cell-to-ECM interaction, but not cell-to-cell interaction (20Wakita H. Takigawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37285-37291Google Scholar). First, we analyzed the expression of differentiation markers in suspension culture with RPA. Transglutaminase-1, involucrin, K1, and K10 mRNA started to increase at 12 h and persisted up to 48 h (Fig. 4 A). Loricrin mRNA increased at 48 h. Next, PI3K activity was analyzed in suspension culture (Fig. 4 B). PI3K activity decreased within 3 h of suspension culture. This indicates that an adherent signal is essential for the activation of PI3K. We then analyzed whether the active form of PI3K inhibits the induction of differentiation markers by suspension culture. After transfection of Ax, keratinocytes were suspension-cultured for 24 h. Transfection of the constitutively active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110) almost completely abolished the induction of early phase differentiation markers, K1 and K10 mRNA (Fig. 5), whereas the expression of late phase differentiation markers, transglutaminase-1 and involucrin, was not affected. Other Ax had no effect on the expression of differentiation markers. This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.6 A). The induction of K1 and K10 protein by suspension culture was abolished by expression of the constitutively active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110). The PI3K activity decreased in suspension culture (Fig. 6 B), as shown in Fig.4 B. However, cells bearing the constitutively active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110) retained PI3K activity in suspension culture. This indicates that activation of PI3K prevents early phase differentiation, and blockade of PI3K activity results in early phase differentiation.Figure 6Inhibition of K1 and K10 protein induction (A) and sustained PI3K activity by the active form of PI3K (B). A, normal human keratinocytes were infected with AxCAΔp85 (dominant negative form of PI3K), AxCAMyr-p110 (constitutively active form of PI3K), or Axβ-gal (control vector) at an m.o.i. of 10. After 24 h of Ax infection, keratinocytes were cultured for a further 24 h on type-I collagen-coated dishes (adherent) or poly-HEMA-coated dishes (suspension). The expression of K1 and K10 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Control: without Ax. B, after 24 h of Ax infection, cells were further cultured (adherent) or suspension-cultured for 3 h. Then, the cells were harvested and the PI3K activity was measured as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The role of PI3K in keratinocyte adhesion to the ECM was then assessed. After transfection of Ax, cells were plated on type-I collagen-coated dishes. Expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to the dishes to 43% (Fig.7). The effect of other vectors was minimal. Next, we studied whether PI3K regulates the expression of α6 and β1 integrins using cell-sorter analysis. Expression of the active or dominant negative form of PI3K did not affect the expression of α6 or β1integrins on adherent keratinocytes (data not shown). When the cells were suspension-cultured, the expression of α6 and β1 integrins decreased within 24 h (Fig.8). Then, we analyzed the effects of the active and dominant negative forms of PI3K on the integrin expression at 6 h of suspension culture (Fig.9). Cells bearing the dominant negative form (AxCAΔp85) of PI3K further decreased the expression of α6 and β1 integrins to 83 and 74% of control, respectively. Next we analyzed the mRNA expression of molecules that mediate adhesion to the ECM. These include integrins, BP180, and BP230. BP180 and BP230 are components of the hemidesmosome that promote adhesion to the basement membrane (21Jones J.C. Hopkinson S.B. Goldfinger L.E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 488-494Google Scholar). After transfection of Ax, keratinocytes were suspension-cultured for 24 h. The expression of mRNA was analyzed by RPA. Suspension culture significantly reduced the mRNA expression of integrins and BPs (Fig. 10). The active form of PI3K (AxCAMyr-p110) restored the mRNA levels of adhesion molecules, including α3, α6, and β1integrins, BP180, and BP230 (Fig. 10). This suggests that PI3K maintains the expression of adhesion molecules in the basal cell layer. Combined, PI3K regulates keratinocyte adhesion to the ECM.Figure 8Decreased expression of α6 and β1 integrins by suspension culture.Keratinocytes were suspension-cultured for the indicated time and harvested for cell-sorter analysis. The cells were filtered through a cell-strainer and incubated with anti-α6 (4F10) or anti-β1 (P5D2) antibodies in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2on ice. After washing, the cells were reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The labeled cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer.

After 24 h of Ax infection, keratinocytes were cultured for another 24 h on type-I collagen-coated dishes (adherent) or poly-HEMA-coated dishes (suspension). Expression of α2, α3, α6, β1, and β4 integrins, BP230, and BP180 mRNA was analyzed by RPA. Control: without Ax. The intensity of each band was quantified and standardized with GAPDH. The data are given as -fold induction, referring to the signal of the control as 1 unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have shown that inhibition of PI3K initiates differentiation and that activation of PI3K prevents differentiation. In adherent cells, PI3K is activated by an adhesion signal (15King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Google Scholar, 16Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Google Scholar). This indicates that, at the basal cell layer, activated PI3K drives the keratinocytes to grow and not to differentiate. A decrease in PI3K activity results in a loss of keratinocyte adhesion to the ECM (Fig. 5), which might be followed by keratinocyte migration to the suprabasal layer. In the suprabasal layer, a “default” differentiation mechanism may initiate, which is suppressed by PI3K at the basal layer. Therefore, PI3K is a key regulator of the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation. Because Akt is activated on adhesion to the ECM and to protect against anoikis (16Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Google Scholar), Akt is a candidate downstream signaling molecule of PI3K. We repeated our experiments, including the constitutively active form of Akt, and found that Akt did not reduce the expression of early phase differentiation markers induced by suspension culture (data not shown). Therefore, some other molecules may participate downstream from PI3K. Such molecules may include ILK or glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. ILK phosphorylates both Akt (22Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V.

A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Google Scholar, 10Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Google Scholar) and regulates their activity. Phosphorylation of GSK3β results in the activation of the β-catenin/Lef-1 pathway (24Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Google Scholar, 25Sokol S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E124-E125Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type ILK suppresses differentiation of mouse mammary glands (26Somasiri A. Howarth A. Goswami D. Dedhar S. Roskelley C.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1125-1136Google Scholar). Although Akt had no effect on keratinocyte differentiation, it is still possible that ILK or GSK3β affects keratinocyte differentiation by interacting with some molecules other than Akt. With the initiation of differentiation, keratinocytes down-regulate integrin expression and migrate to the suprabasal layer in vivo. During suspension-induced differentiation, adhesion to the ECM is down-regulated in two stages (19Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Google Scholar, 27Hotchin N.A. Watt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14852-14858Google Scholar). First, the ability of the integrin to bind the ligand is reduced. Second, the integrin is lost from the cell surface. Although expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K inhibited the adhesion to 43%, the levels of α6 and β1 integrin expression were still high (83 and 74% of control, respectively). A decrease in integrin expression by the dominant negative form of PI3K may account for part of the loss of cell adhesion. Because the expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K had a minimal effect on integrin expression, the dominant negative form of PI3K might also inhibit the binding activity of integrins. Integrins are molecules that can transduce both “inside-out” and “outside-in” signals (28Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 37-43Google Scholar). Adhesion regulation by PI3K is reported in other types of cell. In T lymphocytes, PI3K regulates cell adhesion to the ECM via β1 integrin, without changing its expression level (29Woods M.L. Kivens W.J. Adelsman M.A. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Google Scholar, 30Woods M.L. Shimizu Y. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 874-880Google Scholar), as occurs in keratinocytes (19Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Google Scholar, 27Hotchin N.A. Watt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14852-14858Google Scholar). Moreover, the active form of PI3K restored the mRNA levels of adhesion molecules that were reduced by suspension culture in keratinocytes. This indicates that activation of PI3K by adhesion plays an important role in maintaining the adhesion molecules in the basal cell layer. Thus, PI3K regulates keratinocyte adhesion to the ECM. The proliferative and anti-apoptotic roles of PI3K have been studied; however, PI3K is not recognized as a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. Several intra-cellular signaling pathways have been identified as regulators of keratinocyte differentiation, such as the ASK1 (14Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar), p38 MAPK (14Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K.

Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Google Scholar) pathways. The upper epidermis expresses ASK1, which induces late phase differentiation markers, including transglutaminase-1, involucrin, and loricrin (14Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar). Epidermal keratinocytes express α, δ, ε, η, and ζ isoforms of protein kinase C (34Osada S. Hashimoto Y. Nomura S. Kohno Y. Chida K. Tajima O. Kubo K. Akimoto K. Koizumi H. Kitamura Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. Kuroki T. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 167-175Google Scholar, 39Gherzi R. Sparatore B.

Loomis C. Griffiths C.E. Cooper K.D. Reynolds N.J. Elder J.T. et al.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 553-559Google Scholar). It has been suggested that protein kinase C is involved in the transition process from the spinous to the granular layer (43Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Google Scholar). We examined whether PKC isoforms were involved in the dominant negative form of PI3K-induced differentiation. Activation of PKC isoforms was determined by analyzing the subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms using Western blotting. The redistribution of PKC from the soluble fraction to a particulate fraction is a useful indicator of PKC activation (44Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Google Scholar). However, expression of the dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85) did not affect the subcellular distribution of PKCs (data not shown), indicating that PKCs are not activated by the dominant negative form of PI3K (AxCAΔp85). Furthermore, both ASK1 and protein kinase C regulate involucrin promoter activity via p38 MAPK (14Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar, 31Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar). Therefore, ASK1, p38 MAPK, and protein kinase C seem to be the regulators of late phase differentiation in keratinocytes. On the other hand, PI3K, NF-κB, and MAPK are implicated in the early phase of differentiation. The epidermis of IKKα-deficient mice shows abnormal differentiation (37Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Google Scholar). Because NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the suprabasal layer (37Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Google Scholar), NF-κB seems to play an important role in the initiation of differentiation. Integrin ligation activates MAPK and negatively regulates differentiation, as does PI3K (32Zhu A.J. Haase I. Watt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6728-6733Google Scholar, 33Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Google Scholar). MAPK also regulates cell adhesion to the ECM (32Zhu A.J. Haase I. Watt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6728-6733Google Scholar,33Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Google Scholar). The identities of these regulators, their relationships, and the overall regulatory system remain unclear and should be further elucidated. β1 integrin generates at least two signals in keratinocytes. One signal is a clustering of receptors into a focal adhesion with the polymerization of actin filaments (32Zhu A.J. Haase I. Watt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6728-6733Google Scholar, 33Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Google Scholar, 45Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Google Scholar, 46Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Google Scholar). The other signal is a negative stimulus for differentiation (47Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 307-309Google Scholar) that is independent of receptor clustering (33Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Google Scholar, 48Raghavan S. Bauer C. Mundschau G., Li, Q. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1149-1160Google Scholar). The predominant integrins in the epidermis are α3β1 and α6β4 (49Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Google Scholar). Although β1integrin regulates differentiation in an in vitro model, β1 integrin is not essential for the differentiation mechanism in a gene-targeted mouse model. The proliferative potential is markedly reduced in the β1 null epidermis; however, the differentiation program is preserved (48Raghavan S. Bauer C. Mundschau G., Li, Q. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1149-1160Google Scholar, 50Brakebusch C. Grose R. Quondamatteo F. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. Pirro A. Svensson M. Herken R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Werner S. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3990-4003Google Scholar). The differentiation process may be compensated for by other mechanisms, such as β4 integrin. By contrast, in β4 null mice, basal-like keratin-5-positive cells were seen in the spinous layer and apoptotic cells in the basal cell layer (51Dowling J., Yu, Q.C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Google Scholar). This suggests that the differentiation program is disturbed. There may be a distinction between the signal transduction mechanisms of the two β-integrin subunits. In conclusion, activation of PI3K inhibits early phase differentiation, and a decrease in PI3K activity results in loss of adhesion to the ECM and the initiation of early phase differentiation. Therefore, PI3K is a key regulator of early phase differentiation in keratinocytes."

The predicted human DNA helicase B (HDHB) protein contains conserved helicase motifs (superfamily 1) that are strikingly similar to those of bacterial recD and T4 dda proteins. The HDHB gene is expressed at low levels in liver, spleen, kidney, and brain and at higher levels in testis and thymus. Purified recombinant HDHB hydrolyzed ATP and dATP in the presence of single-stranded DNA, displayed robust 5′-3′ DNA helicase activity, and interacted physically and functionally with DNA polymerase α-primase. HDHB proteins with mutations in the Walker A or B motif lacked ATPase and helicase activity but retained the ability to interact with DNA polymerase α-primase, suggesting that the mutants might be dominant over endogenous HDHB in human cells. When purified HDHB protein was microinjected into the nucleus of cells in early G1, the mutant proteins inhibited DNA synthesis, whereas the wild type protein had no effect. Injection of wild type or mutant protein into cells at G1/S did not prevent DNA synthesis. The results suggest that HDHB function is required for S phase entry.

DNA helicases are an abundant class of DNA metabolic enzymes, surpassing even the DNA polymerases in number and complexity, as well as in their resistance to experimental efforts to elucidate their functions. Although prokaryotic and viral DNA helicases are comparatively well studied, eukaryotic DNA helicases remain poorly understood.

Moreover, DDB stimulates, but is not necessary for, NER in vitro (11Wakasugi M. Kawashima A. Morioka H. Linn S. Sancar A. Mori T. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1637-1640Google Scholar), but it appears to be necessary for normal global genomic NER (12Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Google Scholar). It associates with the histone acetyltransferase, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300, which is believed to be important in altering chromatin structure. Datta et al. (13Datta A. Bagchi S. Nag A. Shiyanov P. Adami G.R. Yoon T. Raychaudhuri P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 89-97Google Scholar) proposed that DDB has a stimulatory role in normal global genomic NER of UV-induced DNA lesions by recruiting cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 to the site of damage to render chromatin more accessible to the DNA repair machinery.DDB interacts with other cellular proteins, suggesting that it may be multifunctional. DDB2 binds to the cell cycle regulatory transcription factor, E2F1, and in the presence of DDB1 it acts as a negative regulator of G1/S cell cycle progression following UV-induced DNA damage (14Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Google Scholar). Both DDB1 and DDB2 are ubiquitinated by Cul-4A, a member of the cullin family of proteins (15Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Zhang Y. Douglas L. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48175-48182Google Scholar, 17Nag A. Bondar T. Shiv S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6738-6747Google Scholar). Cul-4A is believed to be a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (type E3) and is involved in G1/S phase progression inCaenorhabditis elegans (18Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P., He, W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Google Scholar). The expression of DDB2 is cell cycle-regulated, peaking at the G1/S boundary (17Nag A. Bondar T. Shiv S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6738-6747Google Scholar). DDB2, but not DDB1, mRNA and protein levels are induced 2- to 3-fold by UV irradiation (19Itoh T. Nichols A. Linn S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7041-7050Google Scholar).DDB1 binds to the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene regulatory factor 2 (BRF-2), and the DDB1-BRF-2 heterodimer has been suggested to be required for optimum-specific apoB gene expression (20Krishnamoorthy R.R. Lee T.H. Butel J.S. Das H.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 960-969Google Scholar). DDB1 also binds to viral transcriptional transactivators, including the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBVx) (21Butel J.S. Lee T.H. Slagle B.L. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1995; 25: 185-198Google Scholar) and the V proteins from paramyxovirus, simian parainfluenza virus 5, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus 2, and measles virus (22Lin G.Y. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9152-9166Google Scholar). DDB2 also has been shown recently to bind HBVx protein (23Nag A. Datta A. Yoo K. Bhattacharyya D. Chakrabortty A. Wang X. Slagle B.L. Costa R.H. Raychaudhuri P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10383-10392Google Scholar). Because nuclear levels of DDB increase in late G1, DDB has been proposed to participate in nuclear functions of HBVx during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Despite this information, the precise physiological role(s) of DDB still remain elusive.We have identified three domains that are highly conserved in DDB1 sequence homologues of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum,Arabidopsis thaliana, S. pombe (24Zolezzi F. Linn S. Gene. 2000; 245: 151-159Google Scholar), andOryza sativa. 2Unpublished data. 2Unpublished data. Two other reports assigned the same S. pombe predicted polypeptide to the DDB1 family of proteins (25Mintz P.J. Patterson S.D. Neuwald A.F. Spahr C.S. Spector D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4308-4320Google Scholar, 26Neuwald A.F. Poleksic A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3570-3580Google Scholar). The overall identity between the human and S. pombe (previously published as NCBI accession number SPAC17H9.10c) sequences is 26%; the identities in domains 1, 2, and 3 are 45, 40, and 21%, respectively. To our knowledge, no sequence homologue of DDB1 has been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.S. pombe has been used extensively to study DNA repair and cell cycle control (27Humphrey T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 211-226Google Scholar, 28McCready S.J. Osman F. Yasui A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 197-210Google Scholar). S. pombe appears to be more closely related to animal cells with respect to cell cycle regulation and chromosome structure and segregation than is S. cerevisiae (29Zhao Y. Lieberman H.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 359-371Google Scholar) from which it diverged 330–420 million years ago (30Sipiczki M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (Reviews): 1011.1-1011.4Google Scholar). In this study we report the cloning of the S. pombesequence homologue of the human DDB1 gene,ddb1+, and the characterization of theddb1 deletion mutant. ddb1+ is not an essential gene, and the ddb1Δ cells show an elongated phenotype and nuclear abnormalities. The sensitivity of theddb1 deletion strain to a variety of DNA-damaging agents, to hydroxyurea, and to thiabendazole was compared with those of the null strains rad13 (the gene encoding for the homologue of the human XPG protein (31Edwards R.J. Carr A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 471-494Google Scholar)), rhp51 (the gene encoding for the homologue of the human RAD51 protein (32Muris D.F. Vreeken K. Carr A.M. Broughton B.C. Lehmann A.R. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4586-4591Google Scholar)), and cds1 (a gene implicated in the intra-S checkpoint response, the homologue of the human CHEK2 (33Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Google Scholar, 34Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Google Scholar)).DISCUSSIONDDB from mammalian cells is a heterodimer of DDB1 and DDB2 (2Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-212300Google Scholar, 3Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Google Scholar, 4Fujiwara Y. Masutani C. Mizukoshi T. Kondo J. Hanaoka F. Iwai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20027-20033Google Scholar). As noted in the Introduction, DDB1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein; sequence homologues have been identified in mammals, worms, insects and plants. DDB2, however, is less conserved, and DDB2 sequence homologues have been identified only in mammals and plants (24Zolezzi F. Linn S. Gene. 2000; 245: 151-159Google Scholar). 3Unpublished data. Members of the DDB1 family do not contain nuclear localization signals, whereas all of the DDB2 homologues contain multiple nuclear localization signals (1Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F. Admon A. Linn S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Google Scholar). 4Unpublished data. Nevertheless, when the Ddb1p-Myc fusion protein was expressed under the control of the natural chromosomal promoter, an almost exclusively nuclear/nucleolar localization was observed. In human cells, DDB2 is proposed to bind to DDB1 in the cytoplasm and translocate it to the nucleus (44Liu W. Nichols A.F. Graham J.A. Dualan R. Abbas A. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21429-21434Google Scholar, 54Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that two naturally occurring XP-E mutations of DDB2, 82TO and 2RO, are deficient in stimulating the nuclear accumulation of DDB1 (54Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Google Scholar). Therefore, one might expect there to be a functional homologue of human DDB2 in S. pombe that is responsible for the import of Ddb1p into the nucleus. Alternatively, it is also possible that a S. pombe DDB2 functional homologue does not exist. In mammalian cells, DDB2 is induced in response to UV irradiation (19Itoh T. Nichols A. Linn S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7041-7050Google Scholar), and DDB1 is subsequently transported to the nucleus. Moreover, this induction is dependent upon p53 (55Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Google Scholar). By contrast,S. pombe Ddb1p does not relocate following UV irradiation, because it is constitutively present in the nucleus, and S. pombe does not have a p53 homologue.The FZ150 ddb1Δ strain was slightly sensitive to UV irradiation compared with the NER-defective rad13Δ strain, suggesting that Ddb1p does not play a principal role in NER of UV-induced DNA damage. The FZ150 strain also showed a slight sensitivity to X-rays. In both cases, these cells showed the presence of one subpopulation of about 40% with a high sensitivity to the radiation and a second subpopulation with normal sensitivity. Thirty-nine percent of the FZ150 cell population also had an elongated phenotype, suggesting that these elongated cells could be the subpopulation that is sensitive to irradiation. However, because it appeared that roughly the same proportion of cells do not form colonies, this correlation may be coincidental as it may be that the elongated cells do not replicate.The basis of the sensitivity of the ddb1D cells to MMS remains unclear, because no increase in aberrant nuclei was detected following exposure to MMS in liquid culture. Possibly Ddb1p is involved in base excision repair, but then a sensitivity to H2O2 would also have been expected. It is interesting that the rhp51D strain is also sensitive to MMS but not to H2O2, suggesting a possible role of Ddb1p in recombinational repair rather than in excision repair.Ddb1p appears also to be required for proper chromosomal segregation under normal growth conditions. Observations of chromosome III with indirect immunofluorescence of the rDNA-associated protein, Nop1p, showed that the chromatin abnormalities observed in at least some of the ddb1Δ cells appeared to be because of chromatid non-disjunction or premature disjunction. Neuwald and Poleksic (26Neuwald A.F. Poleksic A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3570-3580Google Scholar) used hidden Markov models of structural repeats to predict the presence of β-propeller domains in the DDB1 family of proteins and in other structurally related proteins, including the fission yeast Rik1p-silencing protein. rik1+ belongs to a class of S. pombe-silencing genes that includescrl4+, clr6+,swi6+, and hst4+. These genes have been implicated in silencing of the mating-type loci, the telomeres, the centromeres, and the rDNA repeats and also to be essential elements in the assembly of a heterochromatin-like structure (50Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Google Scholar, 51Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Cranston G. Allshire R.

Bonaduce M.J. Klar A.J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 563-576Google Scholar, 56Freeman-Cook L.L. Sherman J.M. Brachmann C.B. Allshire R.C. Boeke J.D. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3171-3186Google Scholar). Mutations in rik1, as well as inclr4, clr6, swi6, and hst4, also result in a defective chromatin structure leading to abnormal chromosome segregation. Most similar to the ddb1Δphenotype is the hst4Δ phenotype. These cells show the same elongation and abnormal nuclear morphology as theddb1Δ cells (56Freeman-Cook L.L. Sherman J.M. Brachmann C.B. Allshire R.C. Boeke J.D. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3171-3186Google Scholar). Moreover, like Ddb1p, Hst4p shows a preferential nucleolar localization, and the hst4Δ cells are sensitive to UV irradiation (56Freeman-Cook L.L. Sherman J.M. Brachmann C.B. Allshire R.C. Boeke J.D. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3171-3186Google Scholar).Genomic instability in the rik1, clr4,clr6, swi6, and hst4 mutants is thought to be caused by a defect in centromeric silencing, resulting in defective centromeric function (50Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Google Scholar, 51Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Cranston G. Allshire R. Science. 1995; 269: 1429-1431Google Scholar, 52Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J.P. Borgstrom B. Egel R. Cranston G. Allshire R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2637-2648Google Scholar, 53Grewal S.I. Bonaduce M.J. Klar A.J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 563-576Google Scholar). Because clr4,rik1, swi6, and hst4 deletion mutants are highly sensitive to the microtubule-destabilizing drug TBZ, a direct or indirect interaction of the products of these genes with microtubules at the kinetochore was proposed (52Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J.P. Borgstrom B. Egel R. Cranston G. Allshire R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2637-2648Google Scholar). Theddb1Δ strain is also sensitive to TBZ, indicating that theddb1Δ strain might also be defective in an interaction of the centromere with microtubules. Indeed the chromosomal segregation abnormalities observed in the ddb1Δ cells, the presence of lagging chromosomes, and the Ddb1p nucleolar localization, together with the structural homology proposed between Ddb1p and Rik1p, suggest that Ddb1p might help to maintain normal heterochromatin structure at centromeric regions and possibly also at rDNA repeats. Should this be the case, the absence of Ddb1p could result in mispositioning of other unidentified proteins and consequent improper centromere assembly and genomic instability. In this light, the sensitivity of theddb1Δ strain to a variety of DNA-damaging agents could be interpreted as the result of inefficient DNA repair because of a general chromatin assembly defect rather then a specific defect in a DNA repair pathway.The organization of rDNA genes and of the centromeric regions inS. pombe has been shown to be more closely related to that in animal cells than that in S. cerevisiae (47Maleszka R. Clark-Walker G.D. Yeast. 1993; 9: 53-58Google Scholar, 48Toda T. Nakaseko Y.,. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Curr. Genet. 1984; 8: 93-97Google Scholar, 57Allshire R.C. Cranston G. Gosden J.R. Maule J.C.

A function for the S. pombe Ddb1p in maintaining proper chromatin structure in the rDNA genes and the centromeric regions might then explain why a DDB1 homologue is not present in S. cerevisiae but is found in S. pombe. Aravindet al. (63Aravind L. Watanabe H. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11319-11324Google Scholar) compared 4,344 protein sequences from S. pombe with all available eukaryotic sequences and identified those genes that are conserved in S. pombe and non-fungal eukaryotes but are missing or highly diverged in S. cerevisiae. Their results suggested coelimination of functionally interacting sets of proteins. In particular, a pattern of coelimination was seen among proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, including Swi6p, Clr4p, Rik1p, Ddb1p, and the cullin 4A ortholog. As previously noted, both human DDB1 and DDB2 are ubiquitinated by Cullin 4A.A stimulus for this study was ultimately to obtain clues to the function of mammalian DDB1, because naturally occurring mutations of DDB1 are not known. Although it is not clearly established that the mammalian and S. pombe sequence homologues are functional homologues, as well, the very potent defects that result as a consequence of the S. pombe ddb1 deletion would suggest that DDB1 mutations in mammalian cells are likely to be lethal. Moreover, the chromosome segregation defect observed in theddb1Δ mutant might suggest that subtle alterations in the DDB1 gene such as those caused by single nucleotides polymorphisms could lead to genomic instability and therefore to increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis.

S. pombe appears to be more closely related to animal cells with respect to cell cycle regulation and chromosome structure and segregation than is S. cerevisiae (29Zhao Y. Lieberman H.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 359-371Google Scholar) from which it diverged 330–420 million years ago (30Sipiczki M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (Reviews): 1011.1-1011.4Google Scholar). In this study we report the cloning of the S. pombesequence homologue of the human DDB1 gene,ddb1+, and the characterization of theddb1 deletion mutant. ddb1+ is not an essential gene, and the ddb1Δ cells show an elongated phenotype and nuclear abnormalities. The sensitivity of theddb1 deletion strain to a variety of DNA-damaging agents, to hydroxyurea, and to thiabendazole was compared with those of the null strains rad13 (the gene encoding for the homologue of the human XPG protein (31Edwards R.J.

As noted in the Introduction, DDB1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein; sequence homologues have been identified in mammals, worms, insects and plants. DDB2, however, is less conserved, and DDB2 sequence homologues have been identified only in mammals and plants (24Zolezzi F. Linn S. Gene. 2000; 245: 151-159Google Scholar). 3Unpublished data. Members of the DDB1 family do not contain nuclear localization signals, whereas all of the DDB2 homologues contain multiple nuclear localization signals (1Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F.

Biochemical studies on germination have been limited by the difficulty of obtaining a pure population of spores germinating synchronously. Here, we report that spores can be purified and sorted according to their size by centrifugal elutriation and that these spores are able to germinate synchronously. Synchronizing their development has allowed reevaluating certain parameters of germination, and we demonstrate that both transcription and translation are induced very rapidly after germination induction. Spores contain mRNAs that are stable for several months in spores kept at 4 °C. Germination induction leads to very rapid degradation of these mRNAs, thus providing a simple model to study induction of mRNA decay in eukaryotes. mRNAs from the spore are polyadenylated, capped, and cosediment on sucrose gradients with ribosomes and polysomes and with components of the mRNA degradation machinery. The presence of polysomes in the spores led us to evaluate the activity of the translation apparatus in these cells. We present evidence that there is ongoing transcription and translation in nongerminating yeast spores incubated in water at 30 °C, suggesting that these activities could play a role in spore long term survival.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae a/α diploid cells, when deprived of nitrogen in the presence of a nonmetabolizable carbon source, can enter a developmental program known as sporulation (1Esposito R.E. Klapholz S. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 211-287Google Scholar). Yeast sporulation consists of two overlapping processes, meiosis and spore formation. Meiosis leads to the synthesis of four haploid daughter cells that are the yeast gametes. Meanwhile, these gametes are embedded into a specialized structure, the spore, that can resist a variety of harsh treatments and allow the cell to survive drought, frost, heat, and chemical exposure (2Kupiec M. Byers B. Esposito R.E. Mitchell A.P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Cell Cycle and Cell Biology. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 889-1036Google Scholar). When favorable conditions return, the spore germinates and resumes its vegetative growth. This germination program includes the activation of cellular metabolism, extensive morphological changes, and reentry into the cell cycle followed by mating. One haploid cell of the a-mating type will encounter one haploid cell of the α-mating type, and their fusion will lead to the formation of a diploid cell, thus completing the sexual cycle (3Herskowitz I. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 536-553Google Scholar). The development of germinating spores has been examined by electron microscopy (4Rousseau P. Halvorson H.O. Bulla Jr., L.A. St. Julian G. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 1232-1238Google Scholar, 5Hashimoto T. Conti S.F. Naylor H.B. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 76: 406-416Google Scholar, 6Steele S.D. Miller J.J. Can. J.

Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 63-68Google Scholar). For instance, protein synthesis was reported to start 20 min and RNA transcription 70 min after the addition of glucose (13Xu G. West T.P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 786-788Google Scholar), therefore suggesting that spores must contain mRNA available for immediate translation. More recently, it has been confirmed that spore germination requires active protein synthesis during the 1st h and that it depends on the Ras signaling pathway (14Herman P.K. Rine J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6171-6181Google Scholar). However, biochemical analysis was limited by the poor synchrony of germination of spores obtained by classical methods. In contrast to spore germination, about which little was known, meiosis had been the subject of numerous studies in yeast, and a large body of information was available, which had been completed by transcriptome analyses (15Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Google Scholar, 16Primig M. Williams R.M. Winzeler E.A. Tevzadze G.G. Conway A.R. Hwang S.Y. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 415-423Google Scholar). Meiosis requires the coordinate expression of a large number of genes that are expressed in a timely fashion (15Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Google Scholar, 16Primig M. Williams R.M. Winzeler E.A. Tevzadze G.G. Conway A.R. Hwang S.Y. Davis R.W.

In addition to strict transcriptional control, this sharp pattern of expression for early meiotic transcripts is caused by their high instability (18Surdej P. Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 263-282Google Scholar, 19Surosky R.T. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3948-3958Google Scholar). Regulation of mRNA decay represents a significant part of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression (20Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar). The major mRNA degradation pathway in yeast initiates with 3′-poly(A) tail shortening that is catalyzed by the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex (21Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Google Scholar, 22Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar). It is followed by the removal of the 5′-cap structure by the Dcp1p decapping enzyme, which exposes the body of the transcript to Xrn1p, a 5′ → 3′-exonuclease (20Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 23Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Google Scholar). A complex of seven Lsm proteins (including Spb8p/Lsm1p) and Pat1p has been shown to interact with mRNA and to be required for mRNA decapping (20Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5939-5946Google Scholar). We present here a method of preparing pure spores that germinate with high synchrony, thus enabling a biochemical analysis of germination. The addition of glucose results in rapid induction of transcription and translation. Spores contain mRNAs that are stable for months when the spores are kept at 4 °C; however, they are rapidly degraded when germination is induced. These mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated in spores, and they cosediment on sucrose gradients with ribosomes and polysomes. We present evidence that in nongerminating spores there is ongoing transcription and translation whose involvement in spore survival will be discussed. The diploid Y55 strain used for this study was provided by J. Haber (Y55-523: MAT a/α ura3). The two HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin. -tagged cyclin genes (27Gallego C. Gari E. Colomina N. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7196-7206Google Scholar) were introduced into the Y55 strain by genetic crossing, followed by five backcrosses, then a double-tagged strain was constructed to yield strain YBL4325 (MAT a/αade2–1 leu2-Δ ura3–1 CLN2–3HA CLB5–3HA). Yeast cells were handled essentially as described (28Guthrie C. Fink R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar). To induce sporulation, 4 liters of diploid cells were grown at 30 °C in YEPA (YEPA: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% potassium acetate) untilA 600 nm ∼2, then washed in H2O and transferred into 4 liters of sporulation medium (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose) for 72 h. To facilitate the enzymatic digestion, asci were first resuspended in 10 ml/g pelleted cells in 100 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Then, cells were transferred into the same volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1.1 m sorbitol and digested with 0.4 mg/ml Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp.) for 3 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Freed spores were then resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 (ICN) and sonicated. Separation of the yeast spores according to their size was performed with a Beckman elutriation rotor (JE-5.0), using 0.5% Triton X-100 as a counterbalancing fluid. A 600 nm ∼6,000 cells were loaded into the 30-ml elutriation chamber and centrifuged at 3,200 rpm at 4 °C. Once the gradient was established, the flow of the pump was increased progressively, and cellular debris were expulsed from the chamber first, as checked by microscopic observation. Then, once all cellular debris had been eliminated, the flow was increased regularly until cells began to exit the chamber. Fractions of 250 ml were collected, and cell size was monitored using a cell analyzer system (CASY-TTC, Schärfe System, Germany). Fractions containing spores (average cell diameter ∼3 μm) were pooled and resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 at a concentration of A 600 nm∼10. To induce germination, spores were equilibrated at 30 °C in YEP minus glucose, at a concentration of A 600 nm∼1, and a sample was taken immediately before the addition of glucose (time 0). Then, germination was induced by adding 2% glucose, and samples were taken at time intervals, rapidly cooled down, and washed once in TE before freezing the cell pellets in liquid nitrogen. For scanning electron microscopy examination, cells were fixed overnight in phosphate buffer containing 3.6% formaldehyde, then washed three times in phosphate buffer, once in 50% ethanol, and once in 100% ethanol before cells underwent critical point drying using CO2. Samples were then covered with carbon and viewed using a Jeol GSM6300F microscope. RNA extraction was performed as described previously (29Cross F.R. Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Google Scholar, 30Pintard L. Kressler D. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1370-1381Google Scholar). RNA samples were separated either by agarose gel electrophoresis or by PAGE. For agarose gel electrophoresis, 10 μg of total RNA was separated onto a 1.2% agarose slab gel before capillary transfer to positively charged Nylon (Nytran plus) performed in 10× SSC. For PAGE, RNA was loaded onto a 0.75-mm thick, 24-cm long 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3 m urea, 1× Tris borate-EDTA gel and electrophoresed for 3 h at 750 V. RNA was transferred onto Nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) overnight at 8 V, in the cold room. Hybridization was done as described previously (31Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar), either with end-labeled oligonucleotides or with randomly primed double-stranded DNA (Neblot kit, AmershamBiosciences). Poly(A) tail analysis was performed as described previously (32Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Google Scholar). For RNase H cleavage experiments, 10 μg of total RNA and 100 ng of mRNA-specific oligonucleotide (OBL137: TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTT) plus or minus 300 ng of oligo(dT) were hybridized in 10 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl for 10 min at 68 °C. Then, the mixture was slowly cooled down until it reached 30 °C and brought to 20 μl in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and cleavage was performed with 0.25 unit of RNase H (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mmEDTA, 0.5% SDS, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitation of capped mRNAs was carried out as described (33Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Google Scholar), using antibody H20 (34Bochnig P. Reuter R. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 461-467Google Scholar) except that incubation with RNA was performed for 3 h. Proteins were prepared and analyzed as described previously (26Bonnerot C. Boeck R. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5939-5946Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, primary antibodies were added at the following dilutions: anti-Xrn1p (35Heyer W.D. Johnson A.W. Reinhart U. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2728-2736Google Scholar), 1/5,000; anti-Pab1p (36Adam S.A. Nakagawa T. Swanson M.S. Woodruff T.K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2932-2943Google Scholar), 1/5,000; rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF4E (a gift from J. van den Heuvel), 1/2,500; anti-Qsr1p (37Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Google Scholar), 1/1,000, anti-HA, 1/1,000 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Sigma. Polysomes were prepared as originally described (38Hutchison H.T. Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 807-814Google Scholar), modified according to Ref. 30Pintard L. Kressler D. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1370-1381Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitation was performed using native protein extracts and an anti-Pab1p antibody, as described previously (30Pintard L. Kressler D. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1370-1381Google Scholar). Incorporation of labeled precursors into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was used to monitor transcription and translation activities. Cells (2 OD/ml) were labeled with 100 μCi of [3H]uracil either for 10 min (germinating spores) or for 0–2 h (resting spores). Total RNA was then extracted, trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and counted. For [35S]methionine incorporation, spores (5 OD/ml) were equilibrated either in YNB or in H2O with or without 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. After 15 min, [35S]methionine was added and incubated for different times as indicated in the figure legends. For incorporation studies, protein extracts were prepared and trichloroacetic acid precipitated. For qualitative analysis, labeled proteins were fractionated onto 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed. Biochemical analysis of germination has been limited in the past by the difficulty in obtaining large amounts of pure spores germinating synchronously. Indeed, spores prepared using classical methods are contaminated by vegetative cells, and they germinate asynchronously. To overcome these problems, it was necessary to select a yeast strain able to sporulate and germinate efficiently and to design a new method of preparing pure spores able to germinate synchronously. First, we tested several yeast strains for their ability to sporulate and germinate efficiently. For instance, the widely used laboratory strain W303 gave efficient germination but low sporulation rates (∼35%). A strain frequently used to study meiosis, SK1, gave a very high sporulation rate (∼90%), but the spores thus obtained had a moderate rate and a poor synchrony of germination. We selected for this analysis strain Y55, which combined a high score of sporulation (∼75%) with the best rate of germination obtained for the strains that we tested. However, the spores obtained with this strain were still contaminated with vegetative cells, and they germinated asynchronously. Centrifugal elutriation has proven to be a powerful tool to separate cells according to their size. For instance, it permits selection of small yeast daughter cells that are able to undergo a full cell cycle synchronously, once returned to the appropriate growth medium (39Elliott S.G. McLaughlin C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4384-4388Google Scholar, 40Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Google Scholar, 41Johnston L.H. Johnson A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 342-350Google Scholar). We reasoned that asynchronous germination of yeast spores also could be because of their size heterogeneity, and we decided to test on the spores the effect of physical separation previously applied to vegetative cells. The Y55 strain was sporulated, and tetrads were enzymatically digested to free the spores from the asci. After several washes and sonication, spores were elutriated, and several fractions were collected and further tested. The major difficulty in handling the spores came from their extreme stickiness, which is likely necessary in their natural environment to attach to their resting and/or feeding substrate. We tested several conditions for elutriation and found that the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 was sufficient to prevent spore aggregation and clogging of the elutriation apparatus. Once the elutriation chamber was filled and the gradient of cells had formed in the chamber, the flux of the liquid through the chamber was increased progressively to push the smallest spores outside the chamber and to collect them in several fractions. The first fractions, which contained much cellular debris, were tested visually under a microscope and were discarded. Then, spore sorting was monitored by measuring the cell volume using a cell analyzer system (CASY). Before elutriation, the cell suspension was heterogeneous in size (between 2.5- and 7.5-μm diameter) and contained, in addition to the spores, undigested tetrads, diads, vegetative cells, and much cellular debris (Fig.1 A). Pooled elutriated spores had a diameter of ∼3 μm (Fig. 1 B), and no cellular debris or other cell type could be observed by light microscopy. Spores were also examined by scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed the excellent size homogeneity of the population and the absence of contaminating vegetative cells (Fig. 1 C). Starting withA 600 nm ∼6,000 cells, we routinely obtainedA 600 nm ∼600 elutriated spores that can still germinate after several months of storage at 4 °C in 0.5% Triton X-100. When we initiated this work, it was commonly assumed that spores were resting cells, all of whose metabolic activities were shut off, awaiting a germination signal to resume their vegetative growth (see, e.g. Refs. 10Rousseau P. Halvorson H.O. Can. J. Microbiol. 1973; 19: 547-555Google Scholar and 42Harper J.F. Clancy M.J. Magee P.T. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 958-965Google Scholar). We decided to determine carefully whether a basal level of metabolic activity could be detected in elutriated spores prepared from strain Y55. Unexpectedly, when incubated at 30 °C either in minimal medium lacking a carbon source or in water, spores were able to incorporate slowly but steadily both uracil and methionine. Incorporation of [3H]uracil for 2 h at 30 °C was about half of the level obtained with vegetative cells labeled for 10 min (Fig.2 A and data not shown). Therefore, transcription activity in spores corresponded to ∼5% of its level in vegetative cells. Then, we examined protein synthesis by measuring [35S]methionine incorporation rates in spores incubated in water for up to 2 h (Fig. 2 B). Incorporation of methionine in spores also corresponded to ∼5% of the incorporation in vegetative cells. Similar results were obtained with spores prepared from an SK1 strain. To visualize the synthesized polypeptides, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were fractionated onto SDS-PAGE, transferred onto membrane, and autoradiographed (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–5). The complex pattern thus obtained revealed that numerous proteins were synthesized in nongerminating spores. Moreover, this pattern is specific for the spore, and it is significantly different from the one obtained with vegetative cells (lane 6). Addition of cycloheximide prevents protein synthesis in vegetative cells (lane 7) but had no effect on spores (data not shown), likely because of the inability of the drug to penetrate the cell wall of nongerminating spores. This last result demonstrates that the translational activity detected in elutriated spores was not caused by contamination by vegetative cells that would have been otherwise inhibited by cycloheximide. We conclude from these results that yeast spores do possess a basal metabolism when placed in water at 30 °C, which corresponds to ∼5% of the metabolism of exponentially growing cells. To characterize mRNA metabolism in spores further, we first identified mRNAs that were present in spores, and we selected abundant ones to facilitate their analysis. PGK1 mRNA metabolism is well characterized because it has been used in numerous mRNA degradation studies, and it was predicted by a transcriptome analysis to be present in late sporulation (15Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Google Scholar). Similarly, SPS100 was originally identified by differential screening as a gene induced in late sporulation (43Law D.T. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 912-922Google Scholar). These two mRNAs turned out to be present in spores, in which they are relatively abundant. Mobilization of mRNA to polysomes reflects their active translational activity (44Perry R.P. Meyuhas O. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 83-92Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of PGK1 and SPS100 mRNA after separation of polysomes from free ribosomes on sucrose gradient. Cellular extracts were fractionated onto linear sucrose gradients, then fractions were tested by Northern blotting to localize the mRNAs and by Western blotting to search for some of the proteins involved in mRNA translation and degradation. Cellular extracts prepared from exponentially growing cells contained large amounts of polysomes, which reflect their high level of translational activity (Fig.3 A). In contrast, cellular extracts from spores contained essentially one type of complex which likely corresponds to 80 S particles. However, they also contained some larger complexes that are likely polysomes (Fig. 3 A). The two mRNAs PGK1 and SPS100 sedimented along with high molecular weight complexes, roughly the size of monosome and small polysome complexes (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, Pab1p and eIF4E, the two proteins that bind the poly(A) tails and the cap structure on the mRNA, were also sedimenting with fractions containing the two mRNAs along with monosomes and polysomes, even though a subset of these proteins was also detected in lighter fractions (Fig.3 C). In addition, the exonuclease Xrn1p cosedimented with the two mRNAs and the polysomes. This distribution is very similar to the one observed in exponentially growing vegetative cells, except that the latter possess a much more prominent level of polysomes because of their higher translation rate. In conclusion, in spores mRNAs are engaged on large structures that are likely monosomes and polysomes. Spores are able to survive for very long periods of time when kept at 4 °C, and the level of endogenous mRNAs is little affected in spores that are several months old (data not shown). We decided to characterize the structure of mRNAs from spores to determine whether it differs from vegetative cells. The global average size of the poly(A) tails was determined by the RNase A protection assay (32Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Google Scholar) and found to be similar in spores and in vegetative cells (data not shown). In addition, more than 90% of PGK1 and SPS100 mRNAs were detected in the polyadenylated fraction after oligo(dT) cellulose fractionation (data not shown). Then, we determined specifically the poly(A) tail length of PGK1 mRNA in spores and found that it is comparable with vegetative cells (Fig.4 A). The structure of the mRNA 5′-end from spores was analyzed by the TAP method (45Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Google Scholar), and the results suggested that mRNA was capped (data not shown). To confirm this observation, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using an antibody raised against the trimethyl cap structure of small nuclear RNAs which also reacts with the monomethyl cap structure of mRNAs (34Bochnig P. Reuter R. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 461-467Google Scholar). We used the trimethyl capped U3 snoRNA as a positive control for immunoprecipitation, and the uncapped scR1 RNA was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 B). From the results of these experiments we conclude that PGK1 and SPS100 mRNAs are mostly capped in spores. Because spores incubated in water were not fed, we expected their metabolic activities to diminish with time. To test this hypothesis, spores were incubated in water at 30 °C, and their ability to incorporate [35S]methionine into proteins was tested at different times. Protein synthesis capacity was reduced to ∼50% after 24 h and to 25% after 3 days, and some activity could still be detected after 3 weeks of incubation at 30 °C (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, spore viability was also reduced after incubation for several weeks at 30 °C; however, this diminishing was delayed compared with the decrease in protein synthesis capacity. Then, we determined whether this reduction in protein synthesis was accompanied by a similar decrease in the mRNA content of spores. Spores were incubated in water at 30 °C, and samples were taken at different times as above. Then, RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using a probe for PGK1. When spores were incubated at 30 °C, PGK1 mRNA was degraded with a half-life of ∼10 h, whereas in spores kept at 4 °C it was still detected after 6 months of storage (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). Elutriated Y55 spores were equilibrated in YEP medium at 30 °C, then glucose was added, and samples were taken at different times. The size of the spores increased very slowly during the 1st h and then more rapidly, until the first buds appeared after 4 h of germination (Fig.6 A). Western blot analysis revealed that synthesis of the two cyclins Clb5 and Cln2, which are required, respectively, for DNA replication and bud emergence, occurs 240 min after inducing germination (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, electron scanning microscopy analysis of hundreds of cells showed that more than 95% of the germinating spores at a given stage have a similar morphology (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that centrifugal elutriation permits selection of spores that are homogeneous in size and germinate with high synchrony until the entry into the S phase. We examined various metabolic activities during synchronous germination of the Y55 spores prepared using the method described above. [3H]Uracil incorporation indicated that RNA synthesis increased within minutes of the addition of glucose until it reached the level of synthesis of vegetative cells after ∼3 h of germination (Fig. 7 A and data not shown). To confirm this observation, we examined directly the synthesis of newly formed molecules. Five different selected mRNAs were clearly accumulated at a high level as early as 15 min after the addition of glucose, as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig.7 B), a result that was in striking contrast to previous studies (13Xu G. West T.P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 786-788Google Scholar). In addition to this class of early induced genes, several other genes accumulated later during germination, as it is the case for PGK1 (see below) and S phase cyclins (data not shown). Protein synthesis during germination was monitored by [35S]methionine incorporation (Fig. 7 C). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto membrane, and autoradiographed (Fig. 7 D). As shown on the figure, mRNA translation started within minutes of the addition of glucose to the spores, and the pattern of newly synthesized"

We examined whether the two phorbol ester-activated PKCs inAplysia, the Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I and the Ca2+-independent PKC Apl II, are associated with these MTs. Phorbol esters translocated PKC to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, and a significant portion of this translocated pool was sensitive to low concentrations of nocodazole. Low doses of nocodazole had no effect on the amount of PKC in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the absence of phorbol esters, whereas higher doses of nocodazole reduced basal levels of PKC Apl II. The F-actin cytoskeletal disrupter, latrunculin A, removed both PKCs from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in both control and phorbol ester-treated nervous systems. PKC Apl II also directly interacted with purified MTs. In detergent-extracted cells, both PKCs immunolocalized predominantly with MTs. PKCs were associated with newly formed MTs invading the actin-rich peripheral growth cone domain after PKC activation. Our results are consistent with a central role for PKCs in regulating MT extension.

Our results are consistent with a central role for PKCs in regulating MT extension. A large amount of research has been directed at how protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; MT, microtubule; P domain, peripheral domain; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; CSB, cytoskeletal stabilization buffer. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; MT, microtubule; P domain, peripheral domain; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; CSB, cytoskeletal stabilization buffer. regulates cytoskeletal plasticity (1Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Google Scholar). Most of this research has focused on the actin cytoskeleton because PKCs bind directly to actin filaments (2Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Google Scholar, 3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 4Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Google Scholar) and a number of important actin regulatory proteins have been shown to be controlled by PKC phosphorylation (5Matsuoka Y., Li, X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Google Scholar, 6Allen L.A. Aderem A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1109-1120Google Scholar, 7Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Google Scholar). In contrast, roles for PKC in regulating microtubule (MT) function have not been extensively characterized. We recently reported an interesting and potentially important new role for PKC in regulating MT dynamics inAplysia growth cones (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). The growth cone is divided into three domains, a central domain rich in MTs, a transition zone, and a peripheral domain (P domain) rich in filamentous actin. Axonal MTs have a (+)-end distal orientation and undergo bouts of (+)-end assembly, which tend to drive them into the P domain against retrograde F-actin flow. The density of MTs in the P domain appears to be maintained at relatively low levels because they are continually transported rearward via coupling to retrograde F-actin flow (9Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 417-434Google Scholar, 10Forscher P. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1505-1516Google Scholar). We recently reported that, after PKC activation, MTs tend to advance into the P domain because their average MT growth rates increase to exceed retrograde F-actin flow rates (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). The extension of MTs into the P domain may be important in axon extension, guidance, and/or delivery of important molecules to the plasma membrane (11Strong J.A. Fox A.P. Tsien R.W. Kaczmarek L.K. Nature. 1987; 325: 714-717Google Scholar, 12Knox R.J. Quattrocki E.A. Connor J.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1992; 8: 883-889Google Scholar, 13Rosner H. Fischer H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 219: 175-178Google Scholar). Examination of PKC action is simplified in the Aplysianervous system, as there are only two phorbol ester-activated PKCs, the Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I (homologous to PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ in vertebrates) and the Ca2+-independent PKC Apl II (homologous to PKCε and PKCη in vertebrates) (14Kruger K.E. Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Bergold P.J. Beushausen S. Schwartz J.H. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2303-2313Google Scholar, 15Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Google Scholar). Both isoforms of PKC co-assemble with actin in vitro, and this is enhanced by phorbol esters and by inhibitors of PKC phosphorylation (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). Using immunocytochemistry, PKC Apl II was localized to actin cables in the growth cone (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). Both PKCs also translocated to a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction by phorbol esters, and this was initially assumed to represent the actin cytoskeleton (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). However, given our recent report of PKC regulation of MT dynamics, we have further investigated the cytoskeletal pools with which PKC associates in neurons. We have also examined the distribution of PKC on MTs before and after PKC activation, using different cell extraction protocols that retain native associations of PKC with the cytoskeleton. We show that, upon activation by phorbol esters, both isoforms of PKC rapidly translocate onto newly assembled MTs, suggesting a direct role for PKC in regulating distal MT advance in neuronal growth cones. A. californica (50–200 g) were purchased from Marine Specimens Unlimited (Pacific Palisades, CA) or the Aplysia resource facility at the University of Miami and kept in an aquarium for at least 3 days before experimentation. The animals were first placed in a bath of isotonic MgCl2/artificial seawater (1:1, v/v) and then anesthetized by injection of isotonic MgCl2. The ganglia were dissected from the animals and trimmed of connective tissue in ice-cold dissecting medium (230 mm NaCl, 220 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2× low methionine amino acid mixture, 0.2× minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.5× minimal essential medium vitamin solution, 0.1 mm glutamine, and 0.1% glucose, final pH 7.8). PKC was obtained for these experiments from the cytosol of Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus encoding PKC Apl I or Apl II as described (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). Purified bovine brain tubulin (10 mg/ml; ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) was stored in 80 mm PIPES (sesquisodium salt), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 10% glycerol, pH 6.8, at −70 °C. Varying amounts of tubulin from the above stock solution were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of reassembly buffer (0.1 M MES, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mmGTP and 10% glycerol (RGG buffer) plus 10 μg/ml Taxol (Sigma) for some experiments. These samples were then further diluted in RGG buffer to obtain the desired concentration of microtubules. Finally, the samples were incubated in 1 μm 4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; the PKC activator) or 1 μm4α-PDBu (the inactive analog of the phorbol ester) in RGG buffer with 10 μl of Sf9 cell cytosolic fraction expressing PKC Apl I or Apl II for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 94,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. Supernatants were removed and added to 20 μl of sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Following resuspension of the pellets, samples were loaded onto a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In Aplysia, most ganglia are symmetrically paired on either side of the animal. In all experiments, the ganglion on one side of the animal was used as a control for the corresponding one on the other side. The ganglia were desheathed to facilitate penetration of phorbol ester and transferred to resting medium (the same as dissecting medium, but with 460 mm NaCl, 11 mm CaCl2, and 55 mm MgCl2). The ganglia were incubated in either drug solution (300 nm nocodazole (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and/or 5 μm latrunculin A (Molecular Probes, Inc.)) or vehicle in resting medium containing 10 mmglutamine and 0.1% glucose. Subsequently, phorbol esters were added to both samples to a final concentration of 1 μm 4β-PDBu to examine PKC translocation or 1 μm 4α-PDBu (inactive isomer) to examine basal PKC levels. Ganglia were incubated for 1 h at 15 °C; this leads to maximum translocation of PKC (16Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 210-218Google Scholar). The ganglia were then washed twice and homogenized in 120 μl of cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 0.1 mm leupeptide). The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 800 × g to remove any unhomogenized debris. A sample (10 μl) from each condition was removed for analysis of total protein concentration. The remaining homogenates (100 μl) were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. Supernatants (S1) were extracted; a small sample was put aside for analysis of the protein concentration; and the remaining 80 μl was added to 20 μl of sample buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in homogenization buffer. The tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Supernatants (S2, Triton X-100-soluble) were removed and added to 20 μl of sample buffer. The pellets (P, Triton X-100-insoluble) were resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer. Equal protein amounts (S1 lanes containing 10 μg of protein and S2 and P lanes containing the maximum amount to allow equal loading) from control and experimental samples were loaded onto 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Blotting and probing with antibodies to PKCs Apl I and Apl II were as described (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with antibody to actin (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) or tubulin (Sigma). Immunoblots were scanned, and analysis was performed using the NIH Image program. 2Available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. We calibrated our data with the uncalibrated OD feature of NIH Image, which transforms the data using the formula y = log 10(255/(255 − x), where x is the pixel value (0–254). Control experiments demonstrated that, after this calibration, values were linear with respect to the amount of protein over a wide range of values (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). First, the percentage of protein in each of the compartments (supernatant, Triton X-100-soluble, and Triton X-100-insoluble) was calculated. The percentage change in this value with nocodazole and/or latrunculin A was then calculated between the paired ganglia. Statistical tests were paired t tests between control and experimental ganglia. Bag cell neurons were cultured and treated with drugs as previously described (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). Cells were chemically fixed as described previously (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar) with 3.7% formaldehyde in resting medium, or alternatively, live cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 before fixation as follows. Cells were washed with Ca2+-free low ionic strength resting medium (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 15 mm HEPES, and 60 g/liter glycine, pH 7.9) containing 5 mm EGTA for 2 min. They were then extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (CSB) containing 80 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm Taxol, 1 μm Alexa 594-phalloidin plus 4% polyethylene glycol (M r 35,000) for 1 min. After washing with CSB, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in CSB. After fixation, both groups were triple-labeled for F-actin, MTs, and PKCs. For MTs and PKCs, a monoclonal antibody (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar) and polyclonal antibodies (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 15Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Google Scholar) were used as described previously, respectively. These antibodies recognize single bands on immunoblots and specifically recognize PKCs in immunocytochemistry (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 15Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Google Scholar). Alexa 594-phalloidin was used for F-actin, and Alexa 350-labeled goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used for MTs and PKCs, respectively (Alexa-labeled reagents were from Molecular Probes, Inc.). Triple-labeled samples were imaged with a Coolsnap HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and MetaMorph control software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Controls demonstrated no bleed-through between channels. Phorbol esters translocate PKC to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the nervous system (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). Phorbol esters also increase the amount of tubulin that sediments after ganglia are extracted in buffers that stabilize MTs (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the extended MTs seen in growth cones and the increased tubulin sedimented in the presence of phorbol esters are sensitive to low concentrations (10–100 nm) of nocodazole (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). These low concentrations of nocodazole primarily damp MT dynamics, having insignificant effects on cellular MT mass (17Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 252-276Google Scholar, 18Rochlin M.W. Wickline K.M. Bridgman P.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3236-3246Google Scholar) or the amount of tubulin sedimented in the absence of phorbol esters (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). We thus examined whether low concentrations of nocodazole could reverse phorbol ester-mediated translocation of PKCs to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Paired ganglia were treated with either the active or inactive phorbol ester in the presence or absence of 300 nmnocodazole. Nocodazole had no effect on the amount of either PKC in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction when the inactive phorbol ester was used (Fig. 1 A; quantitated in Fig. 1 B). In contrast, when added in the presence of the active phorbol ester, 300 nm nocodazole significantly decreased the amount of both PKCs Apl I and Apl II in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and increased the amount of both PKCs in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1 A; quantitated in Fig.1 B). In the presence of phorbol esters, nocodazole also decreased the amount of tubulin found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, but nocodazole had no effect on the amount of tubulin in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the absence of phorbol esters (Fig. 1 A; quantitated in Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that PKCs are translocated to a dynamic population of MTs by phorbol ester treatment. Nocodazole did not affect the amount of PKC found in the Triton X-100-soluble pellet either before or after phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 1 A; quantitated in Fig. 1 B). The phorbol ester-mediated translocation of PKCs to the Triton X-100-soluble pellet (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 16Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 210-218Google Scholar) is presumably to either plasma membrane or internal membranes and would not be expected to be sensitive to disruption of the cytoskeleton. We have previously shown that both Aplysia PKCs co-sediment with actin filaments in a phorbol ester-dependent manner (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). To further characterize possible PKC-actin filament interactions, we examined the effect of latrunculin A, a sponge toxin that effectively and specifically disrupts actin filaments (19Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Google Scholar), on the amount of PKC translocated to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Paired ganglia were treated with either the active or inactive control phorbol ester in the presence or absence of 5 μm latrunculin A. Latrunculin A decreased the level of PKCs Apl I and Apl II in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction both in the presence and absence of phorbol esters (Fig.2 A; quantitated in Fig.2 B). There was a concomitant decrease in the amount of actin in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2 A; quantitated in Fig. 2 B). This decrease is comparable to the amount of actin released from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in other preparations (20Minamide L.S. Painter W.B. Schevzov G. Gunning P. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8303-8309Google Scholar, 21Bershadsky A.D. Gluck U. Denisenko O.N. Sklyarova T.V. Spector I. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1183-1193Google Scholar). Latrunculin A did not cause a significant change in the amount of PKC found in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction either in the presence or absence of phorbol esters (Fig.2 A; quantitated in Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that a significant fraction of the PKC that is Triton X-100-insoluble is sensitive to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. To demonstrate that the effects of nocodazole and latrunculin A were on different pools of PKC, we tested whether nocodazole or latrunculin A effects persisted in the presence of the other drug. Paired ganglia were treated with phorbol esters plus 300 nm nocodazole in the presence or absence of 5 μm latrunculin A or, alternatively, with phorbol esters plus 5 μm latrunculin A in the presence or absence of 300 nm nocodazole. We found that the actions of the two cytoskeletal disrupters were independent of one another. Both decreased the percentage of PKCs found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction even in the presence of the other inhibitor (Fig. 3, A and B; quantitated in Fig. 3 C). Indeed, the changes appear to be a bit larger as expected if the effects were independent (i.e. nocodazole removed a higher percentage of the Triton X-100-insoluble PKC, as the actin-associated PKC was no longer present because of the addition of latrunculin A to both control and experimental samples). Thus, there appear to be two separate pools of cytoskeleton-associated PKCs, one associated with actin filaments and one associated with microtubules. These experiments allowed us to approximate the percentage of PKC that is Triton X-100-insoluble and sensitive to cytoskeletal disrupters. Under basal conditions, 18 ± 5% of PKC Apl II (n= 8) and 17 ± 3% of PKC Apl I (n = 8) were associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Some of this kinase was sensitive to disruption of the cytoskeleton because, in the presence of both nocodazole and latrunculin, there was less PKC (9 ± 1% of PKC Apl II (n = 4) and 10 ± 2% of PKC Apl I (n = 4)). In the presence of phorbol esters, 31 ± 4% of PKC Apl II (n = 11) and 39 ± 6% of PKC Apl I (n = 11) were associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, significantly greater amounts than seen in the absence of phorbol esters. This increase in the percentage of PKC associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction is consistent with our earlier results demonstrating translocation of PKCs to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). A large amount of the PKC translocated to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction after phorbol ester treatment was sensitive to cytoskeletal inhibitors because, in the presence of both nocodazole and latrunculin, only 14 ± 5% of PKC Apl II (n = 4) and 17 ± 6% of PKC Apl I (n = 4) remained Triton X-100-insoluble. These results suggest that the cytoskeleton is a major site for PKC translocation inAplysia neurons. We next determined whether the PKCs could co-sediment with purified MTs. PKCs were expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus (22Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Google Scholar), and the cytosol from Sf9 cells was incubated with purified tubulin. Tubulin was then polymerized and sedimented, and co-sedimentation of PKCs was measured. Interestingly, PKC Apl II, but not PKC Apl I, exhibited significant association with MTs (Fig. 4,A and B). This association was not significantly enhanced by phorbol esters (Fig. 4 B). The constitutive binding of PKC Apl II to tubulin suggested that PKC Apl II might be present on MTs even in the absence of phorbol esters. To test this, we treated ganglia with high concentrations of nocodazole for a prolonged period (6 h) in the absence of phorbol esters. Control ganglia were treated with vehicle only. High concentrations of nocodazole largely removed tubulin from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, consistent with gross disruption of MTs in the cells (Fig.5). This treatment also reduced the basal levels of PKC Apl II, but not those of PKC Apl I, in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PKC Apl II is associated with microtubules even in the absence of phorbol esters.Figure 5Basal binding of PKC Apl II to MTs in ganglia. A, paired ganglia were treated with vehicle (−) or 50 μm nocodazole (+) for 6 h and treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, the percentage of PKC Apl I or Apl II or tubulin in the Triton X-100 (TX-100)-insoluble fraction was calculated and used to calculate the percentage change between control and nocodazole-treated paired ganglia. There was a significant effect of nocodazole on PKC Apl II (p < 0.05; n = 6) and tubulin (p < 0.01; n = 5), but no specific change for PKC Apl I (p > 0.1; n = 6).Error bars indicate S.E. Sup, supernatant fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain additional evidence for PKC-MT interactions, we examined the immunocytochemical localization of both PKCs in bag cell neuron growth cones, where microtubules are easily identified. Cells were pretreated with 1 μm PDBu or 10 μm Gö 6976 to activate or inhibit PKC activity, respectively; fixed; extracted with 1% Triton X-100; and triple-labeled for PKC Apl II, MTs, and actin filaments (Fig. 6) (data not shown). Under these conditions, PKC-dependent MT advance and some perturbation of P domain F-actin structure were observed as previously reported (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar); however, we were unable to visualize a clear localization of either PKC Apl I (data not shown) or Apl II with MTs under these conditions. Some co-localization of PKC Apl II with F-actin in the P domain was observed, and this appeared to be more pronounced in the presence of the PKC inhibitor, which tended to increase the levels of peripheral F-actin and Apl II (Fig. 6, compare A and D versus C and F). These findings are in accord with our previous biochemical data suggesting that the association of PKC with F-actin is decreased by kinase activity (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). The inability to clearly visualize PKC-MT co-localization in fixed tissues could be due to interference from a large pool of cytosolic or membrane-associated PKC. To enhance our ability to visualize the PKC-MT interaction, we first extracted live cells with 1% Triton X-100 in CSB containing phalloidin and Taxol to preserve actin filament and MT integrity. Then, after extraction, cells were washed to dissociate non-cytoskeleton-associated proteins; fixed; and triple-labeled for F-actin, MTs, and both PKCs. In cells pretreated with 1 μm PDBu, co-localization of both PKCs with MTs was revealed (Fig. 7). Note the presence of PKC immunoreactivity outside the growth cone perimeter, resulting from diffusion of soluble protein during the live cell extraction procedure (Fig. 7, C and F). The extracted protein may appear in clumps due to binding to polylysine (23Schliwa M. van Blerkom J. Porter K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4329-4333Google Scholar). The PKC co-localization with MTs appears to be specific because very little PKC was associated with the residual F-actin cytoskeleton under these conditions. Note also that MTs in the proximal axon shaft as well as those invading the distal P domain were associated with PKCs Apl I and Apl II. To test whether this PKC-MT association requires kinase activity, cells were pretreated with Gö 6976 and triple-labeled for F-actin, MTs, and PKCs. PKC Apl I and Apl II localization to MTs persisted in the presence of the PKC inhibitor (Fig. 8). Thus, phorbol ester activation does not appear to be a prerequisite for PKC association with MTs in the growth cone. One important result from this study is that actin, tubulin, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins are major anchoring proteins for PKC in Aplysia neurons. Although our immunocytochemical experiments were restricted to growth cones, these structures make up only a small fraction of the material used for biochemistry; and thus, the cytoskeleton is presumably an important target for PKC throughout neurons. PKCs bind directly to actin and to many components of the actin cytoskeleton (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 24Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). The targets for PKC binding to MTs have not been identified. Although only PKC Apl II interacted with purified MTs significantly in vitro, the localization of PKCs Apl I and Apl II did not appear to differ significantly in growth cones. The lack of PKC Apl I movement from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction with high concentrations of nocodazole also suggests that PKCs Apl I and Apl II target to MTs with different mechanisms. PKCs have been associated with microtubules in other preparations as well (25Hosotani T. Koyama H. Uchino M. Miyakawa T. Tsuchiya E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 775-788Google Scholar, 26Szalay J. Bruno P. Bhati R. Adjodha J. Schueler D. Summerville V. Vazeos R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 49-66Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Rocha M. Avila J. Lozano J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 1-8Google Scholar). In particular, PKCβ was shown to associate with microtubules both in T-cells (28Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495Google Scholar) and in U937 cells (29Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 231-242Google Scholar). This association is important for cell motility in T-cells (30Volkov Y. Long A. McGrath S., Ni Eidhin D. Kelleher D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 508-514Google Scholar). Similar to our results with the Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I, interactions of the Ca2+-activated PKCβII with tubulin in U937 cells were shown to be indirect (31Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016Google Scholar). We have shown that phorbol esters translocated both PKCs Apl I and Apl II to the Triton X-100-insoluble pool and that this was partly reversed by low concentrations of nocodazole. One explanation for this result is that PKC constitutively associates with MTs. Phorbol ester activation of PKC present on MTs may result in phosphorylation of a protein important in promoting MT (+)-end assembly (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). Increased MT mass after phorbol ester treatment would lead to an increase in the number of sites for PKC binding and thus increased levels of MT-bound PKC. Nocodazole blocks new MT assembly and thus prevents generation of substrate for PKC translocation. This is consistent with the immunocytochemical results in extracted neurons showing that both PKCs are associated constitutively with MTs along their entire observable lengths. Note that there does not appear to be preferential PKC binding near MT (+)-ends that extend distally into the P domain (Fig. 7), suggesting that PKC does not bind preferentially to newly synthesized (nocodazole-sensitive) MTs (8Kabir N. Schaefer A.W. Nkhost A. Sossin W.S. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1033-1043Google Scholar). Indeed, the percentage increase in the level of MTs mirrors the percentage increase in PKCs in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Our results with latrunculin A show that a sizable fraction of each PKC isoform was associated with the actin cytoskeleton both before and after phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 2). PKCs bind to purified actin in a phorbol ester-dependent manner (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). However, inhibitors of PKC reduce interactions of PKC with actin (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar), suggesting that the translocation to actin may be transient and thus difficult to see in steady-state experiments. When growth cones were fixed and then extracted and labeled, PKC Apl II appeared to be mainly cytosolic, with some concentration in puncta. This punctate labeling in the F-actin-rich P domain tended to increase after PKC inhibition (Fig.6 F), consistent with our previous findings (3Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Google Scholar). However, under these conditions, localization to MTs was not readily apparent. In contrast, we found that live cell extraction in CSB revealed clear PKC Apl I and Apl II interactions with MTs, both after PKC activation (Fig. 7) and in the presence of PKC inhibitors (Fig. 8). These results suggest that PKCs Apl I and Apl II associate constitutively with MTs and that this localization does not depend critically on the enzymatic activity of PKC. PKC-MT interactions in the P domain were not apparent under normal fixation conditions probably because of relatively high levels of cytosolic and membrane-associated PKC labeling. We cannot rule out the possibility that the observed PKC-MT interactions result from removal of cytosolic factors that normally inhibit PKC-MT interactions. These issues may be resolved by direct visualization of green fluorescent protein-PKC dynamics in living cells in future studies. With that said, it is important to emphasize that the relocalization of PKC and MTs in Figs. 7 and 8 is not MT signal bleed-through, as it was observed in preparations labeled for PKC alone (data not shown). MT labeling in the live cell-extracted growth cones also appears to be specific, as there was essentially no PKC localization to the robust F-actin structures present in Figs. 7 and 8. These findings suggest that much of the PKC normally associated with F-actin structures in growth cones fixed before extraction (Fig. 6) is labile and associated with the Triton X-100-sensitive membrane-actin cytoskeletal interface. Indeed, there is a pool of Triton X-100-soluble actin in Aplysia growth cones (32Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Google Scholar). In contrast, latrunculin-sensitive PKC-actin interactions in the biochemical experiments involved Triton X-100-insoluble actin. This pool of PKC bound to actin is either not enriched in growth cones or sensitive in some other manner to the conditions used for extraction and fixation. PKC activation by phorbol esters stimulates distal MT advance in the growth cone. It is likely that the association of PKC with MTs is important for this ability. In addition, PKCs are associated with more proximal and stable MTs in the central domain. Kinases are often anchored near their substrates, and this anchoring is often critical for efficient signal transduction (33Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar, 34Sim A.T. Scott J.D. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 209-217Google Scholar, 35Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Google Scholar). The large percentage of PKCs associated with microtubules and actin filaments in neurons suggests that the cytoskeleton is one of the major targets of PKC action in these cells. In the future, it will be important to understand how the activity of PKC on microtubules is regulated under physiological conditions to regulate neuronal outgrowth, delivery of materials, and growth cone guidance.

https://openalex.org/W2017007375,"Hydrolysis of the tail phosphotyrosine in Src family members is catalyzed by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45, activating Src family-related signaling pathways. Using purified recombinant phospho-Src (P-Src) (amino acid residues 83–533) and purified recombinant CD45 catalytic (cytoplasmic) domain (amino acid residues 565–1268), we have analyzed the kinetic behavior of dephosphorylation. A time course of phosphatase activity showed the presence of a burst phase. By varying the concentration of P-Src, it was shown that the amplitude of this burst phase increased linearly with respect to P-Src concentration. Approximately 2% of P-Src was shown to be rapidly dephosphorylated followed by a slower linear phase. A P-Src protein substrate containing a functional point mutation in the Src homology domain 2 (SH2) led to more rapid dephosphorylation catalyzed by CD45, and this reaction showed only a single linear kinetic phase. These results were interpreted in terms of a model in which P-Src exists in a relatively slow dynamic equilibrium between “closed” and “open” conformational forms. Combined mutations in the SH2 and SH3 domain or the addition of an SH3 domain ligand peptide enhanced the accessibility of P-Src to CD45 by biasing P-Src to a more open form. Consistent with this model, a phosphotyrosine peptide that behaved as an SH2 domain binding ligand showed ∼100-fold greater affinity for unphosphorylated Srcversus P-Src. Surprisingly, P-Src possessing combined SH3 and SH2 functional inactivating point mutations was dephosphorylated by CD45 more slowly compared with P-Src completely lacking SH3 and SH2 domains. Additional data suggest that the SH3 and SH2 domains can inhibit accessibility of the P-Src tail to CD45 by interactions other than direct phosphotyrosine binding by the SH2 domain. Taken together, these results suggest how activation of Src family member signaling pathways by CD45 may be influenced by the presence or absence of ligand interactions remote from the tail.

Taken together, these results suggest how activation of Src family member signaling pathways by CD45 may be influenced by the presence or absence of ligand interactions remote from the tail. The interplay between protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases regulates critical cellular processes (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Google Scholar, 2Blume-Jensen P Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Google Scholar, 3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Google Scholar). One of the few well established examples of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase phosphoprotein enzyme-substrate relationship in cell signaling is that of CD45 and Src. The CD45 tyrosine phosphatase participates in the catalytic removal of the tail phosphotyrosine from the Src protein-tyrosine kinases (4Hermiston M.L., Xu, Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Google Scholar, 5Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar, 6Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 247-252Google Scholar). Src kinases are maintained in a catalytically quiescent state by the presence of a tail phosphotyrosine that is introduced by the action of the protein-tyrosine kinase Csk (7Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Google Scholar, 8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Google Scholar). The CD45-catalyzed tail dephosphorylation reaction involving phosphorylated Lck, Fyn, and perhaps other Src kinase family members is responsible for the stimulation of their tyrosine kinase activities. In the case of Lck, this catalytic stimulation results in T cell differentiation and activation (4Hermiston M.L., Xu, Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Google Scholar, 5Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar, 6Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 247-252Google Scholar). CD45 is a receptor-tyrosine phosphatase protein with an extracellular domain of unclear function and two intracellular domains, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase catalytic (D1) and pseudocatalytic (D2) domain that appear to collaboratively effect dephosphorylation (4Hermiston M.L., Xu, Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Google Scholar, 5Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar, 6Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Google Scholar). The D1/D2 tandem is necessary and sufficient in vivo for tail dephosphorylation of Src family members. The nine Src family members are composed of a weakly conserved N-terminal membrane docking domain and three highly conserved modules: an SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology domain 3; SH2, Src homology domain 2; BP, binding peptide; DTT, dithiothreitol; P-Src, phospho-Src; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. domain, an SH2 domain, a catalytic domain, and a phosphorylatable tyrosine-containing tail. Upon tail phosphorylation, Src adopts an intricate three-dimensional fold in which the SH3 domain interacts intramolecularly with the SH2 catalytic domain linker, and the SH2 domain binds to the tail phosphotyrosine (7Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Google Scholar, 8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Google Scholar). Because the phosphotyrosine moiety appears to be buried in a pocket in the SH2 domain, it is difficult to understand how CD45 might gain access to the tail to remove its phosphate. Although the recombinant CD45 intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains have been prepared and studied as catalysts with phosphotyrosine peptide substrates (12Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 977-984Google Scholar, 13Cho H. Ramer S.E. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Burn P. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 133-138Google Scholar), there has not yet been reported a detailed analysis of CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Src phosphoproteins in a purified system. To gain greater understanding of the molecular basis of CD45 recognition of a phosphoprotein substrate, we undertook a kinetic analysis of the dephosphorylation of tail-phosphorylated Src (P-Src) and report the results here. Hepes, Tris, DTT, ATP, bovine serum albumin, sodium vanadate, Triton X-100, and activated charcoal were obtained from Sigma; imidazole, MnCl2, and EDTA were purchased from Fisher. The [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All Fmoc amino acid derivatives and resins were obtained from Novabiochem. The 5 (and 6)-carboxy-X-rhodamine succinimidyl ester and EnzChekTM phosphate assay kit were purchased from Molecular Probes. Cytoplasmic domain CD45 and Csk were prepared exactly as reported previously (14Wang Y. Guo W. Liang L. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7454-7461Google Scholar, 15Grace M.R. Walsh C.T. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1874-1881Google Scholar). The pET expression plasmid encoding kinase-inactive Src (amino acids 83–533; K295M) (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar) was used to generate the plasmids encoding point mutations in the SH3 domain (W118V; src-3), SH2 domain (R174A; src-2), and the double mutant (W118V/R174A; src-23) using the QuikChange method (Stratagene), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frames. The expression plasmid encoding the catalytic domain of kinase-inactive Src (amino acid 260–533; K295M; src-cat) was as prepared previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). Src proteins were prepared from these vectors by expression inEscherichia coli, along with the chaperones GroES and GroEL as described previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). Each of these proteins, which contained N-terminal His tags, was purified by chromatography over a Zn-chelating column as reported previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 2–4 mg/ml (determined by Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar)) and stored in buffer at −80 °C. Protein purities estimated by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue were >80%. The coding region for amino acid residues 83–259 (containing an R174A mutation) of the chickenc-src gene was subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI andXhoI sites on the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin as described previously (18Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Google Scholar). Removal of the GST tag from the fusion protein was achieved on-resin by treatment with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, the cell lysate (obtained from 1 liter ofE. coli culture) containing GST fusion protein was immobilized on 0.2 g of glutathione-agarose resin suspended in 2 ml of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) and treated with 30 units of PreScission protease overnight at 4 °C. The cleavage reaction mixture was further purified by chromatography over a MonoS (HR5/5) ion exchange column. The resultant protein (∼70% pure by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue) was concentrated to 1.6 mg/ml (determined by Bradford protein assay) and stored at −80 °C. The molecular weight of the recombinant protein fragment was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis. The phosphotyrosine-containing peptide (pY542) NH2-CEpYTNIKYSLADQTSGD-CO2H was prepared as described previously (19Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Google Scholar). The SH3 domain binding peptide (SH3BP) AcNH2-VSLARRPLPPLP-CONH2 (20Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Google Scholar) and the rhodamine-tagged, phosphotyrosine-containing peptide (Rhod-SH2BP) Ac-PQpYEEIPIGGGK(Rhod)-NH2 were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc strategy on a 0.1-mmol scale. For Rhod-SH2BP synthesis, phosphotyrosine was introduced in the phosphate-unprotected form. Orthogonal protection of the ε-NH2 group of the C-terminal Lys residue with Dde (dimethyldioxocyclohexylidene) allowed direct attachment of rhodamine (activated as a succinimide ester) before the final cleavage step (21Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6705-6710Google Scholar). Peptides were cleaved and deblocked using Reagent K (10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.75 g of phenol, 0.5 ml of thioanisole, 0.25 ml of ethanedithiol, 0.5 ml of water) and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a water:acetonitrile:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid gradient. Correct peptide structures were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Purified recombinant proteins were phosphorylated at Tyr-527 by Csk. General reactions were performed in a volume of 0.5 ml at 30 °C and pH 7.4 with 15–30 μm Src protein or Src mutants (see Fig. 1), 30 nm Csk, 2 mmMnCl2, 60 μm ATP (0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 60 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm Na-Hepes, 10 mm DTT, 60 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min in a 1.5-ml plastic (Eppendorf) tube. Phosphorylated proteins were purified by chromatography on a Zn-chelating column as described previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar) and were then dialyzed against phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm DTT). The proteins were concentrated by Centricon ultrafiltration (Millipore), and the concentration was determined by Bradford protein analysis. Stoichiometry of Src protein phosphorylation was determined to be >90% by radioactive counting. Less than 5% phosphorylation of the Src Y527F protein in the presence of Csk was observed indicating a specific labeling on the tail tyrosine residue Tyr-527 of the above proteins. Dephosphorylation activity was measured based on the release of inorganic phosphate. Reactions were performed in a volume of 0.03 ml at 25 °C and pH 7.5 with 0.5–100 μmphosphorylated Src or mutants, 0.5–60 nm CD45, 25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT in a 0.6-ml plastic (Eppendorf) tube. Reactions were initiated with CD45 and aliquots (3–8 μl) of reaction mixture at fixed time points (up to 15 min) and were quenched with 400 μl of acidic 5% activated charcoal suspension, followed by immediate vortexing. The quenched mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 2000 × g, and 200 μl of the supernatant was then removed and transferred to 9 ml of scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was then measured by scintillation counting. Dephosphorylation of P-Src and mutants was shown to occur linearly with respect to CD45 concentration in the ranges used and linearly with respect to time up to ≥20 min (except for those reactions showing a burst phase; see below). The assay was further validated by demonstrating that excess CD45 could completely (>95%) dephosphorylate P-Src. The effectiveness of the quench was established by showing that no further phosphate release occurred after vortexing with activated charcoal. All assays were performed at least twice, and duplicates typically agreed within 20%. In all cases, reaction of the limiting substrate did not exceed 10%. Time course data were fitted either to a single-phase linear model or a two-phase kinetic model containing a first-order “burst phase” followed by a first-order steady-state phase (22Ghose C. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5894-5898Google Scholar), shown in Equation 1, P=A(1−e−kt)+vtEquation 1 where P is product formation, A is burst amplitude, kis burst rate constant, v is steady-state rate, and t is time. The steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained from fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a non-linear curve-fitting approach as described previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). Partial dephosphorylation of P-Src was catalyzed by CD45 in a reaction with 10 μm P-Src, 30 nm CD45 at 25 °C for 4 min. The reaction was then quenched with 0.7 mm sodium vanadate. Under these conditions, it was estimated that ∼3% of the P-Src was hydrolyzed. The reaction mixture was loaded on to a 0.5-ml Zn-chelating column and purified as reported previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). This purified partially dephosphorylated P-Src (2 μm) was subsequently tested as a CD45 substrate as described above. To assess the interaction of CD45 and SH3-SH2 domain of Src, EnzChekTM phosphate assays with a short phosphopeptide substrate were performed as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes) based on the method of Webb (23Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Google Scholar). In brief, reactions were performed with 1 nm CD45, 1–8 μm SH3-SH2–2, 25 μm pY542 peptide, 12 μl MESG (2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine riboside), 0.6 μl of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 3 μl of 20× reaction buffer (400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 1 m NaCl) in a 60-μl reaction volume in a cuvette at 25 °C and quantitatively monitored by UV absorbance change at 360 nm. The reaction velocities were calculated based on the release of inorganic phosphate versus time. Control experiments showed no apparent change in CD45 activity with further increases of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and that the phosphatase activity was linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration in this range. Furthermore, the concentration of peptide substrate used was well below its K m in this system. To measure the dissociation constants (K D) for binding of a SH2 domain binding peptide to the phosphorylated P-Src and non-phosphorylated Src-Y527F proteins, titration reactions were conducted by titrating fixed concentrations (1 μm) of Rhod-SH2BP peptide with increasing amounts of the protein (0–90 μm) on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer using a 3-mm-square cuvette (24Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42347-42354Google Scholar). The emission spectra were collected over the wavelength range of 595 to 700 nm with an excitation wavelength of 574 nm. All measurements were performed in 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl at 25 °C. The fluorescence intensity (F) at 605 nm was plotted against protein concentration to obtain the K D from Equations 2 and 3, shown below, after the background fluorescence of protein was subtracted from each spectrum (F o and F f are the initial and final fluorescence intensities, respectively). F=F0−{(F0−Ff)[Peptide]tot/2}{b−(b2−4[Protein]tot[Peptide]tot)1/2}Equation 2 b=KD+[Protein]tot+[Peptide]totEquation 3 Recombinant human Src (83–533) was overproduced and purified from E. coli as described previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar) and phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP to near completion with recombinant Csk to generate P-Src (Fig.1). A kinase-defective mutant of Src was employed to aid in Src expression (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously (16Wang D. Huang X.-Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 200-2010Google Scholar,18Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Google Scholar, 25Wang D. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8883-8887Google Scholar), Csk is extremely selective for the C-terminal tyrosine of Src family members, which, in part, was confirmed here by demonstrating the lack of phosphorylation of the Y527F mutant. Specific radioactivity of labeled P-Src obtained in this manner suggested 95–100% labeling. The protein was purified away from residual ATP and Csk by affinity chromatography and subjected to CD45 dephosphorylation, and the inorganic phosphate generation was monitored by partitioning with activated charcoal. In a time course of dephosphorylation of P-Src, a burst phase of inorganic phosphate release was observed reproducibly followed by a slower phase of phosphate generation (Fig.2). These data were nicely fit by a burst phase kinetic model with two first-order rate constants,k burst = 0.8 min−1, andk steady-state = 0.1 min−1, and burst amplitude = 59 nm. In initial experiments, it was considered that this burst phase might be because of the initial single turnover by the enzyme (22Ghose C. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5894-5898Google Scholar), in part, because the burst amplitude (40–60 nm) was somewhat similar to the concentration of CD45 present (30 nm determined by Bradford assay). However, a plot of the time course as a function of different CD45 concentrations failed to show a significant change in the amplitude of the burst phase (data not shown). In contrast, the amplitude of the burst phase increased linearly with increasing P-Src concentration over a fairly wide range (Fig.3). The slope of a plot of burst amplitude versus P-Src concentration (Fig. 3 B) was ∼0.02, suggesting that 2% of the P-Src was reacting with a relatively rapid rate constant and 98% with a somewhat slower value.Figure 3CD45 dephosphorylation of P-Src.A, multiple time courses of the hydrolysis of P-Src at various P-Src concentrations. ×, 1 μm; ▵, 2 μm; ▴, 4 μm; ■, 10 μm; ▪, 15 μm; ○, 20 μm; ●, 30 μm. [CD45] = 30 nm, 25 °C. Each plot was fit to the burst phase equation described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, plot of burst amplitude versus[P-Src]. Data was obtained from the burst equation fit from the data in Fig. 3A. The data was fit to a linear equation and gave a slope of 0.02.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two possibilities were considered for the above behavior. In the first, two stable and presumably covalently different forms of P-Src were present, perhaps because of oxidation or proteolysis of a minor amount of protein. A second possibility was that there are two forms of interconverting P-Src in an established equilibrium. In either case, the burst phase would be because of the minor component, which is a more efficiently processed substrate. To distinguish between these models, the P-Src protein was treated with CD45 until ∼3% of the P-Src was hydrolyzed and then quenched with vanadate. Theoretically, this should be sufficient to remove the minor component, estimated to be 2% as stated above. The quenched reaction mixture was eluted over a Zn chelate column to remove the CD45. After dialysis to remove vanadate, the pre-hydrolyzed P-Src was again exposed to CD45, and the time course of product formation was recorded. The time course with this pre-hydrolyzed P-Src (Fig. 2 B) was essentially identical to untreated P-Src (Fig. 2 A) arguing in favor of the model of interconverting forms of P-Src and against the concept that irreversible covalent changes are responsible for the burst phase behavior. In considering the structural basis for the minor component showing enhanced efficiency as a CD45 substrate, we considered the possibility that this form of the protein could contain a disruption in its known intramolecular SH2-pTyr or SH3-PPII linker interactions. To evaluate these possibilities, we prepared the following mutant proteins: P-Src-2, P-Src-3, P-Src-23, and P-Src-cat (Fig. 1). The CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation time courses for these proteins were obtained and are shown in Fig.4, and the rates versussubstrate concentrations are plotted in Fig.5. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that the burst phase associated with “wild-type” P-Src protein substrate has essentially disappeared, and the data for the mutants could be reasonably fit to linear time courses. Each of the mutant proteins exhibited faster steady-state rates compared with “wild-type” P-Src. These data suggest that the initial burst phase in P-Src dephosphorylation is the result of a more open form of P-Src, which is lacking the crystallographically observed intramolecular SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction (8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Google Scholar). Examination of Fig. 5 indicates that P-Src and mutant P-Src proteins display reasonable fits to Michaelis-Menten kinetics although theK m for all but P-Src-cat was hard to ascertain, because for these substrates it is much greater than 10 μm. Finally, the effects of the point mutations show cooperativity as suggested by the progression of steady-state dephosphorylation rates (V/E) for P-Src (0.1 min−1, calculated from Fig. 2), P-Src-3 (0.28 min−1), P-Src-2 (1.8 min−1), and P-Src-23 (6.9 min−1) (Fig. 4).Figure 5Kinetic analysis of the CD45 dephosphorylation of P-Src and mutants. A, plot of velocity versus [P-Src]; B, [P-Src-2];C, [P-Src-23]; D, [P-Src-cat]. The steady-state velocities of P-Src were obtained from multiple time courses fit to the burst equation. Data were fit to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation. [CD45] = 1–60 nm, 25 °C. The steady-state catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for these proteins is as follows: P-Src, 1.1 ± 0.1 × 103M−1s−1; P-Src-2, 1.5 ± 0.2 × 104 M−1s−1; P-Src-23, 4.7 ± 0.5 × 104M−1s−1; and P-Src-cat, 1.6 ± 0.1 × 106 M−1s−1. For P-Src-cat,k cat = 1.5 ± 0.1 × 103min−1, K m = 15 ± 3 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) That the substrate P-Src-3 showed a steady-state kinetic rate of dephosphorylation that was 3-fold faster than that of wild-type P-Src, and P-Src-23 showed a 3-fold faster steady-state rate compared with P-Src-2 suggested that the SH3-PPII linker interaction is modestly inhibitory to CD45 recognition and/or dephosphorylation. To further assess this possibility, the proline-rich high affinity ligand SH3BP was added to the P-Src and P-Src-2 dephosphorylation reactions as an independent way to disrupt the intramolecular SH3-linker interaction in P-Src. As can be observed in both cases (Fig. 6, A andB), the steady-state rate of dephosphorylation was enhanced by the presence of SH3BP by about 3-fold. Although a burst phase for CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-Src still appears to be present, the burst phase amplitude is ∼2-fold larger in the presence of SH3BP. Taken together with the SH3 mutation data, these results suggest that the SH2-phosphotyrosine and SH3-linker interactions cooperatively inhibit the dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by CD45. Because the burst amplitude corresponds to about 2% of the total P-Src protein concentration, it was proposed that the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium between closed and open P-Src might be ∼50:1. To measure this equilibrium using an independent approach, a fluorescently labeled phosphotyrosine-containing peptide was synthesized, and its affinity with P-Src and unphosphorylated full-length Src was investigated (Fig. 6, C andD). The K D values for P-Src and unphosphorylated Src are 75 and 0.7 μm (suggesting an open/closed equilibrium of 100:1), respectively, in approximate concordance with the apparent equilibrium constant deduced from the dephosphorylation studies. Interestingly, P-Src-cat is quite a bit more (∼20-fold) efficiently dephosphorylated as a CD45 substrate compared with P-Src-23. Because two major intramolecular interactions are thought to be interrupted in this protein, it was unclear how the SH3 and SH2 domains were inhibiting CD45-catalzyed dephosphorylation. To gain greater insight into this observation, the effect of the presence intermolecularly of the Src SH2-SH3–2 fragment (bearing an Arg → Ala SH2 domain mutation; see Fig. 1) on CD45 dephosphorylation of P-Src-cat was investigated. A dosage-dependent inhibition of CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-Src-cat by SH2-SH3–2 was observed (Fig. 7), consistent with the finding that CD45 dephosphorylates intact P-Src less efficiently than P-Src-cat protein.Figure 7Effect of SH2-SH3–2 on the CD45 dephosphorylation of P-Src-cat and pY542 peptide. A, plot of velocity versus [SH2-SH3–2] in the presence of a fixed P-Src-cat concentration (1 μm); [CD45], 1 nm.

See “Experimental Procedures” for conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two potential models could explain how SH2-SH3–2 could inhibit CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-Src-cat. In one model, SH2-SH3–2 could directly bind and inhibit CD45 as a competitive inhibitor or allosteric regulator. In a second model, SH2-SH3–2 could interact with P-Src-cat directly, blocking its accessibility to CD45. To distinguish between these models, the effect of SH2-SH3–2 on CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of a short, unrelated peptide (pTyr542) was investigated. In these studies, it was found that CD45 activity on pTyr542 was not inhibited by SH2-SH3–2. These results favor the model in which SH2-SH3–2 limits access to P-Src-cat by a direct interaction between these two protein fragments, presumably mimicking an intramolecular interaction in P-Src. There has been increased attention with regard to how protein phosphatases recognize and act on physiologic phosphoprotein substrates (26Wang Z.X. Zhou B. Wang Q.M. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 18: 7849-7857Google Scholar, 27Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Google Scholar). These studies provide the first detailed analysis of purified CD45 catalytic domain with a tail-phosphorylated Src protein family member as substrate. It has been observed here that the behavior of the CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation reaction of P-Src protein is more complex than that with P-Src-cat or phosphopeptide. It is envisioned that the intramolecular interaction between the phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain limit accessibility of the phosphotyrosine to CD45 (Fig.8 A). Perhaps more unexpected is that the SH3 domain-PPII linker intramolecular interaction in P-Src also contributes significantly to inhibition of the CD45 dephosphorylation reaction. These intramolecular interactions appear to show cooperativity not only in preventing enzyme-catalyzed dephosphorylation as seen here but also in limiting the activity of the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of Src family members (28Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Google Scholar, 29LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Google Scholar, 30Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Google Scholar). One of the more interesting findings from these studies is the observation of a burst phase in CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-Src. This leads to at least two important conclusions regarding P-Src and its interaction with CD45. First, the equilibrium between the closed and open forms of P-Src (Fig. 8 A) can clearly influence the rate of dephosphorylation by CD45. Second, the rate-limiting step for dephosphorylation of P-Src by CD45 at steady state appears to involve the opening of P-Src with the loss of the intramolecular SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction (Fig. 8 B). That is, the energetic barrier in going from the open to closed conformation is presumably higher than the energetic barrier to CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation. If the barrier to going from open to closed state were lower than the CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation barrier, no burst phase should be observed, because a rapid equilibrium between the open and closed forms should exist. Thus, the CD45-dephosphorylation reaction offers a new approach to interrogating the rate of conformational change motions of P-Src. This should allow for the analysis of the effects of various ligands and mutations on the conformational state of the P-Src protein in a fashion complementary to measuring Src kinase activity or surface plasmon resonance (28Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Google Scholar, 29LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Google Scholar, 30Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Google Scholar, 31Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Google Scholar). In principle, the “opening” rate in Fig. 8 should be equal to the k cat of P-Src dephosphorylation by CD45 at steady state, which can be estimated to be 5 min−1(Fig. 5 A). However, because the P-Src-23 rate of dephosphorylation catalyzed by CD45 is about 20-fold lower compared with P-Src-cat, it is not clear precisely what the open form really corresponds to structurally and what interactions are still present in this form of P-Src. Further studies with other phosphatases and complementary transient kinetic methods will likely be needed to provide increased insight into the physical basis for these rate constants. The three-dimensional interactions in P-Src-23 that prevent it from being as efficiently processed as P-Src-cat present an intriguing structural biology problem. The obvious implication is that significant long range, interdomain interactions in unphosphorylated Src may contribute to its catalytic activity, substrate interactions, and regulation. Recent structural and enzymatic studies on the related protein-tyrosine kinase Csk suggest that such long range interactions may have a significant impact on the structure and function of the kinase domain (18Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Google Scholar, 32Shekhtman A. Ghose R. Wang D. Cole P.A. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 129-138Google Scholar, 33Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Google Scholar). The implications of the kinetic behavior of CD45-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-Src on the scope and mechanisms of Src in cell signaling pathways are worth considering here. That there is a burst phase in dephosphorylation of the tail by CD45 could allow a Src-related pathway to undergo rapid initiation by a subpopulation of Src molecules. This initiation may then be followed by a slower but more sustained activation as the bulk of the tail-phosphorylated Src is dephosphorylated. These results also point to a new role for ligands, such as phosphotyrosine proteins and proline-rich ligands that can bind to the SH2 domain and SH3 domain of Src and their mode of activation of the tail-phosphorylated Src protein. Obviously, it is possible that they can directly activate the P-Src protein by restructuring the Src catalytic domain. But it is also now clear that they can enhance the tail dephosphorylation of Src, which again could lead to sustained Src pathway activation. A paradox concerning Src family member-CD45 interactions is that CD45 appears to be able to inactivate these tyrosine kinases by dephosphorylation of the activation loop phosphotyrosine site (4Hermiston M.L., Xu, Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Google Scholar, 5Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar, 6Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 247-252Google Scholar). It is not yet understood how activation loop dephosphorylation catalyzed by CD45 might be affected by the presence of tail phosphotyrosine or its interaction with SH2 domain. Moreover, it is not yet known how the lipid membranes that serve as the physiologic environment for CD45 and P-Src might influence catalysis. Future studies may allow a greater understanding of the effects of these complex variables on CD45-Src interactions. We thank J. Stivers for assistance with the fluorescence studies and members of the Cole laboratory for helpful discussions. We thank Dr. P. Johnson for providing the CD45 construct."

Similar to TNF signaling, LMP1 activates NF-κB activity and induces phenotypic changes in a wide range of cell lines (11Hammarskjold M.L. Simurda M.C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6496-6501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yeh T.S., Li, S.N., Wu, C.J. Liu S.T. Meng C.L. Chang Y.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Deletion mutant analyses led to the mapping of two regions in the C-terminal domain of LMP1 (CTAR1 and CTAR2) that mediate NF-κB activation. The CTAR2 domain accounts for ∼70% total NF-κB induction capacity, whereas the remaining 30% is derived from CTAR1 (13Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). Further functional analyses demonstrate that amino acids 204–208 of CTAR1 comprise the consensus motif for TRAF binding (14Sandberg M. Hammerschmidt W. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CTAR2 does not directly interact with TRAFs but recruits the TNF-associated death domain protein (TRADD) through a TRADD-specific N-terminal sequence (15Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interactions between LMP1 and TRADD activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, resulting in JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and concomitant up-regulation of AP-1 transcriptional transactivation (16Kieser A. Kilger E. Gires O. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6478-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M.S. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LMP1 and TNF receptor appear to function through similar mechanisms.The transmembrane protein LMP1 contains a long cytoplasmic domain that mediates protein function. High levels of LMP1 may be cytotoxic to cells (18Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2129-2135PubMed Google Scholar). To date, it is still not clear how LMP1-mediated functions can be balanced in a cell. Recent reports additionally indicate that at least 30% LMP1 proteins are membrane-bound (19Kaykas A. Worringer K. Sugden B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2641-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that LMP1 (a constitutively activated receptor-like protein) signaling is coordinately regulated. Specific regulators may be identified by examining the molecules associated with this protein.In this study, we identified a negative regulator, BRAM1 (BMP receptor-associatedmolecule 1) (20Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by yeast two-hybrid screening using the LMP1 C-terminal sequence as bait. Here we present data showing that BRAM1 interacts with LMP1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, CTAR2 and the last three amino acids (YYD) of LMP1 are critical for interactions between these two proteins. The region of BRAM1 that associates with LMP1 is within the 116 amino acids of the C terminus. Interactions between LMP1 and BRAM1 result in the inhibition of LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation but not JNK activation. BRAM1 interferes LMP1-mediated and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation by targeting the posttranslational modifications of IκBα molecules. Furthermore, BRAM1 also reduces the resistance of LMP1-expressing cells to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity.DISCUSSIONLMP1 has been considered to be a constitutively activated oncogene that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The complicated interactions between LMP1 and cellular factors may result in both stimulatory and inhibitory activities. At the physiological level, LMP1 inhibits EBV and cellular gene expression moderately. However, at high levels of expression, LMP1 is cytotoxic (18Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2129-2135PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sandberg M. Kaykas A. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9755-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), presumably by enforcing the inhibition of both the steady-state RNA synthesis and protein synthesis (30Sandberg M. Kaykas A. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9755-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate the constitutive activity of LMP1 have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we present data showing that LMP1 interacts with a cytoplasmic protein BRAM1, which down-regulates the LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation and promotes cells entering apoptosis under TNF-α treatment. We also demonstrate that BRAM1 interferes the TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Our findings collectively suggest that BRAM-1 plays a negative role in LMP1-mediated signaling and promoting cell death induced by TNF-α and cycloheximide that is normally repressed by LMP1 by inhibiting the survival pathways.BRAM1 protein, a cytoplasmic protein and an alternative spliced form of an adenovirus E1A-associated protein BS69, shares the C-terminal 186 amino acids including a MYND domain with BS69 (Fig. 1). BS69, like other MYND-containing proteins DEAF-1 (31Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and MTG8/ETO (32Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), is primarily a nuclear protein and functions as a negative regulator for transcription by interacting with components of transcriptional repressor complexes including co-repressors Sin3, N-CoR, SMRT, and histone deacetylase (33Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 34Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A.

Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). BS69 can bind viral and cellular nuclear transcription factors such as adenovirus E1A, EBV EBNA2, and the Myc-related cellular transcription factor MGA (38Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) through the PXLXP motifs of these proteins. The MYND domain of BRAM1 is also critical for BRAM1 to interact with LMP1, because the deletion of MYND domain (constructs BRAM1(Δc48) and BRAM1(Δc98)) failed to interact with LMP1 (Fig. 1 B). However, LMP1, similar to two other BRAM1-interacting proteins, BMP type IA receptor (BMPR-IA) (20Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and BIP (39Sugawara K. Morita K. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), does not contain the PXLXP motif for binding. This discrepancy remains to be investigated.The negative role of the cytoplasmic BRAM1 has recently been observed in two homologs of the human BRAM1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, bra-1 and bra-2 (40Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BRA-1 associates with the type I receptor and functions as a negative regulator of DAF-7 transforming growth factor-β signaling. The expression pattern of BRA-2 is similar to another type I receptor; therefore it is possibly involved in another transforming growth factor-β signaling in C. elegans. Whether BRAM1 plays a similar role in BMP signaling requires further investigation.Similar to TRADD, BRAM1 preferentially interacts with the CTAR2 region of LMP1, and the last three amino acids of LMP1 are critical for the binding. Different from TRADD, which acts as a positive mediator in LMP1- and TNF-mediated NF-κB activation, BRAM1 functions as a negative regulator. TRADD contains a death domain in its C terminus that determines the interaction of TRADD with TNF receptor. However, TRADD interacts with CTAR2 of LMP1 through its N terminus. BRAM1, on the other hand, contains no death domain, and its C-terminal MYND is critical for interaction with CTAR2. In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments,2 BRAM1 can co-precipitate with a small amount of TRADD, indicating that these three proteins can be present within a complex. Currently, we are examining the interaction among LMP1, BRAM1, and TRADD in LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation.BRAM1 represses LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation by reducing IκBα phosphorylation and delaying IκBα degradation. This is consistent with the current report indicating that LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation is modulated through NIK (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase)-mediated phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex (24Herrero J.A. Mathew P. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IKK through phosphorylation at Ser-176 by NIK results in activation of downstream NF-κB signaling. This is followed by phosphorylation of IκBα serines 32 and 36. NF-κB typically resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive form by association with its inhibitory proteins IκB. Phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK results in ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα and, subsequently, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus (27Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 28Li Z.W. Chu W., Hu, Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 29Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The present results strongly suggest that BRAM1 inhibits NF-κB activation by interfering the activation of the upstream NIK-IKK-IκB complex.LMP1-expressing cells are more resistant to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents. Induction of NF-κB activity is considered to be one of the survival pathways in LMP1-expressing cells. In this study, we show that BRAM1 interferes LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation and promotes the cell death induced by apoptosis inducing agents, suggesting that BRAM1 plays a critical biological role in LMP1-mediated functions.NF-κB activation is involved in LMP1-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis of Rat-1 fibroblasts (41He Z. Xin B. Yang X. Chan C. Cao L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1845-1848PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, including the c-Myc gene (42La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cyclin D1 gene (43Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar,44Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB may be a means of killing LMP1 expressing cells. Inhibitors of NF-κB activation such as glucocorticoids are wildly used as immune and inflammatory suppressants (45Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 46Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1993; 14: 133-151Google Scholar). Here, results demonstrate BRAM1 is a negative regulator for LMP1-mediated and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, BRAM1 may be used as a therapeutic molecule in treating EBV-associated, LMP1-positive cancers.Although it is unclear what direct impact LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation has in virus-induced oncogenesis, identification of BRAM1 as an upstream modulator that affects IκBα activity should potentially be useful for studying signal pathways that can mediate LMP1-induced oncogenesis. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the viral proteins expressed in EBV-associated tumors. EBV efficiently infects and immortalizes resting B-cells in vitro. LMP1 is indispensable in this immortalization process (1Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The protein transforms rodent fibroblast cells, indicating genuine oncogenicity (2Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3Baichwal V.R. Sugden B. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 461-467PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice containing an Ig heavy chain promoter/enhancer-driven LMP1 gene develop lymphomas with a high incidence in vivo (4Kulwichit W. Edwards R.H. Davenport E.M. Baskar J.F. Godfrey V. Raab-Traub N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In B-cells, LMP1 also activates the expression of Bcl-2 and protects cells from apoptosis (5Henderson S. Rowe M. Gregory C. Croom-Carter D. Wang F. Longnecker R. Kieff E. Rickinson A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, LMP1 down-regulates cytokeratin levels (6Fahraeus R. Rymo L. Rhim J.S. Klein G. Nature. 1990; 345: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), induces the anti-apoptotic protein, A-20, inhibits epithelial cell differentiation (7Dawson C.W. Rickinson A.B. Young L.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and induces cell migration activity (8Fahraeus R. Chen W. Trivedi P. Klein G. Obrink B. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Tsai C.N. Tsai C.L. Tse K.P. Chang H.Y. Chang Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10084-10089Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). LMP1 is an integral membrane protein with a predicted short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, six membrane-spanning domains, and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These regions are potentially important for LMP1-mediated functions, including cellular transformation and signaling. LMP1 associates with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF), as originally determined by the yeast two-hybrid assay (10Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), implying involvement in the signal transduction pathway mediated by the TNF receptor superfamily. Similar to TNF signaling, LMP1 activates NF-κB activity and induces phenotypic changes in a wide range of cell lines (11Hammarskjold M.L. Simurda M.C. J.

Deletion mutant analyses led to the mapping of two regions in the C-terminal domain of LMP1 (CTAR1 and CTAR2) that mediate NF-κB activation. The CTAR2 domain accounts for ∼70% total NF-κB induction capacity, whereas the remaining 30% is derived from CTAR1 (13Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). Further functional analyses demonstrate that amino acids 204–208 of CTAR1 comprise the consensus motif for TRAF binding (14Sandberg M. Hammerschmidt W. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CTAR2 does not directly interact with TRAFs but recruits the TNF-associated death domain protein (TRADD) through a TRADD-specific N-terminal sequence (15Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interactions between LMP1 and TRADD activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, resulting in JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and concomitant up-regulation of AP-1 transcriptional transactivation (16Kieser A. Kilger E. Gires O. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6478-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M.S. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J.

The transmembrane protein LMP1 contains a long cytoplasmic domain that mediates protein function. High levels of LMP1 may be cytotoxic to cells (18Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T.

We therefore hypothesize that LMP1 (a constitutively activated receptor-like protein) signaling is coordinately regulated. Specific regulators may be identified by examining the molecules associated with this protein. In this study, we identified a negative regulator, BRAM1 (BMP receptor-associatedmolecule 1) (20Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by yeast two-hybrid screening using the LMP1 C-terminal sequence as bait. Here we present data showing that BRAM1 interacts with LMP1 in vitro and in vivo.

BRAM1 interferes LMP1-mediated and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation by targeting the posttranslational modifications of IκBα molecules. Furthermore, BRAM1 also reduces the resistance of LMP1-expressing cells to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. DISCUSSIONLMP1 has been considered to be a constitutively activated oncogene that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The complicated interactions between LMP1 and cellular factors may result in both stimulatory and inhibitory activities. At the physiological level, LMP1 inhibits EBV and cellular gene expression moderately. However, at high levels of expression, LMP1 is cytotoxic (18Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2129-2135PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sandberg M. Kaykas A. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9755-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), presumably by enforcing the inhibition of both the steady-state RNA synthesis and protein synthesis (30Sandberg M. Kaykas A.

BS69, like other MYND-containing proteins DEAF-1 (31Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and MTG8/ETO (32Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), is primarily a nuclear protein and functions as a negative regulator for transcription by interacting with components of transcriptional repressor complexes including co-repressors Sin3, N-CoR, SMRT, and histone deacetylase (33Ayer D.E.

Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). BS69 can bind viral and cellular nuclear transcription factors such as adenovirus E1A, EBV EBNA2, and the Myc-related cellular transcription factor MGA (38Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) through the PXLXP motifs of these proteins. The MYND domain of BRAM1 is also critical for BRAM1 to interact with LMP1, because the deletion of MYND domain (constructs BRAM1(Δc48) and BRAM1(Δc98)) failed to interact with LMP1 (Fig. 1 B). However, LMP1, similar to two other BRAM1-interacting proteins, BMP type IA receptor (BMPR-IA) (20Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and BIP (39Sugawara K. Morita K. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), does not contain the PXLXP motif for binding. This discrepancy remains to be investigated.The negative role of the cytoplasmic BRAM1 has recently been observed in two homologs of the human BRAM1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, bra-1 and bra-2 (40Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BRA-1 associates with the type I receptor and functions as a negative regulator of DAF-7 transforming growth factor-β signaling. The expression pattern of BRA-2 is similar to another type I receptor; therefore it is possibly involved in another transforming growth factor-β signaling in C. elegans. Whether BRAM1 plays a similar role in BMP signaling requires further investigation.Similar to TRADD, BRAM1 preferentially interacts with the CTAR2 region of LMP1, and the last three amino acids of LMP1 are critical for the binding. Different from TRADD, which acts as a positive mediator in LMP1- and TNF-mediated NF-κB activation, BRAM1 functions as a negative regulator. TRADD contains a death domain in its C terminus that determines the interaction of TRADD with TNF receptor. However, TRADD interacts with CTAR2 of LMP1 through its N terminus. BRAM1, on the other hand, contains no death domain, and its C-terminal MYND is critical for interaction with CTAR2. In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments,2 BRAM1 can co-precipitate with a small amount of TRADD, indicating that these three proteins can be present within a complex. Currently, we are examining the interaction among LMP1, BRAM1, and TRADD in LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation.BRAM1 represses LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation by reducing IκBα phosphorylation and delaying IκBα degradation. This is consistent with the current report indicating that LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation is modulated through NIK (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase)-mediated phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex (24Herrero J.A. Mathew P. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IKK through phosphorylation at Ser-176 by NIK results in activation of downstream NF-κB signaling. This is followed by phosphorylation of IκBα serines 32 and 36. NF-κB typically resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive form by association with its inhibitory proteins IκB. Phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK results in ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα and, subsequently, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus (27Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present results strongly suggest that BRAM1 inhibits NF-κB activation by interfering the activation of the upstream NIK-IKK-IκB complex.LMP1-expressing cells are more resistant to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents. Induction of NF-κB activity is considered to be one of the survival pathways in LMP1-expressing cells. In this study, we show that BRAM1 interferes LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation and promotes the cell death induced by apoptosis inducing agents, suggesting that BRAM1 plays a critical biological role in LMP1-mediated functions.NF-κB activation is involved in LMP1-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis of Rat-1 fibroblasts (41He Z. Xin B. Yang X. Chan C. Cao L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1845-1848PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, including the c-Myc gene (42La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cyclin D1 gene (43Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell.

Inhibitors of NF-κB activation such as glucocorticoids are wildly used as immune and inflammatory suppressants (45Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1993; 14: 133-151Google Scholar). Here, results demonstrate BRAM1 is a negative regulator for LMP1-mediated and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, BRAM1 may be used as a therapeutic molecule in treating EBV-associated, LMP1-positive cancers.Although it is unclear what direct impact LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation has in virus-induced oncogenesis, identification of BRAM1 as an upstream modulator that affects IκBα activity should potentially be useful for studying signal pathways that can mediate LMP1-induced oncogenesis. LMP1 has been considered to be a constitutively activated oncogene that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The complicated interactions between LMP1 and cellular factors may result in both stimulatory and inhibitory activities. At the physiological level, LMP1 inhibits EBV and cellular gene expression moderately. However, at high levels of expression, LMP1 is cytotoxic (18Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2129-2135PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sandberg M. Kaykas A. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9755-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), presumably by enforcing the inhibition of both the steady-state RNA synthesis and protein synthesis (30Sandberg M. Kaykas A. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9755-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate the constitutive activity of LMP1 have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we present data showing that LMP1 interacts with a cytoplasmic protein BRAM1, which down-regulates the LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation and promotes cells entering apoptosis under TNF-α treatment. We also demonstrate that BRAM1 interferes the TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Our findings collectively suggest that BRAM-1 plays a negative role in LMP1-mediated signaling and promoting cell death induced by TNF-α and cycloheximide that is normally repressed by LMP1 by inhibiting the survival pathways. BRAM1 protein, a cytoplasmic protein and an alternative spliced form of an adenovirus E1A-associated protein BS69, shares the C-terminal 186 amino acids including a MYND domain with BS69 (Fig. 1). BS69, like other MYND-containing proteins DEAF-1 (31Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and MTG8/ETO (32Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), is primarily a nuclear protein and functions as a negative regulator for transcription by interacting with components of transcriptional repressor complexes including co-repressors Sin3, N-CoR, SMRT, and histone deacetylase (33Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 34Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A.

BS69 can bind viral and cellular nuclear transcription factors such as adenovirus E1A, EBV EBNA2, and the Myc-related cellular transcription factor MGA (38Ansieau S. Leutz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4906-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) through the PXLXP motifs of these proteins. The MYND domain of BRAM1 is also critical for BRAM1 to interact with LMP1, because the deletion of MYND domain (constructs BRAM1(Δc48) and BRAM1(Δc98)) failed to interact with LMP1 (Fig. 1 B). However, LMP1, similar to two other BRAM1-interacting proteins, BMP type IA receptor (BMPR-IA) (20Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and BIP (39Sugawara K. Morita K. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), does not contain the PXLXP motif for binding. This discrepancy remains to be investigated. The negative role of the cytoplasmic BRAM1 has recently been observed in two homologs of the human BRAM1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, bra-1 and bra-2 (40Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BRA-1 associates with the type I receptor and functions as a negative regulator of DAF-7 transforming growth factor-β signaling. The expression pattern of BRA-2 is similar to another type I receptor; therefore it is possibly involved in another transforming growth factor-β signaling in C. elegans. Whether BRAM1 plays a similar role in BMP signaling requires further investigation. Similar to TRADD, BRAM1 preferentially interacts with the CTAR2 region of LMP1, and the last three amino acids of LMP1 are critical for the binding. Different from TRADD, which acts as a positive mediator in LMP1- and TNF-mediated NF-κB activation, BRAM1 functions as a negative regulator. TRADD contains a death domain in its C terminus that determines the interaction of TRADD with TNF receptor. However, TRADD interacts with CTAR2 of LMP1 through its N terminus. BRAM1, on the other hand, contains no death domain, and its C-terminal MYND is critical for interaction with CTAR2. In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments,2 BRAM1 can co-precipitate with a small amount of TRADD, indicating that these three proteins can be present within a complex. Currently, we are examining the interaction among LMP1, BRAM1, and TRADD in LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation. BRAM1 represses LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation by reducing IκBα phosphorylation and delaying IκBα degradation. This is consistent with the current report indicating that LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation is modulated through NIK (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase)-mediated phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex (24Herrero J.A. Mathew P. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IKK through phosphorylation at Ser-176 by NIK results in activation of downstream NF-κB signaling. This is followed by phosphorylation of IκBα serines 32 and 36. NF-κB typically resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive form by association with its inhibitory proteins IκB. Phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK results in ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα and, subsequently, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus (27Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 28Li Z.W. Chu W., Hu, Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp.

Previously, we showed that SRrp86 could regulate alternative splicing by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins as long as the entire region encompassing the RS-EK-RS domains was intact. To further investigate the function and domains of SRrp86, we generated a series of chimeric proteins by swapping the RNA recognition motif and RS domains between SRrp86 and two canonical members of the SR superfamily, ASF/SF2 and SRp75. Although domain swaps between SRrp86 and ASF/SF2 showed that the RRMs primarily determined splicing activity, swaps between SRrp86 and SRp75 demonstrated that the RS domains could also determine activity. Because SRp75 also has two RS domains but lacks the EK domain, we further investigated the role of the EK domain and found that it acts to repress splicing and splice-site selection, bothin vitro and in vivo. Incubation of extracts with peptides encompassing the EK-rich region inactivated splicing and insertion of the EK region into SRp75 abolished its ability to activate splicing. Thus, the unique EK domain of SRrp86 plays a modulatory role controlling RS domain function.

RNA recognition motif ribonucleoprotein amino acid nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid The coding regions of nearly all eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences (introns) that must be efficiently and precisely removed to allow translation of functional proteins (1Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). For many genes, introns are constitutively removed during the formation of mRNA, however, for a large number of genes, the removal of introns is regulated such that various combinations of exons are spliced together in a tissue-specific and/or developmentally specific fashion (2Smith C.W.J.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In fact, greater than 60% of known genes are subject to alternative splicing (4Consortium I.H.G.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17490) Google Scholar, 5Brett D. Pospisil H. Valcarcel J. Bork P. Nat.

Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Many of these diseases are caused by mutations in the splice-site sequences but misregulated alternative splicing can also cause disease (7Patton J.G. Smith C.W.J. Creighton T.E.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced exons are often flanked by non-consensus splice sites and are activated for splicing by SR proteins binding to nearby enhancer elements facilitating the recruitment and assembly of spliceosomes (24Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). SR proteins are therefore crucial regulators of alternative splicing.Because many SR family members can individually complement splicing-deficient S100 cytoplasmic extracts, it first appeared that they might be functionally redundant. Consistent with partial redundancy, blocking the expression of six different SR proteins inCaenorhabditis elegans using RNA interference resulted in no observable phenotype (25Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Cáceres J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, RNA interference inhibition of ASF/SF2 in C. elegans, targeted disruption of ASF/SF2 in chicken DT40 cells, and null alleles of theDrosophila SR protein B52 all resulted in lethality (25Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Cáceres J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L.

In addition, multiple studies have shown that individual SR proteins display substrate specificity, have distinct functions in alternative splicing events, and can even negatively regulate splicing (11Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W.J. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell.

Although the results of these studies are somewhat complex, the general conclusion is that RRMs are responsible for RNA binding and specificity in both alternative and constitutive splicing, and they confer the ability to commit different pre-mRNAs to splicing (36Mayeda A.

In contrast, RS domains are thought to be protein-protein interaction domains that are often interchangeable.We recently identified SRrp86, an SR-related protein of 86 kDa. SRrp86 contains one RRM at the N terminus and two RS domains at the C terminus (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The overall primary structure is very similar to canonical SR proteins except that SRrp86 also possesses a unique glutamic acid-lysine rich domain (EK domain) between the two RS domains. SRrp86 is not required for splicing but it can affect the function of canonical SR proteins both in vitro and in vivo. It appears that SRrp86 acts to regulate the activity of other SR proteins, both positively and negatively, through protein-protein interaction. Previously, we showed that SRrp86 inhibits ASF/SF2, SC35 and SRp55 whereas it activates SRp20, provided the RS-EK-RS domains are intact (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell.

In order to understand how SRrp86 might act to both positively and negatively regulate other SR proteins, we sought to identify what domains are needed for function and to determine what role the EK region might play in overall protein function. Using in vitro and in vivo splicing assays and a series of domain-swap constructs, we found that the splicing activity of the chimeric proteins was not completely determined by their RRMs; rather, the RS domains could also direct activity. Specifically, fusion of the RS domains from SRp75 to the RRM from SRrp86 resulted in a chimeric protein capable of activating alternative splice site selection, whereas the parental SRrp86 protein was inactive. Thus, the RS domains from SRp75 can regulate splice site selection. In addition, we discovered that the novel EK domain of SRrp86 can negatively regulate both constitutive and alternative splicing, indicating a plausible mechanism of splicing regulation by SRrp86.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we used domain-swap experiments to analyze the functional properties of SRrp86, a regulator of SR proteins. Despite the fact that the two RS domains from SRrp86 are atypical, chimeric constructs with these domains joined to the RRMs from ASF/SF2 or SRp75 could still regulate alternative splice-site selection. However, when the converse exchange was created, fusing the RS domains from ASF/SF2 or SRp75 to the RRM from SRrp86, we discovered that the RS domains are functionally distinct; only the RS domains from SRp75 were able to activate splicing and alter splice-site selection. For the EK domain, deletion and chimeric constructs suggest that it acts to inhibit splicing and splice-site selection, perhaps by titrating the activity of required splicing factors.Domain Analysis of SRrp86Even though the parental SRrp86 protein by itself could not activate splicing or alter splice-site selection, its RRM and RS domains were both capable of such activity in heterologous settings, indicating that the precise function of the parental protein is caused by its unique combination of domains. This combination allows SRrp86 to function as a modulator of splicing, apparently through direct interaction with other SR proteins (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48Barnard D., Li, J. Peng R. Patton J.G. RNA. 2002; 8: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recent protein-protein analyses and mass spectrometry identification of associated proteins supports the idea that SRrp86 preferentially interacts with a distinct subset of SR proteins as well as other splicing-related factors. 2J. Li and J. G. Patton, unpublished data. One of these is scaffold attachment factor-B, a protein that interacts with SR proteins as well as an isoform of SR Protein Kinase 1, and which has also been implicated in linking transcription and splicing (60Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40175-40182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, scaffold attachment factor-B contains an alternately charged glutamic acid-arginine-rich region that has been proposed to mediate protein-protein interaction with several proteins involved in splicing and transcription (62Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We propose that the unique EK region may be similar in principle to such RD or RE repeats that serve to mediate protein-protein interaction.Functions of the EK DomainThe EK region mimics phosphorylated RS domains, raising the question of what role it might play in splicing regulation. Here, we were surprised to find that deletion of the EK domain enabled SRrp86 to rescue constitutive splicing and alter 5′ splice-site selection. In vivo, deletion of the EK domain resulted in even further activation of SRp20 than that seen with wild-type SRrp86. These results indicate that the EK domain acts as a negative regulatory module. Such inhibitory effects were also observed in heterologous settings because SRp75+EK lost the ability to alter both 5′ and 3′ splice-site selection, failed to activate SRp20 in vivo, and was unable to rescue splicing.Since the EK domain is rich in lysine, this region could potentially be a target for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and it is possible that rapid degradation could account for the loss of in vivoactivity observed when comparing SRp75 with SRp75+EK. To test for such a possibility, we prepared epitope-tagged versions of SRp75 and SRp75+EK and repeated the same experiments described in Fig. 5. Both tagged and untagged proteins had similar effects on SRp20 exon 4 inclusion, indicating that the addition of the epitope tag did not interfere with the function of either protein (data not shown). Importantly, no differences in expression levels were observed for either construct (data not shown), arguing against the possibility that differential protein stability could have impaired the activity of the SRp75+EK construct. We favor the idea that the EK domain modulates protein-protein interaction and that deletion of the EK domain alters the ability of SRrp86 to interact with other splicing factors.The fact that incubation of splicing extracts with purified EK polypeptide inhibited splicing supports the idea that it functions by interacting with other splicing factors. The inhibitory effects of the EK peptide could be explained by two possible protein-protein interaction mechanisms. First, the EK domain might recruit inhibitory factors to block splicing, or second, the EK domain might bind splicing factors and form dead-end complexes. The latter effect may be due to the fact that, in contrast to RS domains, the EK domain is unable to undergo regulated negative charge removal that may be crucial for subsequent spliceosomal rearrangements. We are currently working to identify which factors bind the EK domain. The coding regions of nearly all eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences (introns) that must be efficiently and precisely removed to allow translation of functional proteins (1Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). For many genes, introns are constitutively removed during the formation of mRNA, however, for a large number of genes, the removal of introns is regulated such that various combinations of exons are spliced together in a tissue-specific and/or developmentally specific fashion (2Smith C.W.J. Valcárcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 3Gravely B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In fact, greater than 60% of known genes are subject to alternative splicing (4Consortium I.H.G.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17490) Google Scholar, 5Brett D. Pospisil H. Valcarcel J. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 30: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and it has been estimated that up to 15% of characterized genetic diseases involve mutations that cause defects in splicing (6Krawczak M. Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Many of these diseases are caused by mutations in the splice-site sequences but misregulated alternative splicing can also cause disease (7Patton J.G. Smith C.W.J. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley, New York2001Google Scholar). Before the irreversible commitment of a given pair of splice sites, introns and exons must be defined, typically through the formation of bridge complexes (8Robberson B.L. Cote G. Berget S.M. Mol.

SR family members are characterized by the presence of one or two amino-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)1 and a carboxyl-terminal domain rich in serine and arginine dipeptides (SR). Bridge-complex interactions have been detected between SR family members (10Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 11Kohtz J.D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced exons are often flanked by non-consensus splice sites and are activated for splicing by SR proteins binding to nearby enhancer elements facilitating the recruitment and assembly of spliceosomes (24Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). SR proteins are therefore crucial regulators of alternative splicing. Because many SR family members can individually complement splicing-deficient S100 cytoplasmic extracts, it first appeared that they might be functionally redundant. Consistent with partial redundancy, blocking the expression of six different SR proteins inCaenorhabditis elegans using RNA interference resulted in no observable phenotype (25Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Cáceres J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, RNA interference inhibition of ASF/SF2 in C. elegans, targeted disruption of ASF/SF2 in chicken DT40 cells, and null alleles of theDrosophila SR protein B52 all resulted in lethality (25Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Cáceres J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L.

In addition, multiple studies have shown that individual SR proteins display substrate specificity, have distinct functions in alternative splicing events, and can even negatively regulate splicing (11Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W.J. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell.

Domain-swap experiments have been widely used to study SR proteins and discern the function of the RRM and RS domains. Although the results of these studies are somewhat complex, the general conclusion is that RRMs are responsible for RNA binding and specificity in both alternative and constitutive splicing, and they confer the ability to commit different pre-mRNAs to splicing (36Mayeda A.

A. 1997; 94: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, RS domains are thought to be protein-protein interaction domains that are often interchangeable. We recently identified SRrp86, an SR-related protein of 86 kDa. SRrp86 contains one RRM at the N terminus and two RS domains at the C terminus (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The overall primary structure is very similar to canonical SR proteins except that SRrp86 also possesses a unique glutamic acid-lysine rich domain (EK domain) between the two RS domains. SRrp86 is not required for splicing but it can affect the function of canonical SR proteins both in vitro and in vivo. It appears that SRrp86 acts to regulate the activity of other SR proteins, both positively and negatively, through protein-protein interaction. Previously, we showed that SRrp86 inhibits ASF/SF2, SC35 and SRp55 whereas it activates SRp20, provided the RS-EK-RS domains are intact (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48Barnard D., Li, J. Peng R. Patton J.G. RNA. 2002; 8: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

We propose that the unique EK region may be similar in principle to such RD or RE repeats that serve to mediate protein-protein interaction.Functions of the EK DomainThe EK region mimics phosphorylated RS domains, raising the question of what role it might play in splicing regulation. Here, we were surprised to find that deletion of the EK domain enabled SRrp86 to rescue constitutive splicing and alter 5′ splice-site selection. In vivo, deletion of the EK domain resulted in even further activation of SRp20 than that seen with wild-type SRrp86. These results indicate that the EK domain acts as a negative regulatory module. Such inhibitory effects were also observed in heterologous settings because SRp75+EK lost the ability to alter both 5′ and 3′ splice-site selection, failed to activate SRp20 in vivo, and was unable to rescue splicing.Since the EK domain is rich in lysine, this region could potentially be a target for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and it is possible that rapid degradation could account for the loss of in vivoactivity observed when comparing SRp75 with SRp75+EK. To test for such a possibility, we prepared epitope-tagged versions of SRp75 and SRp75+EK and repeated the same experiments described in Fig. 5. Both tagged and untagged proteins had similar effects on SRp20 exon 4 inclusion, indicating that the addition of the epitope tag did not interfere with the function of either protein (data not shown). Importantly, no differences in expression levels were observed for either construct (data not shown), arguing against the possibility that differential protein stability could have impaired the activity of the SRp75+EK construct. We favor the idea that the EK domain modulates protein-protein interaction and that deletion of the EK domain alters the ability of SRrp86 to interact with other splicing factors.The fact that incubation of splicing extracts with purified EK polypeptide inhibited splicing supports the idea that it functions by interacting with other splicing factors. The inhibitory effects of the EK peptide could be explained by two possible protein-protein interaction mechanisms. First, the EK domain might recruit inhibitory factors to block splicing, or second, the EK domain might bind splicing factors and form dead-end complexes. The latter effect may be due to the fact that, in contrast to RS domains, the EK domain is unable to undergo regulated negative charge removal that may be crucial for subsequent spliceosomal rearrangements. We are currently working to identify which factors bind the EK domain. Domain Analysis of SRrp86Even though the parental SRrp86 protein by itself could not activate splicing or alter splice-site selection, its RRM and RS domains were both capable of such activity in heterologous settings, indicating that the precise function of the parental protein is caused by its unique combination of domains. This combination allows SRrp86 to function as a modulator of splicing, apparently through direct interaction with other SR proteins (44Barnard D.C. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48Barnard D., Li, J. Peng R. Patton J.G. RNA. 2002; 8: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).
