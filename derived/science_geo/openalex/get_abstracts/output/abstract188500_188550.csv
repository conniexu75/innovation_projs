https://openalex.org/W2114727688,"Apoptosis induced by TNF-receptor I (TNFR1) is thought to proceed via recruitment of the adaptor FADD and caspase-8 to the receptor complex. TNFR1 signaling is also known to activate the transcription factor NF-κB and promote survival. The mechanism by which this decision between cell death and survival is arbitrated is not clear. We report that TNFR1-induced apoptosis involves two sequential signaling complexes. The initial plasma membrane bound complex (complex I) consists of TNFR1, the adaptor TRADD, the kinase RIP1, and TRAF2 and rapidly signals activation of NF-κB. In a second step, TRADD and RIP1 associate with FADD and caspase-8, forming a cytoplasmic complex (complex II). When NF-κB is activated by complex I, complex II harbors the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIPL and the cell survives. Thus, TNFR1-mediated-signal transduction includes a checkpoint, resulting in cell death (via complex II) in instances where the initial signal (via complex I, NF-κB) fails to be activated."
https://openalex.org/W1964543951,"In normal human cells, telomeres shorten with successive rounds of cell division, and immortalization correlates with stabilization of telomere length. These observations suggest that human cancer cells achieve immortalization in large part through the illegitimate activation of telomerase expression. Here, we demonstrate that the rate-limiting telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT is expressed in cycling primary presenescent human fibroblasts, previously believed to lack hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Disruption of telomerase activity in normal human cells slows cell proliferation, restricts cell lifespan, and alters the maintenance of the 3' single-stranded telomeric overhang without changing the rate of overall telomere shortening. Together, these observations support the view that telomerase and telomere structure are dynamically regulated in normal human cells and that telomere length alone is unlikely to trigger entry into replicative senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2166073081,"TRPM7 is a polypeptide with intrinsic ion channel and protein kinase domains whose targeted deletion causes cells to experience growth arrest within 24 hr and eventually die. Here, we show that while TRPM7's kinase domain is not essential for activation of its channel, a functional coupling exists such that structural alterations of the kinase domain alter the sensitivity of channel activation to Mg(2+). Investigation of the relationship between Mg(2+) and the cell biological role of TRPM7 revealed that TRPM7-deficient cells become Mg(2+) deficient, that both the viability and proliferation of TRPM7-deficient cells are rescued by supplementation of extracellular Mg(2+), and that the capacity of heterologously expressed TRPM7 mutants to complement TRPM7 deficiency correlates with their sensitivity to Mg(2+). Overall, our results indicate that TRPM7 has a central role in Mg(2+) homeostasis as a Mg(2+) uptake pathway regulated through a functional coupling between its channel and kinase domains."
https://openalex.org/W2067917704,"Like neutrophilic leukocytes, differentiated HL-60 cells respond to chemoattractant by adopting a polarized morphology, with F-actin in a protruding pseudopod at the leading edge and contractile actin-myosin complexes at the back and sides. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, toxins, and mutant proteins show that this polarity depends on divergent, opposing ""frontness"" and ""backness"" signals generated by different receptor-activated trimeric G proteins. Frontness depends upon Gi-mediated production of 3'-phosphoinositol lipids (PI3Ps), the activated form of Rac, a small GTPase, and F-actin. G12 and G13 trigger backness signals, including activation of a second GTPase (Rho), a Rho-dependent kinase, and myosin II. Functional incompatibility causes the two resulting actin assemblies to aggregate into separate domains, making the leading edge more sensitive to attractant than the back. The latter effect explains both the neutrophil's ability to polarize in uniform concentrations of chemoattractant and its response to reversal of an attractant gradient by performing a U-turn."
https://openalex.org/W2053359084,"We have isolated and functionally characterized a multicomponent Oct-1 coactivator, OCA-S which is essential for S phase-dependent histone H2B transcription. The p38 component of OCA-S binds directly to Oct-1, exhibits potent transactivation potential, is selectively recruited to the H2B promoter in S phase, and is essential for S phase-specific H2B transcription in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, p38 represents a nuclear form of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and binding to Oct-1, as well as OCA-S function, is stimulated by NAD(+) but inhibited by NADH. OCA-S also interacts with NPAT, a cyclin E/cdk2 substrate that is broadly involved in histone gene transcription. These studies thus link the H2B transcriptional machinery to cell cycle regulators, and possibly to cellular metabolic state (redox status), and set the stage for studies of the underlying mechanisms and the basis for coordinated histone gene expression and coupling to DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2027329004,"Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) suppress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity critical for extracellular matrix turnover associated with both physiologic and pathologic tissue remodeling. We demonstrate here that TIMP-2 abrogates angiogenic factor-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo independent of MMP inhibition. These effects require alpha 3 beta 1 integrin-mediated binding of TIMP-2 to endothelial cells. Further, TIMP-2 induces a decrease in total protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity associated with beta1 integrin subunits as well as dissociation of the phosphatase SHP-1 from beta1. TIMP-2 treatment also results in a concomitant increase in PTP activity associated with tyrosine kinase receptors FGFR-1 and KDR. Our findings establish an unexpected, MMP-independent mechanism for TIMP-2 inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and reveal an important component of the antiangiogenic effect of TIMP2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2022827874,"Efficient chemotaxis requires directional sensing and cell polarization. We describe a signaling mechanism involving G beta gamma, PAK-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (PIX alpha), Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase (PAK) 1. This pathway is utilized by chemoattractants to regulate directional sensing and directional migration of myeloid cells. Our results suggest that G beta gamma binds PAK1 and, via PAK-associated PIX alpha, activates Cdc42, which in turn activates PAK1. Thus, in this pathway, PAK1 is not only an effector for Cdc42, but it also functions as a scaffold protein required for Cdc42 activation. This G beta gamma-PAK1/PIX alpha/Cdc42 pathway is essential for the localization of F-actin formation to the leading edge, the exclusion of PTEN from the leading edge, directional sensing, and the persistent directional migration of chemotactic leukocytes. Although ligand-induced production of PIP(3) is not required for activation of this pathway, PIP(3) appears to localize the activation of Cdc42 by the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2166978593,"In the heart, insulin stimulates a variety of kinase cascades and controls glucose utilization. Because insulin is able to activate Akt and inactivate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the heart, we hypothesized that Akt can regulate the activity of AMPK. To address the potential existence of this novel signaling pathway, we used a number of experimental protocols to activate Akt in cardiac myocytes and monitored the activation status of AMPK. Mouse hearts perfused in the presence of insulin demonstrated accelerated glycolysis and glucose oxidation rates as compared with non-insulin-perfused hearts. In addition, insulin caused an increase in Akt phosphorylation and a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation at its major regulatory site (threonine 172 of the α catalytic subunit). Transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active mutant form of Akt1 displayed decreased phosphorylation of cardiac α-AMPK. Isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes infected with an adenovirus expressing constitutively active mutant forms of either Akt1 or Akt2 also suppressed AMPK phosphorylation. However, Akt-dependent depression of α-AMPK phosphorylation could be overcome in the presence of the AMPK activator, metformin, suggesting that an override mechanism exists that can restore AMPK activity. Taken together, this study suggests that there is cross-talk between the AMPK and Akt pathways and that Akt activation can lead to decreased AMPK activity. In addition, our data suggest that the ability of insulin to inhibit AMPK may be controlled via an Akt-mediated mechanism.

In addition, our data suggest that the ability of insulin to inhibit AMPK may be controlled via an Akt-mediated mechanism. The insulin signaling cascade is an important signaling pathway responsible for controlling substrate preference in the heart. Indeed, insulin has been shown to stimulate myocardial glucose uptake (1Abel E.D. Kaulbach H.C. Tian R. Hopkins J.C. Duffy J. Doetschman T. Minnemann T. Boers M.E. Hadro E. Oberste-Berghaus C.

These effects of insulin on glucose metabolism are particularly important because a significant amount of glucose-derived ATP is used for maintaining proper cardiac function. In addition, the stimulation of myocardial glucose utilization and subsequent decrease in fatty acid oxidation has been proven to be efficacious in reducing ischemic injury (7Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Schonekess B.O. Allard M.F. Lopaschuk G.D. Circ.

Moreover, insulin-stimulated glucose utilization may be a central component of the beneficial effects of glucose-insulin-potassium therapy on the ischemic heart (12Vanoverschelde J.L. Janier M.F. Bakke J.E. Marshall D.R. Bergmann S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1785-H1794PubMed Google Scholar). Two kinases that can be regulated by insulin are Akt and AMPK. 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; PCr/Cr, phosphocreatine/creatine.1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; PCr/Cr, phosphocreatine/creatine. Akt is a serine/threonine protein kinase that can be activated by insulin via a multistep pathway involving a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent mechanism (see Ref. 13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar for review). Once Akt is phosphorylated and activated, it can promote glucose uptake and subsequent metabolism via translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 to the plasma membrane (14Shao J. Yamashita H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 by Akt activates glycogen synthase and thereby promotes glycogen synthesis (19Halse R. Rochford J.J. McCormack J.G. Vandenheede J.R. Hemmings B.A. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 776-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent evidence in heart indicates that the presence of elevated exogenous palmitate inhibits insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (2Soltys C.L. Buchholz L. Gandhi M. Clanachan A.S. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1056-H1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that Akt may be more central to the control of cardiac energy substrate preference than previously thought. AMPK is a major regulator of cardiac energy substrate use. It is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two non-catalytic subunits (β and γ) (20Stapleton D. Gao G. Michell B.J. Widmer J. Mitchelhill K. Teh T. House C.M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29343-29346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Woods A. Cheung P.C. Smith F.C.

AMPK activity is regulated via protein-protein interactions, allosteric interactions, and by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a major activating site (Thr-172) located on the α catalytic subunit (see Ref. 22Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar for review). This phosphorylation site is a major controller of AMPK activity and is thought to be the target of at least one upstream kinase (23Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D.

Biol. 2002; 317: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The major role of AMPK is to respond to alterations in the AMP/ATP or PCr/Cr ratios and control the energy homeostasis of the cell. In times of low energy supply, AMPK responds by either switching off energy-consuming pathways or by promoting energy producing processes. In the heart, one physiologically relevant condition that results in diminished ATP supply is ischemia (26Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). During myocardial ischemia, AMPK is activated and contributes to accelerated fatty acid oxidation rates upon reperfusion (26Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK activation has been shown to promote the translocation of GLUT 4 to the plasma membrane, thus stimulating glucose uptake (27Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of AMPK in promoting glucose uptake and utilization appears to occur via a different signaling pathway than the insulin signaling pathway (27Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, AMPK has been shown to be inactivated by insulin during normoxic conditions (28Gamble J. Lopaschuk G.D. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1270-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin can antagonize ischemia-induced activation of AMPK, presumably by preventing phosphorylation at the activation site (Thr-172) of the catalytic subunit of AMPK by the upstream AMPK kinase (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although Akt and AMPK have different cellular roles, common downstream targets do exist. For example Akt and AMPK both can phosphorylate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (30Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition, both enzymes appear to be responsible for the regulation of GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane to promote glucose utilization (18Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 27Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this commonality, there appear to be distinct mechanisms by which Akt and AMPK signal GLUT 4 translocation. Therefore, although Akt and AMPK signaling may have at least one common end point in the regulation of cardiac substrate utilization, the mechanisms controlling each kinase cascade may be distinct. Indeed, in many instances Akt and AMPK activity are inversely correlated. For example, myocardial ischemia causes an activation of AMPK and inactivation of Akt, whereas the addition of insulin in the aerobic period activates Akt phosphorylation and blunts the AMPK response to a subsequent period of ischemia (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Beauloye C. Bertrand L. Krause U. Marsin A.S. Dresselaers T. Vanstapel F. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that AMPK activation can regulate Akt in skeletal muscle (33Jessen N. Pold R. Buhl E.S. Jensen L.S. Schmitz O. Lund S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 4: 1373-1379Google Scholar, 34Bolster D.R. Crozier S.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23977-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), although it is not known if the inverse is true. In addition, whether Akt can regulate AMPK activity in the heart is currently unknown. Therefore, understanding how these two kinases interact at a molecular level in response to insulin may provide insights into how glucose-insulin-potassium therapy is cardioprotective.

Briefly, hearts were excised and immediately immersed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 118.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dual-labeled 5-3H and 14C glucose with or without the addition of 100 microunits/ml insulin, and 1.2 mm palmitate prebound to 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The aorta was then cannulated, and the heart was subjected to a retrograde Langendorff perfusion, at 60 mm Hg for 10 min. Upon cannulation of the left atria, the heart was switched from Langendorff to working mode. The left atrium was perfused at a preload pressure of 15 mm Hg, and afterload was set at 50 mm Hg. A 5-ml sample of perfusate and hyamine was taken every 10 min. At the end of the 60-min aerobic perfusion period, hearts were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Akt1 Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active form of Akt1 (myrAkt1) in the heart were generated by crossing αMHC-tTA mice (36Yu Z. Redfern C.S. Fishman G.I. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with Tet-myrAkt1 mice, which express myrAkt1 under the control of tetracycline-responsive promoter. 2I. Shiojima and K. Walsh, unpublished data. Mice were maintained on doxycycline until 12 weeks of age, at which time doxycycline was withdrawn from the drinking water for 2 weeks to induce the myrAkt1 transgene expression in the heart. Control hearts were excised from uninduced littermates. Cell Culture—Hearts from 2-day-old neonatal rat pups were isolated and placed in ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline solution. After repeated rinsing, the atria were removed and the ventricles were minced with scissors. The minced tissue was washed three times in ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline solution and then placed in a T-25-cm2 tissue culture flask containing 19.5 ml of ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, (0.025%) DNase (w/v), (0.10%) collagenase (w/v), and (0.05%) trypsin (w/v). The tissue was digested on rotary shaker at 37 °C for 20 min. After digestion the tissue was centrifuged at 114 × g for 1 min at 4 °C in 20 ml of DF20 media, 20% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was subsequently added to DNase/collagenase/trypsin buffer for further digestion at 37 °C for 20 min. After a second digestion, the tissue was again transferred into a 50-ml falcon tube with 20 ml of DF20 media and centrifuged at 114 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated 2 times. After final digestion, all the supernatant fractions were pooled and centrifuged at 300 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of plating media (DF20 media, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin) and incubated at 37 °C in a T-25-cm2 tissue culture flask for 60 min. After 60 min the supernatant was removed and placed in another T-25-cm2 tissue culture flask for an additional 60 min. This step was repeated twice. After serial plating, the resulting pellet was resuspended in plating media. The cells were plated on primeria dishes (Falcon) at a density of 1.8–2.0 × 106 cells/plate. Cell Treatment—After 18 h of culture, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were rinsed two times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/HAM'S F12 media and infected with Ad·GFP, Ad·myrAkt1 (37Fujio Y.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) adenovirus at the multiplicity of infection of 25. After infection, the media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/HAM'S F12 media supplemented with insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite and cultured for an additional 48 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2. Appropriate dishes of cells were also treated for 18 h with 5 mm of 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (Metformin) 30 h postinfection. After the appropriate treatment time, cells were rinsed two times with ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na pyrophosphate, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I), and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to each plate. Cells were scraped and lysed for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was then determined, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Boiled samples of heart tissue homogenates or cell homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (2Soltys C.L. Buchholz L. Gandhi M. Clanachan A.S. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1056-H1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/1× Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted with either rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473 or Thr-308), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-GSK3α/β(Ser-21/9), goat anti-actin (I-19), rabbit anti-phospho-αAMPK (Thr-172), rabbit anti-αAMPK, rabbit anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser-79) antibodies (1:1,000) dilution, or peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (1:500) dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin/1× Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After being washed extensively, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies or peroxidase-labeled streptavidin in 5% milk/1× Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20. After further washing, the antibodies were visualized using the Amersham Biosciences-enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). The unpaired t test was used for determination of statistical differences between two groups. For comparison of three groups, analysis of variance followed by the Neuman-Keuls post hoc test was used. A value of p <0.05 was considered significant. Cardiac Function and Glucose Metabolism in Perfused Mouse Hearts—Mouse hearts perfused with or without insulin demonstrated no significant alterations in left ventricular work or coronary flow and were functionally very similar (Table I). Hearts perfused without insulin demonstrated glycolytic rates of 1964 ± 422 μmol·g dry wt–1·min–1 (Fig. 1A, open bars). With the addition of insulin these rates increased by 4-fold (Fig. 1A, filled bars). A similar profile is observed in these hearts with respect to glucose oxidation rates, with glucose oxidation rates increasing ∼8-fold in the insulin-perfused group as compared with controls (Fig. 1B).Table IParameters of cardiac function in perfused mouse hearts-Insulin (n = 8)+Insulin (n = 8)Heart rate (beats/min)319 ± 8313 ± 11Peak systolic pressure (mm Hg)81 ± 282 ± 1Developed pressure (mm Hg)26 ± 226 ± 1Coronary flow (ml/min)2.9 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.4Cardiac output (ml/min)9.5 ± 0.810.5 ± 0.5Cardiac work (ml/mm Hg/min × 10-2)7.8 ± 0.78.6 ± 0.5Cardiac function (mm Hg/beats/min)26 ± 126 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Effects of Insulin on Akt and AMPK Phosphorylation—In an attempt to better understand the mechanisms that control the metabolic effects observed in the perfused hearts, extracts from hearts perfused with or without insulin were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473 or Thr-308) or anti-phospho-α subunit of AMPK (Thr-172) antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). Hearts perfused without insulin had relatively little phosphorylated Akt protein. Upon treatment with insulin, the level of phosphorylated Akt increased dramatically at both phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2A, Ser-473 and Thr-308). Although phosphorylation at Ser-473 is indicative of the activation state of Akt, we also immunoblotted with anti-phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody to ascertain whether altered phosphorylation of Akt had any effects on downstream target proteins such as GSK3β, a known Akt target. In accordance with Akt activation, GSK3β phosphorylation was markedly elevated by insulin relative to hearts perfused in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2A). In contrast to these changes in Akt phosphorylation, insulin treatment resulted in reduced phosphorylation of α-AMPK (Thr-172) and was inversely correlated with Akt phosphorylation status (Fig. 2B). During the relatively short perfusion period, the levels of total Akt, GSK3β, or α subunit of AMPK were not altered (Fig. 2, A and B). Effect of Constitutively Active Akt1 on AMPK Phosphorylation Status in Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt1 (myrAkt1) specifically in the heart were used to determine the effects of Akt1 activation on the α-AMPK phosphorylation status. Expression of myrAkt1 in the heart induced an increase in phospho-Akt levels comparable with those observed in insulin-perfused hearts (Fig. 2) and dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of α-AMPK at Thr-172 (Fig. 3). Although phosphorylation of the α-AMPK was reduced, no changes in total α subunit of AMPK protein levels were observed. Effect of Constitutively Active Akt on AMPK Phosphorylation Status in Cultured Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes—To determine whether both Akt1 and -2 had similar abilities to reduce phosphorylation of α-AMPK at Thr-172, rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were cultured and infected with adenoviruses expressing either constitutively active Akt1 or Akt2 (Ad·myrAkt1 or Ad·myrAkt2). Cardiac myocytes expressing myrAkt2 reduced phosphorylation of the α subunit of AMPK to similar levels as in transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt1 (Fig. 4). Almost identical results were obtained using Ad·myrAkt1 adenovirus (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 3, and 5). This reduction in the phosphorylation of α-AMPK was observed in cardiac myocytes cultured in the presence or absence of insulin (data not shown), suggesting that insulin signaling mechanisms distinct from Akt activation are not responsible for reduced AMPK phosphorylation.Fig. 5Phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) are reduced with Akt overexpression and can be reversed by metformin. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes infected with Ad·GFP, Ad·myrAkt1, or Ad·myrAkt2 at the multiplicity of infection of 25 were incubated for 30 h, treated with metformin for 18 h, and then harvested. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and four independent experiments were performed. Representative immunoblots obtained from the cell extracts of these groups using anti-phospho-αAMPK (Thr-172) antibody (A) or anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser-79) antibody (B) are shown. Anti-αAMPK antibody (A) and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (B) served as loading controls for total αAMPK and ACC protein; anti-β-actin antibody served as a loading control for total protein (A). Extracts from cells that were treated with metformin are indicated by the + symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although activated Akt can reduce the basal phosphorylation status of α-AMPK at Thr-172, we determined whether activated Akt could maintain this effect in the presence of a known AMPK activator, metformin. Metformin has been shown to promote phosphorylation of the α-AMPK at Thr-172 without altering the cellular AMP/ATP ratio (39Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus metformin was used in these experiments to avoid confounding variables such as altered energy status of the cell. With the addition of metformin, the inhibitory effect of Ad·myrAkt1 or -2 on α-AMPK phosphorylation was overcome (Fig. 5A), which corresponded to a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of an AMPK target protein, ACC, at Ser-79 (Fig. 5B). Metformin treatment did not result in increased expression of total α subunit of AMPK protein or either of the two ACC isoforms. Using insulin-perfused mouse hearts, hearts from transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt, and isolated cardiac myocytes expressing constitutively active Akt, our data suggest that the ability of insulin to inhibit AMPK can be controlled via Akt. The ability of insulin to lead to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt presumably causes the acceleration of glucose uptake via GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane (18Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This increased availability of glucose accelerates glycolysis and subsequently increases rates of glucose oxidation (40Rosen P. Adrian M. Feuerstein J. Reinauer H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1984; 79: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This was observed in our studies. Because both glycolysis and glucose oxidation rates are dramatically accelerated in the mouse heart perfused with insulin, we investigated whether insulin modified phosphorylation control of AMPK. Although the activation of AMPK by insulin would contradict previous observations (28Gamble J. Lopaschuk G.D. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1270-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), AMPK activation is known to accelerate glucose uptake and utilization in the heart (27Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation status of the α subunit of AMPK was measured in mouse hearts perfused in the presence or absence of insulin. Similar to what has been reported in the perfused rat heart (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), insulin resulted in reduced phosphorylation of α-AMPK (Thr-172) in the perfused mouse heart. Therefore, the dramatic acceleration of glucose utilization in mouse hearts perfused with insulin may not be directly attributed to AMPK activation and increased GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane. However, another major metabolic action of AMPK in the heart is the acceleration of fatty acid oxidation rates (26Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Indeed, insulin has been shown to decrease fatty acid oxidation rates, presumably by decreasing AMPK activity (28Gamble J. Lopaschuk G.D. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1270-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that insulin promotes glucose utilization in the heart by 1) activating Akt and 2) inhibiting fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting AMPK activity. Although the mechanism by which AMPK is inactivated by insulin is unknown, it is possible that activated Akt may play a role. Because cardiac Akt and AMPK activation seem to be inversely correlated during insulin stimulation, we investigated whether increased Akt activity could lead to inactivation of AMPK. Hearts from transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt1 were used to determine the effects of Akt activation on the phosphorylation of α-AMPK. Hearts from transgenic mice demonstrated a dramatic reduction in α-AMPK phosphorylation when compared with control littermates that do not express the transgene. Although the phosphorylation of the α-AMPK at Thr-172 was reduced, no changes in total α-AMPK protein levels between transgenic and control hearts were observed, demonstrating that decreased signal with anti-phospho-α-AMPK (Thr-172) antibody was not due to a decrease in α-AMPK protein levels. Furthermore, these data indicate that activation of Akt in the heart in vivo is sufficient to down-regulate α-AMPK phosphorylation during conditions of normal insulin levels, suggesting that insulin-induced down-regulation of α-AMPK phosphorylation is mediated by Akt-dependent pathways. Although only myrAkt1 overexpressing mice were available for this study, we also investigated whether Akt-dependent inactivation of α-AMPK was specific to Akt1 or Akt2. In addition, because Akt2 has been suggested to be a more important regulator of glucose homeostasis than Akt1 (41Cho H. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Feng F. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38349-38352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 42Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), it was possible that we would observe different effects on α-AMPK phosphorylation with the two Akt isoforms. Rat cardiac myocytes expressing either myrAkt1 or myrAkt2 resulted in similar levels of decreased α-AMPK phosphorylation. These data suggest that Akt1 and Akt2 have at least one common down-stream target that results in similar decreased phosphorylation of α-AMPK. These data also suggest that the ability of insulin in the intact heart to decrease phosphorylation of α-AMPK may be dependent on Akt activation and not on other pathways involved in the insulin signaling cascade. Although the exact mechanism involved in decreased phosphorylation of α-AMPK by Akt is currently unknown, it is possible that either inactivation of the upstream AMPK kinase or stimulation of the AMPK phosphatase is involved. Alternatively, activated Akt may directly phosphorylate AMPK on a separate site other than Thr-172, which may prevent subsequent phosphorylation by AMPK kinase under steady-state conditions. Although Akt activation can reduce α-AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172, the mechanism by which this occurs is reversible even in the presence of continued Akt activity. This may explain why insulin addition to ischemic hearts does not reduce AMPK activity (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although increased phosphorylation of α-AMPK may occur when the ATP/AMP ratio falls, it also may occur when nucleotide ratios are not altered, as is the case with metformin treatment (39Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This suggests that independent of nucleotide changes, activation of the upstream AMPK kinase or inhibition of the AMPK phosphatase can increase phosphorylation of α-AMPK, regardless of Akt activity. In addition, because of the studies by Beauloye et al. (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) involving the ischemic heart, it is likely that ability of Akt to inhibit/reduce AMPK phosphorylation only occurs in hearts that are not metabolically stressed. This study has provided us with information suggesting that there is cross-talk between the AMPK and Akt pathways. Although other studies have suggested that AMPK can regulate Akt expression and/or activity (33Jessen N. Pold R. Buhl E.S. Jensen L.S. Schmitz O. Lund S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 4: 1373-1379Google Scholar, 43Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), this is the first report suggesting that Akt activation can lead to decreased α-AMPK phosphorylation. In addition, our data suggest that the ability of insulin to inhibit α-AMPK phosphorylation may be controlled via Akt. This opens the door to the possibility that the cardioprotective mechanism of glucose-insulin-potassium therapy to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury occurs via Akt inhibition of AMPK. Recently, Beauloye et al. (29Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Letters. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Beauloye C. Bertrand L. Krause U. Marsin A.S. Dresselaers T. Vanstapel F. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin administered prior to an anaerobic episode was able to lessen AMPK activation during ischemia. Because reduced AMPK activity during ischemia would presumably decrease fatty acid oxidation rates, it may explain why insulin is cardioprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The ability of activated Akt to decrease the phosphorylation of AMPK at its primary activation site of the catalytic subunit is a novel pathway that adds to the already complex mechanisms involved in AMPK regulation. Although the reasons for this inverse correlation of Akt and AMPK activity are as yet unknown, this study provides insight into the potential mechanism by which insulin inhibits AMPK activity in the heart. Although the metabolic effects of AMPK and Akt have been studied here, the ability of Akt to inhibit AMPK has implications beyond cardiac energy metabolism. Recently, AMPK activation has been implicated in reducing mTOR, p70S6 kinase, and eEF2 activity and seems to be very much involved in the regulation of protein translation and possibly the hypertrophic response (44Horman S.

Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin and IGF-1 have been shown to induce protein synthesis and cardiac hypertrophy, possibly via Akt activation (31Shiojima I. Yefremashvili M. Luo Z. Kureishi Y. Takahashi A. Tao J.

J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that a contributing factor to Akt-induced hypertrophy may be the reduction of a protein synthesis inhibitor such as AMPK.

However, the mechanism underlying the role of selenium in cellular proliferation and survival is still unknown. The present study using Jurkat cells showed that selenium deficiency in a serum-free medium decreased the selenium-dependent enzyme activity (glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase) within cells and cell viability. To understand the mechanism of this effect of selenium, we examined the effect of other antioxidants, which act by different mechanisms. Vitamin E, a lipid-soluble radical-scavenging antioxidant, completely blocked selenium deficiency-induced cell death, although α-tocopherol (biologically the most active form of vitamin E) could not preserve selenium-dependent enzyme activity. Other antioxidants, such as different isoforms and derivatives of vitamin E, BO-653 and deferoxamine mesylate, also exerted an inhibitory effect. However, the water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, N-acetyl cysteine, and glutathione, displayed no such effect. Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) assay revealed that cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased before cell death, and sodium selenite and α-tocopherol inhibited ROS increase in a dose-dependent manner. The generation of lipid hydroperoxides was observed by fluorescence probe diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) and HPLC chemiluminescence only in selenium-deficient cells. These results suggest that the ROS, especially lipid hydroperoxides, are involved in the cell death caused by selenium deficiency and that selenium and vitamin E cooperate in the defense against oxidative stress upon cells by detoxifying and inhibiting the formation of lipid hydroperoxides.

Selenium is an essential component of several enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1The abbreviations used are: GPx, glutathione peroxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DCFH-DA, dichlorofluorescin diacetate; TR, thioredoxin reductase; pNA, p-nitroanilide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SeP, selenoprotein P.

It is also well known that selenium is essential for cell culture when a serum-free medium is used (12McKeehan W.L. Hamilton W.G. Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Serum-free media, especially for immune cells and neurons, contain insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite. Without selenium, cells can neither proliferate nor survive. However, the underlying mechanism for the role of selenium in cell proliferation is still unknown. Vitamin E, a generic term for tocopherols and tocotrienols, is one of the most potent lipid-soluble antioxidants (13Brigelius-Flohe R. Traber M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Vitamin E occurs in nature in at least eight different isoforms: α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols and α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols (14Packer L. Weber S.U. Rimbach G. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 369S-373SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tocotrienols differ from the corresponding tocopherols only in their aliphatic tail. Vitamin E deficiencies have been implicated in some pathologic conditions, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, and liver necrosis (15Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.M. Azzi A.

Cell Culture and Determination of Cell Viability—Jurkat E6–1 cells, human T-leukemia (American Tissue Type Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, as described previously (22Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For studies on the effects of selenium depletion, cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 μg/ml human insulin, 5 μg/ml human transferrin, 92 nm FeCl3, and 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (ITA-RPMI). Stock solutions of sodium selenite and vitamin E were prepared in PBS and Me2SO, respectively. For the determination of cell viability, trypan blue assay, and MTT assay were conducted for the indicated times. In the former, cells that excluded trypan blue after incubation with PBS containing 0.04% trypan blue dye (Invitrogen) were considered viable. For the latter analysis, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT at 37 °C for 2 h. Isopropyl alcohol containing 0.04 n HCl was added to the culture medium (3:2, by volume), and they were mixed by pipette until the formazan was completely dissolved. The optical density of formazan was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Theromo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Cell Death Assay—Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (23Pigault C. Follenius-Wund A. Schmutz M. Freyssinet J.M. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and caspase activity (24Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) were analyzed as described previously. PS exposure was measured by the binding of annexin V-FITC according to the protocol outlined by the manufacture in the Apoptosis Detection-kit (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Treated cells were also stained with propidium iodide, followed by analysis with a Cytomics FC500 Flow Cytometry System (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL) with a 488-nm argon laser. Caspase activity was measured by the cleavage of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) peptide-conjugated p-nitroanilide (pNA) according to the protocol outlined by the manufacture in the Caspase-3/CPP32 Colorimetric Protease Assay-kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). Substrate cleavage to release pNA (405 nm) was measured using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Theromo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Absorbance units were converted to pmol of pNA using a standard curve generated with free pNA. Cytosol Preparation—Cytosol was prepared as described previously (22Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After culturing for the specified periods, cells were collected and resuspended in an appropriate volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain a cytosolic fraction. Protein Assay—Protein content of cytosol and cell samples were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Assay—To measure GPx and TR activities, a coupled enzyme assay, which was performed by following the oxidation of NADPH, was used as described previously (22Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The assay conditions were as follows: for the cellular GPx (cGPx) assay, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 2 mm GSH, 1 unit/ml of GSH reductase, and 70 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide; for the phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (PH-GPx) assay, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 5 mm GSH, 1 unit/ml of GSH reductase, and 60 μm 1-palmitoyl-2-(13-hydroperoxy-cis-9-trans-11-octadecadienoyl)-3-phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PLPC-OOH); for the TR assay, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.8 μm human recombinant thioredoxin, and 80 μm insulin. The oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm at 37 °C, and the activity was expressed as nmol of NADPH oxidized per minute. Determination of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species—Intracellular ROS were detected using DCFH-DA as described previously (25Takahashi M. Shibata M. Niki E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After culturing for the specified periods, cells were collected, resuspended in PBS and incubated with DCFH-DA at a final concentration of 5 μm for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were excited with a 488-nm argon ion laser in a Cytomics FC500 Flow Cytometry System, and the DCF emission was recorded at 525 nm. Data were collected from at least 10,000 events. Determination of Intracellular Lipid Hydroperoxides—Intracellular lipid hydroperoxides were detected using fluorescence probe DPPP (25Takahashi M. Shibata M. Niki E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and chemiluminescence HPLC systems (26Yoshida Y. Ito N. Shimakawa S. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Miyazawa T. Fujimoto K. Suzuki T. Yasuda K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as described previously with a slight modification. For DPPP assay, cells were preincubated in PBS at 37 °C at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml for 5 min. After addition of DPPP (in Me2SO) at a final concentration of 167 μm, the cell suspension was incubated for 5 min in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in the specified medium. At the times indicated, cells were collected and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence intensities of the cell samples were measured with the Spectrofluorophotometer RF-5300PC (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with excitation and emission wave-lengths of 351 and 380 nm, respectively. For HPLC analysis, cell samples in PBS were mixed with chloroform/methanol (2/1) containing 0.02% butylated hydroxytoluene at twice the volume of the samples. Then, an equal volume of 0.1 m NaCl with cell samples was added to the extract and mixed. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 × g, the lower chloroform layer was evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and injected into HPLC for lipid hydroperoxide analysis. The accumulation of cholesterol hydroperoxide (FC-OOH) was followed with HPLC using a post-column chemiluminescence detector (CLD-10A, Shimadzu, Japan) and a spectrophotometric detector (SPD-10AV, Shimadzu, Japan). An ODS-2 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, GL Science, Japan) was used and methanol/acetonitrile/water (45:46:9 by volume) was delivered as an eluent at 1 ml/min. After passage through the UV detector, the eluent was mixed with a luminescent reagent in the postcolumn mixing joint in the chemiluminescence detector at 40 °C. The luminescence reagent containing cytochrome c (10 mg) and luminol (2 mg) in 1 liter of alkaline borate buffer (pH 10) was loaded at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Phospholipid hydroperoxides were also followed with HPLC using a chemiluminescence detector. Finepack SIL NH2-5 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, JASCO, Japan) was used and hexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanol/water (5:7:2:1 by volume) was eluted at 1 ml/min. Statistics—Data are reported as means ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments. The statistical significance of differences between determinations was calculated by Student's t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Effect of Selenium Deficiency on the Viability of Jurkat Cell—To determine the effect of selenium on viability, Jurkat cells were cultured with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (ITA-RPMI). When cultured with a selenium-deficient medium, the viability of Jurkat cells decreased with incubation time (Fig. 1). The cell viability started to decrease after 24 h, and a higher than 95% loss was observed within 60 h. The viabilities as measured by MTT and TPB assay were in close agreement. In contrast, Jurkat cells cultured with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 nm sodium selenite did not show any significant loss of viability. Characterization of Cell Death Caused by Selenium Deficiency—To identify the type of cell death caused by selenium deficiency, PS exposure and caspase activity were analyzed. The selenium-deficient cells cultured with ITA-RPMI for 36 h were incubated with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Selenium-deficient cells showed not only signs of PS exposure but also uptake of propidium iodide (Fig. 2B). The dead cells in the selenium-deficient medium did not show any exclusion of propidium iodide for the time tested (24–40 h, data not shown). Caspase activity in the selenium-deficient cells was also measured using DEVD peptide conjugated to the chromophore pNA. In the selenium-deficient cells cultured for 36 h, caspase activity was below the background level seen in control and selenium-sufficient cells (Fig. 2C), while activity was detected in cells treated with 50 μm hydrogen peroxide for 6 h (apoptotic condition), but not in those treated with 500 μm hydrogen peroxide (necrotic condition), as previously reported (28Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Selenium-deficient cells did not show caspase activation for the time tested (24–36 h, data not shown), suggesting that this cell death is necrotic rather than apoptotic. Inhibitory Effect of Selenium-containing Protein and Compounds on Cell Death Caused by Selenium Deficiency—A dose-dependent study of the inhibitory effects of selenium revealed that sodium selenite at levels higher than 10 nm protected cells almost completely (Fig. 3). The ED50 of sodium selenite was 3.3 ± 1.5 nm. SeP, which functions as a selenium supply protein (22Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), also demonstrated an inhibitory effect, with the ED50 being 0.066 nm. Selenium-containing amino acids, such as seleno-dl-cystine, seleno-l-methionine, and seleno-dl-methionine, also inhibited cell death (Table I). Ebselen, which is a mimic of GPx (29Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), did not have an inhibitory effect. To clarify temporally the site of selenium action in selenium deficiency-induced cell death, sodium selenite was added to cells at various time points after culturing with the selenium-deficient medium. Almost complete protection of cell death was observed even when sodium selenite was added at 24 h after selenium deficiency (Fig. 4).Table IEffect of selenium and vitamin E on cell death induced by selenium deficiencyCompoundED50aED50: the concentration to inhibit 50% cell death.

As shown in Fig. 5, cellular GPx (cGPx), phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (PH-GPx), and thioredoxin reductase (TR) activities were reduced in selenium-deficient cells grown in a selenium-deficient medium for 24 h. cGPx, PH-GPx, and TR activities were reduced to 36, 36, and 39%, respectively, of those in control cells grown in a medium containing serum. Selenoenzyme activities of cells cultured with a selenium-deficient medium for 48 and 72 h could not be measured because of the lower cell recovery rates (Fig. 5). Inhibitory Effect of Vitamin E and Other Antioxidants on Cell Death Caused by Selenium Deficiency—As described above, a marked decrease of selenoenzyme activities was observed in the selenium-deficient cells. It is well known that these selenoenzymes play an important role in the antioxidative defense system. To understand the underlying mechanism of the protective effect of selenium, we examined the effect of other types of antioxidants. Water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, N-acetyl cysteine, and glutathione, did not inhibit cell death caused by selenium deficiency even at 1 mm (Table I), whereas the lipid-soluble antioxidant α-tocopherol completely blocked cell death (Fig. 6), although α-tocopherol did not produce any decrease of selenoenzyme activies (Fig. 5). Almost complete protection of cells was also observed even when α-tocopherol was added at 24 h after selenium deficiency (Fig. 4). We also observed the inhibitory effect of other forms of vitamin E, such as β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols and α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols (Fig. 6 and Table I). The ED50 values for tocotrienols were smaller than those of the corresponding tocopherols, suggesting that tocotorienols are more potent inhibitors than the corresponding tocopherol isoforms. The cellular uptake of α-tocotrienol was found to be 2.2-fold higher than that of α-tocopherol after incubation for 72 h (data not shown), which corresponds well with the difference in their ED50 values, the ratio being 2.8-fold (Table I). We also examined the inhibitory effect of vitamin E derivatives, such as PMC and Trolox, the former being a short-chain homolog of α-tocopherol and the latter a water-soluble analog of PMC. These compounds also blocked cell death (Table I), and the large difference in the ED50 between them suggests that the lipid-soluble antioxidant retained in the membranes exerts a higher level of activity than does the hydrophilic antioxidant. BO-653, a synthetic radical-scavenging antioxidant (21Noguchi N. Iwaki Y. Takahashi M. Komuro E. Kato Y. Tamura K. Cynshi O. Kodama T. Niki E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), showed a similar inhibitory effect to tocopherols (Table I). Deferoxamine mesylate, which has metal chelating properties, also completely blocked the cell death caused by selenium deficiency (Table I). Evaluation of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species and the Inhibitory Effect of Selenium and Vitamin E—We determined intracellular ROS production in cells using a fluorescence probe DCFH-DA. The selenium deficiency-induced death of Jurkat cells was preceded by an increase in intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 7A). Studies on the kinetics of this change showed that DCF fluorescence was slightly higher after culture for 12 h in the selenium-deficient medium and reached a plateau at 24 h (Fig. 7B). Selenite and α-tocopherol prevented the accumulation of intracellular ROS as measured by DCF fluorescence (Fig. 7, A and B). The dose-dependent study of the effect of selenite and α-tocopherol on intracellular ROS levels revealed that these compounds prevented the increase of DCF fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7C). Water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione, did not prevent the accumulation of intracellular ROS despite the addition of as much as 1 mm (data not shown). Determination of Intracellular Lipid Hydroperoxides—The inhibitory effects of lipid-soluble antioxidants on cell death implicate intracellular lipid hydroperoxides in selenium deficiency-induced cell death. The levels of lipid hydroperoxides in cells were measured by fluorescence probe DPPP and HPLC chemiluminescence. DPPP has been proved to be a sensitive probe for lipid hydroperoxides (25Takahashi M. Shibata M. Niki E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Okimoto Y. Watanabe A. Niki E. Yamashita T. Noguchi N.

Med. 2003; 34: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It reacts with lipid hydroperoxide stoichiometrically to give a fluorescent DPPP oxide. When the DPPP-labeled cells were cultured with the selenium-deficient medium, the fluorescence intensity derived from DPPP oxide increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 8A), but no increase was observed when cultured with sodium selenite or α-tocopherol. These cell death inhibitors dose-dependently suppressed the increase in DPPP fluorescence (Fig. 8B). Using HPLC chemiluminescence, cholesterol hydroperoxide (FC-OOH) was detected in cells cultured with the selenium-deficient medium for 24 h, and the molar ratio of FC-OOH to FC was 0.41 ± 0.30 pmol/nmol (n = 4). Interestingly FC-OOH was detected as a major lipid hydroperoxide in this system, and phospholipid hydroperoxides were at an undetectable level (<0.0053 pmol/nmol PC-OOH/PC and <0.015 pmol/nmol PE-OOH/PE) in the selenium-deficient cells. FC-OOH was not detected in the presence of sodium selenite, α-tocopherol, or fetal bovine serum (<0.015 pmol/nmol FC-OOH/FC). The essential role of selenium in nutrition has been well established. It is also well known that selenium is necessary for cell culture when using a serum-free medium. Insulin (as a growth factor), transferrin (as an iron source), and selenite are added to the serum-free media for immune and neuronal cells. Although the effects of selenium on cell viability and the cellcycle progression has been reported (12McKeehan W.L. Hamilton W.G. Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Zeng H. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism of the protective effect of this element has not yet been elucidated. In the present study using Jurkat cells, a model of proliferating T lymphoma cells, the decrease in cell viability was observed when applying a serum-free medium without selenium. This cell death was completely blocked by selenium-containing materials, except for ebselen, in a dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that these selenium-containing materials are incorporated and can be the cellular source of selenium used for synthesis of selenoprotein (22Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SeP, which is a selenium-rich extracellular glycoprotein (11Saito Y. Takahashi K. J.

https://openalex.org/W2016928596,"The Toll/interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain is a region found in the cytoplasmic tails of members of the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily. The domain is essential for signaling and is also found in the adaptor proteins Mal (MyD88 adaptor-like) and MyD88, which function to couple activation of the receptor to downstream signaling components. Experimental structures of two Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domains reveal a α–β-fold similar to that of the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheY, and other evidence suggests that the adaptors can make heterotypic interactions with both the receptors and themselves. Here we show that the purified TIR domains of Mal and MyD88 can form stable heterodimers and also that Mal homodimers and oligomers are dissociated in the presence of ATP. To identify structural features that may contribute to the formation of signaling complexes, we produced models of the TIR domains from human Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Mal, and MyD88. We found that although the overall fold is conserved the electrostatic surface potentials are quite distinct. Docking studies of the models suggest that Mal and MyD88 bind to different regions in TLRs 2 and 4, a finding consistent with a cooperative role of the two adaptors in signaling. Mal and MyD88 are predicted to interact at a third non-overlapping site, suggesting that the receptor and adaptors may form heterotetrameric complexes. The theoretical model of the interactions is supported by experimental data from glutathione S-transferase pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitations. Neither theoretical nor experimental data suggest a direct role for the conserved proline in the BB-loop in the association of TLR4, Mal, and MyD88.

In humans, innate immune responses provide the first line of defense against invading bacterial pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TIR, Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain; Mal, MyD88 adaptor-like; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; P/H, proline to histidine mutation. from Gram-negative bacteria are sensed by macrophages, and these cells respond by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin 1), which provoke the acute phase response to infection (for review see Ref. 1Dunne, A., and O'Neill, L. A. (2003) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/171/re3.Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become clear that the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are required to mediate these responses. These molecules are single pass transmembrane receptors, and they are related to Drosophila Toll, a protein involved in dorso-ventral patterning and antifungal innate immunity in the fly (2Gay N.J.

Drosophila Toll and TLRs all have ectodomains with characteristic blocks of leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic signaling domain of ∼200 residues called the Toll/interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain. The family of Toll receptors appears to use common components in the post-receptor signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor NFκB (5Buchanan S.G.S. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). It is now well established that human TLR4 together with two other membrane proteins CD14 and MD2 are able to sense the presence of LPS and to establish the appropriate signaling response (7Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). For example, strains of mice that are hyposensitive to LPS either lack or have inactivating mutations in TLR4 (8Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6473) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor is thought to involve dimerization followed by recruitment of a post-receptor complex containing the adaptor MyD88 and the protein kinase IRAK (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase) (9Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.D. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). MyD88 is a critical component in the pathway and is required by most if not all of the TLRs (10Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). It is a modular protein with a TIR and protein interaction domain termed the death domain (11Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2467-2475PubMed Google Scholar). The TIR domain is thought to bind with that of the receptor, and the death domain appears to interact with the death domain found at the N terminus of IRAK. Although MyD88 is the principal transducer of TLR signaling, the TLR4 pathway appears to have evolved a second adaptor called Mal (MyD88 adaptor-like) or TIRAP (TIR adaptor protein) (12Fitzgerald K.A.

Similar to MyD88, this protein has a TIR but it lacks a death domain. In Drosophila, a clear homologue of MyD88 is involved in the Toll-mediated innate immune responses (14Horng T. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12654-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Tauszig-Delamasure S. Bilak H. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, in dorso-ventral patterning, a different adaptor, Tube, is used. Similar to MyD88, this protein has an N-terminal death domain but it lacks an obvious TIR domain (16Letsou A. Alexander S. Orth K. Wasserman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There is now consistent biochemical evidence that activation of TLRs involves the recruitment of specific post-receptor signaling complexes. However, there is still only limited structural information regarding these complexes. In fact, the only structures solved to date are those of the isolated TIRs from TLRs 1 and 2 (17Xu Y.W. Tao X. Shen B.H. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These molecules have an overall fold with a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by five helices. The structures are related to the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheY, confirming a prediction made by Bazan et al., (6Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 18Simonovic M. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28637-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Most of the conserved residues in TIR domains are buried in the core of the fold, but some are solvent-exposed residues located on one face of the protomer. This may form an interaction surface to which MyD88 and Mal can bind in response to signaling. In fact, a loop termed the BB-loop connecting the second β-strand and second helix includes a proline residue that is changed to histidine in mice, which are hyporesponsive to LPS, and the corresponding change also abolishes the ability of TLR2 to interact with MyD88 in vitro (8Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have modeled the TIR domains of TLR4, MyD88, and Mal. Experimental data are provided to support results obtained from docking studies, and putative interaction motifs are identified with particular attention being paid to the conserved proline residue found within the BB-loop of the receptor and adaptor TIR domains. These structures suggest mechanisms by which binding and specificity are achieved by different combinations of TIRs during signaling We also report sequence similarities between Mal and the Drosophila adaptor Tube and the ATP-dependent dissociation of Mal dimers and oligomers. Modeling Studies—The sequences of target proteins were extracted from the protein sequence data banks. Sequence homologues were retrieved using PSI-BLAST and aligned using ClustalW. The resulting alignment was carefully studied and further adjusted manually using a UNIX-based sequence alignment editor, SEAVIEW. Percentage similarities between homologues were scored using MALFORM. Homologues with known three-dimensional structures were aligned using COMPARER (19Sali A. Blundell TL. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 403-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) or FuGue (20Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The JOY annotation used in structure based sequence alignments has been described previously (21Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Johnson M.S. Overingon J.P. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Burke D.F. Deane C.M. Nagarajaram H.A. Campillo N. Martin-Martinez M. Mendes J. Molina F. Perry J. Reddy B.V.B. Soares C.M. Steward R.E. Williams M. Carrondo M.A. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. Proteins. 1999; : 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The target sequence was then aligned to the structure based alignment using ClustalX. This alignment was conducted such that gaps or insertions within conserved secondary structure regions are disfavored by constructing a SWISS-PROT style secondary structure mask. MODELLER6a was used to generate 15 models for each protein. Five models with the best combination of low energy and low number of restraint violations were chosen. PROCHECK was used to check the stereochemical quality of models (23Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 24Morris A.L. Macarthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Loop regions with residue geometry problems were further modeled using RAPPER (25de Bakker P. DePristo M. Burke D. Blundell T. Proteins. 2003; 51: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26DePristo M. de Bakker P. Lovell S. Blundell T. Proteins. 2003; 51: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Models were analyzed further using PROSAII 3.0 or Verify 3D, which use Cα- and Cβ-based potentials to calculate energy profiles for protein structures. Models of complexes between TLR4 and the adaptor proteins, Mal and Myd88, were constructed using geometry and hydrophobicity complementarity search algorithm in GRAMM. The docking parameters were step grid at 6.8 Å, repulsion potential at 6.5, and intervals of rotation at 10°. One hundred models were generated, and the twenty lowest energy matches were analyzed. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—HEK293 cells were obtained from the Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research (CAMR, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml–1 gentamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged TLR-4 were a generous gift from Douglas Golenbock. Cells were seeded at 105 ml–1 24 h prior to transfection. The FLAG-tagged TLR4-expressing plasmid was a kind gift from Ruslan Medzhitov (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The MyD88-expressing plasmid was a gift from Marta Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy). HA-tagged Mal from the pDC304 vector was subcloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector for mammalian cell-based transfections. For bacterial expression, cDNAs encoding full-length Mal, MyD88, and the TIR domain of TLR4 were amplified by PCR using a spleen library and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according the protocol of the manufacturer. All of the other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom) unless otherwise stated. Co-expression and Purification of Mal and MyD88 —Mal and Myd88 full-length expression vectors were co-transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and grown in Luria broth. A bacterial cell culture was grown to A 600 = 0.6 under ampicillin and kanamycin selection. Protein expression was induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed in the French press at 15000 p.s.i., and the soluble/insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Protein purification was facilitated by affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose, anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography). Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—HEK293 cells were seeded (105 ml–1) onto 100-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection with combinations of plasmids (4 μg of each) as indicated using Genejuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24–48-h post-transfection cells were washed by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice (30 min) in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg of leupeptin ml–1. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody, which had been pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting. GST pull-down assays were performed using the recombinant GST fusion proteins coupled to GSH-Sepharose. Lysis extracts were prepared as described above and incubated for 2 h with the fusions indicated in the figure legends. The complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against the epitope tags FLAG (12CA5) and Myc (9E10) were obtained from Sigma. The polyclonal antibody against the HA epitope tag (Y-11) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal AU1 antibody was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Company. The polyclonal antibody against human TLR4 was a kind gift from Keith Ray (Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, United Kingdom). Molecular Modeling of TLR4, Mal, and MyD88 TIR Domains—The evidence suggests that TIR domains from receptors and adaptors are likely to form multitypic complexes. To study how this might occur, we used the crystal structures of the TIR domain from TLRs 1 and 2 (17Xu Y.W. Tao X. Shen B.H. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) to generate molecular models for TLR4, Mal, and MyD88 TIR domains. Structure-based alignments of experimental structures to target sequences generated by FUGUE and COMPARER were used by MODELLER6a for comparative modeling (data not shown). The loop regions were refined using RAPPER (25de Bakker P. DePristo M. Burke D. Blundell T. Proteins. 2003; 51: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26DePristo M. de Bakker P. Lovell S. Blundell T. Proteins. 2003; 51: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Model evaluation using Procheck and PROSAII revealed that the domains were modeled with no structural violations. Electrostatic surface representations of the experimental structure of TLRs 1 and 2 and the models of TLR4, Mal, and MyD88 are shown in Fig. 1 oriented to show the “S” face. This surface has a number of conserved solvent-exposed residues including the critical Pro residue in the BB-loop. Interestingly, apart from this area the electrostatic surface potentials are quite distinct, suggesting the possibility of electrostatic complementarity. The regions on the upper left and lower right of the BB-loop are the most interesting. For example, in TLR4, the upper left is positively charged (Arg-705), whereas the corresponding region in Mal is negatively charged (Asp-154). Another characteristic of Mal that differentiates it from TLR4 and MyD88 is the lack of conservation in “box 3,” a sequence at the C-terminal of the TIR (see Ref. 12Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A.J. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). This region is located at the bottom right of the models and in Mal results in a distinct electrostatic surface (Fig. 1e). As noted above, TLR4, Mal, and MyD88 are able to make heterotypic interactions with each other and these surface properties may indicate how binding specificity is achieved in the post-receptor complex. In an attempt to map the interaction surface for TLR4 with Mal and Myd88, we docked the adaptor proteins onto the TLR4 model using GRAMM (27Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 28Vakser I.A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 29Wells C.A. Vakser I.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). GRAMM docking was conducted on the basis of hydrophobicity and geometry. Models of the best scoring heterotypic complexes of TLR4 with Mal and MyD88 are presented in Fig. 2a. Interestingly, this study suggests non-overlapping binding sites on TLR4 for Mal and MyD88. Mal is predicted to associate through its DD- and DE-loops with the positively charged region of TLR4 centered on Arg-705. This region on TLR4 contains one side of the BB-loop and the αC helix and corresponds to the upper left-hand region in Fig. 1d. MyD88 is predicted to bind with a surface created by its AA- and DD-loop to the CD-loop on TLR4, which is located on the other side of the receptor, opposite its BB-loop. Docking studies with the experimental structure of TLR2 suggest that both adaptors couple to the same surface on this receptor (Fig. 2b). In this case, Myd88 coupling is distinct from that seen with TLR4 with the BB-loop of TLR2 forming a possible point of contact between the two proteins. Effect of the Mutation Conferring Dominant LPS Sensitivity on Receptor/Adaptor Interactions—Previous modeling studies are comparable with those described above and also represent the BB-loop of TLR4 as an exposed surface area (30Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Residues within this loop are critical for TLR4 signaling as displayed by the C3H/HeJ mice, which are unresponsive to LPS because of an inactivating proline to histidine mutation at position 712. Mutation of the corresponding residue in human TLR4 (P714H) also renders the receptor inactive and is thought to disrupt MyD88/TLR4 complex formation. This is based on interaction studies with human TLR2 in which the adaptor failed to immunoprecipitate with the mutant receptor (17Xu Y.W. Tao X. Shen B.H. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). According to our model, the P/H mutation should not affect MyD88/TLR4 heterodimerization. Therefore, we carried out similar experiments to clarify whether this is in fact the case. As shown in Fig. 3, a and b, the TLR4 P/H mutant retained the ability to bind to MyD88 in both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both the wild type and mutant forms of TLR4 were also found to bind to Mal in reciprocal GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3, c–e). This confirms findings from previously reported immunoprecipitations experiments (12Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A.J. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 13Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct interaction was observed between wild type and mutant TLR4 and Mal when the purified recombinant proteins were incubated in isolation (Fig. 3f). A corresponding proline residue is also found in the BB-loops of Mal and MyD88. Therefore, we tested the ability of mutant forms of the adaptors to bind to TLR4. As shown in Fig. 4, a and b, the MyD88 P200H mutation has no effect on TLR4/MyD88 heterodimerization and is consistent with our model in which the BB-loop of MyD88 does not form a point of contact with the receptor TIR domain. It was previously reported that the Mal P125H mutant (which fails to activate NFκB) cannot bind to TLR4 (13Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar); however, in our hands, an interaction was observed between the two proteins in co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiment (Fig. 4c). Again, this is consistent with our model in which the BB-loop of Mal is directed away from the receptor. Mal and MyD88 Heterodimerization—GRAMM docking predicts that Mal and MyD88 TIRs interact with each other at a third non-overlapping site (Fig. 5a). This interface produces an essentially symmetrical arrangement of the Mal and MyD88 protomers with hydrophobic residues at the end of the BB-loop (Ile-30 and Val-205, respectively) together with polar residues on the fourth α helix (Gln-153, Asp-154 in Mal, and Gln-230 in MyD88 in Fig. 5a) making significant contributions. To address whether this interaction is direct, we co-expressed a His-tagged version of full-length Myd88 and GST-tagged full-length Mal in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Fig. 5b, lanes 1–3). The two proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted by thrombin cleavage. Myd88 was observed to co-elute with Mal (Fig. 5b, lanes 4–7). Mutation of Pro-125 in Mal had no effect on the association of Mal with itself or with MyD88 in pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5, c and e). Likewise, mutation of the corresponding proline residue in MyD88 (P200H) did not prevent its homodimerization as shown in Fig. 5d. Importantly, a construct consisting only of the TIR domain of MyD88 was used in these experiments to rule out any N-terminal interactions that may be mediated by the death domain of MyD88. ATP-dependent Dissociation of Mal Dimers and Oligomers— When studying some of the homotypic and heterotypic interactions described above, the TIR domains of Mal and MyD88 were expressed in E. coli (see “Experimental procedures”). As a final step of purification, the Mal and MyD88 preparations were fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 16/60. This analysis revealed an unexpected adenine nucleotide-dependent behavior by Mal. Soluble fractions of induced cells were prepared in either the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP, a treatment reported to remove a contaminant that otherwise co-purifies with GST fusion proteins. The extracts were then purified as described above and finally separated by gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 6, untreated Mal elutes in three well resolved peaks, all of which consist of pure Mal protein. By contrast, Mal purified from ATP-treated lysates migrates as a single peak. This result was reproduced in several experiments and was not observed with corresponding MyD88 TIR domain preparations (data not shown). Sequence Relationship between Mal and the Drosophila Adaptor Tube—The adaptors dMyD88 and Tube are known to couple to the Drosophila receptor, Toll. Because dMyD88 is a direct homolog of vertebrate MyD88, we asked whether Mal might be related to Tube. We generated an alignment between the two proteins using ClustalW and found that the N-terminal sequence of Mal immediately preceding the TIR domain is strikingly similar to the C-terminal of Tube adjacent to the death domain (Fig. 7). 30 of 80 amino acids in this region are conserved or conservatively substituted. These amino acids are also highly conserved in the Tube sequence from the distantly related dipteran Drosophila virilis (31Letsou A. Alexander S. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal of Tube is also aligned by ClustalW with 47 identities or conservative substitutions in the last 150 amino acids. The most conserved regions correspond to the predicted β-strands in the TIR models and particularly hydrophobic core residues. Thus, it seems possible that the Tube C terminus might represent a highly degenerated member of the TIR-fold family, consistent with its role in coupling activation and signaling by the Drosophila Toll receptor. The modeling and docking studies presented here suggest that there are discrete sites on the receptor TIR domains for binding Mal and MyD88 and a third mode of binding for the formation of Mal/MyD88 heterodimers. Neither of the predicted interactions of the adaptor TIR domains appears to directly involve the BB-loop region on TLR4, although that predicted for Mal is immediately adjacent to it. In vitro assays confirm that mutation of a critical proline residue, which lies at the tip of the BB-loop is not sufficient to prevent recruitment of the adaptor proteins. This result contrasts with the finding that mutation of the corresponding residue in TLR2 abolishes the binding of MyD88. Importantly, there are no significant structural differences between the wild type and mutant TLR2 protein (17Xu Y.W. Tao X. Shen B.H. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and this is probably the case with TLR4. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that MyD88 is recruited to the mutant receptor via endogenous Mal should the latter bind at a distinct surface. It may also be the case that mutation of a single residue within the BB-loop is not sufficient to prevent receptor/adaptor association. Indeed, a recent report providing a detailed examination of interaction surfaces on the TLR4 TIR domain revealed that amino acids in both the BB- and DD-loops on TLR4 are critical for signaling (30Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the program GRAMM uses a rigid docking procedure and would not be able to predict sites that undergo a significant conformational change on binding. Thus, if the BB-loop is directly involved in binding, it may undergo a switch such as that seen upon the binding of vonWillebrand factor to platelet glycoprotein 1B (Gp1B) (32Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A.P. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this case, a 16 amino acid loop in Gp1B becomes a β-hairpin and this forms part of a three-stranded intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet. In support of this finding, a recent study of a mutant TLR2 TIR domain, which assumes a somewhat different conformation to that in the original crystal structure, indicates that the BB-loop is intrinsically flexible (33Tao X. Xu Y.W. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The BB-loops of the adaptors appear also not to form a point of contact with either TLR4 or themselves in both docking and experimental studies. Again, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutant proteins are recruited to the receptor complex by their endogenous wild type counterparts. Direct measurement of protein-protein interactions is required to determine the validity of these models. We have expressed and purified Mal and MyD88 to study them biochemically. We have shown that heterodimers of MyD88 and Mal can be reconstituted in a purified system consistent with previous results using immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (12Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A.J. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the Mal protein can exist in different oligomeric states including dimers. This is also consistent with yeast two-hybrid experiments, which indicated the ability of Mal to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with MyD88. Unexpectedly, we observed that the Mal oligomers could be dissociated if they were prepared in the presence of high concentrations of ATP. The significance of this behavior is unclear; however, it suggests that Mal can adopt different conformers and that ATP can directly or indirectly convert these forms. Direct purine nucleotide binding has been proposed previously for TIR domains (34Hopp T.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the TIR-fold is very similar to that of CheY, a bacterial chemotaxis protein that is transiently phosphorylated at an aspartate residue. This phosphorylation induces subtle changes in the CheY structure, particularly the change in conformation of a tyrosine residue in the loop between the fourth β-sheet and fourth α-helix. This conformational switch modulates the interaction of CheY with the flagellar motor, membrane sensor CheA, and regulator CheZ (35Zhu X.Y. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23758-23764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Given the remarkable structural conservation between CheY and the TIRs, it seems possible that the function of these homologous signaling domains also involves conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding or phosphotransfer. Finally, our analysis suggests that the Mal protein is related to Tube, an adaptor for the Drosophila Toll receptor. Until recently, it was thought that Tube was sufficient to establish signaling in the Drosophila Toll pathway. However, it is now clear that a direct homologue of vertebrate MyD88 is required in addition to Tube for both dorso-ventral patterning and for antifungal responses (15Tauszig-Delamasure S. Bilak H. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 36Kambris Z. Bilak H. D'Alessandro R. Belvin M. Imler J.L. Capovilla M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a situation reminiscent of the functional interdependence between vertebrate Mal and MyD88. Tube has a death domain sequence at the N-terminal, and this alone can restore some level of signaling by the Toll receptor (31Letsou A. Alexander S. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The homology identified is principally located at the N-terminal of Mal preceding the TIR, a region with a number of potential phosphorylation sites, which could fulfill a regulatory role. In contrast to Tube, Mal does not have a death domain and must therefore couple to the downstream signaling pathway in a manner distinct from MyD88. The functional interrelationships of Mal, Tube, and Drosophila and vertebrate MyD88 homologues suggest that the C-terminal of Tube serves a role comparable with that of a TIR and may be a highly degenerated example of this fold, which cannot be detected from primary sequence identity. These studies point to a mechanism by which TIR adaptors can be recruited in response to activation of the receptor. A further understanding of this problem requires the experimental determination of structures for receptor and adaptor TIR complexes. The emergence of additional TLR signaling adaptors adds further complexity to this question, and it is clear that extensive in vitro studies are required to understand the precise mechanism by which TLRs assemble into higher order complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1973523055,"Rac is activated in response to various stimuli including growth factors and by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. However, how these stimuli ultimately result in Rac activation is poorly understood. The increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+] i represents a ubiquitous second messenger system in cells, linking receptor activation to downstream signaling pathways. Here we show that elevation of [Ca2+] i , either artificially or by thrombin receptor activation, potently induces Rac activation. Lamellipodia formation induced by artificial elevation of [Ca2+] i is blocked by inhibition of Rac signaling, indicating that calcium-induced cytoskeletal changes are controlled by the activation of Rac. Calcium-dependent Rac activation was dependent on the activation of a conventional protein kinase C. Furthermore, both increased [Ca2+] i and protein kinase C activation induce phosphorylation of RhoGDIα and induce the translocation of cytosolic Rac to the plasma membrane. Intracellular calcium signaling may thus contribute to the intracellular localization and activation of Rac to regulate the cytoskeletal changes in response to receptor stimulation.

Lamellipodia formation induced by artificial elevation of [Ca2+] i is blocked by inhibition of Rac signaling, indicating that calcium-induced cytoskeletal changes are controlled by the activation of Rac. Calcium-dependent Rac activation was dependent on the activation of a conventional protein kinase C. Furthermore, both increased [Ca2+] i and protein kinase C activation induce phosphorylation of RhoGDIα and induce the translocation of cytosolic Rac to the plasma membrane. Intracellular calcium signaling may thus contribute to the intracellular localization and activation of Rac to regulate the cytoskeletal changes in response to receptor stimulation. The Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 isoforms, regulates different aspects of cytoskeletal organization, which are coordinated in the process of cell migration (1Hall A. Nobes C.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Of these, Rac is involved in the protrusion of lamellipodia, which occur principally at the leading edge of migrating cells but also emerge from around newly adherent cells to mediate cell spreading (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 3Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Rac also regulates gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and transformation in vitro (4Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A.

Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Rac is activated in response to various stimuli, including growth factors and adhesion to the extracellular matrix. However, how these stimuli ultimately result in Rac activation is poorly understood. The principal regulators of Rac activation are the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PKC, protein kinase C; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TRP, thrombin-related peptide; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PLC, phospholipase C; PH, pleckstrin homology; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester. and GTPase activating proteins. GEFs induce activation by exchanging GDP for GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins enhance the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, resulting in inactivation. In cells, Rac exists predominantly in its inactive GDP-bound form in a complex with RhoGDI (8Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). RhoGDI binds and masks the hydrophobic C-terminal region of Rac, the same region that is responsible for targeting Rac to the plasma membrane (9Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus RhoGDI maintains Rac in the cytoplasm and must dissociate to allow Rac to translocate to the membrane and interact with membrane-associated activators (10Stam J.C. Sander E.E.

Thus appropriate localization, as well as activation, is necessary for Rac to carry out its functions. Increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+] i represents a ubiquitous second messenger system in cells, linking receptor activation to downstream signaling pathways. Previous studies (15Price L.S.

Intracellular calcium is also required for thrombin- and collagen-induced Rac activation in platelets (19Soulet C. Gendreau S. Missy K. Benard V. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, however, chemoattractant-induced Rac activation is independent of intracellular calcium (20Geijsen N. van Delft S. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Collard J.G. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the relationship between calcium and Rac signaling is dependent on the cell type and/or the growth factor receptor involved. Ras-GRF 1 and 2, exchange factors specific for both Ras and Rac (21Fan W.T. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) whereas the Rac exchange factor, Tiam1, is phosphorylated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which leads to increased nucleotide exchange on Rac (24Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that nucleotide exchange on Rac may be regulated by changes in intracellular calcium. Various studies have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) in the activation of Rac. In Swiss 3T3 cells, phorbol ester treatment induces membrane ruffling, which is indicative of Rac activation (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), whereas PKC is required for PDGF-induce Rac activation in NIH 3T3 cells (25Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, how PKC affects Rac activity is unclear. Here we have examined the effect of intracellular calcium transients on Rac signaling. We find that intracellular calcium transients induce the membrane translocation and activation of Rac. We propose an additional mechanism of regulation of Rac by calcium whereby calcium induces a PKC-dependent disruption of the Rac-Rho GDI complex. This promotes the translocation of Rac to the plasma membrane where it can be activated by membrane-associated or membrane-translocated guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Materials—To generate the biotinylated CRIB peptide the amino acid sequence n-KERPEISLPSDFEHTIHVGFDAVTGEFTGMPEQWARLLQTSNIT-c was used and biotinylated during synthesis at the N terminus. The TAT-CRIB peptide contained the additional N-terminal sequence GCGYGRKKRRQRRR and was not biotinylated. Thrombinrelated peptide (TRP) was synthesized as described previously (26Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fura red, Oregon green, BAPTA-AM, and Alexa 568-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes. Thapsigargin, ionomycin, GF109203X (Gö 6850), U73122, calmidazolium chloride, and KN-93 were from Calbiochem. Streptavidin-agarose and PMA were from Sigma, and cytochalasin B was from Roche Applied Science. Cells and Generation of Stable Cell Lines by Retroviral Transduction—PC3 human prostate carcinoma cells (27Morton R.A. Ewing C.M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3585-3590PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and with 5% CO2. NIH 3T3-Tiam1 cells (28Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM + 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were seeded in tissue culture dishes 24 h before use to obtain a final density of ∼70% confluence. For microscopy, cells were seeded at lower density on glass coverslips and grown for 24 h. PC3 cells expressing EGFP-Rac1 were generated by infection with a retrovirus containing EGFP-Rac1 (29Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 30Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Janssen L. Nolan G. Collard J.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that EGFP-Rac1 was expressed at approximately the same level as endogenous Rac (not shown). EGFP-Rac1 was also functionally active as determined by Rac activation assays using thapsigargin as a stimulus (not shown). GTPase Activity Assays—Rac activity was assayed essentially as described previously (28Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), with the exception that instead of GST-Pak-CRIB a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the CRIB domain of Pak (see above) was used to precipitate active Rac. Briefly, after treatment of cells with the relevant inhibitors and stimuli, cells were washed and then lysed with a 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 2 μg/ml CRIB peptide. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and active Rac-CRIB complexes were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Rac was detected following Western blotting with anti-Rac antibodies (clone 23A8; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Live Cell Imaging of Calcium, PLC Activation, and GFP-tagged Rac—Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in PC3 cells were monitored ratiometrically by simultaneous confocal imaging of the Ca2+ indicators Oregon green 488, BAPTA-1AM, and Fura red-AM (31Williams D.A. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded for 30 min by incubation in DMEM with 10 μm of the AM-esters of these dyes in the presence of pluronic and incubated in fresh DMEM for 15 min prior to the experiment. Excitation was at 488 nm, and the emission was detected using a 522 ± 17-nm bandpass filter (green) and a 585-nm longpass filter (red). Measurements were performed at 37 °C in a buffer containing, in mm, 140 NaCl, 23 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose under 5% CO2. All measurements were calibrated using ionomycin. For simultaneous detection of phospholipase C activation and [Ca2+] i , PC3 cells were transfected overnight with pcDNA3-EGFP-PH (32van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and subsequently loaded with Fura red-AM and imaged as described above. PLC activation was visualized as translocation of the GFP-tagged, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-binding PH domain from the membrane to the cytosol and quantitated by taking the ratio of membrane to cytosolic fluorescence as described (32van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine the membrane association of GFP-tagged Rac1, medial sections ∼2 μm above the plane of the coverslip were imaged by confocal microscopy. These were captured at 10-s intervals and stored on disk for offline analysis. The mean fluorescence intensity at the membrane and at the cytosol was determined, and the ratio of those was plotted versus time, essentially as described (32van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PC3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells expressing Tiam1 were seeded on glass coverslips 24 h before use. Following treatment/stimulation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Filamentous actin was labeled with 0.2 μm Alexa 568-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Tiam1 was visualized with a polyclonal antibody (33Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Where cells were treated with TAT-CRIB peptide, peptide (0.2 mg/ml) was added for 15 min prior to stimulation. Calcium-dependent Phosphorylation by PKC—To visualize calcium-dependent phosphorylation of cellular proteins, PC3 cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and lysates cleared by centrifugation and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with Phospho(ser)PKC substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). GDI phosphorylation was detected as described previously (34Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC3 cells were starved of phosphate for 2 h and then metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. Cells were treated with or without GF109203X and stimulated with thapsigargin (1 μm) or PMA (100 nm). Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaPO4, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, 100 nm calyculin A, 10 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture). RhoGDI was precipitated with polyclonal anti-RhoGDIα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein G-Sepharose. Precipitated RhoGDI and RhoGDI from total cell lysates was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed with a monoclonal anti-RhoGDIα antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Cell Fractionation—After treatment/stimulation, PC3 cells in 2-cm dishes were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then washed again with permeabilization buffer (20 mm Na-PIPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then permeabilized with 25 μm digitonin in permeabilization buffer for 20 min to allow leakage of cytosolic proteins. Maximal leakage of Rac and complete leakage of the cytosolic markers mitogen-activated protein kinase and RhoGDIα was found to take place within 10 min. No E-cadherin, chosen as a representative trans-membrane protein, was extracted by digitonin treatment (not shown). The cytosol-depleted cells were then washed twice with digitonin-containing buffer and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and 5× SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatants. Proteins were resolved on 4–20% gradient gels (Novex), and following Western blotting, membranes were cut and probed with antibodies against Rac, anti-PKCα (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-pan-cadherin (Sigma) for normalization of (membrane) protein loading. Intracellular Calcium and Receptor-mediated Rac Activation—To study the relationship between intracellular calcium signaling and Rac function, we stimulated PC3 cells with the thrombin receptor agonist TRP and measured the effects on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i) and on activation of Rac. Stimulation of the thrombin receptor with TRP results in release of calcium from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores. As expected, stimulation of PC3 cells with TRP induced a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+] i (Fig. 1A). To assay Rac activity, we used a modified Rac pull-down assay, which utilizes a synthetic biotinylated peptide corresponding to a region of the Rac-interacting (CRIB) domain of the Rac effector, Pak (see “Experimental Procedures”). This region specifically binds to Rac when it is in its active conformation. The biotinylated CRIB peptide works equally efficiently as the GST-Pak fusion protein used in earlier studies (35Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 36Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) but is more stable and less susceptible to batch-to-batch variation. Stimulating the thrombin receptor with TRP induced a rapid activation of Rac in PC3 cells (Fig. 1B). Rac activation was transient, returning to baseline levels after ∼10 min (not shown). Treatment with TRP also induced extensive lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling (Fig. 2A, upper panels), which is consistent with an increase in Rac-GTP levels.Fig. 2Intracellular calcium is required for thrombin receptor dependent Rac activation. A, chelation of calcium with BAPTA-AM inhibits TRP-induced lamellipodia formation. BAPTA-AM (15 μm) was added to PC3 cells on glass coverslips for 10 min before stimulation with TRP for 5 min. Cells were then fixed, and F-actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, calcium chelation inhibits thrombin peptide-induced Rac activity. To chelate intracellular calcium, cells were treated with 15 μm BAPTA-AM for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated with 12.5 μm TRP for 5 min, and Rac activity was analyzed by pull-down assays. Average -fold induction of Rac activation ± S.D. is also shown (n = 4, BAPTA-AM significantly inhibited TRP-induced Rac activation; p = 0.04). C, calcium chelation does not disrupt receptor-phospholipase C signaling. Cells transiently expressing a GFP chimera of the PH domain of phospholipase Cδ were pre-treated with and without BAPTA-AM as above and stimulated with 12.5 μm TRP. Calcium traces (upper graphs) show the intracellular calcium concentration as reflected by changes in Fura red intensity. GFP-PH relocalization from membrane to cytosol (lower graphs) reflects activation of PLC and was imaged simultaneously with calcium in the same cell. BAPTA-AM abolishes the TRP-induced calcium transient (upper right trace) but not translocation of GFP-PH (lower right trace). At the end of the experiment, ionomycin (iono) and excess extracellular calcium were added to the medium to give maximal (100%) responses. The scale bar indicates percent change of basal fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether a causal relationship exists between increased [Ca2+] i and activation of Rac and lamellipodia formation by TRP, we first examined the effects of calcium chelation on TRP-induced morphological changes. Pre-treatment of PC3 cells with the membrane-permeable calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, strongly inhibited TRP-induced extension of lamellipodia (Fig. 2A), suggesting that lamellipodia formation was calcium-dependent. BAPTA-AM also inhibited TRP-induced Rac activation (Fig. 2B), suggesting that increased [Ca2+] i was required for Rac activation. To ensure that the effects of BAPTA-AM were not because of disrupted receptor signaling, we examined the effect of BAPTA-AM on TRP-induced PLC activation. For this, PC3 cells were transfected with a GFP chimera of the PH domain of PLC δ1, which translocates from plasma membrane to cytosol upon activation with TRP (37Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Confocal imaging of living cells showed that TRP induced the translocation of GFP-PH from membrane to cytosol, confirming previous findings that thrombin receptor activation leads to the activation of PLC. TRP induced GFP-PH translocation equally well in the presence or absence of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2C, lower traces). However, concomitant measurement of [Ca2+] i confirmed that BAPTA-AM treatment effectively blocked TRP-induced calcium transients (upper traces). This demonstrates that thrombin receptor-Gq-PLC signaling, which ultimately leads to release of intracellular calcium, is not disrupted by BAPTA-AM treatment. From these data we conclude that intracellular calcium is required for thrombin receptor-mediated Rac activation and lamellipodia formation. Increased [Ca2 + ]i Is Sufficient to Activate Rac—To examine further the dependence of Rac activation on calcium signaling, we used pharmacological modulators of [Ca2+] i. Treatment of PC3 cells with thapsigargin, which liberates calcium from intracellular stores by blocking re-uptake from the cytosol by Ca2+-ATPases, led to a transient elevation of [Ca2+] i that remained somewhat above baseline levels (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the time course of Rac activation showed that thapsigargin treatment induced a strong activation of Rac that was maximal at ∼5 min (Fig. 3B). Similarly, treatment of cells with ionomycin, which induces a rapid elevation of [Ca2+] i because of influx of extracellular calcium, also induced rapid activation of Rac (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, we observed consistently that the kinetics of calcium elevation appeared to correlate with that of Rac activation; thus, the prolonged elevation of [Ca2+] i induced by thapsigargin and ionomycin correlated with prolonged elevation of Rac activity, whereas TRP stimulation produced more transient increases in [Ca2+] i and Rac activation. Activation of Rac was not because of calcium-induced changes in spreading or other actin-dependent changes, because thapsigargin-induced Rac activity was not inhibited by cytochalasin treatment (not shown). From these results we conclude that elevation of intracellular calcium is sufficient to activate Rac in the absence of receptor stimulation. Our results also suggest that intracellular calcium mediates TRP-induced activation of Rac via the classical Gq-PLC-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of PLC inhibition, which is predicted to inhibit receptor-induced intracellular calcium increase but not calcium transients induced directly by thapsigargin. Pre-treatment of cells with the PLC inhibitor U73122 (38Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar, 39Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) inhibited TRP-induced Rac activation but not thapsigargin-induced Rac activation (Fig. 3E). Although we can not exclude the possibility that U73122 inhibited TRP-induced Rac activation nonspecifically, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that TRP-induced Rac activation is mediated by PLC-[Ca2+] i signaling and that direct elevation of [Ca2+] i can bypass the requirement for receptor-PLC signaling. We also examined the effects of increased [Ca2+] i on Rac activation in other cell types. In addition to PC3 cells, thapsigargin also induced Rac activation in T47D mammary carcinoma cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or lymphocytes (data not shown). This suggests that Ca2+-dependent Rac activation is cell type-specific and may be restricted to cells of epithelial origin. Calcium-induced Cytoskeletal Changes Are Mediated by Rac—Plasmid-based expression of the CRIB domain of Pak has been used previously (3Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 40Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) to inhibit the signaling of Rac to endogenous CRIB-containing targets. To examine the role of Rac in cell responses, we inhibited Rac signaling using a peptide corresponding to the CRIB domain of Pak combined with a TAT sequence to confer membrane permeability (see Ref. 41Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). We first tested the ability of the TAT-CRIB peptide to inhibit Rac signaling using NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing the Rac exchange factor Tiam1, which shows high levels of activated Rac and as a consequence extensive membrane ruffling (28Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Addition of TAT-CRIB peptide to the medium for 30 min dramatically attenuated Tiam1-mediated membrane ruffling in these cells, indicating that the peptide inhibits Rac downstream signaling (Fig. 4A). Control TAT peptides did not inhibit membrane ruffling (not shown). Treatment of cells with TAT-CRIB peptide for 30 min prior to thapsigargin stimulation also completely inhibited the subsequent detection of active Rac in cells (Fig. 4B), most likely because the TAT-CRIB blocked the binding of the biotinylated CRIB peptide used in the pull-down assay. The TAT-CRIB peptide can therefore be used as a tool to inhibit Rac function in living cells and avoids potential long-term effects of CRIB expression. We then used the TAT-CRIB peptide to examine the role of Rac in calcium-induced effects in PC3 cells. Thapsigargin and TRP induced extensive membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation at the cell cortex, which is indicative of Rac activation. This was strongly inhibited by pre-treatment with TAT-CRIB. From these results we conclude that the induction of lamellipodia by intracellular calcium is Rac-dependent. PKC Mediates Calcium-dependent Rac Activation and Phosphorylation of RhoGDI—In considering the mechanism by which intracellular calcium transients could mediate Rac activation, we first examined the possible role of GEFs. The GEFs GRF and Tiam1 both promote nucleotide exchange on Rac and arepotentialtargetsforregulationbycalmodulinandcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

https://openalex.org/W2002944156,"Sulfated tyrosines at the amino terminus of the principal HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 play a critical role in its ability to bind the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and mediate HIV-1 infection. Here, we show that a number of human antibodies directed against gp120 are tyrosine sulfated at their antigen binding sites. Like that of CCR5, antibody association with gp120 is dependent on sulfate moieties, enhanced by CD4, and inhibited by sulfated CCR5-derived peptides. Most of these antibodies preferentially associate with gp120 molecules of CCR5-utilizing (R5) isolates and neutralize primary R5 isolates more efficiently than laboratory-adapted isolates. These studies identify a distinct subset of CD4-induced HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies that closely emulate CCR5 and demonstrate that tyrosine sulfation can contribute to the potency and diversity of the human humoral response."
https://openalex.org/W1966985666,"We combined biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to investigate the ability of the α1a- and α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes to form homo- and hetero-oligomers. Receptors tagged with different epitopes (hemagglutinin and Myc) or fluorescent proteins (cyan and green fluorescent proteins) were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells either individually or in different combinations. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements provided evidence that both the α1a- and α1b-AR can form homo-oligomers with similar transfer efficiency of ∼0.10. Hetero-oligomers could also be observed between the α1b- and the α1a-AR subtypes but not between the α1b-AR and the β2-AR, the NK1 tachykinin, or the CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization of the α1b-AR did not require the integrity of its C-tail, of two glycophorin motifs, or of the N-linked glycosylation sites at its N terminus. In contrast, helix I and, to a lesser extent, helix VII were found to play a role in the α1b-AR homo-oligomerization. Receptor oligomerization was not influenced by the agonist epinephrine or by the inverse agonist prazosin. A constitutively active (A293E) as well as a signaling-deficient (R143E) mutant displayed oligomerization features similar to those of the wild type α1b-AR. Confocal imaging revealed that oligomerization of the α1-AR subtypes correlated with their ability to co-internalize upon exposure to the agonist. The α1a-selective agonist oxymetazoline induced the co-internalization of the α1a- and α1b-AR, whereas the α1b-AR could not co-internalize with the NK1 tachykinin or CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization might therefore represent an additional mechanism regulating the physiological responses mediated by the α1a- and α1b-AR subtypes.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AR, adrenergic receptor(s); G protein, guanylyl nucleotide binding regulatory protein; IP, inositol phosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; [125I]HEAT, [125I]iodo-2-[β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl]tetralone; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent proteins; HA, hemagglutinin; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid, type B; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. known also as heptahelical receptors, form the largest family of transmembrane signaling proteins transducing signals arising from ions, hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, chemoattractants, and photons. GPCRs were for a long time presumed to function as monomers according to the prevailing model: one ligand molecule-one receptor-one G protein. Recently, increasing complexity of GPCR function and regulation has progressively emerged. For example, one GPCR can adopt multiple conformational states able to interact differentially with signaling and regulatory proteins (1Ghanouni P. Gryczynski Z. Steenhuis J.J. Lee T.W. Farrens D.L.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, receptor cross-talks both at the G protein and at downstream signaling levels have often been described (3Hur E.M. Kim K.T. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Selbie L.A. Hill S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that cross-talk among GPCRs can also occur at the receptor level by means of receptor oligomerization (reviewed in Refs. 5Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). One of the early indications suggesting the capacity of GPCRs to oligomerize came from pharmacological studies showing positive or negative cooperativity of ligand binding curves. More recent support was provided by some “complementation” studies in which co-expression of two GPCR mutants could rescue their functional defects (8Maggio R. Barbier P. Colelli A. Salvadori F. Demontis G. Corsini G.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 251-257PubMed Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as evidence of inter-molecular interactions between two receptor mutants according to a “domain swapping” model (9Gouldson P.R. Higgs C. Smith R.E. Dean M.K. Gkoutos G.V. Reynolds C.A. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: S60-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further indication of GPCR oligomerization came from a large number of studies using co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged receptors co-expressed in the same cells or fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor such oligomers in live cells (reviewed in Refs. 5Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of GPCR oligomerization is not yet fully understood. Co-immunoprecipitation relies on receptor solubilization, which can result in artifactual aggregation of the proteins. To overcome these limits fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, like fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, have been increasingly used. It is widely accepted that energy transfer measurements are well suited to monitor protein-protein interactions or proximity in live cells, as FRET only occurs when the distance between the two fluorophores falls below ∼100 Å (10Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). So far, in virtually all studies an increased energy transfer signal between GPCRs has been interpreted as the evidence for receptor oligomerization. However, whether receptor oligomerization involves intramolecular interactions among receptors versus their increased proximity within the cell membrane without direct contact cannot be unequivocally demonstrated either by the energy transfer measurements or by the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Therefore, in this study the term receptor “oligomerization” will be used bearing in mind that the precise molecular events underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. The functional implication of the existence of GPCR homo- and hetero-oligomers has been addressed by several studies. The strongest evidence supporting the functional importance of hetero-oligomerization came from studies on the metabotropic GABAB receptor. The full reconstitution of the functional activity of the GABAB receptor requires the oligomerization between the GABAB-R1 and GABAB-R2 receptor monomers (11Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). For other GPCRs, a role of oligomerization in receptor signaling as well as internalization has been suggested (reviewed in Refs. 5Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, much work is still required to elucidate how oligomerization is involved in these distinct processes. In addition, whereas the majority of studies was performed in recombinant systems, only in a few cases was evidence provided that GPCR oligomerization occurs in physiological systems. For example, in a recent study hetero-oligomers formed by the adenosine A1 and glutamate mGluR1 receptors were isolated from cerebellar neuronal cultures (12Ciruela F. Escriche M. Burgueno J. Angulo E. Casado V. Soloviev M.M. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Chan W.Y. Lluis C. McIlhinney R.A. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18345-18351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, hetero-oligomers formed by the angiotensin II AT1 and bradykinin B2 receptors were isolated in platelets of pre-eclamptic pregnant women (13AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Massiery A. Quitterer U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Within the adrenergic receptor (AR) family, oligomerization has been extensively studied for the β2-AR (14Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Hebert T.E. Loisel T.P. Adam L. Ethier N. Onge S.S. Bouvier M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar), and these studies have often represented an important reference for investigating the oligomerization of other GPCRs. The β2-AR can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers with the δ- and κ-opioid receptors (17Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with the β1-AR (18Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D. Breit A. Villeneuve L.R. Zhu W.Z. Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35402-35410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Homo-oligomerization of the β2-AR is constitutive, but it can also be enhanced by exposure to the agonist (16Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the amount of information available for the β2-AR and several other GPCRs, nothing is known so far on the putative oligomeric state of the α1-AR subtypes. In this study we extensively investigated the ability of the α1a- and α1b-AR subtypes to oligomerize using biophysical, biochemical, as well as pharmacological approaches. FRET measurements provided solid evidence that both recombinant α1a- and α1b-AR subtypes can selectively form homo- and hetero-oligomers. Our results suggest that the homo-oligomerization of the α1b-AR involves the participation of helix I and, to a lesser extent, of helix VII. The results of confocal imaging strongly suggest that receptor oligomerization plays a role in receptor endocytosis, which might have implications for the physiological responses mediated by the α1a- and α1b-AR subtypes.

Construction of Receptor-GFP and CFP Fusion Proteins and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length cDNA encoding the hamster α1b-AR (19Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 and pECFP-N1 vectors using EcoRI/AgeI to give the α1b-pEGFP-N1 and α1b-pECFP-N1 vectors, respectively. The cDNA encoding the α1b-AR fused to GFP (α1b-GFP) was also subcloned in the pRK5 using EcoRI/XbaI to give the α1b-GFP-pRK5 vector. The Thr369-GFP, Thr369-CFP, and Thr369-YFP constructs were obtained by PCR-amplifying a DNA fragment of the α1b encompassing amino acids 1-369 and subcloning it at the EcoRI-AgeI sites into the α1b-GFP-pRK5, α1b-pECFP-N1, and pEYFP-N1 vectors, respectively. The R143E-GFP and A293E-GFP constructs were obtained by replacing the EcoRI-BssHII fragment of the previously described R143E and A293E mutants (20Scheer A. Costa T. Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) into the α1b-GFP-pRK5 vector. The G53L and G301L mutants were constructed by PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into the α1b-GFP-pRK5 vector to give the G53L-GFP and G301L-GFP constructs, respectively. The construction of the N-glycosylation-deficient mutant N4 fused to GFP (N4-GFP) was described previously (22Bjorklof K. Lundstrom K. Abuin L. Greasley P.J. Cotecchia S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4281-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fragments of the α1b-AR lacking different transmembrane helices were constructed by PCR introducing EcoRI and BssHII sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and subcloned into the Thr369-YFP at the EcoRI site (which is in the 5′-untranslated) and BssHII site (corresponding to amino acids 356 and 357). The receptor fragments engineered were the following: α1b(I-III), amino acids 1-148; α1b(I-V), amino acids 1-231; α1b(III-VII), amino acids 112-369; and α1b(V-VII), amino acids 195-369. All the fragments included 4-5 residues beyond the helical portion as well as also amino acids 356-369 of the C-tail before the fluorophore. The α1b/β2 adrenergic chimeric receptors were constructed using PCR by replacing each helix of the hamster α1b-AR with the corresponding segment of the human β2-AR. The helices were defined based on sequence alignment and on the x-ray structure of rhodopsin. The residues of the α1b-AR replaced with those of the β2-AR for each helix (h) were the following: hI (Ala45-Ala71 α1b/Val33-Ala59 β2); hII (Thr80—Val107 α1b/Thr68-Leu95 β2); hIII (Phe117-Tyr144 α1b/Trp105-Tyr133 β2); hIV (Ala162-Leu181 α1b/Ala150-Ile169 β2); hV (Tyr203-Val226α1b/Tyr199-Val222 β2); hVI (Arg288-Leu316 α1b/Lys267-Val295 β2); hVII (Val329-Ile362 α1b/Val307-Leu340 β2). The percentage of sequence identity between the portions replaced in each helix was 38% for hI, 50% for hII, 57% for hIII, 30% for hIV, 50% for hV, 65% for hVI, and 41% for hVII. The full-length cDNA encoding the human α1a-AR (23Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 and pECFP-N1 vectors using EcoRI/AgeI (blunted) to give the α1a-GFP and α1a-CFP constructs, respectively. The full-length cDNA encoding the human β2-AR was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 using HindIII/AgeI to give the β2-GFP construct. The full-length cDNA encoding the chemokine CCR5 receptor was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pECFP-N1 using HindIII/AgeI to give the CCR5-CFP construct. Construction of Epitope-tagged Receptors—The C-terminal fragments of the α1a-AR and the α1b-AR were amplified using primers encoding the HA (YPYDVPDYA) or Myc (EQKLISEEDL) epitopes at the 3′ end and inserted into the α1b-AR-pRK5 (using BamHI/HindIII) or α1a-AR-pRK5 (using EcoRV/BamHI) vectors, respectively. The full-length cDNA encoding the chemokine CCR5 receptor was PCR-amplified using a primer encoding the Myc epitope at the 5′ end and subcloned into the pRK5 vector using BamHI/HindIII. The full-length cDNA encoding the tachykinin NK1 receptor was amplified using a primer encoding the Myc epitope at the 3′ end and subcloned into the pRK5 vector using EcoRI/HindIII. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) (37 °C and 5% CO2) and transfected using the calcium-phosphate method or the transfection reagent Effectene following the manufacturer's protocol. For inositol phosphate determination, cells (0.15 × 106) were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.2-0.5 μg/well using Effectene. For ligand binding, FRET, and immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with a maximum of 20 μg of DNA/dish using the calcium-phosphate method. For confocal imaging cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes and transfected with 1-2 μg of DNA/well using the calcium-phosphate method. For cells transfected with different combinations of plasmids, the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant in the samples using pRK5. Membrane Preparation and Ligand Binding—48 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, scraped off the culture plates, and collected in ice-cold membrane buffer (5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 40,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold membrane buffer and Polytron-homogenized. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay. For ligand binding of [125I]HEAT, the membranes were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with the radioligand for 1 h at 25 °C. [125I]HEAT was used at a concentration of 250 pm for measuring receptor expression at a single concentration and of 80 pm for competition binding analysis. For saturation binding experiments, the radioligand concentration ranged between 10 and 400 pm. Prazosin at 10-6m was used to determine nonspecific binding. Saturation analysis and competition curves were analyzed using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—24-36 h after transfection, cells were labeled for 12 h with myo-[3H]inositol at 4 μCi/ml in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were pre-incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 20 mm LiCl and then stimulated for 45 min with different concentrations of epinephrine. Total inositol phosphates were extracted and separated as described previously (19Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (65 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) for 1 h at room temperature, separated on 10% acrylamide gels, and electroblotted onto Immobilon membranes. Blots were incubated in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8) containing 0.05% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) powder milk, and the primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-HA or anti-Myc) diluted 1:200. After the primary antibody was washed, the secondary anti-mouse antibody linked to horse-radish peroxidase was added, and the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. Immunoprecipitation of Receptors—36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped off the culture plates in ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm Tris and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 40,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture. Solubilization was carried out for 3 h at 4 °C on a spinning wheel. Unsolubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g on a bench-top centrifuge. The supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA polyclonal antibody overnight on the spinning wheel at 4 °C. After addition of 2.5% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose, the incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a brief centrifugation on a bench-top centrifuge. The pellet was washed three times in the lysis buffer, once in PBS, and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—48 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and detached from the plates using PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The cells from one 10-cm culture dish were resuspended in 1 ml of isotonic buffer (137.5 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) and used in spectrofluorimetric measurements. Cells were routinely co-transfected with equal amounts of plasmids encoding the receptors fused to GFP or to CFP (5-10 μg of each plasmid/100-mm diameter dish) in order to approach a CFP:GFP ratio of 1. Fluorescence spectra of cell suspensions were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog II (Instruments S.A., Stanmore, UK). Samples were placed in a 10 × 4-mm2 quartz cuvette (Hellma, Germany) and continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2-nm band path. CFP and GFP were excited at 430 and 488 nm, respectively, and their fluorescence measured at 450-540 and 500-540 nm, respectively. The spectral contributions arising from light scattering and nonspecific fluorescence of the cells were eliminated by subtracting the emission spectra of mock-transfected cells from the fluorescence spectra of cells expressing the receptor-CFP and GFP constructs. To do so, we measured the emission intensity at 450 nm upon excitation at 430 nm, considering that CFP or GFP fluorescence is negligible and that only light scattering contributes to emission at this wavelength. We then calculated the ratio between the intensities at 450 nm in mock-transfected versus cells expressing the fluorescent receptors and used it as a correction factor F(background). The spectrum of the mock-transfected cells divided by the F(background) was then subtracted from the spectrum of the cells expressing receptor-CFP and GFP constructs. To take into account the differences in expression level of the receptor-CFP and -GFP constructs in co-transfected cells, a second normalization step was adopted. The fluorescence spectra of cells individually expressing the receptor-CFP and -GFP constructs were measured and divided by a correction factor F. For the receptor-CFP excited at 430 nm: F(CFP) = CFP(430/465)/CFP and GFP(430/465). For the receptor-GFP excited at 430 nm: F(GFP) = GFP(490/510)/CFP and GFP(490/510). After normalizing for cell density, FRET was measured by subtracting from the emission spectrum of cells expressing both fluorescent receptors the emission spectra obtained by excitation at 430 nm of cells individually expressing the receptor-CFP and GFP constructs, each divided by its respective correction factor F. The resulting spectrum in cells expressing both fluorescent receptors corresponds to GFP emission arising exclusively from FRET. The transfer efficiency E was determined as shown in Equations 1 and 2, E=AA(λD)AD(λD)IAD(λD,λA(emi)IA(λD,λA(emi)-1(Eq. 1) where AA(λD)AD(λD)=ϵA(λD)ϵD(λD)·IA(λA,λA(emi))·ϵD(λD)ϕD(λD(emi))IDA(λD,λD(emi))1-E·ϵA(λA)ϕA(λA(emi))(Eq. 2) and λD, 430 nm; λA, 490 nm; λD(emi), 475 nm; λA(emi), 510 nm; absorption coefficient of the donor at λD, ϵA(λD) = 13,750 cm-1m-1; absorption coefficient of the acceptor at λA, ϵA(λA) = 55,000 cm-1m-1; fluorescence quantum yield of the donor, [phis]D = 0.4; fluorescence quantum yield of the acceptor, [phis]A = 0.6; A A(λD), acceptor absorbance at the wavelength of donor excitation; A D(λD), donor absorbance at the wavelength of donor excitation; I A(λD, λA(emi)), fluorescence intensity of the acceptor at λA(emi) when excited at λD; I AD(λD, λA(emi)), fluorescence intensity of the acceptor at λA(emi) when excited at λD in the presence of the donor; I DA(λD, λDem), fluorescence intensity of the donor at λD(emi) when excited at λD in the presence of the acceptor. The GFP:CFP ratio was given by Equation 3, CACD=IA(λA,λA(emi))·ϵD(λD)ϕD(λD(emi))IDA(λD,λD(emi))1-E·ϵA(λA)ϕA(λA(emi))(Eq. 3) where CD is the concentration of the donor (CFP); CA is the concentration of the acceptor (GFP). For FRET measurements on receptor fragments fused to YFP, the elaboration of the results described above was adapted to fit the YFP properties. CFP and YFP were excited at 430 and 500 nm, respectively, and their fluorescence was measured at 450-570 and 520-570 nm, respectively. In this case, the acceptor parameters used are as follows: λA, 500 nm; λA(emi), 530 nm; quantum yield of acceptor [phis]A, 0.6; ϵA(λD), 3530 cm-1m-1; ϵA(λA) = 43,700 cm-1m-1. To determine the effect of ligands on FRET efficiency, cell suspensions were incubated at saturating concentrations of epinephrine (10-4m) or prazosin (10-6m) for 15 min at 37 °C under gentle shaking. Spectra of treated and untreated cells were recorded at 37 °C. Internalization Experiments—36 h after transfection, cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 1 h with vehicle or with a saturating concentration of different agonists (10-4m epinephrine, 10-5m oxymetazoline, 10-4m substance P, or 10-6m RANTES). After treatment, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with formaldehyde, and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton. For immunostaining of cells expressing the HA-tagged receptors, the cells were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% BSA and for another hour in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and the polyclonal anti-HA antibody was diluted at 1:100. After a second incubation with the anti-rabbit rhodamine-coupled antibody diluted at 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted in Prolong mounting medium. For immunostaining of cells co-expressing the α1b-HA and myc-CCR5, the polyclonal anti-HA and the monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies were used, followed by the anti-rabbit FITC-coupled and the anti-mouse rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies. Cells immunostained with fluorescent antibodies were analyzed by confocal imaging. Confocal Imaging—Cells expressing different fluorescent receptors were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a C-apochromat ×63/1.2-watt water immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany). The following laser lines were used for excitation: 458 nm for CFP, 488 nm for GFP and FITC, and 543 nm for rhodamine. The following Zeiss filter sets were used to detect the fluorescence of a particular fluorophore: LP475 for CFP, BP505-550 for GFP and FITC, and LP543 for rhodamine. The pinhole was kept at ∼1 airy unit for all recordings. Functional Characterization of the Tagged Receptors—To investigate the pharmacological properties of the α1-AR subtypes tagged with different epitopes (HA and Myc) or fluorescent proteins (GFP and CFP), the receptors were expressed in HEK-293 cells and tested for their ability to bind the radioligand [125I]HEAT and epinephrine. Saturation binding experiments indicated that the K D values of [125I]HEAT were similar at the various tagged or non-tagged α1-AR constructs (results not shown). As shown in Table I, the expression levels of the various receptors ranged between 300 and 900 fmol/well. The IC50 values of epinephrine were similar at the tagged or non-tagged wild typ"

Two isoforms of Epac, Epac1 and Epac2, were described in mammalian cells, both containing a regulatory and a catalytic region (Fig. 1). The catalytic region contains a CDC25 homology domain and a Ras exchange motif domain. Whereas the CDC25-homology domain alone is sufficient to mediate the catalytic activity (3Coccetti P. Mauri I. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the Ras exchange motif domain of SOS has been shown to stabilize the CDC25-homology domain structurally without being directly involved in the interaction with Ras (5Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). More recently, an activity-modulating function of the Ras exchange motif domain was suggested (6Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain of Epac contains a cAMP-binding domain and a DEP domain. The DEP domain mediates membrane localization of Epac and is not involved in regulation of the exchange activity in vitro. The cAMP binding domain inhibits the catalytic activity in the absence of cAMP. The inhibition is released after binding of cAMP. An additional N-terminal cAMP binding domain is present in Epac2. This domain is not required to maintain the inactive state of Epac2 in the absence of cAMP (7de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Insight into the structural basis of the regulatory mechanism was obtained from the x-ray structure of the regulatory region of Epac2 containing both the cAMP binding domains and the DEP domain. The structure was solved in the absence of cAMP and was the first structure of a cAMP binding domain in the ligand-free state (8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on a structural comparison with cAMP-bound regulatory subunits of PKA (9Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) it was proposed that cAMP binding induces a conformational change in the phosphate binding cassette (8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This conformational change allows a C-terminal helix containing a hinge region and a lid region to bend toward the cAMP binding site and to cover cAMP (8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Considering the high conservation of residues involved in the conformational change, the proposed model seems to account for the activation of not only Epac but also PKAs and cAMP-regulated ion channels. When analyzing the role of the lid region of Epac in more detail, we observed that a conserved VLVLE sequence in the C-terminal end of the lid region is mediating the inhibition of the catalytic region. Indeed, mutation of this region resulted in a constitutively active Epac. Surprisingly, single point mutations in the lid region either abolished cAMP-induced activity almost completely or resulted in an activity even higher then that of the wt protein. This indicated that after binding of cAMP, the lid region regulates the activation status of Epac (11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel cAMP analogue, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, that binds and activates Epac efficiently both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, this compound was completely insensitive in activating PKA both in vitro and in vivo (12Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP further and noted Epac that bound to this compound had a 3-fold higher v max than Epac bound to cAMP. By testing other cAMP analogues and by mutational analysis, we found that the 2′-OH atom of cAMP is responsible for the super-activation. We propose a model of how it communicates with the lid region. Preparation of Proteins—All Epac constructs were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins from the pGEX-4T2 vector in the Escherichia coli strain CK600K as described previously (13Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All constructs are human Epac1 and correspond to the following amino acids: Epac, 149–881; Epac149–328, 149–328. Mutations were introduced according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The C-terminal truncated version of Rap1B was expressed and loaded with 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP as described previously (14van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we refer to this construct as Rap1B or simply Rap1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To analyze the binding of cAMP to the isolated cAMP-binding domain, a microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) was used. For details see Rehmann et al. (11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In Vitro Activation of Rap1—The experiments were performed as described earlier (11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 nm of Rap1B loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP were incubated in the presence of 20 μm GDP (Sigma) and 100 nm Epac. cAMP (Sigma) and analogues thereof were added as indicated for the individual experiments. Cyclic nucleotides except cAMP itself were obtained from BIOLOG Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). The nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as decay in fluorescence using a spectrofluorometer “spex1” (Spex Inc.). The origin of the decay is the release of the protein bound mGDP, which shows a higher fluorescence intensity in the hydrophobic environment of the protein than in the buffer solution. The obtained data were fitted to a single exponential decay and obtained rate constants (k obs) were plotted against the cAMP concentration. The concentration dependence of the rate constants were treated as a normal titration experiment. All data analysis, fitting, and plotting were done with the Grafit 3.0 program (Erithacus Software). Interactions of Epac with Various cNMPs—We have used the isolated cAMP-binding domain of Epac 1, Epac-RD149–328, to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd for the nucleotides cAMP, cGMP, cIMP, and cXMP (Fig. 1A) by isothermal titration calorimetry. Interestingly, although cAMP has the highest affinity (3.3 μm) of the cyclic nucleotides tested, the affinities of cIMP (6.4 μm), cGMP (14 μm), and cXMP (20 μm) are of similar magnitude. Next, we investigated whether these nucleotides are able to activate Epac using a fluorescence-based assay, where the ability of Epac to act as a GEF for Rap1 is tested with increasing concentration of nucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 14van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). From this we derive the half-maximal concentration for activation, AC50, and the maximal rate of exchange under saturating concentration of activator k max. Whereas cAMP activated Epac with the expected AC50 of about 45 μm (Fig. 2A and Ref. 8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), neither cGMP (Fig. 2A) nor the other cyclic nucleotides (data not shown) were able to activate Epac significantly. To investigate whether the failure of cGMP, cIMP, and cXMP to activate Epac is caused by a failure to bind to full-length Epac149–881, we measured whether these cNMPs were able to inhibit the cAMP-induced activation. As shown in Fig. 2B, cIMP indeed inhibited cAMP-induced activation of Epac. The IC50 of cIMP to inhibit Epac in the presence of 60 μm cAMP is approximately 200 μm, compatible with a 2–3-fold lower affinity of cIMP compared with cAMP. Similar results were obtained for cGMP and cXMP (data not shown). The RAAT motif is conserved in the regulatory domains of cAMP dependent kinases and is replaced by RTAT/N in cGMP-dependent kinases. It was shown that A-to-T mutations in PKA change the selectivity from cAMP to cGMP and vice versa (15Shabb J.B. Buzzeo B.D. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24320-24326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Shabb J.B. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16031-16034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of EpacRD149–328 the A280T mutation does indeed increase the affinity for cGMP, whereas the affinity for cAMP is not altered (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, in the context of the auto-inhibited Epac, the mutant shows not an improved activation behavior after stimulation with cGMP but rather a 2-fold reduction of k max after activation by cAMP (Fig. 2A). From these results, we conclude that although a number of cyclic nucleotides can bind to Epac, only cAMP is able to activate its GEF activity for Rap1. cAMP differs from the other three cNMPs by the structure of the nucleotide base, and cGMP, cIMP, and cXMP have in common that the 6-amino group of the base in cAMP is replaced by oxygen. To investigate whether indeed the N6 group is crucial for the activation of Epac, we tested the activity of the commonly employed N6-phenyl-cAMP analogue in vitro. As expected, this compound did not activate Epac (data not shown) but inhibits cAMP-induced activation in vitro rather efficiently (Fig. 2C). Modification of the Cyclic Phosphate—The exocyclic oxygens of the phosphate group, which are not involved in the ring formation, can be replaced by sulfur in a stereo-specific manner generating Rp- and Sp-cAMPS isomers, respectively (Fig. 1). Rp-cAMPS is an inhibitor of PKA, whereas Sp-cAMPS, which has a strongly reduced affinity, is able to activate PKA (18Van Haastert P.J. Van Driel R. Jastorff B. Baraniak J. Stec W.J. De Wit R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10020-10024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Botelho L.H. Rothermel J.D. Coombs R.V. Jastorff B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Similar to the findings for PKA, Rp-cAMPS does not active Epac but rather inhibits cAMP-induced activation of Epac (Fig. 3, A and B). In analogy to PKA, Sp-cAMPS is able to activate Epac (Fig. 3B), with a slight modification of both AC50 and k max. Modifications at the 8- and 2-Positions of the Base—To optimize the membrane permeability of cAMP, the 8-position of the base is often modified. We have tested a number of these analogues for their effect on the activation of GEF activity of Epac. All 8-modified analogues tested are active, but the maximal GEF activity at saturating concentrations of is reduced (Fig. 4A). In addition, these modifications affect the AC50, many of them activating more efficiently than cAMP. Most notable is the 50-fold decrease in AC50 of 8-pCPT-cAMP compared with cAMP (Fig. 4). Whereas all 8-modifications activate Epac and affect both the k max and the AC50, 2-chloro-cAMP has k max and AC50 values for Epac similar to those of cAMP (data not shown). Modification of the 2′-Position of the Ribose—One of the most striking differences between the cAMP-binding domains of Epac and those of other proteins is the presence of a glutamine at position 270 of Epac, which corresponds to a glutamate that is totally conserved in all other cAMP- or cGMP-binding proteins. Because in PKA this glutamate was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH group of the ribose (9Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and was shown to be crucial for high affinity binding (20Yagura T.S. Miller J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we wondered whether Epac would tolerate modifications of the 2′-OH group. Its “deletion” in 2′-deoxy-cAMP results in a drastic increase of the AC50, and k max could not be reached even at 1000 μm nucleotide (Fig. 5A). This argues that the 2′-OH group is important for binding and activation. To maintain the oxygen, we generate 2′-O-Me-cAMP and found a more moderate reduction of the AC50, which was estimated to be in the rage of 100 μm. Surprisingly, 2′-O-Me-cAMP induced guanine nucleotide exchange rates (k obs) much higher then the k max of cAMP, even though 2′-O-Me-cAMP was used at non-saturating conditions. Because the 8-pCPT modification was found to decrease the AC50 (Fig. 4A), we wondered whether this positive effect on affinity could be combined with the positive effect on k max of the 2′-O-Me substitution. Indeed, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP showed a decreased AC50 and an increased k max (Fig. 5, A and C). The AC50 of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (1.8 μm) is only slightly lower than the AC50 of 8-pCPT-cAMP (0.9 μm) and still 25 times lower than the AC50 found for cAMP. In addition, the k max of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is 7.2-fold higher than 8-pCPT-cAMP and still 3.6-fold higher than cAMP. To demonstrate that this superactivation of Epac by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is caused by a change in equilibrium between an active an inactive conformation of Epac, not by any different conditions of the assay, we incubated Epac induced by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP with increasing concentrations of cAMP. We found that with increasing concentrations of cAMP, the GEF activity reduced to a level observed for cAMP alone. Similarly, 8-chloro-cAMP inhibits 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-induced GEF activity to a level normally achieved by this analogue, which is half that of cAMP. We can thus conclude that the diverse effects of the 8-pCPT and the 2′-O-Me modifications on inducing GEF activity can be combined to create a super-activating cAMP analogue that specifically activates Epac and can be used as a tool to decipher the role of Rap1 in signal transduction pathways (12Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 21Kang G.

Role of the Gln-270 in Binding and Activation—To analyze the role of Q270 in the interaction with the 2′OH group of cAMP we generated the mutants EpacQ270A and EpacQ270E. The mutation Q270E mimics the residue conserved in PKA. Importantly, the affinity of cAMP for the isolated cAMP-binding domains of both mutants was not affected, demonstrating that unlike PKA, this residue is not involved in binding of cAMP (Fig. 6B). The mutants were then further analyzed, in the context of the auto-inhibited Epac, for their activation properties in response to stimulation by cAMP, 2′-deoxy-cAMP, and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (Fig. 6A). For cAMP, a 2-fold higher k max was observed for both mutants, whereas the AC50 remained unaffected, indicating that Gln-270 is not crucial for the activation mechanism of cAMP and, if anything, has an inhibitory role on full activation. Activation by 8-pCPT-2′-OMe-cAMP is differently affected by the two mutations: whereas the Q270E mutation had no effect on the k max but slightly decreased the AC50, the Q270A mutation decreased k max and left the AC50 unaffected. The AC50 of 2′deoxy-cAMP is too high to determine k max either for wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig. 6). From these results, we conclude that the presence of a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor in the position of residue Gln-270 does contribute to normal activation by cAMP and super-activation by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP in a manner that is not immediately obvious in the absence of a cAMP-bound 3D structure. The lid Region Is Involved in Super-activation—Recently we mutated conserved polar residues Glu-308, Thr-311, Arg-313, and His-317 in the lid of Epac1 (11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As isolated cAMP-binding domains, these mutant proteins have a 2-fold lower affinity for cAMP (except H317A, for which the affinity for cAMP was unaffected). In addition, these mutations affected cAMP-induced activation of Epac (Ref. 11Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Fig. 7). By comparing the effects of cAMP, 8-pCPT-cAMP, and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, we observe that R313A and T311A have a roughly similar effect on the activation of Epac by both cAMP and 8-pCPT-cAMP but, surprisingly, an opposite effect on the activation by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (Fig. 7), R313A did not influence the k max of 8-pCPT-cAMP and cAMP but reduced the k max of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP almost 2-fold. T311A increased the k max of cAMP and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP 2-fold, but has no effect on the k max of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. For H317A, the k max achieved with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me was greatly reduced compared with wild type, whereas for E308A, the k max was even increased by about 25%. In addition, the AC50 of the analogues was affected by the mutations. Most notably, although the affinity for cAMP for the isolated cAMP-binding domain of T311A and T311A was reduced, the AC50 was considerably lower. From these results, we conclude that the lid region is involved in the super-activation of Epac by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. In particular, the differential effect of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP compared with cAMP and 8-pCPT-cAMP on R313A and T311A indicates that the 2′-O-Megroup communicates with the lid to induce super-activation. We have analyzed the effect of various cAMP analogues on their effects on Epac activation in vitro. We first noted that although cGMP, cIMP, and cXMP do bind to Epac with an affinity similar to cAMP, they are unable to activate Epac. This implies that the composition of the base, particularly the N6 position, is absolutely critical for the activation of Epac. In contrasts, cGMP, cIMP, and cXMP are competitive inhibitors. Because the IC50 is the upper micromolar range, it is unlikely that this inhibition is physiologically relevant. In this respect, Epac differs from PKA. Both cGMP (15Shabb J.B. Buzzeo B.D. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24320-24326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cIMP (22Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. Miller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are able to fully activate PKA, although only at high concentrations. Similarly, N6-phenyl-cAMP inhibits Epac but activates PKA (22Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. Miller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these nucleotides have an identical cyclic-phosphate ribose group; thus, the interaction of the base, presumably with the lid, determines the difference. Apparently, alterations in the N6 position of cAMP abolishes the ability of cyclic nucleotides to activate Epac but not PKA. This implies that suitably N6-altered cAMP-analogues may be able to differentiate between PKA and Epac. With respect to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, the RAAT and the RTAT/N motif were identified to determine the cAMP and cGMP specificity, respectively. From modeling studies, an extra hydrogen bound between the 2-NH2 group of the guanine and the first threonine in RTAT/N was predicted (23Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These theoretical considerations were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis for both PKA (17Shabb J.B. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16031-16034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26739-26746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and PKG (16Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which demonstrated an increased cGMP affinity because of the presence of the threonine. Similarly, EpacRD149–328A280T showed an increased affinity for cGMP as well. However, EpacA280T showed no improved activation by cGMP in terms of k max. Thus, the A/T conversion increased the affinity of cGMP for Epac but had no effect on the activation of Epac by cGMP. Interestingly, as predicted from studies with PKA (15Shabb J.B. Buzzeo B.D. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24320-24326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PKG (16Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the A/T conversion had little or no affect on the affinity for cAMP. However it did reduce the maximal activation of Epac by cAMP, showing that the RAAT sequence is involved not only in conferring specificity in binding but also in transferring the cAMP binding information to the activation of Epac. From the structural analysis of Epac and PKA, it was clear that the cyclic phosphate group is critical for the activation of both proteins. Indeed, Rp-cAMPS, in which one of the free oxygens of the phosphate group is replaced by a sulfur atom, is an inhibitor of PKA (18Van Haastert P.J. Van Driel R. Jastorff B. Baraniak J. Stec W.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas Rp-cGMPS inhibits PKG (25Butt E. van Bemmelen M. Fischer L. Walter U. Jastorff B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, Rp-cAMPS also inhibits cAMP-induced Epac activation. This supports strongly the common activation mechanism of these proteins as we proposed previously (8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); i.e. the replacement of the equatorial oxygen perturbs the hydrogen bonding between the phosphate and an alanine in the phosphate binding cassette and prevents the reorientation of the phosphate binding cassette, the first step in the activation of both proteins. Modifications at the 8-position of the base are commonly used as cNMP analogues for PKA and PKG, because these modifications both increase the permeability for cells and reduce the AC50 to activate these proteins (22Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. Miller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Corbin J.D. Ogreid D. Miller J.P. Suva R.H. Jastorff B. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1208-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, 8-pCPT-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP are widely used for in vivo experiments. The 8-bromo substitution was shown to stabilize the syn conformation of cAMP, the conformation of cAMP adopted in the crystal structures of PKAI and PKAII (9Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which provides a possible explanation for the decreased AC50. The analogues also have a lower AC50 for Epac compared with cAMP; in particular, the 8-pCPT modification resulted in a 50-fold reduction in AC50. However, the maximal activation of Epac by these analogues is 2-fold lower compared with cAMP, indicating that modifications at the 8-position also affect the k max of the protein. However, not all modifications of the 8-positions affect the behavior of cAMP on Epac. e.g. 8-ABA-cAMP. The highly conserved glutamate in the FGELAL sequence of the phosphate binding cassette of PKA, PKG, cyclic nucleotidegated ion channels, and even the bacterial CAP protein, is replaced by a glutamine (Gln-270) in Epac1 and a lysine in Epac2. Glutamic acid was found to form a hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH group of the cyclic nucleotide and was shown to be absolutely essential for the binding of cAMP to PKA (20Yagura T.S. Miller J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the Epac structure analysis (8Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) showed that the corresponding residue would be close to the 2′-OH group, a potential interaction between Gln-270 would not significantly contribute to the binding affinity for cAMP. Neither the AC50 of EpacQ270A or EpacQ270E nor the Kd of Epac149–328Q270A or Epac149–328Q270E was altered, which suggests that the glutamine in Epac is not involved in the direct binding of cAMP and questions the necessity of the 2′-OH group for activation of Epac. However, drastic effects on activation of GEF activity with respect to both AC50 and k max were obtained by modifications of the 2′-OH group of the ribose. Replacement of the 2′-OH group by H or by OCH3 leads to an increase of the AC50, indicating that interactions of the 2′-OH-group contribute to the binding of Epac but not via Gln-270. Indeed, the affinity of 2′-deoxy-cAMP for the cAMP binding domain was dramatically reduced. However, this reduction was much less, but still 10-fold, when the oxygen was preserved by replacing the OH group for an O-Me group (27Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A. Maenhaut C. Bos J.L. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35394-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This indicated that the OH group still confers binding energy for cAMP to Epac, presumably through its interaction with the conserved glycine in the FGELAL sequence. Interestingly, 2′-O-Me-cAMP (and perhaps 2′-deoxy-cAMP) at non-saturated concentration induces k obs values that are higher then the k max of cAMP-mediated activation. Apparently, the 2′-O-Me-group shifts the conformational equilibrium of the nucleotide-bound Epac more efficiently to the active site. Combined with the increased affinity of the 8-pCPT-group, both modifications resulted in a highly specific “superactivator” of Epac (12Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The effect of the increased k max is in part mediated by Gln-270. The k max of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-mediated activation of EpacQ270A (but not EpacQ270E) is decreased significantly. On the other hand, the k max of cAMP-mediated activation for both mutants is increased compared with wild type. This indicates that Gln-270 disfavors the cAMP-bound active state but favors the 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-bound active state. Mutagenesis of the lid demonstrate a role of this region in the super-activation behavior of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, although the role of individual residues in this process is still unclear. A potential link between the lid and the OH/OCH3-group and/or Gln-270 is His-317. In all known PKA structures, a hydrogen bond between the glutamate in the FGELAL sequence (corresponding to Gln-270 in Epac1) and a tyrosine/tryptophane in the lid is found. This tyrosine/tryptophane may correspond to His-317. Indeed, cAMP- and 8-pPCT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-mediated activation are drastically reduced in EpacH317A. Arg-313 may be specifically responsive to the 2′-O-Me-group, because the k max of cAMP is not altered, whereas the k max of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is reduced 2-fold. In contrast, Thr-311 may be specifically responsive to the 2′-OH-group. Further structural and mutational analysis of both the lid and the catalytic domain are required to fully understand the molecular mechanism of Epac activation by cAMP and cAMP analogues.

https://openalex.org/W1970266451,"Iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) is a central regulator of cellular iron homeostasis due to its regulation of specific mRNAs encoding proteins of iron uptake and storage. Iron regulates IRP2 by mediating its rapid proteasomal degradation, where hypoxia and the hypoxia mimetics CoCl2 and desferrioxamine (DFO) stabilize it. Previous studies showed that iron-mediated degradation of IRP2 requires the presence of critical cysteines that reside within a 73-amino acid unique region. Here we show that a mutant IRP2 protein lacking this 73-amino acid region degraded at a rate similar to that of wild-type IRP2. In addition, DFO and hypoxia blocked the degradation of both the wild-type and mutant IRP2 proteins. Recently, members of the 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenase family have been shown to hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a modification required for its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Since 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases require iron and oxygen, in addition to 2-OG, for substrate hydroxylation, we hypothesized that this activity may be involved in the regulation of IRP2 stability. To test this we used the 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) and showed that it blocked iron-mediated IRP2 degradation. In addition, hypoxia, DFO and DMOG blocked IRP2 ubiquitination. These data indicate that the region of IRP2 that is involved in IRP2 iron-mediated degradation lies outside of the 73-amino acid unique region and suggest a model whereby 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity may be involved in the oxygen and iron regulation of IRP2 protein stability.

IRP1 and IRP2 bind to stem-loop structures, known as iron-responsive elements, that are found in the untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding proteins important in iron homeostasis. The interaction of IRPs with iron-responsive elements represses translation of ferritin mRNA while increasing the stability of the transferrin receptor mRNA. Since IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activities are regulated by intracellular iron concentration, these proteins couple cellular iron with the regulation of expression of proteins important in iron homeostasis. In iron-replete cells, IRP1 RNA binding activity decreases as the protein assembles a [4Fe-4S] cluster having cytosolic aconitase activity, whereas in iron-depleted cells apo-IRP1 binds RNA (3Kaptain S. Downey W.E. Tang C. Philpott C. Haile D. Orloff D.G. Harford J.B. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of IRP2, iron controls its RNA binding activity through the regulation of protein stability. This is achieved through iron stimulation of its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (4Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Thus, the amount of IRP2 is inversely related to cellular iron concentration. The mechanism by which iron accelerates IRP2 degradation has been reported to involve iron-catalyzed oxidation of the protein within a unique 73-amino acid region termed the “degradation domain” (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Iwai K.

Oxidatively modified IRP2 could then potentially interact with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as the recently identified HOIL-1 E3 ligase that has been implicated in IRP2 ubiquitination (9Yamanaka K.

Like IRP2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is regulated at the level of protein stability. HIF-1α is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is the principal mediator of transcriptional activation during hypoxia (reviewed in Refs. 10Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Prolyl hydroxylases are members of the superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases that are enzymes requiring oxygen and Fe2+, in addition to 2-OG, for substrate hydroxylation. Due to the oxygen requirement of prolyl hydroxylases, HIF-1α hydroxylation is reduced as cellular oxygen decreases. This accounts for the inverse relationship between oxygen concentration and HIF-1α stabilization. The involvement of prolyl hydroxylases in HIF-1α protein degradation provides a mechanism for gene regulation by hypoxia. Our previous studies demonstrated that IRP2 RNA binding activity increases during hypoxia through altered protein degradation (21Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study we show that hypoxia blocks IRP2 degradation, and that the previously designated degradation domain is dispensable for both oxygen and iron regulation of IRP2 stability. In addition, IRP2 iron-mediated degradation is blocked by the hypoxic mimetic CoCl2 and by the 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase inhibitor DMOG. Since hypoxia, iron chelation, CoCl2, and DMOG can inhibit 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, these results suggest that IRP2 degradation may require the activity of a member(s) of this class of enzymes. Moreover, iron chelation, hypoxia, and DMOG all decrease in vivo IRP2 ubiquitination, while iron and 2-OG stimulate in vitro IRP2 ubiquitination. Cell Culture—Human 293 embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the ecdysone receptor (EcR293 cell line, Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and 400 μg/ml Zeocin. Human 293T cells were grown in the same medium lacking Zeocin. Human Hep3B hepatoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Earle's minimum essential medium containing 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids. Plates were treated with polylysine before seeding EcR293 and 293T cells. To generate an IRP2myc stable cell line EcR293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of the pIND(sp1) vector harboring a C-terminal myc-tagged human IRP2 cDNA (21Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The ponasterone A (PA) inducible expressing IRP2myc clone (CII) was isolated following selection in 400 μg/ml G418. IRP2myc degradation assays were performed in CII cells by inducing IRP2myc synthesis with 10 μm PA for 20 h. After removal of PA, IRP2myc degradation was monitored by immunoblot analysis using the 9E10 anti-myc mAb (Santa Cruz). Degradation assays in transiently transfected EcR293 cells were performed by transfecting with 12 μg total DNA/100 mm plate. Following transfection, cells were split equally to 60-mm plates and induced with 10 μm PA prior to chase under the indicated conditions. Degradation was monitored by anti-HA immunoblots. All experiments were performed multiple times with similar results. Hypoxia was achieved by placing cells in a humidified Napco incubator maintained at 1% O2 and 5% CO2 with a balance of nitrogen. Normoxia was achieved by exposing cells to ambient air with 5% CO2. All cells were grown at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (ICN) for 60 min in methionine/cysteine free media.

All PCR manipulations were performed using high fidelity Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), and all constructs were sequenced verified. The 73-amino acid deletion removes IRP2 amino acids 137 to 209 (ΔCAI-X67-PVP). The location of the myc and HA tags was found to have no effect on IRP2 degradation or ubiquitination. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Protein (25 μg) was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with rabbit anti-IRP2 antibody (22Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-myc mAb, anti-HIF-1α mAb (BD Transduction Labs), anti-ubiquitin (a gift from M. Rechsteiner, University of Utah), anti-HA mAb (University of Utah Protein Core Facility), or anti-EGFP mAb (Sigma). Visualization was achieved using Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ubiquitination Assays—For in vivo ubiquitination assays of wild-type IRP2, 293T cells grown on 100 mm plates were cotransfected with 6 μg each of pcDNA3.1(+)/mycIRP2 and a vector that expresses HA-tagged ubiquitin (23Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were split equally to 60-mm plates with one plate receiving 100 μm DFO where indicated. After 22 h, 5 mm DMOG was added where indicated. One h after addition of DMOG all plates received 10 μm lactacystin to inhibit the proteasome, and one plate was exposed to hypoxia. Cells were harvested 5.5 h after addition of lactacystin in lysis buffer containing 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Immunoprecipitations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline using 6 μg of anti-myc antibody and 300 μg of lysate. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HA antibody to monitor IRP2myc ubiquitination. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-IRP2 to ensure equal precipitation from each sample. The same transfection protocol was used for monitoring ubiquitination of Δ73IRP2myc and its wild-type control, WtIRP2myc. For in vitro ubiquitination assays, extracts from 18-h DFO-exposed cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25% Triton X-100 and used in assays containing 0.5 μg/μl ubiquitin, 3.2 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 mm ascorbic acid and an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 60 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 6.6 mm phosphocreatin) with or without 400 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 1 mm 2-OG. Assays for were performed in 25 μl at ∼4 μg/ml protein for 18 h at 30 °C. DMOG and Other Reagents—DMOG was synthesized by Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT) and verified by GC mass spec and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. DMOG and lactacystin (Sigma) were dissolved in H2O and MG132 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Ubiquitin aldehyde was from Boston Biochem Inc. Hypoxia Stabilizes IRP2myc in the CII Cell Line—To study IRP2 stability during hypoxia, we generated a stable ecdysone receptor 293 cell line (termed CII) that expresses IRP2myc only in the presence of the inducer PA. When PA is removed from the growth medium, IRP2myc synthesis ceases, and its degradation can be monitored by anti-myc immunoblot analysis. The CII cell line was used for time course experiments to determine the stability of IRP2myc under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Fig. 1A reveals that IRP2myc decays with a t ½ of ∼5 h during normoxia that is increased to greater than 12 h during hypoxia. Stabilization of IRP2myc is also seen at 20 h of hypoxia (data not shown). The degradation of IRP2myc is completely blocked by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132, demonstrating that its degradation recapitulates endogenous IRP2 proteasomal degradation (Fig. 1B) (4Guo B.

To determine whether hypoxia irreversibly stabilizes IRP2myc, CII cells were exposed to hypoxia for the last 2 h of a 20-h PA induction and subsequently returned to normoxia for the chase phase. Fig. 1C shows that IRP2myc degrades at the same rate during a normoxic chase irrespective of previous exposure to normoxia or hypoxia. A similar result was found when CII cells were exposed to 16 h of hypoxia prior to the normoxic chase (data not shown). These data indicate that the signal responsible for IRP2 hypoxic stabilization is reversed upon the reintroduction of oxygen. Removal of the 73-Amino Acid Unique Region in IRP2 Does Not Affect IRP2 Degradation in EcR293 Cells—The 73-amino acid unique region in IRP2 has been reported to be required for iron-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that three critical cysteines in the 73-amino acid unique region directly sense iron resulting in localized oxidation and subsequent ubiquitination. We performed degradation assays to address the role of this 73-amino acid region in the regulation of IRP2 degradation. Degradation of full-length HA-tagged wild-type IRP2 (WtIRP2-HA) and its 73-amino acid deletion counterpart (Δ73IRP2-HA) were monitored in transiently transfected EcR293 cells in the presence and absence of iron. Unexpectedly, the Δ73IRP2-HA protein degraded at a rate similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A). Moreover, iron accelerated the degradation of both proteins. It should be noted that the degradation rate of transiently transfected IRP2 is longer than that observed for stably expressed IRP2myc (Figs. 1A and 2A) due to greater expression achieved in transient transfections. To determine whether the degradation of Δ73IRP2-HA is iron-dependent, degradation was monitored in the presence of DFO. EcR293 cells were separately transfected with vectors expressing WtIRP2-HA, Δ73IRP2-HA, or EGFP. Fig. 2B shows that DFO blocks the degradation of both WtIRP2-HA and Δ73IRP2-HA, whereas the stability of EGFP was not affected. In addition, exposure of cells to hypoxia also resulted in the stabilization of Δ73IRP2-HA (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the region of IRP2 that is involved in IRP2 iron- and oxygen-mediated degradation lies outside of the 73-amino acid unique region. Inhibitors of 2-OG-dependent Dioxygenase Activity Block IRP2 Degradation—Our results indicate that cysteine oxidation in the 73-amino acid unique region is not required for IRP2 regulation in 293 cells. Since IRP2 and HIF-1α are both stabilized by hypoxia and DFO, we considered an alternative model for IRP2 regulation that requires hydroxylation. To test this model, we used inhibitors of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases. Cobaltous ion is a well known inducer of the hypoxic response due to its stabilizing effect on HIF-1α. Recent studies have attributed this to a decrease in HIF-1α hydroxylation by the direct inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity by cobalt through competition with iron (13Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). We previously showed that CoCl2-treated cells resulted in IRP2 accumulation, however, the mechanism was not examined (21Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of CoCl2 on IRP2, we measured IRP2myc degradation in CoCl2 treated cells. Fig. 3A illustrates that CoCl2, like hypoxia, completely inhibits IRP2myc degradation. Furthermore, the stabilization effect of CoCl2 on IRP2myc was prevented by iron (Fig. 3B). Taken together these results suggest the possibility that IRP2 degradation may be mediated by 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity. To further examine the potential role for 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity in IRP2 degradation we used the inhibitor DMOG. Intracellularly DMOG is converted to N-oxalylglycine (a structural analog of 2-OG), which is a competitive inhibitor with respect to 2-OG in the inhibition of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, where inhibition of collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase occurs in the presence of excess iron (24Cunliffe C.J.

DMOG has been demonstrated to inhibit prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α, resulting in its normoxic accumulation in Hep3B cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans (13Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A.

To examine the effect of DMOG on IRP2 stability, 293T cells were first treated with DFO for 16 h to maximally increase endogenous IRP2. This was necessary because under normal 293T cell growth conditions IRP2 is present at low amounts. Cells were then exposed to DMOG for 2 h prior to the removal of DFO, after which DMOG was added back to the medium with or without ferrous sulfate to promote IRP2 degradation. Cells were harvested at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the addition of iron. Fig. 4A illustrates significant IRP2 degradation after 4 h in the absence of DMOG, whereas IRP2 degradation was prevented in DMOG-treated cells. The blot was then probed for HIF-1α. As expected, HIF-1α was present in DFO-treated cells that were immediately harvested, whereas it degraded in the absence of DMOG, consistent with its rapid normoxic degradation (Fig. 4A). Like IRP2, the degradation of HIF-1α was blocked in the presence of DMOG. In addition, the inhibition of IRP2 and HIF-1α degradation by DMOG occurs at similar concentrations (Fig. 4B). DMOG stabilization of IRP2 is not unique to 293T cells, since IRP2 in Hep3B cells is similarly affected by DMOG (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the degradation of Δ73IRP2-HA is 2-OG-dependent, degradation was measured in the presence of DMOG using transient transfection assays. Fig. 4D shows that DMOG blocks the degradation of both WtIRP2-HA and Δ73IRP2-HA. This result is consistent with data demonstrating that the 73-amino acid unique region is dispensable for iron and oxygen regulation of IRP2 (Fig. 2), and suggests that WtIRP2-HA and Δ73IRP2-HA degradation proceed by a pathway requiring 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity. Control experiments were performed to demonstrate that DMOG does not affect overall protein ubiquitination or bulk protein degradation (Fig. 4, E and F). IRP2 Ubiquitination Is Blocked by DMOG, DFO, and Hypoxia in Vivo—Since IRP2 degradation requires ubiquitination (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25733-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), the effect of DMOG, DFO, and hypoxia on in vivo IRP2 ubiquitination was examined. 293T cells were cotransfected with vectors that express mycIRP2 and HA-ubiquitin. Following transfection, cells were split into four plates to allow for the accumulation of mycIRP2 and HA-ubiquitin, with one plate exposed to DFO. After 22 h, a second plate was pretreated to DMOG for 1 h prior to addition of 10 μm lactacystin to inhibit the proteasome. Untreated cells and DFO-exposed cells also received lactacystin. A third plate was exposed to hypoxia immediately following addition of lactacystin. After 5.5 h cell lysates were prepared, and untransfected and transfected extracts were sequentially probed with anti-HA and anti-IRP2 to determine expression (Fig. 5A, left panels). Immunoprecipitations were performed to capture mycIRP2 from each lysate. Immunoprecipitated mycIRP2 was then assessed for HA-ubiquitin conjugation in an anti-HA immunoblot (Fig. 5A, right panel). The blot was reprobed for IRP2 to show equal precipitations. The results demonstrate that mycIRP2 is ubiquitinated in 293T cells, and that DMOG, hypoxia, and DFO decrease ubiquitination. To examine whether 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity is required for Δ73IRP2 ubiquitination, the effect of DMOG on its ubiquitination was monitored in 293T cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with WtIRP2myc or Δ73IRP2myc along with the vector for HA-ubiquitin. IRP2myc and Δ73IRP2myc were immunoprecipitated and assessed for ubiquitination by an anti-HA immunoblot. Fig. 5B shows that Δ73IRP2myc is ubiquitinated in the absence of DMOG. In the presence of DMOG, ubiquitination of Δ73IRP2myc, like that of WtIRP2myc, is greatly reduced. These data suggest that the region of IRP2 that may be involved in 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase-mediated ubiquitination is outside of the 73-amino acid unique region. Iron and 2-OG Stimulate IRP2 Ubiquitination in Vitro—We determined the effect of iron and 2-OG on IRP2 ubiquitination in vitro. Extracts prepared from 293T cells exposed to DFO for 18 h were incubated with an ATP regenerating system containing ubiquitin, ubiquitin aldehyde, and ascorbic acid in the presence or absence of iron and 2-OG. IRP2 ubiquitination was measured by immunoblot analysis using anti-IRP2 antibody. The results illustrate an increase in high molecular weight IRP2 when iron is present that is further increased in the presence 2-OG (Fig. 5C). These data show that in the presence of cofactors required for 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity, IRP2 ubiquitination is stimulated in vitro. These results are consistent with the in vivo ubiquitination experiments, suggesting that 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity is required for IRP2 ubiquitination. Previously Iwai et al. proposed a model for iron-dependent IRP2 degradation where IRP2 is directly oxidized through an iron-catalyzed mechanism (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this model, the unique 73-amino acid degradation domain is inferred to directly sense iron through three cysteines resulting in localized oxidation. Oxidized IRP2 is then efficiently ubiquitinated. Recently, Kang et al. (8Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used an in vitro metal-catalyzed oxidation system and showed that iron induces the oxidation of any one of these three cysteines. Whether these specific oxidations are involved in the ubiquitination of IRP2 remains to be determined. Since the IRP2 73-amino acid domain has been implicated in iron-mediated degradation, we hypothesized that this region could be involved in its regulation by hypoxia. Our analysis of IRP2 lacking this region indicates that this 73-amino acid unique region is dispensable for oxygen- and iron-mediated degradation. This is supported by the finding that DFO, DMOG, and hypoxia block the degradation of Δ73IRP2-HA, whereas iron stimulates its degradation. Moreover, DMOG blocked Δ73IRP2-HA ubiquitination in vivo. Although it is not yet clear why our results differ from those of Iwai et al. (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it is possible that different cells employ distinct, as well as an overlapping mechanisms, in the regulation of IRP2 stability. The degradation of HIF-1α has been found to be critically dependent on the activity of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases (13Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). A probable mechanism for inactivation of these enzymes by cobalt is through direct competition with iron at the catalytic active site (13Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Our previous data showing that IRP2 accumulates in CoCl2-treated cells (21Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is explained here by the demonstration that, like hypoxia, CoCl2 blocks IRP2 degradation. Similar to HIF-1α, the mechanism of CoCl2-induced IRP2 stabilization is through competition with iron. In addition, the 2-OG analog DMOG blocked HIF-1α degradation (through inhibition of HIF-1α PHDs) at the same concentration required to prevent IRP2 degradation. The relativity high concentration of DMOG (2.5-5 mm) needed to block IRP2 degradation may be due to inefficient conversion of DMOG to its active N-oxalylglycine form within the cell. It should be noted that IRP1 RNA binding activity was not affected in DMOG-treated cells, indicating that DMOG is not chelating iron (data not shown). In addition to CoCl2, DMOG and hypoxia, treating cells to iron chelators has long been known to stabilize IRP2. Therefore, when cellular 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity is predicted to be inhibited (exposure to CoCl2, DMOG, DFO, or hypoxia) there is a simultaneous increase in IRP2 stability. Conversely, when cellular iron is elevated, a condition that might be expected to increase 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity, IRP2 is more efficiently degraded. Based on these results, we suggest that 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity may be involved in the degradation of IRP2. To determine the step in the IRP2 degradation pathway that is affected by inhibitors of 2-OG-dependnet dioxygenase activity, we examined the effect of DMOG, DFO and hypoxia on in vivo mycIRP2 ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of mycIRP2 in vivo was blocked by DMOG and hypoxia. DFO also blocked in vivo mycIRP2 ubiquitination consistent with the results of others (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since DMOG, hypoxia, and DFO inhibit 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, these results suggest that a hydroxylation event lies upstream of IRP2 ubiquitination. Extending our ubiquitination experiments to an in vitro assay, we show that high molecular weight IRP2 species (consistent with ubiquitination) maximally forms when iron and 2-OG are present. To a lesser extent, ubiquitination of IRP2 occurred when iron alone was added to the reaction. This may reflect some stimulation of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase activity by 2-OG present in the extracts. These results suggest that we have recapitulated in vitro both the hydroxylation and subsequent ubiquitination of IRP2. Although hydroxylation of IRP2 would be a direct way to communicate cellular oxygen and iron to IRP2, our data do not show that IRP2 is directly hydroxylated. It is possible that hydroxylation could regulate the function of a protein in the IRP2 degradation pathway, such as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Potential candidates for IRP2 hydroxylases are one of the three HIF-1α PHDs and the HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylase, all of whose activities are influenced by physiologic levels of oxygen (13Epstein A.C.

However, our preliminary experiments showed that the HIF-1α PHDs did not accelerate IRP2 degradation. 2E. S. Hanson, unpublished observation. Whether the activity of these enzymes is also affected by physiologic changes in iron levels is not known. In summary, we propose an alternative model for the regulation of IRP2. We suggest that hydroxylation may be a critical event signaling IRP2 degradation by stimulating its interaction with the ubiquitination machinery. If true, the activity of the 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase catalyzing IRP2 hydroxylation would be expected to be responsive to physiologic changes in both oxygen and iron and therefore serve as an iron and oxygen sensor.

https://openalex.org/W2161094829,"Gene-inactivation studies point to the involvement of OxyB in catalyzing the first oxidative phenol coupling reaction during glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis. TheoxyB gene has been cloned and sequenced from the vancomycin producer Amycolatopsis orientalis, and the hemoprotein has been produced in Escherichia coli, crystallized, and its structure determined to 1.7-Å resolution. OxyB gave UV-visible spectra characteristic of a P450-like hemoprotein in the low spin ferric state. After reduction to the ferrous state by dithionite or by spinach ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, the CO-ligated form gave a 450-nm peak in a UV-difference spectrum. Addition of putative heptapeptide substrates to resting OxyB produced type I changes to the UV spectrum, but no turnover was observed in the presence of ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, showing that either the peptides or the reduction system, or both, are insufficient to support a full catalytic cycle. OxyB exhibits the typical P450-fold, with helix L containing the signature sequence FGHGXHXCLG and Cys347 being the proximal axial thiolate ligand of the heme iron. The structural similarity of OxyB is highest to P450nor, P450terp, CYP119, and P450eryF. In OxyB, the F and G helices are rotated out of the active site compared with P450nor, resulting in a much more open active site, consistent with the larger size of the presumed heptapeptide substrate.

Vancomycin and related glycopeptide antibiotics are clinically important natural products that often provide a last line of defense in the treatment of nosocomial infections by multiple drug-resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria (1Williams D.H. Bardsley B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1172-1193Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of these antibiotics is currently attracting great interest, not least because the knowledge may be important in attempts to produce novel glycopeptides by combinatorial biosynthesis methods. Vancomycin consists of a cross-linked heptapeptide, which is glycosylated on residue 4. The same cross-linked heptapeptide is found in balhimycin and chloroeremomycin (Fig.1). The peptide backbone is constrained into an unusual conformation by the presence of three side chain to side chain linkages connecting aromatic groups in residues 2 and 4, residues 4 and 6, and residues 5 and 7. Although rapid progress has been made recently in studies of the biosynthesis of the constituent amino acids (2Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1105-1118Google Scholar) that builds a linear heptapeptide precursor, the timing of many steps in the biosynthesis remain ill-defined (see below). This is also true of the side chain cross-links, which arise formally by oxidative phenol coupling reactions. Despite the enormous importance of oxidative phenol coupling reactions in natural product biosynthesis, still very little is known about the enzymes that catalyze such reactions, their structures, and their detailed mechanism(s) of action. The nucleotide sequences of some biosynthetic genes for four glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin (13Solenberg P.J. Matsushima P. Stack D.R. Wilkie S.C. Thompson R.C. Baltz R.H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 195-202Google Scholar), chloroeremomycin (14van Wageningen A.M. Kirkpatrick P.N. Williams D.H. Harris B.R. Kershaw J.K. Lennard N.J. Jones M. Jones S.J. Solenberg P.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 155-162Google Scholar), balhimycin (15Pelzer S. Süssmuth R. Heckmann D. Recktenwald J. Huber P. Jung G. Wohlleben W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1565-1573Google Scholar), and teichoplanin (16Sosio M. Bianchi A. Bossi E. Donadio S. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 379-384Google Scholar), as well as the structurally related antiviral agent complestatin (17Chiu H.-T. Hubbard B.K. Shah A.N. Eide J. Fredenburg R.A. Walsh C.T. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8548-8553Google Scholar), have been reported recently. The organization of the biosynthetic genes in each cluster is very similar. This includes in the chloroeremomycin and balhimycin clusters three contiguous open reading frames (ORFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; PEG, polyethylene glycol encoding the peptide synthetases, and a cluster of three genes (oxyA,oxyB, and oxyC) encoding P450-like enzymes that catalyze three oxidative phenol coupling reactions. Gene knockout experiments in the balhimycin producer indicate that the first phenol coupling occurs between residues 4 and 6 and is catalyzed by OxyB (18Süssmuth R.D. Pelzer S. Nicholson G. Walk T. Wohlleben W. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1976-1979Google Scholar, 19Bischoff D. Pelzer S. Höltzel A. Nicholson G.J. Stockert S. Wohlleben W. Jung G. Süssmuth R.D. Angew. Chem.

Engl. 2001; 40: 4688-4691Google Scholar). The second coupling should be between residues 2 and 4 catalyzed by OxyA, and the last coupling is between residues 5 and 7 catalyzed by OxyC (18Süssmuth R.D. Pelzer S. Nicholson G. Walk T. Wohlleben W. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1976-1979Google Scholar, 19Bischoff D. Pelzer S. Höltzel A. Nicholson G.J. Stockert S. Wohlleben W. Jung G. Süssmuth R.D. Angew. Chem.

Engl. 2001; 40: 4688-4691Google Scholar). Methylation at the N terminus of the heptapeptide seems to be a late step in the biosynthesis (10O'Brien D.P. Kirkpatrick P.N. O'Brien S.W. Staroske T. Richardson T.I. Evans D.A. Hopkinson A. Spencer J.B. Willimas D.H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 2000; : 103-104Google Scholar). However, the timing of other steps, e.g. chlorination and release of products from the peptide synthetase, are not yet defined. Thus it is not clear whether or not the free linear heptapeptide 1, either with X = H or Cl, is the substrate for OxyB, or for example, whether the peptide remains attached as a thioester through its C terminus to a peptidyl carrier domain during the phenol coupling reactions. For instance, the P450 enzyme NovI that catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of tyrosine during novobiocin biosynthesis, hydroxylates a tyrosine moiety that is coupled as a thioester to a peptide carrier domain (21Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 301-312Google Scholar). A similar route for the production of a β-hydroxytyrosine moiety may also occur during vancomycin biosynthesis (6Puk O. Huber P. Bischoff D. Recktenwald J. Jung G. Süssmuth R.D. Van Pee K.-H. Wohlleben W. Pelzer S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 225-235Google Scholar). The nikQ gene in nikkomycin biosynthesis has a similar function. NikQ is a P450 that catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of histidine while conjugated to a carrier protein (22Chen H. Hubbard B.K. O'Connor S.E. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 103-112Google Scholar). So far, no reports of in vitro activity for the enzymes OxyA–C have been described. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the three contiguous P450-like genes, oxyA, oxyB, and oxyC, from the vancomycin producer Amycolatopsis orientalis. The enzyme OxyB has been produced in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein whose UV-visible spectral properties are typical of P450 monooxygenases. We also describe the crystal structure of OxyB to 1.7-Å resolution, which is the first reported structure of a P450 protein implicated in an oxidative phenol coupling reaction. A. orientalis DSM40040 chromosomal DNA was used to construct a genomic library in the cosmid SuperCos I (Stragene) in E. coli XL1-blue. Subcloning was in the hosts E. coliDH5α and XL1-Blue with plasmids pUC18 and pBluescript. For production of OxyB with a His6 tag at the N terminus the gene was cloned in pET14b (Novagen), and for OxyB with a native N terminus pET17b (Novagen). Genomic DNA was isolated from A. orientalis, using methods developed for streptomycetes (23Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar) and partially digested with Sau3AI. Fragments of 30–40 kb were isolated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and ligated into SuperCosI previously digested with XbaI and BamHI. After packaging (Gigapack III XL, Stratgene) the DNA was used to transfect E. coliXL1-blue. A part of the gtfE gene (13Solenberg P.J. Matsushima P. Stack D.R. Wilkie S.C. Thompson R.C. Baltz R.H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 195-202Google Scholar) from A. orientalisDSM40040 was amplified by PCR using the following primers: GtfFor, 5′-ATCCCCTACTTCTATGGCTTCCAC-3′; GtfRev, 5′-GAAGTGAATCAGCAGGTGCTGTTC-3′. The PCR product (549 bp) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript. This DNA fragment was used to screen the cosmid library described above. A positive clone was used for subcloning and DNA sequencing of the region upstream of the gtfE gene, which includes cytochrome P450 genes oxyA–C (14van Wageningen A.M. Kirkpatrick P.N. Williams D.H. Harris B.R. Kershaw J.K. Lennard N.J. Jones M. Jones S.J. Solenberg P.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 155-162Google Scholar). Sequencing templates were obtained by generating nested deletions with exonuclease III. Sequencing with the dideoxy chain termination method was performed using an Applied Biosystems 377A sequencer. Nucleotide sequences have been deposited at the EMBL data base (accession number AF486630). Here the protein sequence is numbered from the N terminus starting with Met 1-Ser2-Glu3-Asp4-Asp5etc. The oxyB gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers (restriction sites underlined): OxyBFor, 5′-GCTATCTAGACATATGAGCGAGGACGACCCGCGCCC-3′; OxyBRev, 5′-TGATCAAGCTTAGATCTTCACCAAGCAACCATCAGCTCGGTCAAACCGTACG-3′. The PCR products were digested with XbaI andHindIII, and ligated intoXbaI/HindIII-digested pBluescript for nucleotide sequencing. After confirming the correct nucleotide sequence, the gene was transferred as an NdeI/HindIII fragment into pET17b (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar) to give pOCI810. For the production of His6-tagged OxyB (His6-OxyB), the gene was transferred from pOCI810 as an NdeI/XhoI fragment into pET14b to give pOCI1047. For production of His6-OxyB in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S, TB medium (400 ml) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) was inoculated (4%, v/v) with a preculture (grown overnight at 37 °C) and incubated at 24 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. AtA 600 = 0.5, δ-aminolevulinic acid (8 mg) was added. The culture was induced at A 600 = 1.0 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) and growth was at 22 °C. A second portion of δ-aminolevulinic acid (8 mg) was added 20 h after induction and the cultures were harvested by centrifugation after another 24 h. The cells were disrupted in PG buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% azide) by 3 passages through a French pressure cell at 1200 p.s.i. The E. coli cell-free extract containing His6-OxyB was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (0.5 × 5 cm, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow, Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm, with KCl (300 mm), and imidazole (20 mm)), at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After washing (20 column volumes of buffer A) the His6-tagged protein was eluted in buffer A with 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against buffer B (Tris-HCl (50 mm), pH 7.5, and EDTA (0.5 mm)). The protein was then chromatographed on Mono Q (10/10, Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m KCl over 100 ml with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. His6-OxyB eluted with 0.17 m KCl, and showed a single band by SDS-PAGE, gave an electrospray mass spectrum consistent with the expected mass, and the correct N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation. The production of OxyB with a native N terminus was performed using pOCI810 and the same method described for His6-OxyB (see above), except that induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was atA 600 = 1.6. The E. coli cell-free extract was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 14 cm) equilibrated with buffer B, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 M KCl over 100 ml at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. After dialysis into buffer B, the protein was then applied to a Mono Q 10/10 column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 m KCl over 100 ml at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. After concentrating, the protein was then applied to a Superdex 75 (HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with buffer C (Tris-HCl (50 mm), pH 7.5, with EDTA (0.5 mm) and KCl (0.15 M)) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The native OxyB showed a single band by SDS-PAGE, gave an electrospray mass spectrum consistent with the expected mass, and the correct N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation. Spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 3 double-beam spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. After thermal equilibration at 30 °C the baseline was zeroed between 300 and 700 nm and the UV-visible spectra of the substrate-free His6-OxyB and native OxyB (2.5 μm) were recorded in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0). The enzymes were reduced by addition of 2 mg of solid Na2S2O4 and spectra were measured under the same conditions. The imidazole complex was generated by adding imidazole (100 mm) to native OxyB in the same buffer. A solution of enzyme (2.6 μm) in Tris-HCl buffer (2 ml, 50 mm, pH 8.0) was divided between two tandem cuvettes (sample and reference) and CO was bubbled through the sample cuvette for a few seconds, then 2 mg of solid Na2S2O4 was added to each cuvette, and the difference spectrum was recorded. The P450 concentration was determined from CO difference UV spectra using dithionite-reduced heme, and an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 cm−1 (25Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Google Scholar). Native OxyB was also reduced by incubation in buffer B with spinach ferredoxin (10 μm), ferredoxin-NADP+reductase (0.05 unit; Sigma), and NADPH (1 mm). CO was then passed through the solution and the UV-difference spectrum was recorded. A solution of native OxyB (2.6 μm) in Tris-HCl buffer (2 ml, 50 mm, pH 8.0) was divided between two tandem cuvettes (sample and reference). After thermal equilibration at 30 °C the baseline was zeroed between 300 and 700 nm. Successive aliquots of peptide (1 or2) dissolved in 10% methanol in H2O were added to the sample cuvette to give a final peptide concentration in the range 10–1000 μm. An equal volume of 10% methanol in H2O was also added to the reference cuvette (the final methanol concentration did not exceed 1%). The difference spectrum was then recorded. Crystals were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop method by mixing 1 μl of protein (30 mg/ml in a solution containing 20 mm KCl, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.5) and reservoir solutions. The latter contained either 1 mammonium sulfate, 10 mm KCl, 5 mmdithioerythritol, 100 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.5 (AS crystal form), or 9% PEG 3350, 10 mm KCl, 5 mmdithioerythritol, 100 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.5 (PEG crystal from). The crystals reached their final size (350 × 50 × 20 μm, AS crystal form; 300 × 150 × 50 μm, PEG crystal form) within 8–10 days. Heavy atom-derivatized crystals were prepared by soaking crystals in reservoir solution containing the heavy atom compounds for various periods of time. Prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen the crystals were either rinsed briefly in the final cryoprotectant solution (AS crystal form) or soaked in mother liquor solutions containing increasing concentrations of the cryoprotectant (PEG crystal form). In both cases, the cryoprotectant solution consisted of the respective reservoir solution supplemented with 10% glucose and 10% sucrose. Both crystal forms contain one molecule of His6-OxyB per asymmetric unit. The AS crystal form has the symmetry of the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell parametersa = 100.4 Å, b = 60.4 Å,c = 90.3 Å, β = 122.8°, whereas the PEG crystal form has the symmetry of space group P212121, with unit cell parametersa = 60.4 Å, b = 73.8 Å,c = 99.0 Å. Crystals were kept at 100 K during measurements. Diffraction data were collected using a rotating anode or synchrotron radiation (beamline ID14-1 at the ESRF, Grenoble, beamline X11 at EMBL c/o DESY, Hamburg) and processed with the XDS suite of programs (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Google Scholar) (see TableI). The His6-OxyB structure was determined with CNS 1.0 (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) using a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement and molecular replacement methods. Several polyalanine models derived from crystal structures of different cytochrome P450s were used as search models for molecular replacement. Although a solution was found with the P450terp structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1CPT), the phase information did not allow us to build the protein model. Isomorphous HgCl2 derivatives were obtained for the AS crystal form (Table I). The heavy atom sites were found in both isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps. The heme-iron position was determined by anomalous difference Fourier methods. The heavy atom parameters were refined and phases were calculated to 2.9-Å resolution. The phases were improved by solvent flipping as implemented in the density modification procedure of CNS 1.0 (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The density modified map was interpretable and an atomic model was built into the 2.9-Å electron density map using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The refinement (including simulated annealing) was monitored byR free, computed with 5% of the data randomly selected and omitted from the refinement. The resulting partial structure was used as a model for molecular replacement with the PEG crystal form. The phases from the molecular replacement solution were used to locate heavy atom sites in the ethyl/mercury/phosphate derivatives. The heavy atom sites agreed with the peaks in the isomorphous difference Patterson map. The heavy atom parameters were refined and multiple isomorphous replacement phases were calculated. Several rounds of manual rebuilding followed by refinement with subsequent combination of partially built model phases and experimental phases, using the data from both crystal forms, allowed completion of the protein model. At this point all data to 1.7-Å resolution were included in the refinement. During several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding, solvent molecules were included in the model using the WATERPICK routine of CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Although the peptide was not visible in either crystal form (AS-native 2, PEG-native 2), the data allowed us to build the region Arg70-Arg82 in the AS crystal form and the loop Ile33-Asp38 in the PEG crystal form.

https://openalex.org/W1977063541,"The proteoglycan aggregate is the major structural component of the cartilage matrix, comprising hyaluronan (HA), link protein (LP), and a large chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan, aggrecan. Here, we found that another member of aggrecan family, versican, biochemically binds to both HA and LP. Functional analyses of recombinant looped domains (subdomains) A, B, and B′ of the N-terminal G1 domain revealed that the B-B′ segment of versican is adequate for binding to HA and LP, whereas A and B-B′ of aggrecan bound to LP and HA, respectively. BIAcore™ analyses showed that the A subdomain of versican G1 enhances HA binding but has a negligible effect on LP binding. Overlay sensorgrams demonstrated that versican G1 or its B-B′ segment forms a complex with both HA and LP. We generated a molecular model of the B-B′ segment, in which a deletion and an insertion of B′ and B are critical for stable structure and HA binding. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of formation of the proteoglycan aggregate and HA binding of molecules containing the link module."
https://openalex.org/W2029937779,"Astrocytes have become a focal point for research in neurobiology, especially regarding their purported ability to regulate neuronal communication and survival. The present study addressed a poorly understood but important focus in this area, the mechanism(s) underlying astrocyte-induced survival of neurons. The results of the study show that soluble factors in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) protect murine GT1–7 neurons from serum deprivation-induced cell death and that this neuroprotection is correlated with enhanced activation/phosphorylation of the AP-1 transcription factor, c-JunSer-63. A parallel and correlated activation of the upstream kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK4) was also demonstrated. Furthermore, co-administration of JNK inhibitors, but not a MEK inhibitor, significantly attenuated ACM-induced phosphorylation of c-JunSer-63 and blocked its neuroprotective action. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that ACM enhanced AP-1 binding, an effect that appears functionally important, since an AP-1 binding inhibitor significantly attenuated the neuroprotective action of ACM. Further studies implicated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 as critical active soluble factors released by astrocytes, since both were demonstrated in ACM, and immunoneutralization of the conditioned media with a panspecific TGF-β antibody significantly attenuated the enhanced AP-1 binding and neuroprotective action of the ACM. Furthermore, exogenous application of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 was found to enhance c-JunSer-63 phosphorylation and to be neuroprotective, and co-administration of JNK inhibitors or an AP-1 binding inhibitor blocked TGF-β-induced neuroprotection. Taken together, these studies suggest that astrocytes can protect neurons from serum deprivation-induced cell death, at least in part, by release of TGF-β and activation of a c-Jun/AP-1 protective pathway.

Astrocytes, the major nonneuronal cells in the brain, have been implicated in the segregation, maintenance, and support of neurons. Recent work also implicates a role for astrocytes in the reduction of neuronal cell death following a variety of cellular stresses, such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress (1Rosenberg P.A. Aizenman E. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 2Tanaka J. Toku K. Zhang B. Ishihara K. Sakanaka M. Maeda N.

Along these lines, during acute ischemic stroke, neuronal cell death rapidly progresses following the loss of astrocytes, suggesting that astrocytes are critical for support of neuronal survival in vivo in injury situations (5Liu D. Smith C.L. Barone F.C. Ellison J.A. Lyski P.G. Li K. Simpson I.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 68: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This suggestion is further supported by the fact that administration of a gliotoxin, which abolishes astrocytic function, increases the sensitivity of neurons to cellular stressors (6Largo C. Cuevas P. Herreras O. Neurol. Res. 1996; 18: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and by the observation that targeted ablation of astrocytic function in vivo results in increased neuronal cell death as well as increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke damage (7Cui W.

Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings have led to the suggestion that astrocytes possess potent neuroprotective capability; however, the mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective effects are poorly understood. Both soluble and insoluble factors could play a mediatory role in astrocyte-induced neuroprotection. Our laboratory and others have focused on soluble factors released by astrocytes and their potential roles in central nervous system function. Along these lines, recent work has demonstrated that astrocytes can produce and release the growth factor, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; ACM, astrocyte-conditioned medium; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; C6 CM, C6 glial cell-conditioned medium; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MKK4, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4.

TGF-β is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and was the first family member isolated, having been discovered over 20 years ago (10Bruno V. Battaglia G. Casabona G. Copiani A. Caciagli F. Nicoletti F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9594-9600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abundant work since then has implicated a role for TGF-β in such diverse processes as regulation of growth, differentiation, extracellular matrix formation, and immune regulation as well as induction of neuronal survival and repair following injury (12Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar, 13Zhu Y. Ahlemeyer B. Bauerback E. Krieglstein J. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 38: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TGF-β exists as three isoforms in mammals, designated TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, each of which is the result of a separate gene. Studies of the TGF-β cell signaling pathway have shown that the TGF-β type II receptor, a constitutively active kinase, binds TGF-β and initiates signal transduction following the activation of the TGF-β1 type I receptor (14Vivien D. Wrana J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β activates numerous diverse signaling pathways, recent studies demonstrated that AP-1 activation is required for TGF-β to regulate a number of its target genes (15Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechledier R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A.

AP-1 is a family of transcription factors that form homodimeric and/or heterodimeric complexes consisting of c-Fos and c-Jun family members. The function of AP-1 transcription factors during brain injury is unclear, but increased c-Jun expression has been noted in surviving hippocampal neurons following ischemic brain injury (19Sommer C. Gass P. Kiessling M. Brain Pathol. 1995; 5: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, prolongation of AP-1 binding has been shown to protect vulnerable neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus following ischemia (20Yoneda Y. Kuramoto N. Azuma Y. Inoue K. Ogita K. Mitani A. Yanase H. Masuda S. Zhang L. Kataoka K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and c-Jun, the major AP-1 binding partner, exerts a neuroprotective function in PC12 neurons in vitro (21Leppa S. Eriksson M. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4369-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a potential role for AP-1-mediated transcription in neuroprotection. Based on these observations, we proposed that astrocyte-derived TGF-β could mediate, at least in part, the ability of astrocytes to exert neuroprotection and that this mediation could involve activation of a c-Jun/AP-1 protective pathway. To test this hypothetical mechanism for a possible mediatory role in astrocyte-induced neuroprotection, a serum deprivation cell death model was employed using GT1–7 neurons, a well characterized neuronal cell model used extensively in the testing of neuroprotective compounds and in the study of mechanisms of neuronal cell death (22Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L.

A TGF-β type II receptor dominant negative construct was created in which a mutation in the kinase domain was made, which rendered the receptor kinase deficient. The resulting construct could bind ligand but could not phosphorylate downstream targets, thus, in effect, acting as an antagonist. To construct the TGF-β type II receptor dominant negative, the human TGF-β type II receptor gene was isolated from a human brain cDNA PCR library (Clontech) using the following primers: 5′-GGG ATC CAT GGG TCG GGG GCT GCT CAG G-3′ and 5′-CCT CTA GAC CTA TTT GGT AGT GTT TAG G-3′. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The extracellular domain (amino acids 1–200) was further amplified using primers 5′-GGG ATC CAT GGG TCG GGG GCT GCT CAG G-3′ and 5′-GGT TGA ACT AAG CTT CTG CTG-3′. This region, that includes the signal sequence and transmembrane region, was inserted in frame at BglII and HindIII sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The resulting construct, expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein (enhanced green fluorescent protein) is missing the cytoplasmic region. A similar dominant negative construct has been utilized and extensively characterized previously using a hemagglutinin tag (30Wieser R. Attisano L. Wranna J.L. Massague J. Mol. Cell.

Astrocyte, C6 Glial Cell, and GT1–7 Neuronal Cell Cultures—Conditioned medium from highly purified hypothalamic astrocytes or C6 glia cells was used to test the putative role of a soluble astrocyte-active factor (i.e. TGF-β) in astrocyte-induced neuroprotection. C6 glial cells (American Type Tissue Culture, Manassas, VA) and immortalized neuronal cells, GT1–7 cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C. C6 conditioned medium was collected in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. GT1–7 were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well for cell viability studies and grown to 50–60% confluence. Medium was then replaced with appropriate treatments as specified in figure legends. For Western blotting, GT1–7 were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates and grown to 70% confluence. Cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated as described in the figure legends. Primary cultures of astrocytes were obtained from 1–2-day-old Holtzman rats, as previously described by our laboratory (9Buchanan C.D. Mahesh V.B. Brann D.W. Biol.

Brann D.W. Endocrine. 2003; 21: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Trypan blue exclusion assays were also used to confirm the results (data not shown). Western Blotting and Growth Factor Measurements—Western blotting was performed as described in detail previously (9Buchanan C.D. Mahesh V.B. Brann D.W. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at the following final concentrations: 1:500 for P-MKK4 and P-JNK, 1:1000 for all other antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The housekeeping protein, α-actin, was used as a control for equal loading of protein. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the presence of primary antibody, and the enhanced chemiluminescence system was used to visual the proteins (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were exposed, and molecular weight determination was performed using a digital imaging system (Alpha Imager 2200, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). With respect to growth factor measurements, transforming growth factor-β1 and -β2 were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI) (9Buchanan C.D. Mahesh V.B. Brann D.W. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-α was measured using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA) as described previously (9Buchanan C.D. Mahesh V.B. Brann D.W.

Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed as described previously (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Struhal K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2001: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar, 33Hadman M. Loo M.

Briefly, GT1–7 neurons were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were allowed to swell for 10 min and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g, and the nuclei were extracted by resuspending in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and quickly mixed with high salt buffer (same as low salt buffer except 1.2 m KCl). After a 20-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. DNA binding reactions were performed by incubation of 1–5 μg of nuclear extract with 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg of poly(dI-dC), 4 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm spermidine, and 8% glycerol. Complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The probe used to analyze AP-1 DNA binding contains the consensus AP-1 binding site (CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—An n = 6 was used for each treatment group. All experiments were repeated at least three times to confirm findings. Significant differences between groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance was followed by Student-Newman-Keul's test. The results were expressed as means ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Astrocyte-conditioned Medium Protects GT1–7 Neurons from Cell Death—As shown in Fig. 1, serum deprivation induced significant cell death of GT1–7 neurons. Decreased cell viability was observed in the serum-deprived group as early as 24 h after serum deprivation, with progressive, highly significant decreases in cell viability continued at 48 and 72 h after serum deprivation (Fig. 1, A and B). Of note, the addition of C6 glial cell-conditioned medium (C6 CM) or astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) completely prevented the serum deprivation-induced cell death of GT1–7 neurons, such that C6 CM- and ACM-treated serum-deprived groups were not significantly different from the serum control group with respect to cell viability (Fig. 1, A and B). Morphologically, serum-deprived neurons showed cellular rounding, neurite withdrawal, and cellular detachment as compared with serum control neurons (Fig. 1, compare C and D), whereas ACM-treated serum-deprived neurons maintained their cell shape, had preserved neurite connections, and reflected a healthy appearance and phenotype similar to that observed in the serum control neurons (Fig. 1, compare E and C). Astrocyte-derived TGF-β Mediates Neuroprotection— Table I shows levels of transforming growth factors present in the ACM and C6 CM. As shown in Table I, significant levels of total TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were observed in ACM and C6 CM, with slightly higher levels observed in C6 CM. In contrast, TGF-α was undetectable in both ACM and C6 CM. To determine whether the TGF-β present in ACM and C6 CM could mediate the neuroprotective effects of ACM and/or C6 CM, immunoneutralization of ACM and C6 CM was performed using a panspecific TGF-β antibody (which neutralizes all three isoforms of TGF-β; i.e. TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3), and the effect on the protective ability of ACM and C6 CM against serum deprivation-induced cell death was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, immunoneutralization of C6 CM or ACM with a panspecific TGF-β antibody completely reversed the neuroprotective effect of the C6 CM and ACM upon serum deprivation-induced cell death of GT1–7 neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). Further work demonstrated that significant levels of TGF-β are present in serum, with TGF-β1 being predominant (TGF-β1, 2.4 ng/ml; TGF-β2, 160 pg/ml). We thus sought to determine whether the protective effects of media containing serum could be due, at least in part, to TGF-β present in serum. Toward this end, immunoneutralization of media containing serum with the panspecific TGF-β antibody was performed, and the effect on the protective ability of media containing serum on GT1–7 neurons was determined. The results suggest that TGF-β present in serum is an important contributor to the prosurvival effects of media containing serum, as immunoneutralization with the panspecific TGF-β antibody significantly decreased GT1–7 neuronal survival in a manner similar to serum deprivation (Fig. 2C).Table ITGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-α concentrations in ACM and C6CMGrowth factorACMC6CMpg/mlTGF-β1538978TGF-β2202363TGF-αNDaND, not detectable.NDa ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Exogenous TGF-β Protects against Neuronal Cell Death—To further confirm that TGF-β1 and/or TGF-β2 can exert neuroprotection against serum deprivation in GT1–7 neurons, the effect of exogenous TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 treatment was examined. As shown in Fig. 3A, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) rescued GT1–7 neurons from serum deprivation-induced cell death in a manner similar to ACM. TGF-β2 also rescued GT1–7 neurons from serum deprivation-induced cell death, although it was slightly less potent than the effect observed with TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 3B). Similar to the situation observed with ACM treatment, both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 preserved normal elongated cell shape and neurite extensions of the GT1–7 neurons, which is in sharp contrast to the phenotypically unhealthy appearance of the serum-deprived vehicle-only treated cells, which displayed cellular rounding, neurite retraction, and cellular detachment (Fig. 3, C–E). Additionally, transfection of a TGF-β type II receptor dominant negative construct into GT1–7 neurons resulted in the cells displaying a phenotype similar to serum deprivation although they were in serum control medium (i.e. rounding up of cells, withdrawal of neurites, and significant cellular detachment (Fig. 3F). Transfection of an empty vector had no significant effect on the phenotype of the GT1–7 cells (Fig. 3G). Astrocyte-conditioned Medium Activates AP-1 Signaling Pathways—To assess the potential involvement of the c-Jun-AP-1 signaling pathway in the neuroprotective effects of ACM, Western blotting was performed using antibodies to c-Jun-AP-1 pathway members (Fig. 4A). Graphical expression of the Western blot data (percentage of phospho-c-Jun/total c-Jun) is also shown in Fig. 4B. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, treatment of GT1–7 neurons with ACM induced an increase in c-Jun protein levels starting at 1 h and persisting until 24 h after treatment. A correlated activation of c-Jun was also observed, as indicated by a rapid increase in phosphorylation of c-JunSer-63, which started at 30 min and persisted until 12 h following ACM treatment. Additional studies showed that phospho-c-JunSer-63 levels at the 0 time point were similar to levels observed for the serum-deprived group at all time points, excepting 30 min and 1 h, where the serum-deprived group had slightly lower levels than the 0 time point, and that ACM increased phospho-c-JunSer-63 levels as early as 5 min after treatment (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C, the elevation of phospho-c-JunSer-63 was mirrored by an ACM-induced increase in AP-1 binding to DNA as compared with the vehicle-treated serum deprivation group when examined at 4.5 h after ACM treatment. Further work showed that ACM induced the phosphorylation of the upstream kinases, MKK4 and JNK1 and JNK2, beginning at 30 min and lasting for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 5, A and B). Nonphosphorylated MKK4 did not show any significant fluctuation with ACM treatment (Fig. 5A), whereas nonphosphorylated JNK displayed a slight elevation at 1, 3, and 6 h after ACM treatment (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5, C and D, shows the graphical expression of the Western blot data for MKK4 and JNK (percentage of phosphoprotein/total protein) showing the ACM-induced elevation of P-MKK4 and P-JNK at all time points following ACM treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, treatment with the JNK inhibitor, dicoumarol, blocked the ACM-induced phosphorylation of JNK in GT1–7 neurons and correspondingly abolished the neuroprotective effect of ACM against serum deprivation-induced cell death. TGF-β1-induced neuroprotection in GT1–7 neurons was also abolished by dicoumarol treatment (Fig. 6B). A second recently developed highly selective JNK inhibitor, SP600125, was also tested, as was a MEK inhibitor (PD98059), to test for specificity of the inhibitory effect. As shown in Fig. 7A, treatment with a 30 or 50 μm dose of the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, completely blocked the neuroprotective effect of ACM against serum deprivation in GT1–7 neurons. In contrast, treatment with a 30 μm dose of the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, had no significant effect on the neuroprotective effect of ACM against serum deprivation (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7C, SP600125 also blocked the neuroprotective effect of TGF-β1 against serum deprivation in GT1–7 neurons, similar to the effect observed for ACM.Fig. 5Temporal pattern of phosphorylation of MKK4 (A) and JNK (B) in serum-deprived GT1–7 neurons following treatment with vehicle or ACM.

As shown in Fig. 8, A and B, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 both induced significant phosphorylation of c-Jun, with increases in phospho-c-JunSer-63 noted at all time points but the 30-min time point by TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. Additionally, c-Jun protein levels were also enhanced by TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, demonstrating a regulation of both the c-Jun protein and its activation by TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, a situation similar to that observed for ACM (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, immunoneutralization of ACM with a TGF-β panspecific antibody markedly attenuated the ACM-induced elevation of AP-1 binding in GT1–7 neurons under serum deprivation conditions (Fig. 8B). Correspondingly, co-incubation with an AP-1 binding inhibitor, curcumin, significantly attenuated the neuroprotection by AC"
https://openalex.org/W2042469661,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that was shown to inhibit the biosynthesis of articular cartilage components. Here we demonstrate that IL-1β inhibits the production of newly synthesized collagens in proliferating rabbit articular chondrocytes and that this effect is accompanied by a decrease in the steady-state levels of type II collagen mRNA. IL-1β down-regulates COL2A1 gene transcription through a –41/–33 bp sequence that binds a multimeric complex including Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Specificity of IL-1β effects on COL2A1 promoter activity was demonstrated in experiments in which transfection of a wild type –50/+1 sequence of COL2A1 promoter as a decoy oligonucleotide abolished the IL-1β inhibition of a –63/+47 COL2A1-mediated transcription. By contrast, transfection of the related oligonucleotide harboring a targeted mutation in the –41/–33 sequence did not modify the negative effect the cytokine. Because we demonstrated previously that Sp1 was a strong activator of COL2A1 gene expression via the –63/+1 promoter region, whereas Sp3 overexpression blocked Sp1-induced promoter activity and inhibited COL2A1 gene transcription, we conclude that IL-1β down-regulation of that gene, as we found previously for transforming growth factor-β1, is mediated by an increase in the Sp3/Sp1 ratio. Moreover, IL-1β increased steady-state levels of Sp1 and Sp3 mRNAs, whereas it enhanced Sp3 protein expression and inhibited Sp1 protein biosynthesis. Nevertheless, IL-1β decreased the binding activity of both Sp1 and Sp3 to the 63-bp short COL2A1 promoter, suggesting that the cytokine exerts a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism on Sp1 and Sp3 gene expressions. Altogether, these data indicate that modulation of Sp3/Sp1 ratio in cartilage could be a potential target to prevent or limit the tissue degradation.

Articular cartilage is a highly specialized tissue composed of a complex extracellular matrix of proteoglycans, collagens, and noncollagenous glycoproteins. Cartilage collagens include type II as the major form and types VI, IX, and XI as minor components (1Mayne R. Irwin M.H. Kuettner K. Schleyerbach R. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage Biochemistry.

Pathogenesis of OA involves multiple etiologies that contribute to cartilage damage, but the mechanisms of tissue destruction are not fully understood. It is known that proinflammatory cytokines induce chondrocytes to secrete metalloproteases that can cleave most of the cartilage matrix macromolecules (12Andrews H.J. Bunning R.A. Dinarello C.A. Russel R.G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IL-1β has been shown to play a key role in this mechanism because it is capable of increasing catabolic activity of chondrocytes and inhibiting their macromolecule synthesis (13van de Loo F.A.

Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 797-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). IL-1β induces the expression of many genes whose promoters are regulated through interacting transcription factors, including NF-κB, AP1, activating transcription factor, or CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. The cytokine signals via activation of protein kinase cascades involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase or NF-κB pathways (15Stylianou E. Saklatvala J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1075-1079Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Robbins J.R. Thomas B. Tan L. Choy B. Arbiser J.L. Berenbaum F. Goldring M.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2189-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In most of the cellular models studied to date, IL-1β was found to initiate a signaling cascade leading to the activation of NF-κB, a homo- or heterodimeric complex composed of p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, or RelB proteins, the prototypical p50/p65 heterodimer being generally the effector of the transduction. NF-κB is normally present in the cytoplasm as an inactive element of a complex, with members of the IκB inhibitor protein family. In this complexed form, the nuclear localization sequence found on NF-κB is masked by IκB. Under IL-1β treatment two IκB kinases, IκBα and IκBβ, are activated and phosphorylate IκB at specific serine residues. In the last steps of this signal transduction, the phosphorylated and ubiquitinated IκB is degraded, and the exposed nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB interacts with the nuclear import machinery and then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its target gene and modulates its transcription (for review, see Ref. 17Mercurio F.

The importance of transcriptional regulation of cartilage markers, such as type II collagen gene, has been addressed in the studies of chondrocyte response to cytokines and growth factors, to understand the regulatory mechanisms that govern COL2A1 gene expression and further define new therapeutic approaches in OA treatment (11Chadjichristos C.

Earlier studies have demonstrated that IL-1β suppresses type II collagen expression in cultured chondrocytes by reducing the transcriptional activity of the COL2A1 gene (19Pujol J.-P. Loyau G.

This down-regulation involves DNA regulatory sequences that control that gene expression (22Chandrasekhar S. Harvey A.K. Higginbotham J.D. Horton W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on and transient transfection experiments have shown that a IL-1β negative signal for human COL2A1 gene transcription involves a 577-bp proximal promoter region and the specific enhancer sequence present in the first intron of the gene (23Goldring M.B. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Lai W.-F.T. Am. J. Therapeutics. 1996; 3: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar effects were also observed in immortalized human articular chondrocytes (24Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowaski J. Arbiser J.L. Appeley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These data suggest that IL-1β exerts its control on type II collagen production through binding sequences of the promoter and/or first intron regions of the COL2A1 gene. Recent studies on mouse costal chondrocytes and the MC615 mouse chondrocytic cell line also revealed that IL-1β decreases the amounts of COL2A1 mRNA, SOX9 mRNA, and SOX9 protein. NF-κB is involved in SOX9 down-regulation, a mechanism that accounts for the inhibition of mouse SOX9-dependent COL2A1 enhancer elements and subsequent decrease of type II collagen biosynthesis (25Murakami S. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3687-3692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the nature of transcription factors mediating IL-1β inhibition of human COL2A1 gene transcription is not completely elucidated because a recent study on that gene in a human immortalized chondrocytic cell line demonstrated that the cytokine-induced repression of transcription is mediated by two upstream Egr1 binding sites found in the promoter, but the authors cannot exclude the involvement of downstream sequences binding Sp3, which acts as a transcriptional repressor in their system (26Tan L. Peng H. Osaki M. Choy B.K. Auron P.E. Sandell L.J. Goldring M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17688-17700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TGF-β1 decreases type II collagen production in primary RAC by a transcriptional regulatory mechanism, which implicates a –41/–33 bp promoter sequence binding Sp1 and Sp3. The repressive effect of the cytokine results from an increase in Sp3/Sp1 ratio which prevents Sp1-induced transactivating effects (11Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43903-43917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we show here that IL-1β down-regulates COL2A1 gene transcription by the same promoter region and that this effect implies both Sp1 and Sp3. We propose that down-regulation of type II collagen expression under IL-1β and TGF-β1 exposure, two cytokines generally thought to have antagonistic effects on chondrocyte metabolism, involved similar transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that converge on the same complex in which the Sp3/Sp1 ratio is increased. Cell Cultures—RAC were prepared from the shoulders and the knees of 3-week-old rabbits, as described previously (5Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates, 100-mm dishes, or 75-, 150-, and 175-cm2 flasks and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was changed twice a week. Collagen Labeling—To assay newly synthesized collagen, RAC cultures at 80% confluence were preincubated in 10% FCS-containing DMEM in 9.6-cm2 dishes for 15 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate. Then, the medium was replaced by the same fresh medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile and 2 μCi/ml [3H]proline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing 10 ng/ml IL-1β (a generous gift from Dr. Soichiro Sato, Shizuoka, Japan) or not. Cultures were pulsed for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was collected, and the amount of labeled collagen was assayed with pure bacterial collagenase (27Peterkofsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The cell layer-associated collagens were also assayed after scraping and sonication of the cells because that fraction generally contains large amounts of type II collagen (28Galéra P. Rédini F.

Levels of collagen and noncollagenous proteins were corrected to protein amounts determined by the Bradford colorimetric method. RT-PCR Analysis—For RT-PCR analysis, 2 μg of total RNA from primary RAC cultures treated or not with 10 ng/ml IL-1β at 80% of confluence were reverse transcribed into cDNA as described already (8Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amplification reaction was carried out using specific sense and antisense primers for COL2A1, Sp1, Sp3, and GAPDH genes as reported previously (11Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F.

RT-PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose electrophoresis gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. After photography, the intensities of the COL2A1 and GAPDH cDNA bands were quantified by densitometric scanning, using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of COL2A1 cDNA was normalized to GAPDH cDNA levels. Transfection Experiments—For luciferase assays, primary proliferative RAC were transiently transfected at 80% of confluence by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using chimeric COL2A1-luciferase reporter vectors and pSV40β-gal plasmid, as described previously (5Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ghayor C.

In some experiments, reporter plasmids were also cotranfected with Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression vectors (pEVR2/Sp1 and/or pRC/CMV/Sp3, respectively) as described previously (11Chadjichristos C.

The corresponding insertless expression plasmids were used as controls (pEVR2 and pRC/CMV). In these experiments, the pSV40β-gal construct has not been cotransfected because Sp1 is able to increase SV40 promoter activity because of the presence of several Sp1 DNA-binding sites in this promoter as reported already (11Chadjichristos C.

In other experiments, a pNF-κB-Luc vector was used. It represents a reporter plasmid harboring five copies of a NF-κB binding site located immediately upstream from a minimal promoter purchased from Stratagene (kindly provided by Dr. B. de Crombrugghe, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). After overnight transfection, the culture medium was changed to a fresh one, and chondrocyte cultures were incubated for a further 24 h in DMEM + 10% FCS containing 10 ng/ml IL-1β or not. At the end of the experiment, cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (5Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L.

Decoy Oligonucleotide Assays—For decoy assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides were transfected into RAC cultures in an attempt to interfere with Sp1 and Sp3 binding to their cognate cis-acting elements within the 63-bp short promoter of the COL2A1 gene. The sequences used as a decoy element were a multicopy (two copies) of the –50/+1 wild type (wt) and mutant sequence found in the COL2A1 promoter (Table I). The decoy oligonucleotides were also added in the culture medium during the incubation period with 10 ng/ml IL-1β. 24 h later, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities and protein amounts.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyKROXwt: 5′-CTC TGT ACG CGG GGG CGG TTA GAG-3′KROXmut: 5′-CTC TGT ACG CGG AAG TTG TTA GAG-3′NF-κBwt: 5′-GAT CCG GCT GGA AAA GTC CCC A-3′-49/-28wt: 5′-TCG AAA GGG GCC GGG CGC ATA CG-3′-67/-30wt: 5′-TTG GGC GAG TTC GCC AGC CTC GAA AGG GGC CGG GCG C-3′-35/+1wt: 5′-GGG CGC ATA TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG GGA GAA GAC-3′-35/+1mut: 5′-GGG CGC AGC TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC-3′-50/+1wt: 5′-CCT CGA AAG GGG CCG GGC GCA TAT AAC GGG CGC CGC GGC GGG GAG AAG ACG-3′-50/+1mc wt: 5′-GCC TCG AAA GGG GCC GGG CGC ATA TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC GCC TCG AAA GGG GCC GGG CGC ATA TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC-3′-50/+1mc mut: 5′-GCC TCG AAA GGT TCC TTG CGC ATA TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC GCC TCG AAA GGT TCC TTG CGC ATA TAA CGG GCG CCG CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC-3′-30/+1wt: 5′-TAT AAC GGG CGC CGC GGC GGG GAG AAG ACG-3′-15/+1wt: 5′-CGG CGG GGA GAA GAC G-3′ Open table in a new tab Nuclear Extracts and DNA Binding Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared as maxi- or minipreparations (30Dignam J.D.

In the antibody interference assays, 1 μl of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-Smad3, anti-AP2, and anti-Egr2 antibodies (Santa Cruz) was added to each reaction mixture for 15–20 min at room temperature then 15 min at 4 °C. The probe was finally added to the binding reaction, a further 15-min incubation at room temperature was performed, and the samples were finally electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel that was processed by autoradiography (5Ghayor C.

A Short COL2A1 63-Base Pair Proximal Promoter Mediates IL-1β-induced Inhibition of Type II Collagen Expression in Articular Chondrocytes—We first determined the effect of IL-1β on collagen biosynthesis in RAC primary cultures. Newly synthesized collagens were assayed after [3H]proline labeling of chondrocytes, treated or not with the cytokine (10 ng/ml). IL-1β treatment was found to decrease total collagen neosynthesis (essentially type II collagen) by 55% (Fig. 1A). The reduction was greater in the cell layer-associated fraction because this latter contains the major part of neosynthesized type II collagen. To determine whether IL-1β-decreased type II collagen synthesis was accompanied by a similar effect at the transcriptional level, steady-state levels of COL2A1 mRNA were estimated by semiquantitative RT-PCR performed on total RNA extracts of proliferating primary RAC treated or not with IL-1β. As shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of COL2A1 mRNA were reduced by ∼40% under IL-1β treatment of RAC cultures. To investigate further the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-1β down-regulates type II procollagen production and COL2A1 mRNA levels, the transcriptional activity of the human COL2A1 gene constructs containing deletions in both promoter and/or first intron regions was assayed. Transient cotransfections performed on RAC cultures showed that IL-1β inhibits the transcriptional activity of all of these constructs, except for the shortest construction, which contains only 35 bp upstream the transcription start site (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that a –63/–35 bp sequence of the proximal promoter mediates IL-1β-induced inhibition of COL2A1 gene transcription. Delineation of the DNA Binding Sites That Mediate IL-1β Inhibitory Effect on the –63/–35 Base Pair Fragment of the COL2A1 Promoter—To determine cis-acting elements that mediate the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on type II collagen expression, DNase I footprinting assays were performed on the 63-bp proximal promoter, using nuclear extracts from primary RAC treated or not with the cytokine. As shown in Fig. 2A, a region of the 63-bp fragment was protected by proteins present in nuclear extract from proliferating RAC. The protected area is located between –35 and –63 bp. Sequences within –8/–63 bp also bound Sp1 recombinant protein. A similar protection intensity was observed whatever nuclear extracts from control RAC or IL-1β-treated cells were used. To identify the transcription factors interacting with this proximal promoter, EMSA analysis was performed using the wild type oligonucleotidic sequences identified in DNase I footprint experiments on the 63-bp promoter fragment and their mutant counterparts (Table I). Three wild type double-stranded labeled oligonucleotides were generated and incubated with nuclear extracts from primary RAC. As shown in Fig. 2B, three major complexes called a, b, and c were formed upon incubation with the –50/+1wt probe when the binding reaction was performed with control nuclear extracts. Only complexes a and b are detected with the –67/–30wt probe. DNA binding activity of the transcription factors involved in a complex is decreased when nuclear extracts from RAC treated with IL-1β were used. Complex c is nonspecific as we demonstrated previously (11Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43903-43917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) because it is not always detected, even when the same RAC nuclear extracts and the same probes are used (see Fig. 2, C and E). With the –35/+1wt probe, only complex b was formed, and IL-1β treatment of the RAC did not modulate DNA binding activity of this complex, suggesting that b does not have a functional transcriptional effect, as we have already found for the TGF-β1 effect, and that b could bound nonspecifically (11Chadjichristos C.

https://openalex.org/W1989699053,"Aggregation of huntingtin (htt) in neuronal inclusions is associated with the development of Huntington's disease (HD). Previously, we have shown that mutant htt fragments with polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in the pathological range (>37 glutamines) form SDS-resistant aggregates with a fibrillar morphology, whereas wild-type htt fragments with normal polyQ domains do not aggregate. In this study we have investigated the co-aggregation of mutant and wild-type htt fragments. We found that mutant htt promotes the aggregation of wild-type htt, causing the formation of SDS-resistant co-aggregates with a fibrillar morphology. Conversely, mutant htt does not promote the fibrillogenesis of the polyQ-containing protein NOCT3 or the polyQ-binding protein PQBP1, although these proteins are recruited into inclusions containing mutant htt aggregates in mammalian cells. The formation of mixed htt fibrils is a highly selective process that not only depends on polyQ tract length but also on the surrounding amino acid sequence. Our data suggest that mutant and wild-type htt fragments may also co-aggregate in neurons of HD patients and that a loss of wild-type htt function may contribute to HD pathogenesis.

Harper P.S. Major Problems in Neurology: Huntington's Disease. 22nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Ltd., London1991Google Scholar). The disease is associated with selective neuronal cell death occurring mainly in the cerebral cortex and the striatum (2Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). The mutation causing HD is an expanded CAG repeat located within exon 1 of the IT-15 gene encoding huntingtin (htt), a 350-kDa protein of unknown function (3Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6957) Google Scholar). The CAG repeat is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence, and the disease appears when the critical length of ∼37 glutamines is exceeded (4Rubinsztein D.C. Leggo J. Coles R. Almqvist E. Biancalana V. Cassiman J.J. Chotai K. Connarty M. Crauford D. Curtis A. Curtis D. Davidson M.J. Differ A.M. Dode C. Dodge A. Frontali M. Ranen N.G. Stine O.C. Sherr M. Abbott M.H. Franz M.L.

However, the current data do not exclude the possibility that loss of wild-type htt function may also contribute to the disease phenotype in post-mitotic neurons. htt function is essential for neurogenesis (5White J.K.

Strikingly, deletion of the gene encoding the htt mouse homologue hdh resulted in a progressive neurological phenotype (8Dragatsis I. Levine M.S. Zeitlin S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that the toxic gain of function of mutant htt may cause a loss of the essential function of wild-type htt and thereby induce selective neurotoxicity (9Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).However, the molecular basis for such a disease mechanism remains unclear. A characteristic feature of mutant htt proteins with elongated polyQ sequences is that they spontaneously self-assemble into SDS-resistant protein aggregates with a fibrillar morphology in vitro and in vivo (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E.

This suggests that HD is due to a toxic gain of function that leads to the formation of abnormal protein aggregates in a nucleation-dependent process.Indeed, the formation of neuronal inclusions (NIs) in affected brain regions of patients is a characteristic feature of HD (11Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). NIs do not consist solely of htt protein but also of other cellular proteins such as molecular chaperones (14Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that cellular toxicity associated with htt aggregation results from sequestration of proteins that are involved in cellular key events. Of particular interest is the finding that NIs also contain other polyQ-containing proteins such as the transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein; Ref. 15Huang C.C. Faber P.W. Persichetti F. Mittal V. Vonsattel J.P. MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.F. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and CBP (CREB-binding protein; Ref. 16Steffan J.S.

This suggests that the polyQ domain in transcription factors mediates protein-protein interactions and associates with the polyQ sequence of htt.Here, we have studied the co-aggregation of recombinant HD exon 1 proteins with normal and extended polyQ sequences. In addition, we have analyzed the interaction of HD exon 1 proteins with the transcription factors NOCT3 and PQBP1, which are expressed in brain (17Schreiber E. Tobler A. Malipiero U. Schaffner W.

However, PQBP1 is known to specifically bind to polyQ-containing proteins (18Waragai M. Lammers C.H. Takeuchi S. Imafuku I. Udagawa Y. Kanazawa I. Kawabata M. Mouradian M.M. Okazawa H. Hum. Mol.

We find that mutant HD exon 1 protein rapidly aggregates in vitro and thereby promotes the aggregation of HD exon 1 proteins with polyQ sequences in the normal range. When both wild-type and mutant HD exon 1 proteins are mixed together, SDS-resistant co-aggregates with a fibrillar morphology are formed by a nucleation-dependent process. In contrast, SDS-resistant co-aggregates are not formed between mutant huntingtin and the transcription factors NOCT3 and PQBP1 in vitro, although these two proteins do co-localize in inclusion bodies in cell culture models of HD. Together our results suggest that co-aggregation between wild-type and mutant htt fragments may also occur in patient brains and that this may lead to the loss of wild-type huntingtin function in neuronal cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—Commercially available antibodies were mouse monoclonal HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA), mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma), mouse monoclonal c-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science), polyclonal rabbit c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal rabbit FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), peroxidase-coupled secondary donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Roche Applied Science), and immunogold-labeled (5–10 nm) secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (British BioCell, Cardiff, UK).

Downstream of the sequence coding for the PreScission protease cleaving site an adapter carrying an NdeI restriction site and the FLAG tag (F, peptide sequence DYD-DDDK) was introduced into the multicloning site. DNA fragments coding for HD exon 1 proteins with 20, 32, 37, 39, 45, or 53 CAG repeats were excised by restriction with endonucleases EcoRI and NotI from pTL-HD exon 1 plasmids (10Scherzinger E.

The plasmids pEGFP-HDQ72 and pYEGFP-HDQ17 were described under the names pEGFP-CAG72 and pEGFP-CAG17, respectively (23Sittler A. Lurz R. Lueder G. Priller J. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Lehrach H.

The coding sequences for NOCT3 and PQBP1 were amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA plasmids pBS-NOCT3 and pBS-PQBP1 (kind gifts from A. Fontana and N. Bonini) and subcloned into pGEX-6P-1-FLAG. Subsequently, NOCT3 and PQBP1 were subcloned as BamHI-XhoI and EcoRI-NotI fragments, respectively, into pTL1-HA2 (23Sittler A. Lurz R. Lueder G. Priller J. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Lehrach H.

All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression and Purification—Expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH10B was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) at 37 °C for 3.5 h. The proteins were affinity purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed according to standard protocols (45Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar).Aggregation Assay—Purified GST fusion proteins were diluted to concentrations of 25–400 μg/ml and digested with 0.1 unit of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–4 h at 8 °C in a final volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, the samples were transferred to 37 °C to start aggregation. At various times aliquots of 100, 200, or 400 ng were taken and analyzed by the filter retardation assay as described (46Wanker E.E. Scherzinger E. Heiser V. Sittler A. Eickhoff H. Lehrach H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Aggregates were detected using the ECL kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film. The radiographs were scanned with a Epson GT-700 Photo scanner and quantified using the software program AIDA 1.0 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Cell Lines and Cell Transfection—COS1 cells were grown as described previously (47Sittler A.

Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described (23Sittler A. Lurz R. Lueder G. Priller J. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Hum. Mol.

Alternatively, the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of Mammalian Whole Cell Extracts—Cell lysis was performed according to Ref. 25Waelter S.

Protein was determined by a Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as standard.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS1 cells were transfected with the plasmids coding for HA- or GFP-tagged fusion proteins. After 40–44 h the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 4 min at room temperature, followed by immunostaining as described (25Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) with anti-HA antibody from mouse and visualized with anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy3. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Samples were examined with the fluorescence microscope Axioplan-2 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).Electron Microscopy—Aggregates from the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 30 min and washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The resuspended samples were incubated for 45 min with primary antibody, centrifuged, washed as before, and then incubated for 45 min with secondary immunogold-labeled antibody. EM was performed on a Philips CM100 EM (Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).RESULTSPurification of polyQ Containing FLAG- and Myc-tagged GST Fusion Proteins—To study co-aggregation of polyQ-containing proteins in vitro plasmids for the expression of FLAG-tagged (F-) and Myc-tagged (M-) GST-HD exon 1 fusion proteins with polyQ sequences in the normal (20, 32, or 37 glutamines) and the pathological range (39, 52, or 53 glutamines) were constructed (Fig. 1A).The resulting GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified under native conditions by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose beads (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The FLAG- and Myc-tagged fusion proteins with polyQ sequences in the normal and pathological range revealed major bands at 45–60 kDa with the expected shifts in migration relative to polyQ repeat length (Fig. 1, B and C). The identity of each fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an htt-exon 1-specific antibody (anti-CAG53b) and antibodies directed against the FLAG or Myc epitope (anti-FLAG and anti-Myc, respectively). Fig. 1D shows exemplarily that the anti-FLAG antibody detects FLAG-tagged proteins but not Myc-tagged proteins. Conversely, the anti-Myc antibody recognizes the Myc- but not the FLAG-tagged proteins.Aggregation of FLAG- and Myc-tagged HD Exon 1 Proteins in Vitro—To study the aggregation of epitope-tagged GST-HD exon 1 fusion proteins, an in vitro assay was developed. The fusion proteins with polyQ tracts of different lengths were incubated at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/ml with PreScission protease for 3 h at 8 °C to remove the GST tag, which itself hinders aggregate formation. The unique PreScission protease site in the fusion proteins is located between the GST and the HD exon 1 fragment (Fig. 1A). After cleavage, the samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C to permit accumulation of SDS-resistant polyQ-containing protein aggregates. Formation of insoluble aggregates was quantified using a filter retardation assay (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). We found that both F-HDQ39 and F-HDQ53 formed SDS-insoluble high molecular weight aggregates in vitro, whereas F-HDQ20, F-HDQ32, and F-HDQ37 did not (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when the aggregation of the protease-treated Myc-tagged fusion proteins with 20, 32, 37, 39, 45, and 52 glutamines was analyzed (data not shown). SDS-resistant aggregates could not be detected for any of the fusion proteins prior to incubation at 37 °C.Fig. 2Aggregation of GST-HD fusion proteins in vitro. A, concentration and polyQ length dependence of HD exon 1 protein aggregation. Fusion proteins with 20–53 glutamine residues were incubated at 50–400 μg/ml with PreScission protease for3hat8 °Cand then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. 400 ng of each sample were subjected to the filter trap assay, and aggregates were detected with the anti-FLAG antibody. B, EM analysis of aggregates formed by HD exon 1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins GST-F-HDQ20 and GST-HDQ53 (final concentration, 400 μg/ml) were treated with (right panels) or without (left panels) PreScission protease and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The aliquots were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and viewed by electron microscopy. C, kinetics of HD exon 1 aggregation. GST-F-HDQ53, GST-F-HDQ20, and GST-F-HDQ32 (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) were incubated with PreScission protease for 3 h at 8°C and then incubated at 37 °C. At various times aliquots were taken, denatured, and analyzed by the filter retardation test. The captured aggregates were detected with anti-FLAG antibody and quantified. The signal intensity of the sample obtained after 21 h of incubation was arbitrarily set as 100%. The signal obtained for the nonincubated sample was subtracted from each value as background. D, HD exon 1 protein aggregation is nucleation-dependent. F-HDQ53 aggregation was performed with or without the addition of seeds (1–5% of input fusion protein) derived from M-HDQ52 aggregates. Following removal of the GST tag from GST-F-HDQ53 (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) by PreScission protease samples were incubated at 37 °C. Aggregate formation was monitored by the filter trap assay using anti-FLAG antibody. C and D, values shown are the averages of triplicate determinations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we explored the morphology of the aggregates formed in vitro from FLAG or Myc-tagged fusion proteins. GST-F-HDQ20 and GST-F-HDQ53 were used for aggregation assays, and aliquots thereof were subjected to electron microscopy. As expected, the F-HDQ53 aggregates obtained after GST-F-HDQ53 cleavage showed a distinct fibrillar morphology, whereas no such fibrils were observed after cleavage of GST-F-HDQ20 or for the uncleaved GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2B). The same results were obtained with the corresponding Myc-tagged fusion proteins. Thus, the presence of both the FLAG and Myc epitope (7 and 10 amino acid residues, respectively) does not seemingly hinder the process of aggregation and allows the formation of fibrils similar to those observed for the non-tagged HD exon 1 proteins (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar).We found that self-assembly of polyQ-containing htt fragments strongly depends on protein concentration and occurs only when a critical threshold of polyQ-length is exceeded (Fig. 2A). Compared with previous in vitro models of htt aggregation using recombinant proteins (10Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41032-41037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), our assay bears two major advantages. First, because of the introduction of a unique PreScission protease site between the GST tag and the epitope-tagged htt fragment, it is possible to separate the processes of proteolytic removal of the GST tag and subsequent aggregation of the htt portion of the fusion protein. Thus, aggregation can be followed independently from the proteolytic cleavage step. Second, differential labeling of htt fragments with the FLAG or Myc epitope allows to follow the fate of different moieties of purified HD exon 1 proteins in the same aggregation reaction. This renders our assay an excellent tool to study co-aggregation of htt molecules with normal and extended polyQ stretches.Kinetic Studies of HD Exon 1 Protein Aggregation in Vitro—A time course of F-HDQ53, F-HDQ20,and F-HDQ32 aggregation is shown in Fig. 2C. Following removal of the GST tag from the fusion proteins, samples were incubated at 37 °C to permit aggregate formation. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times, and SDS-resistant aggregates were detected by the filter trap assay. Formation of SDS-resistant F-HDQ53 aggregates started after a lag phase of 2–3 h and reached near saturation after 8–11 h, whereas as expected no SDS-resistant aggregates were observed with the F-HDQ20 and F-HDQ32 proteins (Fig. 2C).In the experiment of Fig. 2D, we examined the effect of seeds on the kinetics of F-HDQ53 aggregation. Aggregates produced from GST-M-HDQ52 were sonicated to disrupt them into small pieces that were visible by electron microscopy but were too short to be detected by the filter trap assay (data not shown). These fragments then were used to seed the aggregation of F-HDQ53. The reactions were set up with GST-F-HDQ53 in the presence of various amounts of seeds (1–5% of input fusion protein). At various times aliquots were removed and analyzed by the filter retardation assay using the anti-FLAG antibody. The results shown in Fig. 2D demonstrate that the addition of increasing amounts of seeds to the aggregation reaction of F-HDQ53 leads to the elimination of the lag phase at a seed concentration corresponding to about 2.5% of the total amount of input protein. Thus, aggregation of FLAG-tagged htt protein requires the formation of nuclei and starts when their concentration exceeds a critical value.Co-aggregation of FLAG- and Myc-tagged HD Exon 1 Proteins in Vitro—Increasing evidence suggests that besides aggregation of mutant htt, loss of normal htt function also contributes to the phenotype of HD (9Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies and post-mortem examination of brains from HD patients and transgenic mice have led to the speculation that aggregates of mutant htt may sequester wild-type protein and interfere with its normal function (15Huang C.C. Faber P.W. Persichetti F. Mittal V. Vonsattel J.P. MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.F. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 21Wheeler V.C. White J.K.

Genet. 2000; 9: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To investigate this hypothesis in more detail, we performed co-aggregation studies using GST-HD fusion proteins with normal or elongated polyQ sequences.FLAG-tagged fusion proteins with 20, 32, or 37 glutamines were mixed with equal amounts of the Myc-tagged protein GST-M-HDQ52. Samples were treated with PreScission protease, followed by incubation at 37 °C to permit aggregation. In parallel, co-aggregation assays were carried out in which GST-M-HDQ52 was replaced by GST-M-HDQ20 that harbors a normal polyQ tract. Aggregates were captured by filtration and detected with the anti-FLAG (Fig. 3A) and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3B). We found that FLAG- and Myc-tagged proteins form mixed SDS-insoluble high molecular weight aggregates in vitro provided that one of the proteins contains an elongated polyQ tract (>37 glutamines). The extent of aggregate formation is strongly influenced by attributes of the co-aggregating polyQ fragments that cannot trigger aggregation on their own. The highest amount of co-aggregates was formed when M-HDQ52 was combined with F-HDQ37. Significantly fewer co-aggregates were observed after combination of M-HDQ52 with F-HDQ32 or F-HDQ20 (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the total amount of aggregates formed correlates with the polyQ tract length even when the number of glutamines in the co-aggregating partner does not exceed the critical threshold.Fig. 3Co-aggregation of Myc- or FLAG-tagged GST-HD exon 1 fusion proteins. A and B, fusion proteins GST-M-HDQ20 and GST-M-HDQ52 (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) were mixed with equal amounts of GST-F-HDQ20, GST-F-HDQ32, or GST-F-HDQ37. After removal of the GST tag by treatment with PreScission protease samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h.

It forms a molecular complex with oleic acid that induces cell death with selectivity for tumor cells and undifferentiated cells. The apoptotic activity of this complex was discovered by serendipity in a fraction of human milk casein (1Håkansson A. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Sabharwal H. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8064-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and the structural basis of this novel activity was studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques and biological assays (2Svensson M. Sabharwal H. Hakansson A. Mossberg A.K. Lipniunas P. Leffler H. Svanborg C. Linse S. J. Biol.

HAMLET contains partially unfolded α-lactalbumin with native-like secondary structure but lacking specific tertiary packing of the side chains. Oleic acid binds to the unfolded protein with a stereo-specific fit, and the hinge region between the α-helical and the β-sheet domains has been proposed as the fatty acid binding site. 2M. Svensson, A.-K. Mossberg, J. Pettersson, S. Linse, and C. Svanborg, manuscript submitted.2M. Svensson, A.-K. Mossberg, J. Pettersson, S. Linse, and C. Svanborg, manuscript submitted. The link between apoptosis induction and the folding change was proven by deliberate conversion of native α-lactalbumin to the apoptosis-inducing form in the presence of oleic acid (3Svensson M. Hakansson A. Mossberg A.K. Linse S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). HAMLET is thus defined as the biologically active conversion product of α-lactalbumin and oleic acid. HAMLET triggers cell death in many different tumor cell lines, with morphological features resembling apoptosis. The dying cells show nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, and DNA fragmentation. Healthy, differentiated cells, in contrast, survive HAMLET challenge and show no apoptotic changes (1Håkansson A. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Sabharwal H. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8064-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This difference in sensitivity implies that HAMLET reaches unique targets in tumor cells, but not in healthy, differentiated cells, and that cell death programs are activated and executed as a result of these interactions. One striking feature of HAMLET is the ability to move through the cytoplasm of tumor cells to the nuclei, where HAMLET remains and accumulates. This unusual trafficking behavior was first observed in early studies with the active human milk fraction (2Svensson M. Sabharwal H. Hakansson A. Mossberg A.K. Lipniunas P. Leffler H. Svanborg C. Linse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6388-6396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Håkansson A. Andreasson J. Zhivotovsky B. Karpman D. Orrenius S. Svanborg C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The nuclear accumulation occurred in the majority of dying tumor cells but not in the healthy cells that remained viable in the presence of HAMLET, showing that the interaction with the nuclear compartment is an important aspect of the tumor cell response. In addition, the nuclear accumulation appeared to be irreversible, suggesting that nuclear target molecules were able to bind and retain the active complex in the nucleus. The present study identified nuclear target molecules for HAMLET in cancer cells. We present evidence that HAMLET interacts with specific histone proteins and chromatin. The chromatin interaction may indeed mark the irreversible phase of cell death. Purification of α-Lactalbumin and Conversion to HAMLET—HAMLET is a folding variant of human α-lactalbumin stabilized by a C18:1 fatty acid cofactor. In this study, native α-lactalbumin was purified from human milk and converted to HAMLET on an oleic acid conditioned ion exchange matrix as previously described (3Svensson M. Hakansson A.

Subcellular Localization of HAMLET—For subcellular localization by real-time confocal microscopy, A549 or human renal tubular epithelial cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 568-labeled HAMLET (Alexa-HAMLET, 0.1 mg/ml) under cell culture conditions described above and analyzed in a Bio-Rad 1024 laser scanning confocal equipment attached to a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope (Nikon) with a 60× objective (NA 1.40). For in vivo co-localization of HAMLET and histones, HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H3 or H2B (5Kimura H. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) were exposed to Alexa-HAMLET for 24 h (H3) or 3 h (H2B) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For localization of 125I-labeled HAMLET (125I-HAMLET), HeLa cells were incubated with 0.4 mg/ml unlabeled HAMLET and ∼1.5*105 cpm 125I-HAMLET/ml for 1, 3, or 6 h. The cells were subsequently fractionated into a cytoplasmic and a nuclear fraction. The activity of the fractions was measured using a gamma counter (1282 Compu-gamma, LKB Wallac). Cellular and Nuclear Fractionation—Nuclei from HeLa cells were purified according to Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (6Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, Hoboken, NJ1993: 12.0.3-12.1.9Google Scholar). The supernatant remaining after collection of the nuclei was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclei were subfractionated by treatment with 1) 0.3 m KCl (6Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Wiley Interscience, Hoboken, NJ1993: 12.0.3-12.1.9Google Scholar), 2) 0.1 mg/ml RNase I (Sigma) in the presence of 0.25 m KCl for 30 min at 37 °C, or 3) 0.5 units of micrococcus nuclease (MNase) to 8 optical units (A 600) of nuclei in the presence of 0.25 m KCl for 5 min at 37 °C. Following treatment, soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare whole nuclear extracts from Jurkat and A549, cells were harvested, washed twice in 1/15 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS), and suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 for Jurkat cells and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, for A549 cells, with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 15 min. The cells were homogenized (Dounce homogenizer, pestle size 411), and sucrose was added to a final concentration of 0.25 m. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, digested with MNase (7Bates D.L. Butler P.J. Pearson E.C. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g, and lysed in 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Gel Electrophoresis—The histones and nuclear extracts were separated on Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (15 or 16%) on a Novex Nu-Page Mini Cell II (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue or silver staining (8Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). Chromatin samples were electrophoresed at room temperature in 4% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1 (w/w)) in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA) (9Hamiche A. Richard-Foy H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The chromatin was stained with SYBR green (Molecular Probes) and detected with a FluorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Overlay—Nuclear extracts or commercial histones were separated by PAGE and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking with solutions Sat 1 (ethanolamine 6.1 g/liter, glycine 9 g/liter, polyvinylpirolidone 10 g/liter, methanol 25%) and Sat 2 (ethanolamine 6.1 g/liter, glycine 9 g/liter, Tween 20 1.25 g/liter, gelatina hydrolysate 5 g/liter, methanol 25%) for 15 min each, the membrane was washed three times for 15 min with PBS-T (PBS and 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with 125I-HAMLET in PBS overnight, washed in PBS-T six times for 15 min, and dried. Bound HAMLET was detected using a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Sequencing and Identification—Nuclear extracts were blotted to PVDF membranes and stained with Coomassie Blue, and bands to be sequenced were excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems model 477 A peptide sequencer. Sequences were compared with the Swiss Protein Database with PatScan software (www.unix.mcs.anl.gov/compbio/PatScan/HTML/patscan.html). Mass Spectrometry—The 12-, 14-, 16-, and 17-kDa bands from the nuclear extract were excised from the gel and prepared for mass spectrometry with a Bruker Scout 384 Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (10Lorenzo P.

Histones—Individually purified bovine histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Bromma, Sweden). Native, folded histones were obtained from duck erythrocyte nuclei (11Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster histones were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and assembled into octamers (12Hamiche A. Kang J.G. Dennis C. Xiao H. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14316-14321Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Affinity Chromatography—HAMLET was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B™ (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. The gel was mixed with core histones in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 m NaCl for 2 h at room temperature and washed, and bound material was eluted by boiling in SDS loading buffer. The eluted material was analyzed by PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Biotinylated HAMLET was immobilized on a SA sensor chip in a BIAcore X facility (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Histone octamers were applied in serial dilutions. A flow rate of 5 μl/min was used during the immobilization and 20 μl/min during the analysis. PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 m NaCl was used as the flow buffer. The surface was regenerated with 10 or 20 mm HCl. The data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation 2.2 software. Precipitation of Histones with HAMLET—Total core histones (native from cells, 2.5 μg) were mixed with HAMLET (2.5 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 5 min, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 2 min and analyzed by 15% Laemmli SDS-PAGE and silver staining. DNA—A 256-bp fragment containing a sea urchin 5 S RNA gene (13Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) was gel-purified from an EcoRI or NciI digest of plasmid pLV405-10 (14Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). HAMLET Targets Tumor Cell Nuclei—The accumulation of HAMLET in tumor cell nuclei was demonstrated by real-time confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). Alexa-HAMLET was shown to translocate into the cytoplasm of the tumor cells and to accumulate in their nuclei. In healthy cells, HAMLET entered the cytoplasm but did not travel further, and no nuclear accumulation was detected (Fig. 1A). The nuclear accumulation of HAMLET was quantified using radiolabeled protein. Nuclear fractions were obtained from 125I-HAMLET-treated carcinoma cells after 1, 3, or 6 h of incubation. About 90% of the cell-associated radioactivity was in the nuclear fraction after 1 h, with a little further increase at the later time points, and 0.2-0.4% of the total added radioactivity was incorporated into the cells (Fig. 1B). After 6 h, cell viability had decreased to 67%. HAMLET Binds to Specific Histones in Nuclear Extracts— Molecular targets for HAMLET were identified in nuclear extracts separated by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with 125I-HAMLET. Experiments were performed in parallel in one human lymphoma (Jurkat) and one carcinoma (A549) cell line, and similar results were obtained using nuclear extracts from both cell lines. HAMLET was shown to recognize four distinct bands of ∼12, 14, 16, and 17 kDa molecular mass (Fig. 2A). The 17-, 16-, 14-, and 12-kDa bands were identified as histones H3, H2B, H3, and H4, respectively, by MALDI-TOF. The 17-kDa band showed N-terminal homology to histone H3, and the identity was verified by immunoblot using monoclonal anti-H3 antibodies (not shown). The 14-kDa band showed sequence homology with H3 but lacked the first 21 amino acids of the N-terminal tail (Fig. 2A). This form of H3 corresponds to a fragment obtained after proteolytic degradation, and as a consequence, the band was not recognized by the anti-H3 antibody, which is directed to the tail region (not shown). HAMLET, in contrast, bound to this form of H3, suggesting that the interaction is independent of the histone tail. HAMLET Interacts with Purified Histones—These interactions were further examined using purified histone proteins. As a first step, purified bovine histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes, and the blots were overlaid with radiolabeled HAMLET (Fig. 2B). High affinity binding to H3 and weak binding to H4 and H2B were observed. HAMLET did not bind to bovine H1 or H2A in the overlay assay. The histone specificity of HAMLET was examined further using natively folded histones in affinity chromatography. A mixture of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) purified from duck erythrocyte nuclei was allowed to interact with HAMLET immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose. Proteins eluted with SDS loading buffer were identified by SDS-PAGE. The four histones were retained on the column in approximately equal amounts, but there was no binding to the clean Sepharose matrix (Fig. 2C). The affinity of HAMLET for isolated histones was studied by surface plasmon resonance using HAMLET-coated BIAcore sensor chips and bovine or natively folded duck histone preparations. Bovine histone H3 showed very rapid binding kinetics and remained bound with no evidence of dissociation during the experimental period, suggesting virtually irreversible binding to HAMLET (data not shown). H3 could not be forcibly eluted from the chip when detergents, salt, or acid were used. The native core histones bound rapidly to the HAMLET coated surface (Fig. 2D), and the dissociation was very slow. HAMLET Precipitates Histones from Solution—In preparation for studies of nucleosomes and chromatin, native core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) were mixed with HAMLET in solution. To our surprise, the solution immediately turned opalescent, and with time a white precipitate accumulated at the bottom of the test tube. The precipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and was shown to contain mainly histones H3 and H4 and minor amounts of H2A and H2B (Fig. 3). HAMLET was also present in the precipitates (not shown). Native α-lactalbumin was used as a control and did not form precipitates with the histones (Fig. 3); the histones did not precipitate in the absence of HAMLET (not shown). HAMLET Co-localizes with Histones H2B and H3 in Vivo— The interaction of HAMLET with histones was further examined in the nuclei of intact, living cells. Stably transfected HeLa cell lines expressing GFP-H3 or GFP-H2B were exposed to Alexa-HAMLET. By real-time confocal microscopy (Fig. 4A), HAMLET was shown to co-localize with both histones in the HeLa cell nuclei. In addition, the global chromatin structure was perturbed by HAMLET treatment. In HAMLET-treated cells, the chromatin was condensed to the nuclear periphery, and new, spherical structures appeared. Both HAMLET and the histones were present in those structures. Control cells showed normal chromatin distribution (Fig. 4B). HAMLET Is Not a Chromatin Assembly Protein—The results suggested that HAMLET may interact directly with soluble histones and chromatin in tumor cells. HAMLET was compared with the chromatin assembly protein nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1), which binds histones and delivers them to DNA, thereby enhancing nucleosome formation. NAP-1 was mixed with histones, DNA fragments were added to the mixture, and the assembled nucleosomes were detected by native PAGE (Fig. 5A). The pure histone-DNA mixture formed unspecific aggregates, but after the addition of NAP-1, a concentration-dependent nucleosome assembly was observed. Depending on the position of the histone octamer on the DNA fragment, two mononucleosome species were formed (Fig. 5A, bands N 1 and N 2). The same assay system was used to test how HAMLET affected the assembly of nucleosomes (Fig. 5B). No nucleosome assembly was detected in the presence of HAMLET. In contrast, HAMLET prevented the histones from binding to the DNA. HAMLET Forms an Insoluble, Histone-containing Complex in Tumor Cell Nuclei—Nuclei were purified from 125I-HAMLET-treated HeLa cells, and HAMLET-containing nuclear fractions were purified (Fig. 6). After measurements of total nucleus-associated radioactivity, nuclei were extracted with 0.3 m KCl to release soluble nuclear proteins. 97% of the radioactivity remained in the insoluble nuclear fraction. The nuclei were further solubilized by treatment with RNase I and 0.25 m NaCl. Labeled HAMLET (91%) remained in the insoluble fraction. Finally, the chromatin was solubilized by MNase cleavage in the presence of 0.25 m KCl. This treatment released chromatin from the nuclei (not shown), but the majority of HAMLET (91%) and some chromatin (not shown) remained in the insoluble fraction. This fraction was forced into solution at 95 °C in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular species interacting with HAMLET were identified by blotting with the radiolabeled protein. HAMLET recognized histones H3 and H4 on the blot (Fig. 6). HAMLET causes apoptosis-like death of tumor cells and accumulates in their nuclei. In this study, histones and chromatin were found to be the nuclear target molecules involved in this process. HAMLET was shown to bind a discrete set of proteins in nuclear extracts, which were identified as histones H3, H4, and H2B. The histone specificity of HAMLET was confirmed using isolated histone proteins, and both denatured and natively folded histones were found to bind HAMLET. High affinity interactions were detected by BIAcore methodology, and surprisingly, HAMLET was found to form macroscopically visible precipitates with histones in solution. The in vivo correlate of the HAMLET-histone interactions was studied by real-time confocal microscopy. Using H3 and H2A GFP-reporter constructs, fluorochrome-labeled HAMLET was shown to co-localize with histones in tumor cell nuclei and to perturb the global chromatin structure. HAMLET-treated cells showed condensation of the chromatin, a feature that normally is associated with apoptosis (15Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12826) Google Scholar). Spherical structures were formed within the nuclei, and both HAMLET and histones were present in those structures. The effect on chromatin was confirmed in vitro, and HAMLET was found to differ from other histone-binding proteins like NAP-1, in that it blocked rather than promoted assembly of chromatin. Finally, HAMLET and histones were identified in an insoluble nuclear fraction isolated from dying cancer cells. The results demonstrate that core histones, and especially H3, are targets for HAMLET in tumor cell nuclei, suggesting that the affinity for histones perturbs the chromatin structure in tumor cells. In addition, HAMLET binding to free histones may influence their function and transport to the nuclear compartment. By these mechanisms, HAMLET may force the tumor cells into the irreversible phase of cell death. HAMLET interacted with histones in a dose-dependent manner but differed from other known histone-binding proteins. The nucleosome assembly protein, NAP-1 (16Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and other histone-binding proteins act as chaperones during chromatin assembly and remodeling (17Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Their binding to histones is reversible, allowing them to deliver the histones from the site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This effect of NAP-1 was reproduced in the present study, but HAMLET failed to induce nucleosome assembly under the same conditions. When mixed with histones prior to the addition of DNA, HAMLET instead prevented nucleosome formation. Rather than delivering the histones to the DNA, HAMLET thus appeared to sequester them and prevent their deposition on DNA. This is consistent with the high affinity interactions and lack of reversibility of binding that was observed in vitro, in the BIAcore and precipitation assays, and with the presence of HAMLET and histones in an insoluble nuclear fraction from dying cancer cells. The results show that HAMLET differs not only in structure but also in function from other histone-binding proteins. HAMLET was found to bind with high affinity both to native and denatured histone proteins, suggesting that HAMLET recognizes molecular motifs that are maintained regardless of the histone fold. Interestingly, the interaction with H3 was independent of the functionally important histone tail, further supporting the notion that conserved epitopes are involved in binding. This ability of HAMLET to interact with different folding variants of histones is likely to have implications for the effects of HAMLET on histone metabolism and function in vivo. HAMLET may bind histones at the time of synthesis in the cytoplasm and disturb the folding process as well as the nuclear transport. HAMLET could also interfere with the association of correctly folded histones with each other and, ultimately, their deposition on DNA, as evidenced by the present study. Based on these findings, two potentially important cellular effects of HAMLET may be discussed. First, the studies offer a molecular explanation for the accumulation of HAMLET in the nuclei of tumor cells, as the high affinity binding to histones and nucleosomes may cause HAMLET to remain in the nuclear compartment. Second, this effect of HAMLET may represent a novel mechanism of nuclear attack during programmed cell death. The results suggest a new mechanism of chromatin disruption and propose HAMLET as an agonist with this effect. By binding to histones, HAMLET disrupts chromatin assembly and interferes with intact chromatin, thus preventing the cell from transcription, replication, and recombination. Kinetic studies have confirmed that DNA and RNA synthesis come to a halt within minutes in cells treated with HAMLET. 3O. Hallgren and C. Svanborg, unpublished data. As a consequence, HAMLET causes irreversible damage and cell death. This mechanism has not been described previously, but chromatin assembly proteins in yeast have been proposed to be involved in cell death (18Yamaki M. Umehara T. Chimura T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Deletion of the histone chaperone ASF1/CIA1 stimulated an active, apoptosis-like cell death mechanism. It is possible that HAMLET may act through a similar mechanism in tumor cells. We propose that HAMLET offers a novel solution to ensure tumor cell death through disruption of the chromatin and speculate that the chromatin interaction marks the irreversible phase of tumor cell death induced by HAMLET. The specificity for histones per se does not explain the selectivity of HAMLET for tumor cells, however. The decisive step is the active transport of HAMLET from the cytoplasm into the nuclear compartment. 4L. Gustafsson, C. Düringer, and C. Svanborg, unpublished data. We have observed that this nuclear accumulation occur in tumor cells and not in healthy differentiated cells, but further studies are required to understand the transport of HAMLET to the nuclear compartment and the molecular basis of selectivity. Selective induction of apoptosis in tumor cells would be a highly desirable outcome of cancer therapy. Normally, however, tumor cells are refractory to the apoptosis signals that limit the longevity of healthy, differentiated cells. For example, p53 mutations impair the sensing of DNA damage, and altered expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members inhibits the mitochondrial response to various apoptosis agonists (19Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Still, the molecular executors of apoptosis remain intact in many tumor cells, and the task is to find ways of inducing apoptosis by circumventing the roadblocks that prevent them from being activated. HAMLET may offer new solutions to this problem. By attacking the chromatin assembly machinery, HAMLET appears to upset fundamental mechanisms available in all tumor cells, potentially explaining why HAMLET has such a broad anti-tumor spectrum.

https://openalex.org/W2067025650,"Low density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) is a transmembrane receptor, localized mainly in hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and neurons. It is implicated in diverse biological processes both as an endocytic receptor and as a signaling molecule. Recent reports show that LRP undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavage in the ectodomain and transmembrane domain. The latter cleavage, mediated by the Alzheimer-related γ-secretase activity that also cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, results in the release of the LRP cytoplasmic domain (LRPICD) fragment. This relatively small cytoplasmic fragment has several motifs by which LRP interacts with various intracellular adaptor and scaffold proteins. However, the function of this fragment is largely unknown. Here we show that the LRPICD is translocated to the nucleus, where it colocalizes in the nucleus with a transcription modulator, Tip60, which is known to interact with Fe65 and with the APP-derived intracellular domain. LRPICD dramatically inhibits APP-derived intracellular domain/Fe65 transactivation mediated by Tip60. LRPICD has a close interaction with Tip60 in the nucleus, as shown by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. These observations suggest that LRPICD has a novel signaling function, negatively impacting transcriptional activity of the APP, Fe65, and Tip60 complex in the nucleus, and shed new light on the function of LRP in transcriptional modulation.

This cleavage releases a cytoplasmic fragment of LRP (LRPICD) from the membrane. However, the function of LRPICD is not yet known. In addition to its well characterized role as an endocytic receptor, recent data suggest that LRP (like other LDL receptor family members, VLDLR and ApoER2), could have essential signaling functions that involve interactions of its cytoplasmic tail with the intracellular signaling machinery (15Pietrzik C.U.

Transmembrane proteins can be cleaved within the plane of the membrane to liberate cytosolic fragments that enter the nucleus to control gene transcription. This mechanism, called regulated intramembranous proteolysis (Rip), adds molecular diversity in the field of signaling (for a review, see Ref. 18Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). APP recently has been shown to play a role in gene transcription, because the APP intracellular domain (AICD) (19Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), in collaboration with the adaptor protein Fe65, can transactivate a Gal4 reporter gene by interacting with the histone acetyltransferase, Tip60 (20Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Our current data show that LRPICD also may interact with Tip60, but in contrast to APP, LRPICD is a negative regulator of transactivation in this system. Generation of Expression Constructs—A summary of constructs APP and LRP, which were used for this study, is shown in Fig. 1. The generation of the full-length LRP-GFP was described previously (10Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Mikhailenko I. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LC-Myc construct, which encodes only the light chain of LRP, tagged with Myc at its C terminus has been used and described previously (21Mikhailenko I. Battey F.D. Migliorini M. Ruiz J.F. Argraves K. Moayeri M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39484-39491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LRP165-Myc was generated from the LC-Myc plasmid. LC-Myc was digested with PstI, and the band containing the vector and the carboxyl terminus of LRP (coding 165 amino acids) was extracted and self-ligated to make the LRP165-Myc construct. The LRP105-Myc construct, encoding only the cytoplasmic domain of LRP, was amplified by PCR, using two sets of primers, 5′-CGCTCGAGGCCACCATGGTGGTATTCTGGTATAAGCGG-3′ and 5′-CGAAGCTTGGTGCCAAGGGGTCCCCTATCTC-3′. Then it was ligated into XhoI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc B (Invitrogen) vector. Likewise, LRP105-GFP was made by PCR using two sets of primers, 5′-CGCTCGAGGCCACCATGGTGGTATTCTGGTATAAGCGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTGCCAAGGGGTCCCCTATCTC-3′, and then inserted into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). LRP105-GFP NPXY and LRP105-Myc NPXY constructs with doubly mutated NPXY to APXA, were generated by PCR, using the LC-Myc construct containing doubly mutated NPXY motifs as a template as described above. Substitutions of asparagine and tyrosine to alanines in the two NPXY motifs of the cytoplasmic domain of the LC-Myc were performed using Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) and confirmed by sequencing. Signal LRP105 encodes the signal peptide (Igκ chain leader sequence) at its N terminus to ensure the secretion of expressed protein; the LRP105 fragment amplified by PCR was inserted into the PstI and XbaI sites of pSecTagB (Invitrogen). LRP105-Gal4 contains a Gal4-binding domain at its C terminus, which was amplified by PCR from pMst-APP695 construct (see below) using two sets of primers, 5′-GTCGCTAGCAGGCCACCATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-GACCTCGAGCGATACAGTCAACTGTCTTTG-3′, and then inserted into the NheI and XhoI sites of the LRP105-Myc construct. pMst-APP695 (APP-Gal4) was generously provided by Dr. T. Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), in which Gal4 was inserted into the intracellular tail of APP695 at the cytoplasmic boundary of the transmembrane region as well as the Gal4 reporter plasmid (pG5E1B), which contains five Gal4 binding sites and the E1B minimal promotor in front of the luciferase firefly gene. pRK-Fe65 has been used and described previously (10Kinoshita A.

Hertz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Numb in the expression vector pSG5 was a generous gift of Dr. Y. N. Jan (University of California, San Francisco). The AICD plasmid, encoding the C-terminal 58 amino acids of full-length APP, tagged with Myc, has been used and described previously (22Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28530-28536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). pCMV-β-Gal was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). PGL2-promotor vector, containing SV40 promotor upstream of the luciferase gene, was used as a positive control for firefly luciferase production (Promega, Madison, WI). PGL2-Basic vector was obtained from Promega and used as a negative control for firefly luciferase production. The generation of the wild type Tip60 construct has been described previously (22Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28530-28536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, Tip60 was cut out from the pOZ-Tip60 plasmid (23Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) with restriction enzymes XhoI and NotI. The expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was digested with XhoI and NotI, cutting out the GFP. The wild type Tip60 was digested and ligated into a mammalian expression vector backbone derived from the EGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech), from which the EGFP coding sequence had been deleted. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibody 11H4 against LRP-C-terminal fragment was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. The antibody against amino acids 494–513 of Tip60 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-Fe65 was a generous gift from Dr. Buxbaum (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Anti-APP C terminus C8 was raised against the 8 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of APP, a generous gift from Dr. Selkoe (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Cell Culture Conditions and Transient Transfection—H4 cells derived from human neuroglioma cells and HEK293 cells derived from human embryonic kidney cells are used in this study. Both H4 cells and HEK293 cells were cultured in OPTI-MEM I with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of the cells was performed using a liposome-mediated method (FuGene 6; Roche Applied Science). For immunocyotochemistry, cells were split into 4-well chambers 1 day before the transfection. First, a mixture of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGene6 was made in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and left for 15–30 min at room temperature. Then 25 μl of this mixture was added to the medium in each well. The incubation time was 24–48 h. Double transfection of LRP and Tip60 was performed in the same way. For the transactivation assay, HEK293 cells were split into 12-well plates 1 day before transient transfection. To see the effect of LRPICD on the transactivation induced by APP and Fe65, various LRPICD constructs were co-transfected with pMst-APP and Fe65, together with pG5E1B-Luc. pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was added to make up the equal amount of DNA transfected. PGL3-SV40 was used as a positive control for firefly luciferase, and pGL2-Basic was used as a standard. In order to assess the role of LRPICD in transactivation, LRP105-Gal4 was co-transfected with pG5E1B-Luc with or without other plasmids encoding LRP-interacting proteins (Fe65, mDab1, Numb, and AICD). All cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-Gal, a constitutive β-galactosidase expression vector, to standardize for transfection efficiency. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was done on the cells 24–48 h post-transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.3), and permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum for 1 h. To detect the localization of LRPICD, cells transfected with LRP105-Myc or LRP105-Gal4 were immunostained by mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen) or 11H4, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline and labeled by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (10 μg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunostained cells were stored in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C until imaging. To detect the interaction of LRPICD and Tip60 in the nucleus, cells co-transfected with constructs of LRP105-GFP and Tip60 were used. Co-transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized and blocked in normal goat serum and then incubated with primary antibody against Tip60, followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 (10 μg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch) to visualize the localization of Tip60. Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells were harvested for reporter gene assays 24 h after transfection. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. After the addition of 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) per well of the 12-well plate, cells were collected and pelleted, and the supernatant was saved. Luciferase gene expression was analyzed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a 96-well plate. The luminescence emission was measured by a Wallac plate reader. β-Galactosidase assays for internal control of transcription efficiency were carried out with an aliquot of the cell lysates prepared for the luciferase assay using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was obtained by dividing the relative luminescence units values by those from the β-galactosidase reaction, and then this number was standardized by dividing by that of pGL2-Basic-transfected cells. All transfections were done in triplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. Values shown are averages of transactivation assays carried out in triplicate. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET): Assessment by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)—FRET is observed when two fluorophores are in very close proximity (i.e. <10 nm). FRET measurements using FLIM rely on the observation that the fluorescence lifetime (the time of fluorophore emission after brief excitation, measured in picoseconds) decreases in the presence of a FRET acceptor. The decrease in lifetime is proportional to the distance between donor and acceptor (see Refs. 24Bastiaens P.I. Squire A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar and 25Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Optics. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). FLIM allows quantitative determination of the distance between a donor and acceptor fluorophore on a scale of nanometers. We recently developed a new technique that can quantitate protein-protein interactions using multiphoton microscopy (25Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Optics. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Berezovska O. Pavan R. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra Physics) sends a 1-fs pulse every 12 ns to excite the fluorophore. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 multiphoton microscope. We used a high speed Hamamatsu microchannel plate detector and hardware/software from Becker and Hickl (Berlin, Germany) to measure fluorescence lifetimes on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Donor fluorophore (GFP) lifetimes were fit to two exponential decay curves to calculate the fraction of fluorophores within each pixel that either interact or do not interact with an acceptor (in this case, Cy3-labeled Tip60). These lifetimes were then mapped by pseudocolor on a pixel-by-pixel basis over the entire image. As a negative control, GFP lifetime was measured in the absence of acceptor (i.e. the cells were not stained with Cy3). Localization of LRP Cytoplasmic Domain in Various Deletion Mutants—We asked whether the proteolytic intramembranous cleavage of LRP would affect the localization of LRPICD, as is the case for proteins that undergo Rip. H4 cells were transiently transfected with various LRP constructs, and the localization of the LRP C terminus was examined (Fig. 2). The membrane-spanning molecules, full-length LRP, LC, LRP165, and LRP105 construct with a signal peptide are localized in Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, cell surface, and endosomes (Fig. 2). In contrast, LRP105-transfected H4 cells (tagged with either EGFP or Myc at their C termini) showed the LRP C terminus predominantly in the nucleus. LRP105-Gal4, when stained with 11H4, also showed a predominantly nuclear localization. LRP binds to diverse cytoplasmic proteins that have been found to interact with the tail of LRP (3Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The tetraamino acid motif NPXY is present in two copies in the LRP tail. One or both of the NPXY motifs might interact with other proteins in the cytoplasm, such as Fe65 (7Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and mammalian Disabled-1 (mDab1) (27Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The LRP105 double NPXY mutant, which has APXA substitution instead of NPXY in both copies of the LRP tail, also showed a predominantly nuclear signal, suggesting that the NPXY motifs are not necessary for LRPICD to be translocated to the nucleus and that LRPICD localization in the nucleus is independent of the interaction via NPXY with adaptor proteins, like Fe65. Thus, these results show that the intracellular domain of LRP is translocated to the nucleus. The Effect of LRPICD on Transcription—As described above, the cytoplasmic domain of LRP was localized predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have some function as a transcriptional modulator, like other proteins that undergo regulated intramembranous proteolysis. We hypothesized that LRPICD might be able to modulate gene transcription. To investigate the role of LRPICD in transcription, we employed a luciferase-based reporter gene assay. We fused the cytoplasmic tail of LRP to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4) at its C terminus (LRP105-Gal4). HEK293 cells were transfected with LRP105-Gal4 along with a reporter plasmid. LRP105-Gal4 had little or no activity on the Gal4-dependent promotor (Fig. 3A), although its localization was found to be predominantly in the nucleus (confirmed by 11H4 staining). This result suggests that LRPICD alone is not sufficient to strongly activate the transcriptional response. We considered the possibility that LRPICD may require an adaptor protein to activate transcription, like AICD requiring Fe65. We transfected LRP105-Gal4 with adaptor/interacting proteins to HEK293 cells, along with a reporter plasmid. Little transactivation (4–8-fold) was observed with LRP105-Gal4 by itself or in the presence of Fe65, Numb, mDab1, or AICD compared with pGL2-Basic plasmid (Fig. 3A). Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of LRP, when overexpressed in cells as a fusion protein with a heterologous DNA binding domain, does not stimulate transcription robustly in comparison with APP-Gal4 or especially APP-Gal4 plus Fe65 (>200-fold). We then tested whether LRPICD could have some effect on transactivation induced by APP and Fe65 (20Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), since LRP is known to interact with APP via its extracellular and intracellular domains (6Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfecting LRPICD greatly inhibited the transcription (e.g. to less than 10%) mediated by pMst-APP and Fe65, suggesting that LRPICD is a potent transcription inhibitor in this system. To determine whether this effect depends on the nuclear translocation of LRPICD or interaction with Fe65, we used various LRPICD constructs: LRP105, LRP105 double NPXY mutant, LRP105 with a signal peptide (which is membrane-associated in the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum), and LRP165. As shown in Fig. 3B, LRP105 double NPXY mutant (which translocates to the nucleus but does not interact with Fe65) had the same inhibitory effect as LRP105. By contrast, LRP105 with a signal peptide and LRP165, which do not translocate to the nucleus, do not inhibit AICD-mediated transactivation. Thus, this result suggests that the inhibitory effect by LRPICD depends on its nuclear translocation and that this effect is independent of its interaction with adaptor proteins via NPXY motifs. We reasoned that this inhibition could be due to inhibition of AICD generation or translocation to the nucleus, inhibition of AICD/Fe65 interaction with Tip60, or nonspecific inhibition of the luciferase reporter. In order to see whether LRPICD nonspecifically inhibited the luciferase reporter system, we co-transfected pGL2-SV40 with LRPICD plasmid. pGL2-SV40 was used as a positive control for the firefly luciferase. Co-transfecting LRPICD with this plasmid did not affect transactivation or the luciferase read-out. Whether the nuclear translocation of AICD is affected by LRPICD or not was examined by triple transfection of LRP105, APP, and Fe65 into H4 cells. Cells were immunostained by rabbit anti-Fe65 antibody (labeled by Cy5) and mouse 11H4 antibody (labeled by Cy3). APP770-GFP signal is localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of Fe65 (Fig. 4A); however, APP770-GFP signal was found in the nucleus as previously reported in the presence of Fe65 (28Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), regardless of LRPICD co-transfection (Fig. 4B). To confirm these results, cells were transfected with pMst-APP, Fe65-Myc, and LRP105-GFP. Cells were immunostained by rabbit C8 antibody (labeled by Cy3) and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (labeled by Cy5). The APP C terminus was also localized in the nucleus (data not shown), confirming that the translocation of APP C terminus was not inhibited by LRPICD. Interaction of LRPICD with Tip60 by FLIM Analysis—We next tested the possibility that LRPICD may interact with Tip60, thus interfering with transactivation by APP. We first examined the localization of LRPICD and Tip60 in co-transfected H4 cells by confocal microscopic analysis. The LRP105 singly transfected cells showed nuclear localization of LRPICD, with a uniform staining pattern in the nucleus, as shown in Fig. 2. When LRP105 is co-transfected with Tip60, the intranuclear localization of LRPICD changes noticeably, and it becomes localized in subnuclear compartments, showing a perfect match of localization with Tip60 (Fig. 5A). To further test the hypothesis that LRPICD interacts with Tip60 in the nucleus, we utilized a morphologically based new FRET technique that can reveal protein-protein interactions in intact cells, FLIM. Fluorescence lifetime is influenced by the surrounding microenvironment and is shortened in the immediate vicinity of a FRET acceptor molecule. The degree of lifetime shortening if inherently a quantitative measure of proximity and changes in this quantity reflect alterations in proximity that can be displayed with very high spatial resolution in a pseudocolor-coded image. If the molecules are close together, the donor fluorescence lifetime will be shorter, and the color will be closer to red. Our negative control (in the absence of an acceptor molecule) showed that the lifetime of GFP alone is 2122 ± 50 ps (mean ± S.D.) (see Table I). FLIM analysis of the co-transfected H4 cells with LRP105-GFP (donor) and Tip60 (labeled by Cy3, acceptor) showed that the average fluorescence (GFP) lifetime decreased to 1560 ± 200 ps in the co-localized areas of the nucleus in the presence of acceptor (Table I and Fig. 5B, red-orange staining in the FLIM image), indicating that LRPICD and Tip60 are in close proximity in some special subnuclear locations. As a negative control, FLIM analysis also revealed that there is no detectable interaction between LRPICD and Tip60 in cytoplasmic compartments; the fluorescence lifetime of GFP in nonnuclear compartments, where it does not colocalize with Tip60, was not different from that seen in GFP alone (shown in blue-green in the FLIM image of Fig. 5B).Table IEGFP lifetime of the negative control and the proximity between LRP105 and Tip60FRET donor GFPFRET acceptor Cy3GFP lifetime (mean ± S.D.)p valueaCompared with control.psLRP105GFPNone2122 ± 50LRP105GFPTip601560 ± 200p < 0.002a Compared with control.

https://openalex.org/W2071349049,"Fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc) are characterized by an excessive production of extracellular matrix and profibrotic proteins such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In normal dermal fibroblasts, CTGF is not expressed unless induced by proteins such as tumor growth factor-β (TGFβ). Conversely, in fibroblasts cultured from fibrotic lesions CTGF mRNA and protein are constitutively expressed, even in the absence of exogenously added TGFβ. Thus, studying the mechanism underlying CTGF overexpression in SSc fibroblasts is likely to yield valuable insights into the basis of the fibrotic phenotype of SSc and possibly other scarring disease. CTGF overexpression is mediated primarily by sequences in the CTGF promoter. In this report, we identify the minimal promoter element involved with the overexpression of CTGF in SSc fibroblasts. This element is distinct from the element necessary and sufficient for the induction of CTGF expression by TGFβ in normal fibroblasts. Within this region is a functional Sp1 binding site. Blocking Sp1 activity reduces the elevated, constitutive levels of CTGF promoter activity and protein expression observed in SSc fibroblasts. Relative to those prepared from normal dermal fibroblasts, nuclear extracts prepared from SSc fibroblasts possess increased Sp1 binding activity. Removal of phosphate groups from nuclear extracts enhanced Sp1 binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of Sp1 normally reduces Sp1 binding to DNA. Thus, the constitutive overexpression of CTGF in SSc fibroblasts seems to be independent of TGFβ signaling but dependent at least in part on Sp1.

Wound healing requires the de novo synthesis of connective tissue. If this process is not appropriately terminated, excessive matrix deposition occurs, resulting in pathological fibrosis (1Gruschwitz M. Muller P.U. Sepp N. Hofer E. Fontana A. Wick G. J.

Fibrotic diseases are among the largest groups of disease for which there is no known effective therapy, in part because the cause of these diseases remains elusive. Because TGFβ 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, tumor growth factor-β; SSc, scleroderma; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; wt, wild type. promotes fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis, attention has long been devoted to the potential role of this factor in initiation and maintenance of fibrosis (for reviews, see Refs. 3Blobe G.C.

Pathol. 1998; 184: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For example, there is a clear correlation between TGFβ action and the initiation of fibrosis; in acute drug- or surgery-induced animal models, anti-TGFβ strategies, such as a neutralizing TGFβ antibody or overexpression of Smad7 (for reviews, see Refs. 3Blobe G.C.

Pathol. 1998; 184: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), are effective at attenuating the onset and severity of fibrogenesis. However, the precise role that TGFβ plays in human fibrotic disease is not entirely clear. In the chronic fibrosing disorder scleroderma (SSc) TGFβ mRNA is localized to the leading edge of the fibrotic lesion (i.e. to the region of enhanced inflammatory response that is presumably involved with the expansion of the fibrotic response) but not to the lesional area itself (5Querfeld C.

Although a general feature of fibroblasts taken from SSc lesions is that they show elevated levels of collagen relative to their normal counterparts, SSc fibroblasts do not show elevated TGFβ levels or binding activity or enhanced sensitivity to TGFβ treatment (6Kikuchi K.

Thus, TGFβ expression seems to be clearly associated with the initiation of the fibrotic phenotype of SSc; however, the role of this cytokine in the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype in SSc, or of other fibrotic disease, for that matter, remains unclear. In contrast to TGFβ, expression of the profibrotic protein CTGF correlates well with the severity of fibrotic phenotype of SSc (9Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Grotendorst G.R.

Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Although not normally expressed in fibroblasts unless induced by TGFβ or other proteins, such as thrombin, CTGF is constitutively expressed in many fibrotic disorders, such as scleroderma, liver sclerosis, and pulmonary and renal fibrosis (for reviews, see Refs. 11Moussad E.E.A.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1774-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). CTGF seems to be associated with matrix deposition. For example, a CTGF response element lies between nucleotides –376 and +58 of the type I collagen (Col1A2) promoter (16Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. du Bois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which includes the TGFβ response element of this promoter (17Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, whereas subcutaneous injection of TGFβ into neonatal rats results only in a transient fibrotic response, coinjection of CTGF and TGFβ results in sustained fibrosis (18Mori T. Kaware M. Shinozaki N. Hayashi T. Kakinuma A. Igarishi M. Takigawa T. Nakanishi T. Takehara K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This result could possibly be because CTGF can bind TGFβ and consequently may enhance the activity of TGFβ, at low concentrations, to bind its receptors (19Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that TGFβ may initiate, but CTGF may sustain, the fibrotic response. Thus, examining the mechanism underlying the constitutive overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts from fibrotic lesions should provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying fibrosis. CTGF expression seems to be controlled primarily at the level of transcription and involves both TGFβ-dependent and -independent mechanisms (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A.

For example, the TGFβ induction of the CTGF promoter requires consensus binding motifs for Smad and TEF transcription factors (22Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A.

Similarly, the elevated expression of CTGF protein observed in SSc fibroblasts is paralleled by elevated levels of CTGF promoter activity (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J.

Thus, analyzing the relative contribution of TGFβ-dependent and -independent mechanisms to the elevated level of CTGF promoter activity in lesional SSc fibroblasts should yield valuable insights into the molecular basis of the maintenance of the SSc phenotype. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the fibrotic phenotype of SSc, in this study, we identify regions of the CTGF promoter necessary for the overexpression of CTGF in lesional, dermal SSc fibroblasts. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype of the SSc fibroblast. Cell Culture, Reporter Assays, Transfections, and Western Analysis— Dermal fibroblasts from SSc lesions and healthy persons were taken from biopsies of age-, sex-, and anatomical site-matched volunteers, after informed consent was obtained. All patients fulfilled the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis of diffuse SSc. Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and used between passages 2 and 5 (18Mori T. Kaware M. Shinozaki N. Hayashi T. Kakinuma A.

For assays in which the role of trans-acting proteins were to be tested, 0.5 μg of reporter and 1 μg of empty vector or expression vector encoding the protein of interest were used. TGFβ2 was from R&D Systems or Celtrix. Data presented are means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's unpaired test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For Western blots, cells were cultured and 25 μl of media were electrophoresed through a 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and blotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). CTGF protein was detected as described previously (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Anti-actin antibody was from Sigma. DNA Constructs—The CTGF promoter/SEAP reporter constructs were as described previously (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Point mutations in putative Sp1 sites were introduced (Stratagene) using primer (Sigma Genosys) for the 5′ Sp1 mutant 5′-CACGTCATTGGCGAGCCGCGATATCCCGGAGCGTATAAAAGCCTC-3′ and for the 3′ Sp1 mutant 5′-GTATAAAAGCCTCGGGCCGCGGCCGCCCAAACTCACACAACAAC-3′. The Sp1 expression vector was provided by Dimitris Kardassis (University of Crete, Greece). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting levels of Sp1 binding to a double-stranded oligomer containing a consensus Sp1 site was purchased (Clontech). A commercially available source of Sp1 was purchased (Promega). Fibroblast nuclear extracts were prepared and quantified as described previously (25Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Gel shifts were performed with 2–5 μg of protein and a 0.5-ng probe (1–5 × 104 cpm) as described previously (22Holmes A.

For competition experiments, 100-fold excess unlabeled competitor was added to the reaction mixture before incubation, when required. The SMAD oligomer was described previously (25Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); AP2 and Sp1 oligomers were purchased (Promega). A gel-shift microarray that contained double-stranded oligomers bearing consensus binding sites for known transcription factors was purchased and used as described by the manufacturer (Panomics). To assess the role of phosphorylation in Sp1 binding, nuclear extracts were incubated with and without 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche) for 1 h at 37 °C before use in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The Region Lying between Nucleotides –86 and +17 of the CTGF Promoter Is Required for Its Overexpression in SSc Fibroblasts—To identify regions of the CTGF promoter important for its overexpression in SSc fibroblasts, we transfected a series of CTGF promoter deletion constructs (wt, –244 bp, and –86 bp) into normal and SSc dermal fibroblasts. All constructs contained abundant CTGF promoter expression, suggesting that the elevated level of CTGF expression observed in SSc fibroblasts was controlled by the first 86 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation start site (Fig. 1). This region of the CTGF promoter does not contain the TGFβ response that is necessary and sufficient for TGFβ to induce CTGF in fibroblasts (22Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3008-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The Region between –86 and +17 of the CTGF Promoter Contains One Functional Sp1 Site—To begin to identify elements of the CTGF promoter lying between –86 and +17 that might contribute to the elevated level of CTGF expression in SSc fibroblasts, we examined this region of the CTGF promoter for consensus sites of known transcription factors. We noted a TATA box flanked by two consensus binding sites for transcription factor Sp1, one 5′ to the TATA box (5′Sp1; Fig. 2A); the other 3′ to the TATA box (3′Sp1; Fig. 2A). To determine whether the CTGF promoter's putative Sp1 elements were functional, we first assessed whether these sites could bind Sp1 protein. To do this, we synthesized and radiolabeled a double-stranded oligomer containing both putative Sp1 sites (the sequence shown in Fig. 2A) and performed gel-shift analyses using a commercially available source of Sp1 protein. We found that addition of Sp1 protein to the probe resulted in a shift that could be competed either by a 100-fold molar excess of either unlabeled probe or by an oligomer containing a consensus Sp1 site (Fig. 2B). However, a 100-fold molar excess of oligomers containing either a consensus AP2 site or the SMAD element of the CTGF promoter (22Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) did not compete for factor binding. To test which of the putative Sp1 binding sites in the CTGF promoter could bind Sp1, we generated double-stranded oligomers that contained mutations in either the 3′Sp1 site or the 5′Sp1 site but were otherwise identical to the gel-shift probe and used them as competitors in our gel-shift assays. We found that a 100-fold molar excess of an oligomer containing a mutated 3′Sp1 site did not compete for factor binding; however, an oligomer containing a mutation in the 5′Sp1 site still competed for factor binding (Fig. 2B). Thus, Sp1 or Sp1-like binding activity binds to the consensus Sp1 site downstream from the TATA box in the CTGF promoter but not to the consensus site upstream of the TATA box. To verify that the Sp1 binding site downstream of the TATA box was functional, we mutated the 5′Sp1 or the 3′Sp1 sites in the context of an otherwise wild-type, full-length CTGF promoter, and subcloned the resultant fragments in front of the SEAP reporter gene. These constructs (m5′Sp1 and m3′Sp1, respectively; Fig. 2C) were transfected into fibroblasts. When we compared the expression levels of these new constructs with that of the wild-type, full-length CTGF promoter/SEAP reporter construct (wt CTGF; Fig. 2C), we found that mutation of the 3′Sp1 site, but not the 5′Sp1 site resulted in a decrease of ∼50% in basal promoter activity. Thus, only the putative Sp1 site downstream from the TATA box contributed to the basal CTGF promoter activity. We then cotransfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with either empty expression vector or expression vector encoding Sp1 along with the wt CTGF, m5′, and m3′ promoter/reporter constructs. We found that Sp1 activated the wild-type reporter and the m5′Sp1 mutant construct, but not the m3′Sp1 mutant construct (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggest that the Sp1 recognition motif 3′ to the TATA box, but not the Sp1 site 5′ to the TATA box, is functional and contributes significantly to basal activity of the CTGF promoter. To verify and extend previous results showing that this region of the CTGF promoter did not contain its TGFβ response element and to verify that Sp1 binding was not required for this response (22Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3008-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the 3′ Sp1 site was necessary for the TGFβ-mediated-induction of the CTGF promoter. To do this, we transfected the wild-type (wt CTGF), m3′Sp1, or m5′Sp1 mutant constructs into cell lines (Fig. 2C). After an 18-h incubation in serum-free media, cells were incubated for 24 h with or without 25 ng/ml TGFβ2. TGFβ significantly activated all the CTGF promoter/reporter constructs, indicating that Sp1 is not required for the TGFβ induction of the CTGF promoter. Sp1 Is Required for the Elevated Levels of CTGF Expression Observed in Scleroderma Fibroblasts—To assess the contribution of Sp1 to the elevated level of CTGF expression in SSc fibroblasts, we transfected these cells with the full-length, wild-type CTGF promoter/reporter construct or with an otherwise identical construct with a mutation in its functional 3′Sp1 binding site (Fig. 3). Mutation of the 3′Sp1 site resulted in a 50% decrease of basal CTGF promoter activity in SSc fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Similarly, incubation of cells with the Sp1-specific inhibitor mithramycin (26Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) reduced elevated CTGF promoter activity (Fig. 3) and protein expression (Fig. 4). Mithramycin also blocked the TGFβ-mediated induction of CTGF protein in normal fibroblasts, reflecting the fact that Sp1 is essential for basal CTGF promoter activity in fibroblasts. Collectively, our results suggest that the constitutive overexpression of CTGF in SSc fibroblasts was Sp1-dependent.Fig. 4Effect of mithramycin on CTGF expression in dermal fibroblasts. After culturing cells to 85% confluence, media were changed, and the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin (150 nm) was added for 24 h to normal dermal fibroblasts, in the presence or absence of TGFβ1 (2.5 ng/ml), and to fibroblasts cultured from dermal lesions of patients with diffuse scleroderma. Cell layers were then lysed and equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis with an anti-CTGF antibody. Addition of mithramycin blocks the basal CTGF expression in scleroderma fibroblasts. Blots were also probed with an anti-actin antibody to establish that lanes were equally loaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Elevated Levels of Sp1 Binding Exist in Nuclear Extracts from SSc Fibroblasts—We then assessed whether the requirement for Sp1 for the elevated levels of CTGF observed in SSc fibroblasts was mirrored by an elevated level of Sp1 binding to its binding site. We addressed this issue by evaluating the total level of cellular Sp1 capable of binding an Sp1 binding element. We compared nuclear protein from fibroblasts from four healthy subjects with fibroblasts with five subjects with SSc using two related methods. First, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures Sp1 binding to an Sp1 response element (Fig. 5A). Second, we used a direct gel-shift assay with the same Sp1 binding sequence as probe for consistency. According to either assay, subjects with SSc possessed significantly elevated levels of Sp1 binding relative to healthy subjects (Fig. 5B). As a control, we pooled our normal and SSc nuclear extracts and hybridized equal proteins amounts to a gel-shift microarray, which contained double-stranded oligomers bearing consensus DNA binding sites of known transcription factors. We found that, in contrast to our results examining Sp1 binding, nuclear extracts from normal and SSc fibroblasts contained equal amounts of binding to a consensus oligomer containing a binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (Fig. 5C). To assess whether phosphorylation of Sp1 played a role in the Sp1 binding in fibroblasts, we preincubated nuclear extracts from normal and SSc fibroblasts with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase before use in EMSAs. We found that removal of phosphates enhanced binding of Sp1 to DNA, suggesting that in fibroblasts, phosphorylation of Sp1 normally suppresses Sp1 binding to DNA (Fig. 5D). Thus, our results suggest that the elevated level of CTGF expression observed in SSc fibroblasts is dependent, at least in part, on an elevated level of Sp1 binding present in the nuclei of SSc fibroblasts and is relatively independent of sequences involved with the TGFβ induction of CTGF. These results are consistent with the notion that the fibrotic phenotype of the SSc fibroblasts is not caused solely by hyperactive or autocrine TGFβ signaling. Previously, we identified the CTGF promoter's TGFβ response element, which is both necessary and sufficient to confer TGFβ responsiveness to a heterologous promoter (22Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3008-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, this TGFβ response element is dispensable for the elevated, constitutive level of CTGF expression that is the hallmark of the fibrotic phenotype of the SSc fibroblast; removal of this element has no significant impact on the elevated level of CTGF promoter activity in SSc fibroblasts (22, current study). Here, we have found that Sp1 is involved in CTGF promoter activity. Targeting Sp1 markedly reduced CTGF expression in SSc fibroblasts. Furthermore, nuclear extracts from SSc fibroblasts possessed significantly elevated levels of Sp1 binding to DNA. These results suggest that targeting mechanisms involved with Sp1 or its activation may provide useful in developing antifibrotic therapies. Our results are intriguing in light of recent observations concerning the role of Sp1 in matrix gene regulation. Functional Sp1 binding motifs have been found in the minimal promoters of several collagen genes. For example, mithramycin inhibits collagen α1 type I protein expression in normal fibroblasts (28Nehls M.C. Brenner D.A. Gruss H.J. Dierbach H. Mertelsmann R. Herrmann F. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2916-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and Sp1 has been shown to activate expression of this gene's promoter (29Chen S.J. Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Gene. 1998; 215: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the collagen α2 type I promoter has shown that TGFβ activates its expression through a complex process involving SMAD3 and -4 and Sp1 (30Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 was shown to directly contribute to the expression of a wide variety of matrix genes (31Verrecchia F. Rossert J. Mauviel A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 755-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies examined the role of Sp1 and in the regulation of fibrogenic genes in a fibrotic setting. Intriguingly, Sp1 or its family members may contribute directly to the elevated level of expression of target genes in fibrosis. Intriguingly, increased phosphorylation of Sp1 has been shown to be a feature of scleroderma fibroblasts (32Ihn H. Tamaki K. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of the phosphorylated residues to Sp1 binding or the elevation of matrix gene expression in SSc fibroblasts is not clear. In this study, we found that phosphorylation of Sp1 had little effect on the ability of Sp1 to bind to its consensus binding element; addition of alkaline phosphatase to nuclear extracts before performing a gel shift with an oligomer bearing a consensus Sp1 element enhanced Sp1 binding to DNA. Our results are, in fact, consistent with data from other systems showing that Sp1 binding is repressed by phosphorylation and that removal of phosphate groups from Sp1 enhances binding to DNA (33Leggett R.W.

However, it is possible that phosphorylation of Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins could enhance the ability of Sp1 to form an active transcriptional complex with other nuclear factors. That said, our report is the first to directly assess the potential, functional contribution of Sp1 to the fibrotic phenotype of the SSc fibroblast. The elevated level of Sp1 binding observed in our studies could arise from an increased amounts of Sp1 protein in SSc nuclear extracts compared with extracts prepared from healthy subjects. However, when we directly addressed this issue by using Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts with an anti-Sp1 antibody, we could show no appreciable differences in Sp1 protein levels between nuclear extracts prepared from healthy subjects and those prepared from persons afflicted with SSc (data not shown). Sp1 is a member of the Kruppel-like family of proteins that effectively bind to a consensus Sp1 binding site (40Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urritia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the elevated Sp1 binding activity observed in SSc nuclear extracts could be caused by other members of the Kruppel-like Sp1 family and that these members show elevated expression in lesional diffuse SSc fibroblasts relative to normal fibroblasts. In fact, we have shown that other Kruppel-like family members are capable of activating the CTGF promoter (data not shown). The precise identity of the proteins binding to the Sp1 binding site in the CTGF promoter, and whether expression of these proteins is elevated in SSc, is currently under investigation. In conclusion, by investigating the constitutive CTGF expression from defined fibrotic settings, we have shown that the TGFβ response element in the CTGF promoter is dispensable for its constitutive up-regulation in SSc fibroblasts; rather, it seems to reflect an elevation of basal promoter activity as visualized by its dependence on Sp1. Sp1 generally acts with other transcription factors to potentiate transcription (for review, see Ref. 40Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urritia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), so it is likely that Sp1 acts with these factors to activate transcription of genes, such as CTGF, expressed in SSc fibroblasts. Identification of these additional factors is currently underway. That said, our results suggest that a simple model of autocrine TGFβ signaling seems to be insufficient to explain the fibrotic phenotype of the SSc fibroblast. For example, prolonged exposure of fibroblasts to TGFβ is insufficient to generate fibroblasts that constitutively overexpress collagen relative to their normal counterparts (8McWhirter A. Colosetti P. Rubin K. Miyazono K. Black C. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 885-894PubMed Google Scholar). Because CTGF has been reported to be an effective marker of fibrosis, and given the known profibrotic effects of this molecule and that small molecule inhibitors that suppress CTGF expression alleviate fibrotic effects in vivo and in vitro (41Stratton R.

https://openalex.org/W2066956736,"Homo- and hetero-oligomerization have been reported for several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The CXCR2 is a GPCR that is activated, among the others, by the chemokines CXCL8 (interleukin-8) and CXCL2 (growth-related gene product beta) to induce cell chemotaxis. We have investigated the oligomerization of CXCR2 receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and generated a series of truncated mutants to determine whether they could negatively regulate the wild-type (wt) receptor functions. CXCR2 receptor oligomerization was also studied by coimmunoprecipitation of green fluorescent protein- and V5-tagged CXCR2. Truncated CXCR2 receptors retained their ability to form oligomers only if the region between the amino acids Ala-106 and Lys-163 was present. In contrast, all of the deletion mutants analyzed were able to form heterodimers with the wt CXCR2 receptor, albeit with different efficiency, competing for wt/wt dimer formation. The truncated CXCR2 mutants were not functional and, when coexpressed with wt CXCR2, interfered with receptor functions, impairing cell signaling and chemotaxis. When CXCR2 was expressed with the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluR1, CXCR2 dimerization was again impaired in a dose-dependent way, and receptor functions were prejudiced. In contrast, CXCR1, a chemokine receptor that shares many similarities with CXCR2, did not dimerize alone or with CXCR2 and when coexpressed with CXCR2 did not impair receptor signaling and chemotaxis. The formation of CXCR2 dimers was also confirmed in cerebellar neuron cells. Taken together, we conclude from these studies that CXCR2 functions as a dimer and that truncated receptors negatively modulate receptor activities competing for the formation of wt/wt dimers."

Despite the fact that p53-dependent p21-mediated G1 arrest induced by DNA damage is well defined, the role of p53 in the cell cycle in response to the MAKP signaling remains to be determined. Here we show that MKP1, a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase family capable of inactivating MAPKs, is a transcriptional target of p53. MKP1 mRNA and protein levels were increased upon p53 activation in several well defined p53-regulated cell systems. p53 bound to a consensus p53 binding site located in the second intron of the MKP1 gene and transactivated MKP1 in reporter gene assays. Inhibition of phosphatase activity impaired p53-mediated G1 arrest in arrested human glioblastoma GM cells in response to growth factor stimuli. Importantly conditional expression of MKP1 prevented arrested human cancer cells from entering into the cell cycle. Thus, these results provide a novel mechanism by which p53 controls the cell cycle in response to the MAPK signaling in the absence of DNA damage and suggest that p53 may negatively control the MAKP pathway via MKP1.

The tumor suppressor p53 gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. The ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis plays a central role in its tumor suppression. In response to a variety of stimuli such as DNA damage, p53 becomes activated and, in turn, initiates its biological responses including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, senescence, differentiation, and antiangiogenesis through transcriptional activation of specific target genes that carry p53 DNA binding sites (1Ko L.J.

In addition, studies have demonstrated that p53 can transcriptionally activate Wip1, a phosphatase that negatively regulates the major growth signaling mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; Dex, dexamethasone; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; IAP1, inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; Dex, dexamethasone; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; IAP1, inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1. in response to UV radiation (28Fiscella M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6517-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether p53 can regulate the MAPK pathway in the absence of DNA damage. The MAP kinase signaling pathway mainly consists of three subfamilies: the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)), the p38 MAPK, and the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). Members of the ERK family are induced by either growth factors or stresses, resulting in diverse outcomes in cells. Induction of ERK by growth factors leads to cell proliferation and growth. Both JNK and p38, on the other hand, are induced by stresses that can lead to cell differentiation and cell death. In the presence of stimuli, these MAPKs are activated through the reversible phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues of the TXY motif in the catalytic domain by upstream dual specificity kinases called MAPK kinases including MKK1/2, MKK3/6, and MKK-4, p38 MAPK, and JNK/SAPK (30Kyriakis J.M.

Activation of MAP kinases triggers a signal cascade, leading to many changes including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The activities of MAPKs are negatively regulated by members of the MAPK phosphatases. The MAPK phosphatases are a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases, which can dephosphorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues, thus inactivating the activities of MAP kinases (33Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This family includes MKP1, MKP2, MKP3, MKP4, MKP5, VHR, Pac1, hVH2, hVH3, Pyst1, and Pyst2 (34Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). MKP1, also known as CL100, 3CH134, and Erp (hereafter referred to as MKP1) (35Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 36Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 37Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), was the first member of this family to be identified as a phosphatase. MKP1 was originally identified as an oxidative damage-induced gene and an ERK-specific phosphatase (36Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A.

It has now been shown that MKP1 can also inhibit JNK and p38 (39Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in cell cycle control. It has also been shown that overexpression of MKP1 inhibits UV- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis (42Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3014-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 43Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest a role of MKP1 in the cell cycle and chemosensitivity. In this study, we show that MKP1 is a transcriptional target of p53. Activation of p53 induces the expression of MKP1 transcript and protein in several well defined p53-regulated cell systems. Furthermore p53 transcriptionally regulates MKP1 via binding to a p53 binding site located in the second intron of this gene. Induction of MKP1 by p53 is independent of MAP kinases. Importantly we demonstrate that inhibition of phosphatase activity impairs p53-mediated G1 arrest in response to growth factor stimuli. Moreover we show that conditional expression of MKP1 blocks the entry of arrested cells into the cell cycle in response to mitogens. These results provide insights into the molecular basis of how p53 regulates the cell cycle in response to growth factor stimuli in the absence of DNA damage and suggest a novel mechanism by which p53 negatively controls the MAPK pathway.

These cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The Drosophila Mel-2 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine plus antibiotics at 25 °C. Plasmids—The expression vectors for wild-type p53 (pCMV-p53) and for mutant p53 (pCMV-p53mt135) were purchased from Clontech. pPac-p53wt and pPac-p53mt135 were generated by subcloning of p53wt and p53mt135 cDNA into pPac vector at the XhoI site (48Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol.

A 2.43-kb fragment that contains 780 bp of promoter and 1.65 Kb of intron 1 and 2 of the MKP1 gene was amplified from human placental DNA using a GC-rich PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and the following primers: MKP1-L5, 5′-CGACGCGTGGTGGGAGTTTGCTTGCTCAC-3′; MKP1-L3, 5′-GAAGATCTCCAGGCATCCATTCCATTTACC-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 10 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2.25 min; and then 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3.58 min followed by 68 °C for 7 min for the final extension. The amplified fragment was isolated from 1% agarose gel, digested with BglII and MluI, and subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) to generate the pGL3-B-MKP1-L reporter construct. The pGL3-B-MKP1-LA vector (pGL3-B-MKP1-LA that lacks a 579-bp fragment including intron 2 with a p53 DNA binding site), the pGL3-B-MKP1-LB vector (pGL3-MKP1-LB lacks both intron 1 and intron 2), and the pGL3-B-MKP1-LC vector (pGL3-B-MKP1-LC contains promoter only) were constructed by PCR amplification and subcloning as for pGL3-B-MKP1-L except the PCR primers. The PCR primer pairs used were as follows: 5′-CGACGCGTGGTGGGAGTTTGCTTGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTCTTCCCTGTGGCAGGGACACC-3′ for MKP1-LA; 5′-CGACGCGTGGTGGGAGTTTGCTTGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTAGGGGTACCGGGCAAAACCTC-3′ for MKP1-LB; and 5′-CGACGCGTGGTGGGAGTTTGCTTGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTGAGCCTGGCCCGGGGAGCGCG-3′ for MKP1-LC. These fragments contain the same 5′ end of the MKP1 promoter as in pGL3-B-MKP1-L (see Fig. 3B). All inserts of pGL3-B-MKP1-L, pGL3-B-MKP1-LA, pGL3-B-MKP1-LB, and pGL3-B-MKP1-L3 were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of H460 Cells Inducibly Expressing MKP1—To generate cell lines in which the human MKP1 gene is inducibly expressed, H460 cells were transfected with either pMEP4, an empty vector, or pMEP4-MKP1 using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (49Wu G.S. Ding Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks, and individual clones were isolated as described previously (46Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 623-633PubMed Google Scholar). Clones that expressed MKP1 protein determined by Western blot analysis, as described below, were used in this study. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was purified using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was separated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were hybridized with the random primed radiolabeled 503-bp fragment of the MKP1 cDNA, which was generated by PCR with primer pairs of 5′-GAGCACATCGTGCCCAACG-3′ and 5′-TGATGTCTGCCTTGTGGTTGTC-3′. PCR was performed by using Pfu (Stratagene) as an enzyme and the cDNA from GM cells infected with p53 adenovirus as a template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 64 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min with one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min for the final extension. Radioactive signals were analyzed by autoradiography. cDNA Microarray Screening and Data Analysis—Total RNA from GM cells treated with or without dexamethasone (Dex) (1 μm) for 10 h was purified. cRNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression technical manual followed by hybridizing to the Human Genome U95AV2 Array containing 12,625 genes. The hybridization and gene chip expression analysis was carried out at the Michigan Center for Genomic Technologies (MCGH) of Michigan Life Science Corridor at Wayne State University. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (49Wu G.S. Ding Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined using the Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (50 μg) were electrophoresed through 7.5–12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.) by electroblotting. The blots were probed or reprobed with the antibodies, and bound antibody was detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human MKP1 (c-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody Ab2 and the anti-human p21WAF1 monoclonal antibody Ab1 were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-actin antibody (AC-74) was purchased from Sigma. Cell Cycle Studies—Subconfluent cells were maintained in medium with 0.5% FBS for GM cells and 0.1% FBS for H460 cells to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. After 3 days, arrested GM cells were replaced with 10% FBS medium with or without dexamethasone (1 μm) in the absence or presence of vanadate (5 μm), while arrested H460 cells were cultured in medium with 10% FBS with or without CdSO4 (5 μm) for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and fixed with ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol for 24 h. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), and DNase-free RNase (1 μg/ml). The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Transfections for luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (50Wu G.S. Saftig P. Peters C. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In brief, SW480 cells were plated at 7.5 × 105/well in 6-well plates. The next day, the cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of reporter constructs (pGL3-B-MKP1-L, pGL3-B-MKP1-LA, or pGL3-Basic), 600 ng of pCMV-based plasmids (pCMV-V, pCMV-p53, or pCMV-p53mt135), and 30 ng of pRLSV40 (Promega) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were harvested 24 h later. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Turner TD20/20 luminometer and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. To transfect Drosophila Mel-2 cells, the cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the MKP1-luciferase reporter constructs and 500 ng of pPacp53wt or pPacp53mt135 using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested after 24 h for assaying luciferase activity using the Single Luciferase Assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to cellular protein, measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay system. The expression levels of p53 and p53mt135 in Drosophila Mel-2 cells were monitored by Western blotting. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Calu-6 cells infected with Adp53 as described previously (45Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald E.R. Meng R.D. Kao G. Muschel R. Yen T. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6411-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were harvested at 24 h after infection, and the nuclear extracts were prepared using a Nucbuster protein extraction kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides corresponding to a potential p53 binding site in intron 2 of the MKP1 gene were as follows: 5′-GCTGGTCCTGCCCAGGCAAATGGGCTTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAAGCCCATTTGCCTGGGCAGGACCAGC-3′. A mutant version of this site was obtained by replacing the conserved C and G with T (in lowercase) as follows: 5′-GCTGGTaCTaCCCAGGCAAATGGGCTTAG-3′. The consensus binding site for p53 (5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGG-3′) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The oligonucleotide pairs were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (50Wu G.S. Saftig P. Peters C. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (0.03 pmol) at 4 °C for 20 min in a volume of 20 μl of DNA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of cold probe competitors. The reaction mixtures were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For the supershift assays, 2 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Sciences) specific for p53 or p21 was preincubated with the nuclear extract prior to addition of the labeled probe and poly(dI-dC). Identification of Additional p53 Target Genes Involved in Cell Cycle Arrest in the Absence of DNA Damage—Despite a number of p53 targets being identified, the p53 signaling pathways are still not completely understood (23Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). We sought to identify additional transcriptional targets of p53 and characterize their roles in the p53 signaling pathways. We carried out a microarray screen to identify genes that are transcriptionally regulated by p53 in a well established GM cell system (44Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The human glioblastoma cell line GM contains an endogenous mutant p53 and an exogenous Dex-inducible wild-type p53 (44Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Upon addition of Dex to the medium, these cells induce the expression of p53, which, in turn, transcriptionally activates the expression of p21 (10El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculesue V.E. Levy D.B.

Muschel R. Yen T. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6411-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis on glass slides (Affymetrix), which contain 12,625 genes including expressed sequence tag sequences. RNA isolated from untreated cells was used as a control. The results were analyzed as described elsewhere (51Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Using 2-fold change as a cut-off, 76 genes were induced, and 240 genes were decreased when p53 was activated (data not shown).

We first PCR-amplified cDNA fragments including MKP1 (CL100), IAP-1, and ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4 from the same RNA used in the cDNA array screen with Taq DNA polymerase. Each cDNA fragment was verified by DNA sequencing and then used as a probe in Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the induction of MKP1 and IAP-1 in GM cells treated with Dex for 10 h when p53 is activated (Fig. 1, A and B), thus confirming the results obtained from microarray analysis. We also confirmed that ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4 was induced (Fig. 1C, ADR). As expected, p21 was up-regulated upon p53 activation; this served as a positive control (Fig. 1D). Induction of MKP1 in a p53-dependent Manner—We focused on MKP1 in this study for the following three reasons: 1) MKP1 was highly induced (about 47-fold induction) upon p53 activation (Table I); 2) MKP1 plays an important role in negatively regulating MAPK activity (33Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 34Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar); and 3) although it is believed that there is a functional link between the p53 pathway and the MAPK pathway, the mechanism underlying such a link has not been previously clearly demonstrated. Although Northern blot analysis demonstrated MKP1 induction by Dex in GM cells, it is possible that such induction may be due to Dex but not p53 as described recently (52Lasa M. Abraham S."

The plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase is an unusual target in that a unique phosphothreonine motif (946YpTV, where pT represents phosphothreonine) in the extreme C-terminal end of the H+-ATPase interacts with the binding cleft of 14-3-3 protein (Wurtele, M., Jelich-Ottmann, C., Wittinghofer, A., and Oecking, C. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 987-994). We report binding of 14-3-3 protein to a nonphosphorylated peptide representing the 34 C-terminal residues of the Arabidopsis plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2). Following site-directed mutagenesis within the 45 C-terminal residues of AHA2, we conclude that, in addition to the 946YpTV motif, a number of residues located further upstream are required for phosphorylation-independent binding of 14-3-3. Among these, Thr-924 is important for interaction with 14-3-3 protein even when Thr-947 is phosphorylated. We suggest that the role of phosphorylation, which is accentuated by fusicoccin, is to stabilize protein-protein interaction between 14-3-3 protein and several residues of the H+-ATPase C-terminal domain. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of well conserved proteins interacting with a large number of phosphorylated binding partners in eukaryotic cells.

Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Since this interaction often results in changed activity of the target protein, 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as important regulators of enzyme function (1van Hemert M.J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and signal transduction components such as protein kinases and protein phosphatases therefore become crucial for determining whether interaction between 14-3-3 protein and the target will occur in vivo (4Tzivion G.

Most secondary transporters in plant cells depend upon the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which is essential for generating the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane (for a review, see Ref. 14Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and it has therefore generated considerable interest that 14-3-3 proteins have appeared as positive regulators of this proton pump (15Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). No canonical 14-3-3 binding motifs are present in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, but deletion or substitution of the three C-terminal amino acid residues 946YTV from the H+-ATPase abolishes interaction with 14-3-3 protein (16Fuglsang A.T.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation at this position occurs e.g. in stomatal guard cells as a response to blue light exposure concomitant with activation of proton pumping by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (20Kinoshita T.

Fusicoccin (FC) 1The abbreviations used are: FC, fusicoccin; AHA2, A. thaliana H+-ATPase isoform 2; ExoS, exoenzyme S; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RU, resonance units. is a fungal toxin that activates the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in vivo (23Marrè E. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1979; 30: 273-288Crossref Google Scholar). FC binding requires the simultaneous presence of 14-3-3 and the C-terminal end of H+-ATPase (15Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T.

A plant 14-3-3 protein was recently co-crystallized with FC and a phosphorylated peptide (QSYpTV) representing the five C-terminal residues of a tobacco plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform (26Würtele M. Jelich-Ottmann C. Wittinghofer A. Oecking C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, FC fills a cavity in the phosphopeptide/14-3-3 interaction surface where FC and the phosphopeptide mutually increase the binding affinity of each other by almost 2 orders of magnitude. A peptide representing the last 16 amino acids of the C terminus of Arabidopsis thaliana H+-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) binds 14-3-3 protein, provided that Thr-947 is phosphorylated, whereas a nonphosphorylated peptide will not bind even in the presence of FC (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of any detectable phosphorylation, fusion proteins comprising the H+-ATPase C-terminal hydrophilic domain (∼100 residues) are able to bind 14-3-3 protein, provided that FC is present (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

This indicates that specific residues or secondary structures located further upstream in the C terminus of the H+-ATPase must be important for the nonphosphorylated, FC-induced binding of 14-3-3 to the target sequence. In this study, we show that several residues upstream of the 946YTV sequence of AHA2 stabilize phosphorylation-independent interaction between 14-3-3 protein and AHA2. Among these, Thr-924 is essential for both fusicoccin binding and activation of AHA2 even when Thr-947 is phosphorylated. Expression of AHA2 in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae—The yeast strain RS-72 was transformed and cultured essentially as described previously (29Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). In RS-72 (MATa ade1-100 his4-519 leu2-3,112), the natural constitutive promoter of the endogenous yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, PMA1, has been replaced by the galactose dependent promoter of GAL1. The cells were harvested, and plasma membranes were isolated as described (29Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G.

Glutathione S-transferase was fused to the AHA2 C-terminal amino acids Phe-860 to Val-948 of AHA2 by first amplifying DNA from the cloned AHA2 cDNA (31Palmgren M.G. Christensen G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-CCG GAA TTC GCT TTC ACG ATG AAG AAA GA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGC GAG CTC TAC TAC ACA GTG TAG TGA CTG-3′. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in the desired fusion between glutathione S-transferase and the C-terminal end of AHA2. Deletion mutants from the 5′ end of AHA2 were made after the same principle but using alternative forward primers. To amplify amino acids Arg-880 to Val-948 of AHA2, the forward primer 5′-CCG GAA TTC CAA AGG ACA CTT CAC GGT-3′ was employed. The segment encoding residues Ala-890 to Val-948 of AHA2 was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CCG GAA TTC GAA GCT GTT AAC ATC TTC-3′. The forward primers 5′-CCG GAA TTC AGT TAC AGA GAA TTG TCT-3′, 5′-CCG GAA TTC CAA GCT AAA AGA AGA GCT GAG-3′, 5′-CCG GAA TTC GCT GCT GAG ATG GCT-3′, 5′-CCG GAA TTC CTT AGG GAG CTG CAC AC-3′ were used to amplify AHA2 cDNA fragments encoding Tyr-900 to Val-948, Ala-910 to Val-948, Ala-914 to Val-948, and Leu-919 to Val-948, respectively. SDS-PAGE and 14-3-3 Protein Overlay Assay—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as described (12Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A. Bruntrup I.M. Collinge D.B. Volkmann D. Sommarin M. Palmgren M.G.

For detection of phosphothreonine residues, a specific antibody (71-8200; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was employed. For detection of plasma membrane H+-ATPase, an antibody directed against the N terminus of the AHA3 protein was used (32Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol.

Synthesis of Peptides—Peptides biotinylated at their N termini were synthesized and characterized by Thistle Research (Glasgow, Scotland, UK). The purity of the peptides was >95%. The sequences and the nomenclature of the peptides were as follows: TP9113, Biotin-amidocaproic-EIARELHTLKGHVESVVKLKGDIETPSHYpTV; TP9115, Biotin-amidocaproic-EIARELHTLKGHVESVVKLKGDIETPSHYTV. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—The BIAcore 3000 system from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden) was used. Biotinylated peptides (400 resonance units) were captured on an Biacore SA sensor chip precoated with streptavidin. The interaction was followed in real time at different 14-3-3 and FC concentrations as indicated at 25 °C. Premixed solutions of 14-3-3 protein and FC in running buffer (20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) were injected into the flow cell and passed over the peptide surfaces at a continuous flow rate of 10 μl/min to monitor association. Immediately after this injection, buffer without 14-3-3 protein but including FC was injected, followed by injection of running buffer without 14-3-3 as well as FC. Each association-dissociation cycle was followed by two 30-s injections with 10 mm NaOH to remove 14-3-3 protein bound to the immobilized peptides. After regeneration, a 30-min wait period was introduced before the next cycle of binding and regeneration. All sensorgrams were corrected for bulk refractive indexes by reference-subtracting with sensorgrams from a flow cell in which only streptavidin was immobilized. The data were evaluated using BIAevaluation 3.1 (Biacore AB). To obtain K D and R max values, a 1:1 Langmuir binding model was fitted to the sensorgrams. In experiments evaluating the effect of varied FC concentrations, the observed rate constants (k obs) were used to estimate association. ATPase Assays—ATP hydrolytic activity was measured essentially as described (29Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the assay medium (pH 7.0) included 5 μm FC and 2.5 μg of 14-3-3 protein and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 3-5 μg of yeast plasma membranes. The specific ATP hydrolytic activities of the nonactivated AHA2 plasma membrane H+-ATPase expressed in yeast were in the range of 1.2 ± 0.2 μmol of Pi released/mg of membrane protein/min. The basal activities of mutant enzymes were similar. In peptide experiments, the assay media (pH 6.5) contained 20 μm FC and 5 μg of 14-3-3 protein, and the peptides were preincubated in the assay buffer 30 min prior to the assay was started. Peptide assays were started by the addition of microsomes isolated from yeast expressing AHA2. [3H]FC Binding Assay—FC binding was measured to endoplasmic reticulum isolated from transformed yeast cells. Binding assay was performed in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg of GF14-14 14-3-3 protein. The assay was started by the addition of 25 μg of plasma membranes. After incubation at 25 °C for 3 h, the membranes was precipitated by centrifugation (10 min, 25 × g, 4 °C). The pellet was washed three times with buffer and afterward dissolved in 100 μl of 7% trichloroacetic acid. Radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. All samples ware made as triplicates. Nonspecific [3H]FC binding was monitored in parallel for each sample by the addition of an excess of unlabeled FC (10-4m). A Nonphosphorylated Peptide Corresponding to the C-terminal 34 Residues of AHA2 Inhibits Activation of AHA2 by 14-3-3 Protein—The binding site for 14-3-3 on plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase involves the phosphorylated tripeptide motif 946YTV in the C-terminal end (Fig. 1A) (16Fuglsang A.T.

Fusion proteins involving fragments of different lengths of the AHA2 C terminus, all including the 946YTV motif were expressed in E. coli and used for 14-3-3 overlay assays. Thereby, we could identify the minimal sequence necessary for phosphorylation independent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, namely 35 amino acids as seen in Fig. 2. Additional upstream residues seemed to stabilize the binding further as noted previously (28Jelich-Ottmann C. Weiler E.W. Oecking C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39852-39857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Fig. 2A fragment of 35 amino acid residues derived from the AHA2 C-terminal end is sufficient for phosphorylation-independent, FC-stabilized binding to 14-3-3. C-terminal fragments of AHA2 were expressed as N-terminally tagged glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli. Following expression in E. coli, total protein was extracted, run on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for the 14-3-3 protein overlay assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To learn more about the phosphorylation-independent interaction between AHA2 and 14-3-3 protein, we synthesized two longer peptides derived from the C terminus of AHA2 (Glu-915 to Val-948; 34 amino acids) and introduced threonine or phosphothreonine residues, respectively, at the penultimate positions (Fig. 1C). We subsequently tested the effect of the AHA2-derived peptides for their ability to inhibit activation of AHA H+-ATPase by 14-3-3 proteins. This was done in the presence of FC to promote the interaction between the binding partners. The addition of 14-3-3 protein increased ATP hydrolytic activity of full-length AHA2 about 3-fold (pH 7.0). As seen in Fig. 3, the phosphorylated peptides (Ct16-P and Ct34-P) inhibited the 14-3-3 protein induced activation with comparable potency and at low concentrations (K i ≈ 0.1 μm) without affecting basal ATPase activity. The long nonphosphorylated peptide (Ct34) similarly inhibited the 14-3-3 protein-induced increase in activity, but significantly higher concentrations of peptide were required to observe this effect (K i = 3 μm). The shorter nonphosphorylated peptide (Ct16) had no effect even at the highest concentration tested (30 μm). This indicated that, in contrast to the shorter peptide (Ct16), the long nonphosphorylated peptide (Ct34) interacts directly with 14-3-3 protein in the presence of FC. This further reinforces the notion that residues upstream of Val-933 in AHA2 are able to promote a phosphorylation-independent interaction with 14-3-3 protein. Interaction between 14-3-3 Protein and Peptides Corresponding to the C-terminal End of AHA2 Detected by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—We next employed the synthetic peptides for protein-protein interaction studies using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Table I). By employing this technique, it has previously been shown that an nonphosphorylated peptide representing the 16 C-terminal amino acid residues of AHA2 does not bind 14-3-3 protein irrespective of the presence of FC (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Table I). The two longer peptides of 34 residues (Ct34 and Ct34-P) were immobilized to biosensor chips, and 14-3-3 protein (100 nm) and FC (varying concentrations) were injected into the flow system (Fig. 4). This allowed for detection of association between peptides and 14-3-3 protein. Next, 14-3-3 protein was omitted from the flow buffer, whereas FC was kept constant to follow dissociation of already bound 14-3-3 protein. Finally, only buffer was injected into the flow system to measure dissociation of 14-3-3 protein in the absence of FC. Under these conditions, the immobilized peptides did not bind bovine serum albumin control protein, and an unrelated immobilized control peptide representing the N terminus of pig kidney α1 Na,K-ATPase did not bind 14-3-3 protein (data not shown).Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants of 14-3-3 protein binding to synthetic peptides based on the C-terminal sequence of AHA2PeptideaSequences of peptides are given in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Indeed, both the nonphosphorylated and the phosphorylated peptides bound 14-3-3 protein in this system, although the phosphorylated peptide Ct34-P exhibited the highest affinity for 14-3-3 protein (Table I). However, it was also evident that 14-3-3 protein had an approximately 10 times higher maximum binding response (R max) for phosphorylated than for nonphosphorylated peptide (Table I). Equal amounts of peptide had been immobilized on the biosensor chips, and mass spectrometry analysis verified that the compositions of the peptides were as expected (data not shown). Thus, it remains a possibility that the nonphosphorylated peptide exists in more than one conformation and that only one of these conformations is capable of interacting with 14-3-3 protein. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were determined from steady-state binding values predicted from fits to the data in Fig. 4. Comparison of K D values of 14-3-3 in complex with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides demonstrated that phosphorylation increased the affinity for 14-3-3 protein severalfold (Table I). The addition of FC increased the maximal binding of 14-3-3 to both peptides significantly (Fig. 4). This implies that a preformed complex between 14-3-3 protein and AHA2 forms the basis for FC-dependent high affinity complexes irrespective of whether they are phosphorylated or not. For both peptides, values for K D and R max were also determined in the presence of 5 μm FC. FC at this concentration decreased K D ∼4-fold for the phosphorylated peptide and 3-4-fold for the nonphosphorylated peptide, whereas R max was not changed significantly by FC (Table I). Taken together, these data support the notion that there is a region of interaction between AHA2 and 14-3-3 protein in the stretch of amino acids of the longer peptides (Ct34) not represented in the shorter peptides (Ct16), namely between Glu-915 and Val-933. Kinetics of Interaction between 14-3-3 Protein and Peptides Corresponding to the C-terminal End of AHA2—The observed rate constants (k obs) measured in the Biacore system relate to the association rate constant (k a) as follows: k obs = k a j C + k d. By rearrangement and approximation, this gives k a ≈ k obs/C, when k d ≪ k obs. Since k d values in the experiments reported here were at least 1 order of magnitude lower than the corresponding k obs values, it is reasonable to take k obs as an approximate measure for k a. It is notable that for the phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4C), the observed rate constants (k obs) are decreasing with increasing FC concentrations. This implies that the build-up of the 14-3-3·ATPase complex is slowed by FC. The effect of FC on the dissociation rate constant (k d) is, however, much more pronounced than its effect on the association process (Fig. 4D). For the phosphorylated peptide Ct34-P, the concentration of FC needed to decrease k d to 50% was found to be 120 nm, about 1 order of magnitude lower than the concentration required to reduce the apparent association rate to 50% of maximal reduction. Thus, the overall effect is an efficient stabilization of the complex. When changing the flow to buffer only, dissociation increased, indicating that FC is reversibly bound in the 14-3-3·phosphopeptide complex (Fig. 4, A and B). For the nonphosphorylated peptide (Ct34), FC likewise reduced the apparent dissociation rate (Fig. 5B), where the effect on the dissociation rate constant was much less pronounced (Fig. 5C). However, it is clear from Fig. 5A that the dissociation of 14-3-3 protein from immobilized peptide is increased when FC is omitted from the injection buffer. Thus, FC acts similarly to stabilize the complex between 14-3-3 protein and nonphosphorylated peptide. Growth of Yeast Expressing AHA2 Mutants—Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was next employed to identify residues in the C-terminal end of the Arabidopsis plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 that affect the strength of the interaction between 14-3-3 protein and H+-ATPase. A convenient screening system was employed in which growth of transformed yeast cells is dependent on the activity status of heterologously expressed plant H+-ATPase. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, PMA1 is an essential gene, encoding a P-type plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Following expression in yeast, full-length AHA2 H+-ATPase promotes slow growth in the absence of the en"

Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The jmj mutant embryos showed heart malformations including ventricular septal defect, noncompaction of the ventricular wall, double outlet right ventricle, and dilated atria. All homozygous jmj mutants died soon after birth. Cardiac marker analysis by in situ hybridization suggested that cardiomyocytes were differentiated but developmental regulation of chamber-specific genes was defective in late stage embryos. The jmj gene was first identified and described as a developmentally important gene in the nervous system and subsequently in liver, spleen, and thymus development (2Takeuchi T. Yamazaki Y.

Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). During mouse embryonic development, JMJ is widely expressed, including in the developing heart. In adult mice, it is expressed at a higher level in heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and thymus (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Continuous expression of jmj in the heart suggests that JMJ plays an important role in both the developing and adult heart. Although JMJ may be involved in cell growth when JMJ is overexpressed (4Toyoda M. Kojima M. Takeuchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the molecular function of JMJ remains unknown. The deduced amino acid sequence of JMJ reveals a putative DNA binding domain (DBD) homologous to the DBD of a DNA-binding protein family, AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) (5Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that JMJ is a transcription factor. However, the homology of this domain with the DBDs of other ARID family members is low, with only about 30% amino acid identity in the putative DBD. There is an increasing number of factors that belong to an ARID family, which show diverse functions in vertebrates, plants, and fungi (6Balciunas D. Ronne H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 274-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cardiac development is a complex biological process requiring the integration of cell specification, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Many factors have been implicated in this process on the basis of their spatial and temporal expression patterns or their phenotypic effects when they are functionally inactivated in flies or mice (for reviews, see Refs. 7Cripps R.M. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 2002; 246: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 8Zaffran S. Frasch M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Lyons G.E. Curr.

Identification of molecular pathways involved in normal heart development led to the discovery of the genetic basis for human congenital heart disease. For example, congenital heart disease characterized by septal defects and abnormal atrioventricular conduction is caused by mutations in the transcription factor Nkx2.5 (20Schott J.J. Benson D.W.

Another group of human cardiac defects referred to as CATCH-22 (cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia, associated with chromosome 22 microdeletion) may be caused by mutation in a downstream gene of dHAND (21Yamagishi H.

Therefore, it is critical to characterize the molecular function of JMJ. We have used in vitro mutagenesis to functionally characterize the JMJ protein and to better understand the structural/functional relationship of JMJ. The present study indicates that JMJ is a DNA-binding nuclear factor that contains a strong transcriptional repressor domain. JMJ may regulate the expression of cardiac genes, and therefore this study will form a basis to further identify molecular mechanism of cardiac development. Plasmid Construction—Cloning of the cDNA encoding jmj was previously described (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the GAL4 DBD-JMJ chimera, the wild type and various deletion mutants were constructed as follows. The various regions of JMJ were PCR-amplified with primers containing appropriate restriction digestion sites. The PCR products were digested and subcloned in frame to the GAL4 DBD in the pcDNA3 vector (24Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and also subcloned in frame to an Xpress tag in pcDNA3.1/HisB (Invitrogen). The reporter gene consisting of 5× GAL4 binding site upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter TATA box linked to luciferase (pG5Ti-Luc, obtained from Dr. P. Farnham) (24Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) exhibited low basal activity. We constructed the reporter gene by subcloning 5× GAL4 binding sites into the pGL3 vector (Promega) that consisted of the SV40 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene, 5×G-pGL3. This reporter gene exhibited high basal reporter gene activity, which is suitable to study transcriptional repression activity. The reporter genes containing selected oligonucleotides by CASTing were constructed by subcloning the high affinity binding site of JMJ upstream of the SV40 promoter linked to luciferase in pGL3. All new constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Preparation of the JMJ Fusion Protein and Anti-JMJ Antibody—The bacterially produced JMJ fusion protein was prepared for a gel mobility shift assay (GMSA), cyclic amplification and selection of target (CASTing), and production of antibodies. The regions containing a putative DNA-binding domain of JMJ (amino acids (aa) 529-798 and 529-1198) or N-terminal part (aa 1-517) were PCR-amplified using primers with appropriate linkers and were ligated in frame to the vector containing a cDNA for glutathione S-transferase (GST) (pGEX-2T; Amersham Biosciences). The GST-JMJ fusion proteins were prepared using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as described previously (25Lee Y. Mahdavi V. J. Biol.

To generate anti-JMJ antibody against the JMJ fusion protein, GST-JMJ 529-798 was loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and a protein band visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue was used to inoculate a rabbit (service provided by Covance). The anti-JMJ antibodies were characterized by immunostaining, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis as described previously (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, for immunoprecipitation, in vitro translated and 35S-labeled JMJ (TNT kit; Promega) was incubated with anti-JMJ antibody in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. The precipitate was washed and loaded onto SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. For Western blot analysis, COS cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding JMJ. Whole cell lysate was prepared as described elsewhere (4Toyoda M. Kojima M. Takeuchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. Cell extracts were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-JMJ antibody (1000-fold dilution), and the protein band was detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). GMSA—To examine whether JMJ binds to DNA in vitro, GMSAs were performed as described previously (25Lee Y. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified GST-JMJ protein eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) for 10 min on ice. After 10 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (about 30,000 cpm/lane) were added for 20 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run in 1× protein buffer (25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine) at 200 V for 2 h and autoradiographed. The Tx2 oligonucleotide sequence, a duplicated binding site of the Bright protein (28Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), is 5′-GC(GTTAAATCACAATAAAATATTG)2. The NP3 oligonucleotide, a trimer of the consensus Engrailed binding sequence that is also a binding site of the dri gene product (5Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), is 5′-GC(TCAATTAAATGA)3. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed, followed by 32P-end-labeling by T4 kinase. CASTing—To select the consensus DNA-binding motif of JMJ in vitro, CASTing was performed as described previously (29Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 30Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The GST-JMJ aa 529-798 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-coated agarose beads was prepared. The random sequence library was prepared by synthesizing oligonucleotide pools comprising a random 30-bp sequence flanked by 18 bases of nonrandom sequence 5′-GCGAAGCTTTGACTGAGGN30TTGATGCCGAGGATCCCG-3′ (Biotechnology Center at the University Of Wisconsin). BamHI and HindIII sites are underlined. The PCR primers annealing to the 18 bases of each top and bottom strand were synthesized. The 3′ primer was used for a primer extension reaction to make double-stranded oligonucleotides, which was purified by PAGE. The selection procedure was initiated by mixing 10 μg of the purified double-stranded random oligonucleotides with 50 ng of GST-JMJ coupled to glutathione-agarose beads in buffer A (0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A, resuspended in 95 μl of PCR buffer, boiled for 3 min, and centrifuged. 90 μl of this supernatant was used as template for a 100-μl PCR. The product after 10, 15, and 20 PCR cycles was examined by running 6.0 μl of the PCR on an agarose gel. Then the PCR fraction that was barely visible on the agarose gel was used for the second round of selection. The second generation began when 20 μl of the above PCR was mixed with the GST-JMJ fusion protein exactly as in the first generation. This step was repeated seven times. After the last PCR amplification step, a fraction of the PCR product was cut with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced (Biotechnology Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Binding to JMJ was confirmed by GMSA as described above. Site Selection and Amplification Binding (SAAB)—To identify the DNA-binding consensus sequences, the SAAB method was also carried out as described previously (31Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 32Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11635-11642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1 μg of GST-JMJ eluted from the beads was incubated with 1.6 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled random double-stranded probe. This probe was generated by PCR using the primer sets as described above. The mixture was electrophoresed on native polyacrylamide gels. After the shifted band was excised, the DNA was eluted from the gel into 0.5 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS for 5 h at 37 °C. The recovered DNA was amplified by 15 cycles of PCR with the 5′ and 3′ primers that were used in the CASTing experiments. The selection procedure was repeated for four rounds. After the last round of SAAB, PCR-amplified products were directly subcloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega) and sequenced. These oligonucleotides were then subjected to GMSA to confirm their binding to JMJ, followed by the reporter gene assays as described above. Transfection Assay and Immunostaining—Transient transfection assays were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (27Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Mouse fibroblast 10T1/2 cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with 1-2 μg of reporter gene and various amounts of JMJ in mammalian expression vectors and 1 μg of CMV-βgal. Two days after glycerol shock, cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega) using a luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Indirect immunostaining experiments were performed as described (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). COS cells transfected with JMJ mutants were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and incubated with the indicated antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a confocal laser microscope. JMJ Represses the GAL4 Reporter Gene—Although JMJ has been previously identified as a nuclear factor that is developmentally important (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Takeuchi T. Yamazaki Y. Katoh-Fukui Y. Tsuchiya R. Kondo S. Motoyama J. Higashinakagawa T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the molecular function of JMJ remains largely unknown. The deduced amino acid sequence of jmj revealed a homologous region to the DBD of an ARID factor family. In addition, the jmj homozygous mutant embryos showed defective regulation of heart-specific gene expression (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that JMJ is a transcriptional regulator. To investigate whether JMJ functions as a transcriptional regulator, transient transfection assays were performed using a reporter gene containing five tandem copies of the GAL4-DNA binding sites linked to the heterologous SV40 promoter upstream of luciferase in the pGL3 vector (5×G-pGL3). The reporter gene was cotransfected into 10T1/2 cells with the expression plasmid encoding the GAL4-DNA binding domain fused to the full-length JMJ consisting of 1234 amino acids (G-J1-1234). The reporter gene will be activated or repressed if JMJ contains a transactivation or repressor domain, respectively. Interestingly, G-J1-1234 markedly repressed the reporter gene activity up to 80% in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1), indicating that JMJ contains the repressor domain. The N terminus of JMJ consisting of aa 1-528 (G-J1-528) repressed the reporter gene as efficiently as the full-length JMJ in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the C terminus containing JMJ chimera (G-J529-1234) neither repressed nor activated the reporter gene, suggesting the N terminus contains a repressor domain. This repression is specific to JMJ, because GAL4-DBD alone did not have any effect on the reporter gene activity. In addition, the positive control plasmid, GAL4-DBD, fused to a VP16 activation domain (G-VP16), activated the reporter gene about 1000-fold as compared with the reporter gene alone. Cotransfection assays using the reporter gene containing a different promoter, pG5Ti-Luc, 5× GAL4-DNA binding site linked to the adenovirus major late promoter, yielded the same results as that of 5×G-pGL3 (data not shown), confirming that repression by JMJ is not dependent on the promoter. Determination of a Transcriptional Repression Domain in JMJ—Since the JMJ N terminus (aa 1-528) mediated repression of the target gene expression, serial deletion mutants were examined for their transcriptional activities to map the repressor domain (Fig. 2) in association with their intracellular location (Fig. 3, A and B). Both G-J1-377 and G-J1-222 markedly repressed the reporter gene as efficiently as the full-length chimera G-J1-1234. In contrast, G-J1-130 completely lost repressor activity, indicating that the repressor domain is located between aa 131 and 222. When this repressor domain was deleted from the full-length JMJ, this mutant (G-J1-130/225-1234) lost most of its repression function, exhibiting about 80% activity as compared with the reporter gene alone. These results indicated that the region between aa 131-222 is necessary. This region between aa 131 and 222, together with the nuclear localization domain (aa 1-130; see Fig. 3A), is sufficient to mediate major transcriptional repressor activity as indicated by maximum repression by G-J1-222. Therefore, this region (aa 131-222) was designated as a transcriptional repressor domain. All of these N terminus-containing chimeras were localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3JMJ contains the nuclear localization signal. A, the immunostaining experiments with JMJ antibody. COS cells were transfected with various JMJ mutants in pcDNA3.1/HisB (a-f) or G-JMJ chimeras (g-i). Fixed cells were incubated with anti-JMJ antibodies or anti-Xpress antibodies followed by anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red, respectively. Subcellular localization of JMJ mutants was examined under epifluorescence or confocal laser microscope. B, the same field of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, which stains the nuclei. C, characterization of the anti-JMJ antibody. Polyclonal antibody against GST-JMJ fusion protein was raised in rabbit and characterized by immunoprecipitation (lanes 1-4) and Western blot analysis (lanes 5 and 6). For immunoprecipitation, control reticulocyte lysate and in vitro translated and 35S-labeled JMJ and (2 μl each) were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). JMJ (5 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate) was incubated with the anti-JMJ antibody raised against GST-JMJ fusion protein or preimmune serum (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The binding complex was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. For Western blot analysis, whole COS cell extracts (50 μg/lane) either overexpressing the full-length JMJ 1-1234 (lane 2), or control extract (lane 1), were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-JMJ antibody (1000-fold dilution), and the protein was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) None of the C terminus-containing JMJ chimeras, G-J529-1234 (Fig. 2), G-J529-806, and G-J807-1234 (data not shown), significantly repressed the reporter gene activity. However, these C-terminus-containing G-JMJ chimeras were not localized in the nucleus but rather in the cytoplasm, as visualized with immunostaining experiments (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the lack of transcriptional activity of these C-terminus-containing mutants could be attributed to their inability to localize in the nucleus. To determine whether there is an effector domain in this C terminus, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain (aa 1-130; see below) was fused to the C terminus. This NLS domain alone does not have any transcriptional regulatory activity, as indicated by lack of transcriptional activity of G-J1-130 (Fig. 2). These mutants, G-J1-130/529-1234 and G-J1-130/529-792, localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3A) but showed very weak repression if any (Fig. 2). These data indicate that a strong transcriptional repressor domain is located between aa 131 and 222, and perhaps a weak repressor domain exists between aa 529 and 798. The repressor domain deletion mutant G-J1-130/225-1234 was located in the nucleus but lost most of its repressor activity (Fig. 2). These data confirm that the strong repressor domain is situated between aa 131 and 222. Identification of a Nuclear Localization Signal in JMJ—Transcription factors should enter the nucleus where they regulate transcription of target genes. Many nuclear factors are actively transported into the nucleus, which requires an NLS (33Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 341-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the NLS is deleted or blocked by steric hindrance, nuclear proteins will either accumulate in the cytoplasm or be rapidly degraded. Therefore, it is critical to examine intracellular location of various mutants. JMJ contains several putative NLS similar to that of the SV40 T-antigen at aa 104-110, 147-154, and 433-438. To examine intracellular location of various JMJ mutants, immunostaining experiments were performed on COS cells transfected with JMJ mutants in the mammalian expression vectors (Fig. 3, A and B). Depending on which mutant was used, fixed cells were incubated with either anti-JMJ polyclonal antibody or anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen). The JMJ antibodies raised against the peptide were described elsewhere (Fig. 3C) (1Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ.

The 1.7-kilobase 5′-upstream DNA sequence of the human IA-1 gene directed transgene expression predominantly in the developing nervous system including forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, spinal cord, retina, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum, which recapitulated the expression patterns of neuroendocrine tissues and childhood brain tumors. The IA-1 promoter deletion reporter gene constructs revealed that the sequence between -426 and -65 bp containing three putative E-boxes (∼361 bp) upstream of the transcription start site was sufficient to confer tissue-specific transcriptional activity. Further mutation analysis revealed that the proximal E-box (E3) closest to the start site is critical to confer transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transient transfection studies demonstrated that the NeuroD1 and E47 heterodimer are the key transcription factors that regulate the proximal E-box of the IA-1 promoter. Therefore, we concluded that the IA-1 gene is developmentally expressed in the nervous system and the NeuroD1/E47 transcription factors up-regulate IA-1 gene expression through the proximal E-box element of the IA-1 promoter.

The bHLH proteins are classified into two separate groups based on their DNA binding properties and tissue distribution. In general, the class A members are ubiquitous factors including E47 and E12.

However, the class B proteins can dimerize with the class A proteins as heterodimers and bind to DNA with high affinity and confer tissue-specific expression (8Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Gene targeting experiments revealed that deletion of the NeuroD1 gene resulted in defective pancreatic morphogenesis and abnormal enteroendocrine differentiation, which led to the early development of diabetes (14Naya F.J.

Previously, we have identified NeuroD1 as a potential target gene of a novel transcriptional repressor, insulinoma-associated antigen-1 (IA-1) (20Breslin M.B. Zhu M. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study, we show evidence that NeuroD1 also regulates IA-1 gene expression.IA-1 encodes a novel zinc finger DNA-binding protein that was isolated from a human insulinoma subtraction library (21Goto Y. DeSilva M.G. Toscani A. Prabhakar B.S. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15252-15257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro induction of the AR42J amphicrine cell line into insulin-producing cells suggested that IA-1 gene expression is closely associated with the expression of islet-specific transcription factors including NeuroD1 (22Zhu M. Breslin M.B. Lan M.S. Pancreas. 2002; 24: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Functional studies revealed that IA-1 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to a specific DNA element and can autoregulate itself and the NeuroD1 gene (20Breslin M.B. Zhu M. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The IA-1 gene has a very restricted expression pattern to tumors of neuroendocrine origin (21Goto Y. DeSilva M.G. Toscani A. Prabhakar B.S. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15252-15257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lan M.S. Russell E.K. Lu J. Johnson B.E. Notkins A.L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4169-4171PubMed Google Scholar), including insulinoma, medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pituitary tumor, pheochromacytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and small cell lung carcinoma. This pattern of expression largely overlaps the expression pattern observed for NeuroD1 (24Rostomily R.C. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Berger M.S. Tapscott S.J. Reh T.A. Olson J.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3526-3531PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the IA-1 gene in neuroendocrine tissues. In this study, we have analyzed the IA-1 promoter activity in vivo by introducing an IA-1 promoter-LacZ transgene and monitoring the expression of LacZ activity in the transgenic mice. In addition to the restricted expression pattern of the IA-1 gene, we have identified both the E-box element and the E47-NeuroD1 transcription factors that contribute to the tissue restricted expression of the IA-1 gene. Since IA-1 possesses transcriptional repressor activity against the NeuroD1 gene and their expression patterns largely overlap in the neuroendocrine cells, it suggests that the NeuroD1 and the IA-1 gene may counterregulate their expression levels during nervous system development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Transfection—HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), WERI-Rb1 and Y79 (human retinoblastomas), Daoy (human medulloblastoma), U87MG (human glioblastoma), and βTC-1, (mouse insulinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with either high or low glucose supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours prior to the transfection, the adherent cell lines were seeded at a density of 0.25-0.3 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well culture dish. Alternatively, the suspension cell lines were collected by centrifugation on the day of transfection and seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. A 1:1 ratio of 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) to 5 μg of DNA was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA complex was added per well in the absence of serum for 5 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh fetal bovine serum containing medium for a total of 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected, lysed in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer by repeated freeze-thaw, and assayed for CAT (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Promega) activity or the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Construction of the IA-1 Promoter-LacZ Reporter Transgene and the Generation of Transgenic Mice—The 5′-flanking region (-1661 to +40 bp) of the human IA-1 gene was subcloned from two human genomic clones, pL3S2.0 and pL3S0.8 (25Lan M.S. Li Q. Lu J. Modi W.S. Notkins A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14170-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.7-kb fragment was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) containing the 3.7-kb Escherichia coli LacZ gene with a SV40 poly(A)+ tail. The transgene fragment (5.4 kb) was excised from the parental plasmid by digestion with XhoI and BamHI. The fragment was purified and contracted with the NICHD Transgenic Mouse Development Facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham for transgenic mouse production. Founder mice were identified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA prepared from tails. Forward primer pIA-1 (5′-AAGCGGGAGGCGAGAACAAT-3′) and reverse primer β-gal/fusion (5′-TTCGCTATTACGCCAGCTGG-3′) yielded a PCR product of 501 bp overlapping IA-1 promoter and β-gal sequences using a touch-down PCR condition. The PCR cycles are as follows: in the first step, 94 °C for 45 s, 68 °C (each cycle decrease 0.5 °C) for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 19 cycles; in the subsequent step, 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 19 cycles; last, extension for 10 min in 72 °C.Southern Blot Analysis of Copy Numbers from Transgenic Genomic DNA—To measure the copy number of transgene in three lines of transgenic mice, we performed a Southern blot analysis using known concentrations of the transgene as control. Fifteen micrograms of normal mouse or transgenic mouse tail genomic DNA were digested with BamHI and XhoI and then separated on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis overnight. After denaturation and neutralization, the gel was transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for Southern blot. The IA-1p-LacZ transgene was radiolabeled using a random prime labeling kit (Invitrogen). The hybridization procedure was followed as previously described (25Lan M.S. Li Q. Lu J. Modi W.S. Notkins A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14170-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The copy number of the transgene was estimated by quantification of band intensity using a Bio-Rad image analysis system.Whole Mount Histochemical Detection of β-Galactosidase Activity—For timed pregnancy and embryo staging, the morning of vaginal plug observations were considered as e0.5 embryo, and tissues were dissected at the designated ages, fixed in solution containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1.5% formaldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, for 30 min to 2 h at room temperature depending upon the embryo size. The embryo and tissue were washed three times with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. β-Galactosidase activity was developed in staining solution consisting of 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature for up to 48 h. Whole mount stained embryo was photographed through a dissecting microscope. X-gal-stained embryos or tissues were further fixed in 10% buffered formalin for storage or subjected to paraffin embedding.DNA Constructs—The various IA-1 promoter CAT constructs were created by subcloning the human IA-1-1661/+40 bp promoter fragment into the XhoI site of the pCAT3 basic vector (Promega). The -426/+40 bp construct was created by NheI digestion of the -1661/+40 bp IA-1p/CAT3 construct followed by religation to eliminate the -1661 to -427 bp region. The -65/+40 bp construct was created by subcloning into the SacI/SmaI site in the pCAT3 basic vector. The E47 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. R. Stein (Vanderbilt University). The pCR3.1β2 construct was kindly provided by Dr. M. J. Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine). The E-box deletion constructs were created by using the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter/CAT3 plasmid as a template. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to bind to complementary strands of the IA-1 promoter spanning the individual E-box elements (ΔE1 -361 to -356 bp, ΔE2 -315 to -310 bp, ΔE3 -182 to -177 bp) to delete the 6-bp binding site. The synthetic oligonucleotides used were ΔE1 (-361 to -356 bp; 5′-ATTCTCGCGCTGATGGACGGGCCGCGGCTCCGCGCCCCCCGGAGGAGA-3′), ΔE2 (-315 to -310 bp; 5′-GACACAAAGCCCAGGCGCCTCCCCATAGAG-3′), ΔE3 (-182 to -177 bp; 5′-CCGCGCCCTCAGGTACCGCACCTACCGGGC-3′), and the complementary strand primers, respectively. PCR conditions were performed using 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 125 ng of each primer, 20 ng of double-stranded DNA, and 2 units of Pfuturbo DNA polymerase in a 50-μl reaction. PCR was performed using an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s (E-box 2 and 3) or 63 °C (E-box 1), and extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR products (10-μl aliquot) were visualized on a 1% agarose gel, and the remainder of the reaction mixture was digested with DpnI restriction endonuclease for 1 h at 37 °C. Following digestion with DpnI, 5 μl of the mutagenesis reaction was transformed into XL-1 Blue competent cells. Mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis (U.S. Biochemical Corp.).The 3× E-box constructs were created using synthetic oligonucleotides containing three tandem copies of the individual E-box elements: E-box 1 oligonucleotide (5′-CCCATTTGGCCCATTTGGCCCATTTGGA-3′), E-box 2 oligonucleotide (5′-GGCACGTGCGGCACGTGCGGCACGTGCGA-3′, and E-box 3 oligonucleotide (5′-TACATCTGCCTACATCTGCCTACATCTGCCA-3′) and their complementary strand oligonucleotides. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing equal molar amounts of oligonucleotides and heating at 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooled at 1 °C/min to room temperature. The oligonucleotides were synthesized with an A overhang to allow for cloning into the TA TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The 3× E-box constructs were sequenced to determine orientation and then subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI site or HindIII/XbaI cloning site of the E1bTATACAT vector.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA analysis was performed using a double strand oligonucleotide spanning the -192 to -165 bp region of the IA-1 promoter (containing E-box 3), 5′-CCCTCAGGTACATCTGCCGCACCTACCG-3′, and the complementary strand. The double strand oligonucleotide was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). E47 and NeuroD1 proteins were synthesized using the expression plasmids pCR3.1β2 and pcDNA3E47 and the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). Synthesis of E47 and NeuroD1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-E47 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or an anti-NeuroD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (CeMines). The EMSA binding reaction included various amounts of in vitro translated proteins in a binding reaction composed of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 ng of poly(dI·dC), and 5 × 104 cpm of probe. For supershift assay, 1 μl of a 1:5 dilution of E47 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a 1:2.5 dilution of NeuroD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (CeMines) was added to the mixture following a 10-min preincubation at room temperature with in vitro translated protein and probe. The whole mixture was then incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% PAGE (40:1) gel in 0.25× TBE buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from Daoy, D283MED, U87MG, WERI-Rb1, Y79, and βTC-1 cell lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS running buffer. Northern blot analysis was carried out as previously described (21Goto Y. DeSilva M.G. Toscani A. Prabhakar B.S. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15252-15257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length human IA-1 cDNA (2.8 kb of EcoRI fragment), a partial mouse IA-1 cDNA fragment (1.3 kb), and full-length hamster β2 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Ming Tsai; Baylor College of Medicine) probes were random prime-labeled (Invitrogen) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 1 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled probe was added to the hybridization mixture. Following an overnight incubation at 55 °C, the blots were washed three times for 15 min at 55 °C in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and exposed to autoradiography at -70 °C for 2 days. A photograph of the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel prior to transfer is shown for a lane to lane loading comparison.RESULTSGeneration of IA-1p-LacZ Transgenic Mice—Previous analysis of a -2090/+169 bp fragment of the IA-1 5′-flanking sequence demonstrated that the promoter was active in AtT-20 cells and not detectable in HeLa cells, consistent with the IA-1 tissue-restricted mRNA expression pattern (26Li Q. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the IA-1 promoter activity in vivo, we subcloned a 1.7-kb 5′-upstream sequence of the IA-1 gene in front of a LacZ reporter gene as a transgenic construct. We have successfully generated three lines of IA-1 promoter/LacZ transgenic mice, named Tg 2-5, 2-7, and 2-8. The estimated copy number and the LacZ expression pattern in each line of transgenic mice was determined by Southern blot analysis and β-gal activities. High copy numbers were found in two lines of transgenic mice, Tg 2-5 (∼40-50 copies) and Tg 2-8 (∼80-90 copies), whereas Tg 2-7 contains a low copy number (<5 copies).Strong Expression of the IA-1p-LacZ Transgene in Nervous System—We performed a whole mount embryo analysis of β-gal activity from timed pregnant female mice. Early embryos were collected for whole mount fixation and stained for β-gal activity. The blue color (Fig. 1) represents β-gal activity driven by the IA-1 promoter sequence (-1661 to +40 bp). Strong staining was observed in the nervous system of the early stage embryo (e11.5-e14.5) in the forebrain, midbrain, hind brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and retina (Fig. 1). No β-gal activity was detected in other tissues. In general, the staining patterns of Tg 2-5 and Tg 2-8 are similar. There are differential intensities between the Tg 2-5 and Tg 2-8 lines. For example, the retina staining in the Tg 2-8 was stronger than in Tg 2-5 (e11.5). Further sectioning of β-gal stained embryos (e12.5 day) revealed strong activities in the olfactory bulb, olfactory epithelium, retinal neuron, lens, spinal cord, and trigerminal ganglion. We also stained the postpartum brains collected from e16.5, e18.5, newborn, 1 week, and adult. Strong staining was observed in cerebellum and pineal gland at e18.5, whereas the LacZ activity gradually decreased while the brain matured to adulthood (Fig. 2). Age-matched nontransgenic control animals failed to show any detectable levels of β-gal staining in the brain at the time points that were chosen (data not shown). The earliest onset of β-gal staining was observed in e9.5 embryos with a less intense staining pattern in the midbrain, forebrain, hind brain, and spinal cord. Detection of LacZ expression at e9.5 precedes the previously reported endogenous expression of mouse IA-1 mRNA (27Xie J.P. Cai T. Zhang H. Lan M.S. Notkins A.L. Genomics. 2002; 80: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Fig. 2The postpartum brains collected from e16.5, e18.5, newborn, 1 week, and adult were also subjected to β-gal staining. Strong staining was observed in cerebellum and pineal gland at e16.5 to e18.5 days, whereas the LacZ activity was decreased while the brain matured to adulthood.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The -426/+40 bp IA-1 Promoter Sequence Contains the Tissue-specific Activity—Based upon the results of the in vivo IA-1 promoter/LacZ transgenic mice, we demonstrated that the -1661/+40 bp human IA-1 promoter region is sufficient to direct both the proper spatial and temporal expression of the IA-1 gene. In order to determine the minimal region(s) necessary to direct tissue-specific expression, three separate deletion constructs of the IA-1 promoter were linked to the CAT reporter gene. We analyzed the promoter activity in three different cell lines, HeLa, Y79, and βTC-1 (Fig. 3). Comparison of the three deletion constructs revealed that the -426/+40 bp/CAT construct activated the reporter gene to the same level as the -1661/+40 bp construct in both Y79 and βTC-1 cells. However, the overall promoter activity was significantly higher in Y79 (∼40-fold increase) as compared with βTC-1 cells (∼7-fold increase). As expected, promoter activity was much lower in HeLa cells (∼3-fold). Therefore, this result demonstrates that the -426/+40 bp region contains most of the cis elements necessary to direct the proper tissue-specific expression of the IA-1 gene.Fig. 3Analysis of IA-1 promoter deletion constructs in HeLa, β-TC1, and Y-79 cells. Schematic diagram of the IA-1 promoter deletion constructs that were subcloned in a pCAT3-basic vector. The IA-1 5′-flanking sequence (-1661/+40 bp) used for the transgenic study and the two other fragments (-426/+40 and -65/+40 bp) were subjected to a reporter gene assay. Both 1.7 kb and -426 bp fragments confer maximal promoter activity, which is consistent with the IA-1 expressing cell lines (Fig. 1). The CMV-β-gal vector was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. The transfections were repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E-box 3 Is Critical for IA-1 Promoter Activity—Close inspection of the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter region revealed the presence of three putative E-box elements. In order to demonstrate the importance of the E-box elements in the IA-1 promoter, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the E-box elements singly or in various combinations from the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter/CAT reporter construct (designated as wild type (WT in Fig. 4)). We assessed the overall activity each of the E-box elements contributes to the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter activity in βTC-1 cells. Deletion of one E-box element at a time demonstrated that deletion of E-box 3 (E3) resulted in a significant loss in promoter activity (∼70%) in βTC-1 cells (Fig. 4). Deletion of E1 or E2 alone did not result in a significant change in basal promoter activity. Double deletion of E1 and E2, as expected, did not show any significant change to overall basal promoter activity (Fig. 4). As expected, double deletion of either E1 and E3 or E2 and E3 or triple deletion of E1, E2, and E3 mimicked the single deletion of E3 alone, resulting in a ∼75, 60, or 60% loss, respectively, in promoter activity when compared with the wild type promoter. Therefore, this result demonstrates the importance of the E3-box for tissue-specific IA-1 promoter activity.Fig. 4E3-box is important for the IA-1 promoter activation. Mutational analyses of the E-box elements in the IA-1 promoter (-426/+40 bp) in β-TC1 cells. The 6-bp E-box was deleted from the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter construct as shown in the hatched box. All deletion constructs were compared with the wild-type -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter activity. The deletion of the E3-box diminished by more than 60% the IA-1 promoter activity. The CMV-β-gal vector was used as internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. The transfections were repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E47-NeuroD1 Heterodimer Activates the -426/+40 bp IA-1 Promoter—Deletion analysis of the IA-1 promoter in various cell lines demonstrated that the -426/+40 bp region contained the majority of the critical information necessary to result in the tissue-specific expression of the IA-1 gene (Fig. 3). Further analysis of this region revealed the presence of three E-box elements in this region. Deletion of the individual E-box elements revealed that E3 was crucial for 70% of the basal promoter activity in βTC-1 cells. The sequence of the E3 element resembles a NeuroD1 binding site found in both the rat insulin and glucagon genes (16Dumontell E. Laser B. Cpmstant I. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19945-19954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed transient transfections with the wild type -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter/CAT construct to determine whether NeuroD1 could activate the IA-1 promoter/CAT construct. Using various concentrations of a NeuroD1 expression vector, a dosage-dependent increase in IA-1 promoter activity was observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). NeuroD1 is a tissue-restricted bHLH protein that binds to a 6-bp E-box element as a heterodimer with a ubiquitous partner E47 (15Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.T.M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Therefore, we then performed transient transfections in HeLa cells using the -426/+40 bp IA-1 promoter/CAT construct along with a fixed amount of E47 and NeuroD1 expression vectors to demonstrate that there was a synergistic effect of co-expression of these two molecules on the IA-1 promoter construct. As shown in Fig. 5B, transfection of an E47 expression vector alone could not stimulate the IA-1 promoter/CAT activity; however, the"

K562 cells irradiated with UVA (3.0 milliwatts/cm2) for 5, 15, and 30 min showed a time dependent increase in 4-HNE levels. As judged by the activation of caspases, apoptosis was observed only in cells irradiated for 30 min. Within 2 h of recovery in normal medium, 4-HNE levels in 5 and 15 min UVA, irradiated cells returned to the basal or even lower levels but in cells irradiated for 30 min, 4-HNE levels remained consistently higher. The cells irradiated with UVA for 5 min and allowed to recover for 2 h in normal medium (UVA-preconditioned cells) showed a remarkable induction of hGST5.8, which catalyzes conjugation of 4-HNE to glutathione (GSH), and RLIP76 (Ral BP-1), which mediates the transport of the conjugate, GS-HNE. In cells irradiated with UVA for 30 min the induction of RLIP76 or hGST5.8 was not observed. The preconditioned cells transported GS-HNE into the medium at a rate about 2-fold higher than the controls and the transport was inhibited (65%) by coating the cells with anti-RLIP76 IgG. Upon treatment with xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XA/XO), 4-HNE, or prolonged UVA exposure, the control cells showed a sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis. However, in the UVA-preconditioned cells, apoptosis was not observed, and JNK activation was inhibited. This resistance of preconditioned cells to XA/XO-, 4-HNE-, or UVA-induced apoptosis could be abrogated when these cells were coated with anti-RLIP76 IgG to block the efflux of GS-HNE.

Transfection of HL-60 and K562 cells with murine enzyme mGSTA4-4 with substrate preference to 4-HNE has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis caused by oxidative stress as well as 4-HNE (9Cheng J.Z.

Also, a concomitant induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76 has been shown to provide protection to several human cell lines in culture against oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis (12Cheng J.Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M.K. Singh S.V. Zimniak P. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41213-41223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Previous studies with a number of cell lines of human origin have demonstrated that cells preconditioned with mild, transient oxidative stress or heat shock acquire resistance to apoptosis caused by oxidative stress through an accelerated metabolism and exclusion of 4-HNE due to the induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76. A coordinated action of these proteins causes an increased efflux of the GS-HNE across the cell membranes, lowers the intracellular concentration of 4-HNE, and protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (12Cheng J.Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M.K. Singh S.V. Zimniak P. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, present studies were designed to examine a possible role of 4-HNE in UVA-induced apoptosis. K562 cells were selected for these studies because we have previously characterized the enzyme systems, which regulate the intracellular concentrations of 4-HNE (12Cheng J.Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M.K. Singh S.V. Zimniak P. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol.

Arch. 1999; 15: 163-176Google Scholar) in these cells. It was hypothesized that if 4-HNE was involved in UVA-mediated apoptosis, then upon UVA exposure, 4-HNE levels should rise. This should be accompanied by a defense response of the cells against 4-HNE toxicity resulting in the induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76. If this response occurs at non-toxic/non-lethal doses of UVA irradiation, cells preconditioned with mild and transient UVA exposure should become more resistant to apoptosis caused by prolonged UV exposures. Furthermore, if UVA preconditioned cells also acquire resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, 4-HNE could be considered to be a common mediator of apoptosis in a variety of stress situations. To address the above questions, we have studied the effect of UVA exposure on the formation of 4-HNE, induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76, and the efflux of GS-HNE from K562 cells. The effect of mild, transient UVA exposure on major antioxidant enzymes, which metabolize ROS has also been studied. Furthermore, we have examined whether cells exposed to mild UVA exposure acquire resistance to apoptosis caused by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (oxidative stress) and prolonged UVA exposure and if so, whether this protection can be abrogated by inhibiting the efflux of GS-HNE. Results of these studies show that preconditioning with mild UVA exposure imparts to cells a partial resistance against oxidative stress- and UVA-induced apoptosis by preventing the activation of JNK and caspase, and that this resistance can be abolished by inhibiting the efflux of GS-HNE. These results strongly suggest an involvement of 4-HNE in UVA-induced signaling for apoptosis, and point out similarities in the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and UVA. Materials—1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), glutathione (GSH), xanthine (2,6-dihydroxypurine) (XA), and xanthine oxidase (XO) were from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. 4-HNE was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI) and hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). 4-[3H]HNE was synthesized by us as described previously (12Cheng J.Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S.

All reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western transfer were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against the Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes of human GSTs were the same as those used in our previous studies (23Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M.

Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant mGSTA4-4, the mouse ortholog of hGST5.8, were raised in rabbits. In earlier studies, these antibodies have been shown to be specific to hGST5.8 among the human GSTs (24Cheng J.Z. Yang Y. Singh S.P. Singhal S.S. Awasthi S. Pan S.S. Singh S.V. Zimniak P.

Purified IgG obtained by sequentially passing these antibodies over DEAE-52 and protein A-Sepharose columns were used in all the experiments. Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant hGSTA4-4 were raised in chicken as described by us previously (24Cheng J.Z. Yang Y. Singh S.P. Singhal S.S. Awasthi S. Pan S.S. Singh S.V. Zimniak P.

Monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated JNK (G-7) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against β-actin was acquired from Sigma. Cell Lines and Cultures—The human erythroleukemia K562 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. UV Irradiation—K562 (5 × 106) cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS. The cells were then transferred into a Petri dish (60 mm diameter) and irradiated under a 365-nm UV lamp (Model UVL-56, UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) in dark at a rate of 3 mW/cm2 determined by the chemical actinometry method of Hatchard and Parker (25Hatchard C.G. Parker C.A. Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A. 1956; 235: 518Crossref Google Scholar). After the UVA exposure for fixed time periods, the cells were pelleted, and PBS was replaced by normal culture medium. The cells were allowed a 2 h recovery time at 37 °C. In parallel, sham irradiated cells were subjected to an identical experimental protocol except that UV irradiation was omitted. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analyses—The treated cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in RIPA buffer containing 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 or Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The extract was passed through a 23-gauge needle to shear DNA, and was kept on ice for 30–60 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For detection of phosphorylated JNK, cell extracts were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), and were lysed by sonication (3 times, 5 s each at 40 watts). Cell lysates containing 25–100 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For the detection of the expression of hGST5.8 in K562 cells, 250 μg of protein was loaded. For detection of phosphorylated JNK, 50 μg of protein was loaded. Western blot analysis was performed essentially according to the method of Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The chemiluminiscent reagents from Pierce were used to develop the immunoblots by following the manufacturer's instructions. Determination of Intracellular 4-HNE Levels—Biotech LPO-586 228 kit (Oxis International, Portland, OR) was used to measure concentrations of MDA and MDA plus 4-HNE in K562 cells before recovery and after 2 h of recovery. For each determination, 1 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm BHT and frozen at –70 °C until assayed. To each sample, 650 μl of N-methyl-2-phenylindole and 150 μl of either 12 n HCl (for MDA determination) or 15.4 m methanesulfonic acid (for 4-HNE plus MDA determination) were added. The reaction mixture was mixed by vortexing and incubated at 45 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation at 15000 × g for 10 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was determined at 586 nm. Standards of MDA and 4-HNE were prepared by the hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane in HCl and 4-HNE diethylacetal in methanesulfonic acid, respectively. Extinction coefficients for MDA and 4-HNE (1.1 × 105m–1 cm–1 and 1.3 × 105m–1 cm–1, respectively) determined from the standard curves were used, and the values were expressed as pmol of 4-HNE/mg of protein. Enzyme Assays—Control or UVA-irradiated K562 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). After lysis by sonication, the lysates were centrifuged for 45 min at 28,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were then assayed for their activities against different substrates. GST activity toward CDNB was determined by the method of Habig et al. (28Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that toward 4-HNE was determined according to the procedure described by Alin et al. (29Alin P. Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined by the methods described by Beers and Sizer (30Beers Jr., R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Paoletti and Mocali (31Paoletti F. Mocali A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), respectively. 2-Mercaptoethanol was excluded from the buffer A in preparation of the supernatants used for the determination of SOD activity. Measurement of GS-HNE Efflux from the Cells—In order to investigate the effect of GS-HNE efflux on the mechanism of UVA, oxidative stress, and 4-HNE-induced apoptosis, control or UVA irradiated K562 cells were allowed to recover for an hour, treated with preimmune IgG or anti-RLIP76 IgG at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, and incubated for an additional 1 h. In some experiments, as noted in the text, the antibody coating step was omitted. Instead, the cells were allowed to rest for 2 h, so that the total recovery period was 2 h in each treatment. After washing with PBS to remove IgG. The cells were then loaded with 4-[3H]HNE by incubating with 20 μm 4-[3H]HNE (specific activity 3,800 cpm/nmol) in culture medium for 30 min. The cells loaded with 4-[3H]HNE were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g, washed with PBS (2 × 2 ml), resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C for measuring the efflux of GS-[3H]HNE from the cells. After the incubation period, cells were harvested, the medium was quantitatively separated, and radioactivity was measured in the medium and in cells. For the identification of GS-HNE conjugate, the medium was lyophilized, extracted with 200 μl of 70% ethanol, and the conjugate was isolated and characterized by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry as described previously (12Cheng J.Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M.K. Singh S.V. Zimniak P. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41213-41223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in triplicate in parallel experiments using equal number of cells under identical conditions. Caspase Assay for in Situ Apoptosis—Control or 5 min of UVA-irradiated cells were allowed to recover for 2 h in complete medium. Apoptosis in separate experiments was induced by one of the following treatments (i) 20 μm 4-HNE for 2 h at 37 °C, (ii) UVA irradiation (3.0 mW/cm2) for 30 min, and (iii) 30 μm xanthine (XA) for 1 h prior to the addition of xanthine oxidase (XO, 20 milliunits) and incubation for additional 15 h. Where mentioned, after 5 min of UVA irradiation, cells were incubated for 1 h in complete medium followed by preincubation with preimmune IgG or anti RLIP76 IgG at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml for an additional 1 h and, after washing with PBS, were treated with 4-HNE, XA/XO, or UVA irradiation as described above. Apoptotic cells were detected by staining with 10 μm CaspACE FITC-VAD-FMK (Promega) in situ marker for 30 min in the dark. The slides were rinsed with PBS twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, mounted in a medium containing DAPI (1.5 μg/ml), and observed under fluorescent microscopy (Olympus, Japan). Effects of Short Time UVA Irradiation on 4-HNE Levels and Apoptosis—In order to investigate a possible role of 4-HNE in UVA-mediated signaling for apoptosis, K562 human erythroleukemia cells were subjected to UVA (365 nm) irradiation (3.0 mW/cm2) up to a period of 30 min, and the intracellular levels of 4-HNE were examined at different time intervals. The results of these experiments presented in Fig. 1 showed that 5, 15, and 30 min of UVA irradiation caused ∼1.4-fold, 2-fold, and 2.6-fold increase, respectively, in the 4-HNE levels over that observed in the control cells. After UVA exposure, the cells were allowed to recover in complete medium at 37 °C for 2 h, and 4-HNE concentrations were re-examined after the recovery period. Results of these experiments (Fig. 1) showed that after 2 h of recovery, 4-HNE levels in the cells irradiated for relatively short time were remarkably reduced. For example, in cells irradiated for 5 min and rested for 2 h, the 4-HNE level was only about 40% of that observed immediately after UVA exposure. In fact, the 4-HNE level in these rested cells was even lower than the basal level observed without UVA irradiation. Likewise, in cells subjected to 15 min of UVA irradiation, the 4-HNE level was remarkably reduced after recovery period and was comparable to the basal 4-HNE level before irradiation. On the contrary, the 4-HNE level in cells irradiated for 30 min remained persistently high even after the recovery period (Fig. 1). These results indicated that UVA exposure caused an enhanced formation of 4-HNE and suggested that cells exposed to UVA for a short time acquired the capability to dispose of 4-HNE at an accelerated rate but lose this capability if irradiated for a prolonged period with UVA. Effect of UVA on Apoptosis—UVA-irradiated cells after 2 h of resting were examined for apoptosis using the CaspACE FITC-VAD-FMK marker which specifically detects caspase activation in situ (Fig. 2). Results of these studies showed that after 2 h recovery, cells exposed to 5 and 15 min of UVA showed no significant activation of caspases indicating lack of significant apoptosis. However, a major fraction of the cells exposed to 30 min of UVA showed caspase activation, suggesting onset of apoptosis, which was also indicated by the characteristic nuclear condensation observed in DAPI-stained cells. These results are consistent with earlier reports that UVA causes apoptosis (20Pourzand C. Rossier G. Reelfs O. Borner C. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1405-1411PubMed Google Scholar, 21He Y.Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8058-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and suggest that the intracellular 4-HNE levels may correlate with the extent of UVA-mediated apoptosis. Effects of UVA on Expression of Enzymes Regulating Intracellular Concentrations of 4-HNE—Since our results indicated that 4-HNE concentrations in cells exposed to 5 and 15 min of UVA were decreased after a 2-h recovery, we examined the expression of 4-HNE-metabolizing enzymes in cells rested after UVA exposure. Previous studies have shown that the majority of cellular 4-HNE is metabolized through its conjugation to GSH, catalyzed by GSTs (32Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B.

In humans, there are two GST isozymes, hGSTA4-4 (18Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and hGST5.8 (17Singhal S.S.

Acta. 1994; 1204: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which display high catalytic efficiency toward 4-HNE (33Yang Y. Sharma R. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 182: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 3, A and B showed that hGST5.8 expression was strongly induced upon 5 min (20-fold) and 15 min (7-fold) of UVA irradiation but returned to barely detectable basal level in cells subjected to 30 min of UVA irradiation. These results are consistent with the results on 4-HNE levels presented in Fig. 1 and show that the 4-HNE-metabolizing GST isozyme hGST5.8 is remarkably induced upon initial exposure to UVA but this transient induction is abolished upon a prolonged exposure to UVA. The other 4-HNE-metabolizing GST isozyme, hGSTA4-4, was undetectable in K562 cells under physiological conditions as well as after UVA irradiation (data not presented). UV exposure also did not affect the Pi and Mu class GSTs (data not presented), which comprise the bulk of constitutive GST protein in K562 cells (22Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Saini M.K. Cheng J.Z. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Biochem. Arch. 1999; 15: 163-176Google Scholar). Accumulation of GS-HNE generated by GST-catalyzed conjugation of 4-HNE to GSH is inhibitory to GSTs. Therefore, GS-HNE should be pumped out of the cells to sustain the continuing conjugation of 4-HNE. Previous studies have shown that RLIP76 mediates the ATP-dependent transport of GSH conjugates, and that it accounts for ∼70% of the total transport activity toward GS-HNE in various human cells (14Sharma R.

By searching the data base we discovered a second closely related gene, mNAT2. mNAT1 and mNAT2 are highly homologous to yeast NAT1, a gene known to regulate entry into the G0 phase of the cell cycle. However, in the absence of further characterization, including evidence that mammalian homologues of NAT1 encode functional acetyltransferases, the significance of this relationship has been unclear. Here we focus on mNAT1. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that mNAT1 and its evolutionarily conserved co-subunit, mARD1, assemble to form a functional acetyltransferase. Transfection of mammalian cells with mNAT1 and mARD1 followed by immunofluorescent staining revealed that these proteins localize to the cytoplasm in both overlapping and separate compartments. In situ hybridization demonstrated that throughout brain development mNAT1 and mARD1 are highly expressed in areas of cell division and migration and are down-regulated as neurons differentiate. Finally, mNAT1 and mARD1 are expressed in proliferating mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells; treatment of these cells with retinoic acid initiates exit from the cell cycle, neuronal differentiation, and down-regulation of mNAT1 and mARD1 as the NMOA receptor 1 gene is induced.

Over half of all eukaryotic proteins are N-terminally acetylated (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A functional role for this highly prevalent post-translational modification has been demonstrated for the activity of two peptide hormones; the N-terminal acetyl group of α-melanocorticotropin is necessary for its melanocyte-stimulating activity (2Ney R.L. Ogata E. Shizume N. Nickolson W.E. Liddle G.W. Proc. Int. Congr. Endocrinol. 1964; 2: 1184Google Scholar), and N-terminal acetylation of β-endorphin abolishes its analgesic action (3Symth D.G. Massey D.E. Zakarian S. Finnie M.D. Nature. 1979; 279: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Apart from such rare exceptions, the biological significance of N-terminal acetylation in higher eukaryotes is unknown. In contrast, considerably more is understood about the role of N-terminal acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where three N-terminal acetyltransferases that act on distinct groups of substrates have been identified (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). One of these enzymes, NatA, is a complex composed of two proteins, NAT1 and ARD1 (5Park E.C. Szostak J.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The nat1 null mutant displays slow growth, derepression of the silent mating locus HML, failure to enter G0, and failure to sporulate (6Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M.

Therefore, it has been proposed that in yeast the NAT1/ARD1 complex is required to regulate some protein or proteins involved in cell cycle control (6Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P.

Influx of calcium through activated NMDA receptors initiates intracellular signaling cascades that lead to changes in the activity of transcription factors such as cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and ultimately to changes in gene expression (16West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B. Dolmetsch R.E. Kornhauser J.M. Shaywitz A.J. Takasu M.A. Tao X. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the adult hippocampus NMDA receptor-induced changes in gene expression are thought to be necessary for long term changes in synaptic efficacy (17Poser S. Storm D.R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To identify molecular events regulated by NMDA receptor function in developing neurons, we used the disrupted whisker representation neural circuit in NMDAR1 knockout mice (18Li Y. Erzurumlu R.S. Chen C. Jhaveri S. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 76: 427-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) as model for cDNA microarray analysis. Three genes were identified that are expressed at higher than normal levels in the absence of functional NMDA receptors (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of these, mNAT1, is highly homologous to the S. cerevisiae N-terminal acetyltransferase subunit NAT1 (6Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition to mNAT1, other vertebrate homologues of NAT1 have been identified in screens for molecules expressed very early in embryogenesis (20Choi S.C. Chang J.Y. Han J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), as well as in developing blood vessels (21Gendron R.L. Adams L.C. Paradis H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that these genes encode an N-terminal acetyltransferase that plays an important developmental role that is evolutionarily conserved from lower eukaryotes to mammals. However, in the absence of detailed developmental studies, full-length coding sequence for mammalian NAT1, and biochemical and functional evidence that it encodes an acetyltransferase, the viability of this hypothesis has been unclear. Here we demonstrate for the first time that mammalian NAT1 and mammalian ARD1 combine to form a functional acetyltransferase. In addition, we show that mNAT1 and mARD1 are expressed in regions of cell division and migration throughout brain development and are down-regulated as neurons mature and form appropriate patterns of synaptic connections. This inverse correlation between mARD1/mNAT1 expression and neuronal maturation is recapitulated in retinoic acid-stimulated P19 embryonic carcinoma cells that are undergoing neuronal differentiation in vitro. The results suggest that an N-terminal acetyltransferase complex containing mNAT1 and mARD1 forms an evolutionary link between developmental mechanisms in lower eukaryotes and those used in the mammalian brain. cDNA Clones and Expression Constructs—The complete cDNA sequence for mNAT1 was deduced from two overlapping cDNA clones, 3A and 8F, as well as from three ESTs: AA561496, AA163290, and AA474587 (see Fig. 1A). To obtain 3A and 8F, PCR primers were designed based on EST AA474587, and these were used to screen an arrayed mouse testis cDNA library (Origene). It should be noted, however, that 3A and 8F are conventional cDNA clones. The coding sequence in clone 3A was sequenced on both strands. The complete mNAT1 cDNA sequence has been registered in the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF510858). An intermediate construct, pCMV6-mNAT1, that contains full-length mNAT1 cDNA, was assembled by a three fragment ligation of the 418-bp EciI (blunted)/PstI fragment from EST AA561496, the 1.99-kb PstI/BamHI fragment from clone 3A, and the BamHI/EcoRI (blunted) fragment from clone 8F. Construct CS2+MT-mNAT1, used for cellular expression and localization of Myc-mNAT1 (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6C), was generated by subcloning the 1.53-kb SpeI/PstI (blunted) fragment from pCMV6-mNAT1 between the XbaI and SnaBI sites of the CS2+MT vector (22Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 23Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the XhoI (blunted)/SphI fragment of this construct was replaced with the 1.26-kb EagI (blunted)/SphI fragment of pCMV6-mNAT1 to obtain CS2+MT-mNAT1. A construct used for in vitro translation of mNAT1, as well as some acetyltransferase assays (see Fig. 6A), pT7-mNAT1, was generated by replacing the luciferase cDNA in the luciferase T7 control DNA (Promega) with the NotI/DraI fragment from pCMV6-mNAT1. A second construct used for in vitro translation of mNAT1 and the remainder of the acetyltransferase assays (see Fig. 6B), pT7-MT-mNAT1, was assembled by subcloning the NcoI (blunted)/SpeI fragment from CS2+MT-mNAT1 into the NotI (blunted)/SpeI sites of pT7-mNAT1.Fig. 6mNAT1 and mARD1 co-assemble to form a functional acetyltransferase. A, mNAT1 (NAT1) and HA-tagged mARD1 (ARD1-HA) were translated separately in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine to form 90- and 45-kDa proteins, respectively (Input). The amount of protein seen in each input lane represents 20% of the amount of protein used in each immunoprecipitation reaction. Anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitated (IP) both mNAT1 and mARD1 when the two were mixed, indicating that they co-assemble in vitro. No immunoprecipitation of either protein occurred when IgG was substituted for the anti-HA antibody or when HA-tagged ARD1 was omitted from the reaction. Acetyltransferase activity was determined by incubating each immunoprecipitate with [3H]acetyl-CoA and adrenocorticotropic hormone peptide. The acetylated peptide was isolated by cation-exchange chromatography and counted for radioactivity. B, mNAT1 is not functional in the absence of mARD1. Myc-tagged mNAT1 (MT-NAT1) and ARD1-HA were translated separately in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Input). Anti-MT (shown) and anti-HA antibodies immunoprecipitated both mNAT1 and mARD1 (IP). No immunoprecipitation of either protein occurred when IgG was substituted for the anti-MT or anti-HA antibodies. When mARD1 is present, MT-NAT1 has acetyltransferase activity; MT-NAT1 alone displays only background levels of activity. C, mNAT1 and mARD1 co-assemble in cells. ARD1-HA and MT-NAT1 were transiently expressed together in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Lysate was isolated from transfected (T) and mock transfected (M) cells and subject to immunoprecipitation analysis (IP). Proteins were electrophoresed and transferred to a membrane, and the membrane was probed with anti-Myc antibody followed by an horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and finally processed for luminal-horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence. MT-NAT1 was detected in unprocessed lysate (lane 1), as well as in samples in which ARD1-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (lane 2). MT-NAT1 was not detected when IgG was substituted for anti-HA antibodies (lane 3) or when lysate from mock transfected cells was substituted for lysate from transfected cells (lane 4). The lysate shown in lane 1 represents ∼5% of the amount of lysate used in each immunoprecipitation reaction (lanes 2-4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A cDNA clone representing mARD1 was identified in the GenBank™ data base (accession number NM_019870) by searching for sequences homologous to yeast ard1. The 883-base pair mARD1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR using postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA and the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CCAGTCCAAGCTCCTATCGT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GCAGGTTCTAGGAGGCAGAGT-3′. The resulting cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript and pBSHA (a gift of Dr. Kunio Takishima, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan) to generate pBS-mARD1 and pBS-mARD1/HA, respectively. The latter has a hemagglutinin (HA) tag added to the 3′ end of the mARD1 open reading frame. The full-length HA-tagged mARD1 cDNA was subcloned into CS2+ (22Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 23Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) to generate CS2+mARD1/HA, which was used for cellular localization experiments (see Fig. 5). Northern Hybridization—A mouse poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot (Origene) containing RNA from multiple adult tissues was hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of 32P-lableled cDNA probe in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) at 42 °C for 16 h. The highest stringency wash was 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min. The following cDNA fragments were used to generate probes: mARD1, the 561-bp NcoI/BamHI fragment from pBS-mARD1 (nucleotides 361-942 of NM_019870), and mNAT2, the 531-base pair BsmI/DraI fragment from IMAGE clone BG295065. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol.

Riboprobes used are as follows: mNAT1, nucleotides 19-291 of AA474587, and mARD1, nucleotides 577-867 of NM_019870 plus an additional 91 nucleotides inserted 5′ to nucleotide 622 as a result of alternative splicing. P19 Cell Culture—Mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells were maintained, and neuronal differentiation was induced in the presence of retinoic acid as described previously (26Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Briefly, monodispersed P19 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of 1 μm retinoic acid in bacteriological grade culture dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Funabashi, Japan). These aggregate cultures were maintained 4 days (12-h, 1-day, and 4-day time points in Fig. 4), trypsinized, and plated on tissue culture dishes without retinoic acid. Two days later, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside (Sigma); the culture was maintained for up to another 6 days for a total of 8 days in culture after retinoic acid treatment (4 + 4-day and 4 + 8-day time points in Fig. 4). Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNase Protection—RNA extraction and RNase protection analysis was carried out as described previously (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Corriveau R.A. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dried gels were exposed at -70 °C to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MS film, and signals were quantified directly from the gels using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Riboprobes used are as follows: mNAT1, nucleotides 19-291 of AA474587; mARD1, nucleotides 577-867 of NM_019870 plus an additional 91-nucleotide insertion (extra exon) 5′ to nucleotide 622; NMDAR1, nucleotides 994-1341 of U08261. NMDAR1 knockout pups (18Li Y. Erzurumlu R.S. Chen C. Jhaveri S. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 76: 427-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) were generated by heterozygous crosses, and genotyping was performed as described (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cellular Localization of mARD1 and mNAT1—Rat NRK-49F cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and 6 × 104 cells were replated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips the day before transfection. Equimolar amounts (0.5 μg each) of CS2+MT-mNAT1 and CS2+mARD1/HA were transfected into the cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 36 h, the cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubating them in cold ethanol for 10 min and blocked with 10% calf serum in PBS for 60 min. For HA immunostaining, 3F10 rat anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science) were used at 0.7 μg/ml and followed by an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rat polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:500. For Myc immunostaining, 9E10 mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal ascites fluid (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:1000, followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1:1000. Samples were examined using a Zeiss LSM410 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a ×63 oil immersion objective. Results presented in Fig. 5 are representative of four independent experiments; for one of these four, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 10% calf serum in PBS for 10 min, rather than the cold methanol treatment described above. Similar results were obtained with both methods. Immunoprecipitation—In vitro translation was performed in the presence of Redivue [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using a TNT T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). mNAT1 and HA-tagged mARD1 proteins were generated using constructs pT7-mNAT1 and pBS-mARD1/HA, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated protein was carried out by incubating 25 μl of the mNAT1 translation reaction, 10 μl of the mARD1/HA translation reaction, 20 μl of 250 μg/ml rabbit anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and 45 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.15 m NaCl) on ice for 100 min. At this point 130 μl of RIPA buffer and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 2 h. The protein A-Sepharose beads were then washed four times with RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 20 μl were resolved on an 11% SDS-PAGE gel. Co-immunoprecipitation from transfected mammalian cells was carried out as follows. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes 24 h before transfection. Cells at 50% confluency were transiently transfected with 0.75 μg each of CS2+MT-mNAT1 and CS2+ARD1/HA plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 2 days the cells were harvested in 250 μl/dish of RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution was passed through a 21.5-gauge needle 30 times and incubated on ice for 30 min. This lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was precleared by incubating with rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose on ice for 30 min. For immunoprecipitation, 300 μl of the precleared lysate was incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-HA antibody on ice for 60 min. Then 20 μl of protein A (25% slurry) was added to the reaction, and the incubation was continued for 8 h with constant agitation. The precipitates were washed with RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 four times and then resuspended in 20 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The Myc-tagged mNAT1 protein in the immunoprecipitate was detected using a standard Western blotting procedure. Briefly, 12 μl of the sample was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The blot was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Chemicon) and the Chemilucent Western blot detection system (Chemicon). Acetyltransferase Assay—Acetyltransferase activity determinations (see Fig. 6, A and B) were performed in triplicate. Briefly, in vitro translation of mNAT1 and HA-tagged mARD1 was carried out as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of mNAT1 translation mixture, 20 μl of mARD1 translation mixture, 15 μg of rabbit anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 160 μl of RIPA buffer, and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose were incubated on ice for 16 h. The complex bound to the Sepharose was separated by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and once with RIPA buffer without Nonidet P-40. N-terminal acetyltransferase activity was then assayed as described previously (28Lee F.J. Lin L.W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yamada R. Bradshaw R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, the Sepharose-bound complex was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h in a 150-μl reaction containing 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 4.5 mm [3H]acetyl-CoA (137 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 33 μm human adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH 1-24; Calbiochem) with constant agitation. The reaction was then centrifuged, and 130 μl of supernatant was applied to 150 μl of SP Sephadex (50% slurry in 0.5 m acetic acid; Sigma). The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid and rinsed with 300 μl of methanol, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Vertebrate Homologues of Yeast NAT1—We previously identified EST AA474587, a partial cDNA clone corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of mNAT1, because it is expressed at higher than normal levels in the developing brains of NMDAR1 knockout mice (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length cDNA corresponding to mNAT1, we screened a mouse testis cDNA library and isolated clone 3A. Sequence analysis indicated that this clone lacked the 5′ end of the coding region, which was obtained from EST AA163290 and EST AA561496 (Fig. 1A). An open reading frame of 2,595 nucleotides encoding an 865-amino acid protein was deduced from the assembled sequence (Fig. 1B). mNAT1 and yeast NAT1 share 28% identity and 41% similarity when conservative amino acid substitutions are included. One additional clone, 8F, was found to be identical in sequence to that assembled from 3A, AA163290, and AA561496, with the exception of the 5′-most region and a silent polymorphism observed at nucleotide 1874 of the registered cDNA sequence AF510858 (G → A). Comparison of the 5′ region to the corresponding mouse genomic sequence indicates that 8F represents an mRNA that resulted from alternative usage of an upstream exon (data not shown). This alternative splicing would yield a protein that is 50 amino acids shorter at the N terminus than the one predicted by the other cDNAs we analyzed. A search of the GenBank™ data base identified a cDNA (accession number AK005056) that encodes a mouse protein that is 68% identical to mNAT1 (Fig. 1B). When conservative amino acid substitutions are included, the overall similarity is 81%. Northern blot analysis of mNAT2 indicated that, in the adult, highest levels of expression are present in the kidney and testes (Fig. 1C). Moderate expression was observed in the liver, thymus, and skin. Although the expression profiles of mNAT1 and mNAT2 are generally similar, expression levels of mNAT2 are lower than those of mNAT1, in particular in the brain (Fig. 1C; see also Ref. 19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present analysis focused on mNAT1. A Vertebrate Homologue of Yeast ARD1—Studies in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that, to form a functional N-terminal acetyltransferase complex, NAT1 must assemble with another gene product, ARD1 (5Park E.C. Szostak J.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the mouse homologue of ARD1 has not been reported, we found a mouse cDNA in GenBank™ (accession number NM_019870) that encodes a protein that shares 42% identity with yeast ARD1. Based on this sequence, primers were designed to amplify mouse ARD1 cDNA. Reverse transcriptase PCR resulted in two products of ∼291 and 382 base pairs, respectively. Sequence analysis of these cDNAs revealed that the shorter of the two is identical to NM_019870, whereas the longer one appears to be derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA with an extra 91 nucleotides inserted 5′ to nucleotide 622 of NM_019870. Comparison of these two cDNA sequences with the corresponding mouse genomic sequence suggests that they resulted from an alternative choice of splice acceptor sites in the last coding exon. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis indicated that in P0 mouse brain the shorter form is expressed at higher levels than the longer one (data not shown). The expression profile of mARD1 in adult mouse tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). mARD1 is expressed quite ubiquitously and in general displays a similar pattern of expression to that observed for mNAT1 (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An exception to this overall trend is found in the testes, where mNAT1 expression is high, but mARD1 expression is quite low. In addition, unlike mNAT1 (19Sugiura N. Patel R.G. Corriveau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14257-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), mARD1 is expressed at normal levels in the brainstem and brain of neonatal NMDAR1 k"
https://openalex.org/W2020426480,"Yersinia are causative agents in human diseases ranging from gastrointestinal syndromes to Bubonic Plague. There is increasing risk of misuse of infectious agents, such as Yersinia pestis, as weapons of terror as well as instruments of warfare for mass destruction. YopH is an essential virulence factor whose protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity is required for Yersinia pathogenicity. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing potent and selective YopH inhibitors as novel anti-plague agents. We have screened a library of 720 structurally diverse commercially available carboxylic acids and identified 26 YopH inhibitors with IC50 values below 100 μm. The most potent and specific YopH inhibitor is aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), which exhibits a Ki value of 5 nm for YopH and displays 6–120-fold selectivity in favor of YopH against a panel of mammalian PTPs. To determine whether ATA can block the activity of YopH in a cellular context, we have examined the effect of ATA on T-cell signaling in human Jurkat cells transfected with YopH. We show that YopH severely decreases the T-cell receptor-induced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, ERK1/2 activity, and interleukin-2 transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that ATA can effectively block the inhibitory activity of YopH and restore normal T-cell function. These results provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis that small molecule inhibitors that selectively target YopH may be therapeutically useful. In addition, it is expected that potent and selective YopH inhibitors, such as ATA, should be useful reagents to delineate YopH's cellular targets in plague and other pathogenic conditions caused by Yersinia infection.

These results provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis that small molecule inhibitors that selectively target YopH may be therapeutically useful. In addition, it is expected that potent and selective YopH inhibitors, such as ATA, should be useful reagents to delineate YopH's cellular targets in plague and other pathogenic conditions caused by Yersinia infection. The genus Yersinia include three species that are pathogenic for rodents and humans: Yersinia pestis is the agent responsible for Bubonic Plague (also known as Black Death), Yersinia enterocolitica produces a broad range of gastrointestinal syndromes, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes adenitis and septicemia (1Bulter T. Wyngaarden J.B. Smith L.H. Textbook of Medicine. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1985: 1600-1603Google Scholar). Credible estimates of the number of people killed by this bacterium during the course of human history approach 200 million (2Brubaker R.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Despite efforts to eradicate the disease, it has recently been recognized by the World Health Organization as a re-emerging public health concern. In addition, several multidrug resistant strains have been found in Y. pestis (3Galimand M. Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Rasoamanana B. Chanteau S. Carniel E. Courvalin P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Buchrieser C. Galimand M. Eahalison L. Chanteau S. Courvalin P. Carniel E. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is increasing risk of misuse of infectious agents, such as Y. pestis, as weapons of terror, as well as instruments of warfare for mass destruction (5McGovern T.W. Christopher G.W. Eitzen E.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1999; 135: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Inglesby T.V. Dennis D.T. Henderson D.A. Bartlett J.G. Ascher M.S. Eitzen E. Fine A.D. Friedlander A.M.

Thus, there is an urgent need to devise unique and effective treatments that could be implemented soon after a bioterrorist attack. All three pathogenic species of Yersinia contain an extrachromosomal plasmid of 70 kb that is essential for virulence (8Portnoy D.A. Wolf-Watz H. Bolin I. Beeder A.B. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes the genes of a type III secretion system and several of the bacterial virulence factors known as Yops 1The abbreviations used are: Yop, Yersinia outer membrane protein; ATA, aurintricarboxylic acid; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; IL-2, interleukin-2; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; TCR, T-cell receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody. (Yersinia outer membrane proteins) (9Cornelis G.R. Folia Microbiol. 1998; 43: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The type III secretion system is a highly conserved macromolecular machinery among pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, that upon contact with a eukaryotic cell injects a set of bacterial effector proteins into the lumen of the target cells. Six Yersinia effectors, YopH, YopE, YopJ/P, YpkA/YopO, YopT, and YopM, have been identified (10Juris S.J. Shao F. Dixon J.E. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The expression of Yops is correlated with the capacity of the bacterium to avoid host defense mechanisms (11Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once inside the host cell, Yops disrupt signaling cascades that activate the processes of phagocytosis, cytokine production, and respiratory burst, resulting in inhibition of the innate and adaptive immune responses (12Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8778-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). YopH was identified as an essential and obligatory virulence factor for Yersinia pathogenesis as plasmids that have a nonfunctional yopH gene are avirulent (13Bolin I. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Michielis T. Cornelis G. Microbial. Pathogen. 1988; 5: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Rosqvist R. Bolin I. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2139-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Straley S.C. Bowmer W.S. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 445-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the YopH protein contains amino acid sequences (including the active site sequence HC(X)5 R) similar to the eukaryotic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily (17Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In fact, YopH is the most active PTP characterized to date (18Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because bacteria in general do not contain tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (19Foster R. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the requirement of the YopH PTP activity for Yersinia pathogenicity suggests that it mediates a novel mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis. Indeed, production of YopH during Yersinia infection is associated with dephosphorylation of proteins in human epithelial cells and murine macrophages (20Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Hartland E.L. Green S.P. Phillips W.A. Robins-Browne R.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4445-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andersson K. Carballeira N. Magnusson K.-E. Persson C. Stendahl O. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The identified celluar targets of YopH include p130cas, focal adhesion kinase p125FAK, and paxillin, all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins found in the focal adhesion complexes (24Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 25Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the observations that YopH activity causes the disassembly of focal adhesion, which impairs the entry of the bacteria into HeLa cells or their phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils (24Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 25Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 26Ruckdeschel K. Roggenkamp A. Schubert S. Heesemann J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 724-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Black D.S. Montagna L.G. Zitsmann S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the YopH-mediated dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins may be important for the ability of Yersinia to escape the host innate immune responses. Since the acquired immune responses are crucial to the survival of infected animals and all three Yersinia species have a tropism for lymphatic tissue (28Autenrieth I.B. Vogel U. Preger S. Heymer B. Heesemann J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2585-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Autenrieth I.B. Firsching R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Autenrieth I.B. Hantschmann P. Heymer B. Heesemann J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is possible that YopH may also have an effect on components of the adaptive immune system. Indeed, it has been reported that Y. pseudotuberculosis can directly interfere with T and B cell antigen recepter-mediated activation and the lymphocyte inhibitory effects are dependent on YopH (31Yao T. Mecsas J. Healy J.I. Falkow S. Chien Y. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The presence of YopH in T and B cells results in hypophosphorylation of almost all tyrosine-phosphorylated components associated with the antigen receptor signaling complex after receptor activation. More recently, YopH was shown to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion of stimulated T-lymphocytes infected by Y. enterocolitica (32Sauvonnet N. Lambermont I. van der Bruggen P. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consequently, T-cells transiently exposed to Yersinia are unable to flux calcium and produce cytokines. It appears that YopH can suppress the functions of both T- and B-cells thereby preventing the development of an appropriate adaptive immune response. It is clear that there are diverse mechanisms for YopH to impair and evade both the innate and adaptive host immunity. It is also evident that the PTP activity of YopH is essential for the bacterial pathogenicity. For example, conversion of the essential cysteine residue to alanine in YopH abolishes the PTP activity in Y. pseudotuberculosis and eliminates the virulence of the bacterium in a murine infection model (20Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the PTP activity of YopH is essential for the virulence of Yersinia, specific inhibitors targeted to YopH are expected to render the bacteria avirulent. Thus, potent and specific inhibitors for the Yersinia PTP could serve as effective agents to block the spread and proliferation of Y. pestis infection. In this study, we describe the identification and biochemical characterization of a potent and specific small molecule YopH inhibitor, ATA. We further demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of YopH on T-cell signaling can be blocked by ATA, validating the concept that inhibition of YopH may be therapeutically useful. Materials—ATA was purchased from Sigma. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluke Co. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20) was from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). mAb 12CA5 to hemagglutinin was from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-T-cell receptor (TCR) antibodies C305 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Protein Purification—YopH was expressed and purified as described previously (18Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of CD45 (containing both D1 and D2) was expressed and purified as a recombinant GST fusion protein. Other recombinant PTPs, PTP1B, Cdc25A, VHR, T-cell PTP (TCPTP), and HePTP were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (33Shen K. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Screening of a Carboxylic Acid Library for YopH Inhibitors—A library of 720 structurally diverse commercially available carboxylic acids that differ by molecular weight, charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, and sterics was acquired from Aldrich and Sigma. The compounds were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to a concentration of 0.5 m and stored in eight 96-well plates, each plate consisting of 90 compounds. The 6 empty wells were used for control. The compounds were further diluted to 2 mm with DMF. To screen this carboxylic acid library for YopH inhibitors, the effect of each library member on the YopH-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis was determined. The YopH-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of 100 μm carboxylic acid was assayed at 30 °C in a 200-μl reaction system in a 96-well plate. Each reaction contained 10 μl of 2 mm compound in DMF (final concentration 100 μm) and 190 μl of assay buffer (50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0 with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by addition of NaCl) containing 2 mm pNPP and 10 nm YopH. The PTP-catalyzed reaction was started by addition of the enzyme. 10 μl of DMF (i.e. no carboxylic acid) was used as a control. The YopH-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm of the product p-nitrophenol continuously, with a SpectraMAX 340 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The initial rate was obtained by calculating the slope of the product versus the time curve. Compounds that display significant inhibition at 100 μm were subject to IC50 measurements. IC50 Measurement—The PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of inhibitor was assayed at 30 °C in a 200-μl reaction system in the same assay buffer described above. At various concentrations of the compound, the initial rate at fixed pNPP concentrations (equal to the corresponding Km values for each PTP) was measured by continuously following the production of p-nitrophenol as described above. The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative PTP activity toward pNPP versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 1 using Kaleidagraph. Vi/V0=IC50/(IC50+[I])(Eq. 1) In this case, V i is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I], V 0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki [S]/Km. Therefore, when the substrate concentration [S] is equal to Km , IC50 = 2Ki . Ki Measurement—The YopH PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of ATA was assayed at 30 °C and in assay buffer described above. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme YopH to a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.2 to 5 Km) and various fixed concentrations of ATA, and quenched by addition of 50 μl of 5 m NaOH. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a Spectra MAX340 microplate spectrophotometer using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m–1 cm–1. The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern were evaluated using the program GraFit. Plasmid Construction, Cell Culturing, and Transfection—The cDNA for YopH was subcloned into the pEF5HA eukaryotic expression vector, which encodes an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. Human leukemic Jurkat T-cells expressing SV40 large T antigen (Jurkat-TAg cells) were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml of penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 20 × 106 cells were transiently transfected with a total of 10 μg of either pEF/HA empty vector or HA-tagged YopH plasmid by electroporation at 800 microfarads and 280 V. 36 h after electroporation, cells were harvested and either left untreated or stimulated with C305 antibodies for 5 h. 200 nm ATA (diluted from 50 mm stock in aqueous solution) was added to cell medium during electroporation or stimulation. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. Equal protein amount of cell lysates was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was immunoblotted by appropriate antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase Assays—20 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation with 2 μg of NFAT/AP-1-luc plasmid, 3 μg pCMV-β-gal together with 5 μg of empty pEF/HA vector or YopH plasmids. Cells were then stimulated with the TCR antibodies for 5 h. 200 nm ATA was added during electroporation or stimulation. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The final assay sample contained 50 μl of cell lysate, 100 μl of ATP solution (10 mm ATP, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, and 20 mm MgCl2), and 100 μl of luciferin reagent (0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2). The activity was measured in an automatic luminometer (Monolight 3010, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The activity of a cotransfected β-galactosidase was measured to normalize the luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. Macrophage Infections—J774A.1 murine macrophage-like cells were prepared for infection assays as described (35Black D.S. Marie-Cardine A. Schraven B. Bliska J.B. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Three hours prior to infection the cells were incubated in tissue culture medium containing 100 μm ATA. The cells were infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis as described (35Black D.S. Marie-Cardine A. Schraven B. Bliska J.B. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for 1 h in the presence of 100 μm ATA. Protein dephosphorylation was assayed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting as described (35Black D.S. Marie-Cardine A. Schraven B. Bliska J.B. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As noted in the Introduction, Y. pestis is an emerging public health threat and a potential weapon in biological warfare and bioterrorism. Because the YopH phosphatase activity is essential for virulence in the Yersinia pathogen, small molecule inhibitors of YopH may constitute a novel family of anti-plague agents. Moreover, inhibition of YopH may also widen the time window in which treatment for the plague with broad-spectrum antibiotics would be effective. However, few potent and selective YopH inhibitors are described. Some of the YopH inhibitors that have been identified to date, such as vanadate and suramin, tend to exhibit broad activity against a multitude of mammalian PTP targets (36Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently, several divalent and trivalent α-ketocarboxylic acids and 4-(carboxymethyloxy) phenylalanine containing tripeptides have been discovered that exhibit low micromolar affinity toward YopH (37Chen Y.T. Seto C T. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3946-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Lee K Gao Y. Yao Z.-J. Phan J. Wu L. Liang J. Waugh D. Zhang Z.-Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these compounds also inhibit the mammalian PTP1B with similar potency. The goal of this study was to identify potent low molecular weight compounds that can specifically inhibit YopH without affecting host PTPs and block the cellular intoxication by YopH. The active site-directed phosphotyrosine (pTyr) provides key elements for PTP substrate recognition (39Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 40Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. McNamara D. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 42Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 43Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, a common approach for PTP inhibitor design is to develop nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates that contain both a phosphate mimic that substitutes the phosphoryl group and an aromatic scaffold that can occupy the active site pocket in a manner reminiscent of the aromatic ring in pTyr (44Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 45Zhang Z.-Y. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Handbook of Cellular Signaling. Academic Press, New York2003: 677-684Google Scholar). Due to the conserved nature of the pTyr-binding pocket, nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates usually do not display strong selectivity against different PTPs. However, inhibitor potency and selectivity can be achieved by linking the nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetic with an appropriate structural element to target both the active site and a unique adjacent site (46Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Because the YopH catalytic domain shares only 20–30% sequence identity with the mammalian PTPs (47Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it seems quite feasible to acquire YopH specific inhibitors. Indeed, we have recently identified a specific YopH small molecule inhibitor, p-nitrocatechol sulfate, which exhibits a Ki of 25 μm for YopH and displays a 13–60 fold selectivity in favor of YopH against a panel of mammalian PTPs (48Sun J.-P. Wu L. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33392-33399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the modest potency and in vivo instability of the sulfate ester of p-nitrocatechol sulfate limit its further biological evaluation. Identification of YopH Inhibitors from a Carboxylic Acid Library—As a continued effort to search for potent and selective small molecule inhibitors for YopH, we screened a library of 720 structurally diverse commercially available carboxylic acids that differ by molecular weight, charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, and sterics. Our rationale for employing a carboxylic acid library was based on the fact that the majority of the reported nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates contain at least one carboxyl group (45Zhang Z.-Y. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Handbook of Cellular Signaling. Academic Press, New York2003: 677-684Google Scholar). The ability of the library members to inhibit the YopH-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was assessed at 30 °C in pH 7.0 buffer containing 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by addition of NaCl (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Out of the 720 carboxylic acids, 26 compounds displayed measurable inhibition of the YopH-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis at 100 μm concentration. They were selected for further characterization. For each compound, the inhibitory efficacy as determined by the IC50 value was measured at a pNPP concentration fixed at the experimentally determined Km for YopH (2.0 mm). Table I lists the structures of the 26 carboxylic acids together with their associated IC50 values for the YopH-catalyzed reaction. As shown in Table I, the hits that were generated against YopH cover a diverse structural space. In addition, the IC50 values for the hits span several orders of magnitude.Table IStructures and IC50 values of carboxylic acid inhibitors of YopH We have also screened the library with several mammalian PTPs. Several compounds, including 2-fluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid, trans-4-methyl-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, and diiodofluorescein, inhibit YopH, HePTP, PTP1B, and CD45 to a similar extent at 100 μm concentration (data not shown). By contrast, many others, including 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid, (S)-(–)-indoline-2-carboxylic acid, 9-fluorenone-1-carboxylic acid, 3,7-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, show no measurable inhibitory activity against HePTP, PTP1B, and CD45 at 100 μm. In addition, 3,5-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), 4,4′-bis(3-carboxy-4-chloroanilino)tritylchloride, lithocholic acid, Chrome Azurol S, and Mordant Orange 1 display at least several-fold selectivity in favor of YopH. Remarkably, ATA inhibits YopH with an IC50 of 10 nm, which makes it the most potent and selective YopH inhibitor identified to date. Novel Nonhydrolyzable pTyr Mimetics—The active sites of PTPs are highly conserved. In the pTyr-bound form of PTP1B, the terminal non-bridge phosphate oxygens of pTyr form an extensive array of hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens of the PTP signature motif (residues 215–221) and the guanidinium side-chain of Arg-221. The phenyl ring of the pTyr is engaged in hydrophobic interactions with the active site cavity, formed by the nonpolar side-chains of Val-49, Ala-217, Ile-219, and Gln-262, and the aryl side-chains of Tyr-46 and Phe-182, which sandwich the pTyr ring and delineate the boundaries of the pTyr-binding pocket (42Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Given the structural similarity of aryl sulfate/sulfonate/phosphonate moieties to pTyr, they are commonly used as nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetics (44Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, a variety of carboxylic acid containing compounds, such as O-malonyltyrosine, cinnamic acid, 3-carboxy-4-(O-carboxymethyl) tyrosine, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(oxalylamino)-benzoic acid, 5-carboxy-2-naphthoic acid, and α-ketocarboxylic acid, are also capable of serving as nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates (45Zhang Z.-Y.

Thus, precise control of DGK activity is essential for proper signal transduction. We demonstrated previously that a peptide corresponding to the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation site domain (PSD) in DGKζ was phosphorylated in vitro by an active fragment of protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we tested full-length DGKζ and found that PKCα phosphorylated DGKζ on serines within the MARCKS PSD in vitro and in vivo. DGKζ also coimmunoprecipitated with PKCα, suggesting that they reside in a regulated signaling complex. We then tested whether phosphorylation affected DAG kinase activity. We found that a mutant (DGKζ S/D) in which serines within the MARCKS PSD were altered to aspartates (to mimic phosphorylation) had lower activity compared with wild-type DGKζ or a control mutant (DGKζ S/N) in which the same serines were changed to asparagines. Furthermore, activation of PKCα by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited the activity of wild-type DGKζ, but not DGKζ S/D, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results suggest that by phosphorylating the MARCKS PSD, PKCα attenuates DGKζ activity. Supporting this, we found that cells expressing DGKζ S/D had higher DAG levels and grew more rapidly compared with cells expressing DGKζ S/N that could not be phosphorylated. Taken together, these results indicate that PKCα phosphorylates DGKζ in cells, and this phosphorylation inhibits its kinase activity to remove cellular DAG, thereby affecting cell growth.

Bae S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores (2Keizer J. Li Y.X. Stojilkovic S. Rinzel J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas DAG is an allosteric activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). PKC is not the only protein activated by DAG; several other proteins, such as Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP), the chimaerins, Unc-13, and protein kinase D, can bind and are activated by DAG (4Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 5Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, DAG participates in a broad array of cellular responses through the activation of PKC and other proteins. One of the major routes for terminating DAG signaling is by its phosphorylation, catalyzed by diacylglycerol kinases (DGK), producing phosphatidic acid (PA) (6Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PA also has signaling functions (9Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, PA can modulate the activity of several enzymes including phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, NADPH oxidase, and Ras GTPase activating protein. Also, it has a role in actin polymerization and vesicle transport (8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 10Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, DGK activity terminates DAG signaling, consequently reducing the activity of proteins dependent on DAG signaling. It is also possible that DGK activity may serve as a source of PA that subsequently functions as a signal. Given its critical role in balancing cellular levels of these two signaling lipids, DAG and PA, it is not surprising that regulation of DGK is vital for appropriate signal transduction. To date, nine mammalian DGK isoforms have been identified, and they are divided into five types which are based on common structural motifs (7van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These DGKs contain a conserved catalytic domain and at least two cysteine-rich C1 domains. Most DGKs have unique motifs that likely play regulatory roles. For example, type I DGKs have calcium-binding EF-hand motifs; type II and type V DGKs contain a pleckstrin homology domain which may be responsible for phosphatidylinositol binding. Type IV DGKs have four ankyrin repeats at their C termini, which likely facilitate structural and regulatory protein-protein interactions. The structural diversity, together with the diverse tissue distribution (8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), suggests that each DGK isoform has a unique cellular function and is regulated in a distinct way. DGKζ (type IV DGK) has a motif similar to the phosphorylation site domain (PSD) of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein (11Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the MARCKS protein, the PSD is phosphorylated by PKC (13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported previously that a peptide corresponding to the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ was phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and that mutation of a serine residue in this peptide significantly reduced its phosphorylation. One functional consequence of this phosphorylation was the exclusion of DGKζ from the nucleus, which altered nuclear DAG accumulation (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the present study, we considered the possibility that phosphorylation of the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ may have other effects. Here, we demonstrate that the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ is phosphorylated by PKCα in vitro and in vivo. The consequence of this phosphorylation is the reduction of its DAG kinase activity, thus attenuating its ability to remove cellular DAG. In addition, cells expressing a mutant DGKζ that mimics the phosphorylated enzyme had higher DAG levels and proliferated faster than cells that expressed a mutant DGKζ that could not be phosphorylated. Together, these data suggest that PKCα phosphorylates DGKζ to inhibit its DAG kinase activity, which alters DAG signaling and affects downstream events such as cell proliferation.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PKCα was subcloned into the pcDNA3/Amp plasmid (Invitrogen). The PLCγ1 construct was a gift from Dr. Sue Goo Rhee (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were stimulated with PMA (90 nm) or vehicle for 30 min. Where indicated, Gö 6983 (500 nm) was added for 10 min before PMA stimulation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293 cells were transfected with DGKζ-FLAG, DGKζ S/N-FLAG, or DGKζ S/D-FLAG. After 48 h, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), allowed to lyse for 20 min on ice, and then centrifuged to remove debris. Cleared lysates were incubated with 25 μl of monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation for5sat 10,600 × g, the beads were washed with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) three times. The immunoprecipitates were then used for SDS-PAGE. For immunoaffinity purification of recombinant DGKζ, the immunoprecipitated DGKζ-FLAG proteins were eluted from beads by competition with 100 μlof3× FLAG peptide (150 ng/μl) for 30 min. Coomassie Blue staining showed that the purity of DGKζ proteins was more than 95%. PKCα, PLCγ1, and DGKζ were detected by using antibodies specific to each protein (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous DGKζ from rat brain extracts was performed as described previously (16Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—In vitro PKC kinase assays were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 1 mm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Purified recombinant DGKζ protein (0.5 μg) was incubated with 0.1 μg of purified recombinant PKCα in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitor (Gö 6983, 500 nm) in a total volume of 25 μl. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The DGK kinase assays were performed as described previously by using lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with DGKζ (12Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycerol was used as the substrate. The reaction was carried out for 10 min in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Lipids were extracted and separated by TLC, and PA was visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo 32P Labeling Experiments—HEK293 cells seeded in 60-mm plates were transfected with PKCα and DGKζ-FLAG (1.5 μg of each plasmid). After 36 h, the cells were serum-starved overnight and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.15 mCi) in phosphate-free DMEM for 2 h. After PMA (90 nm) treatment for 30 min, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Where indicated, Gö 6983 (500 nm) was added for 10 min before PMA stimulation. DGKζ-FLAG proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel. The immunocomplexes were then washed three times with wash buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Phosphorylated DGKζ proteins were detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager. DAG Assay—HEK293 cells transfected with DGKζ constructs were stimulated with thrombin (2 units/ml) or vehicle for 5 min in 60-mm plates and then collected in 2 ml of methanol. Lipid extractions were done as described (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). DAG levels were determined by using the DAG assay system, and phosphate levels were also determined from the lipid extracts (17Whatley R.E. Stroud E.D. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16130-16138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XTT Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with DGKζ constructs or vector for 24 h and then suspended and seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 96-well microplates. 24 h later, cells were incubated with XTT labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h and assayed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 492 nm. PKCα Phosphorylates DGKζ in Vitro and in Vivo—Data from our laboratory previously demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ was phosphorylated by PKC (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that full-length DGKζ can be phosphorylated by PKCα, we incubated purified recombinant DGKζ with PKCα in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and detected phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1A). As expected, we found that PKCα could autophosphorylate in these conditions (18Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 19Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We also observed that DGKζ could not autophosphorylate, but incubation of DGKζ with PKCα resulted in phosphorylation of DGKζ, which was significantly reduced in the presence of a PKC inhibitor, Gö 6983. Together, these results demonstrate that PKCα can phosphorylate DGKζ in vitro. To verify that phosphorylation occurs in vivo, we labeled with [32P]orthophosphate HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with DGKζ-FLAG and PKCα. In these experimental conditions, we found that DGKζ was phosphorylated in the basal state; the addition of PMA, a potent PKCα activator, caused a significant increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). A PKC inhibitor, Gö 6983, dramatically attenuated PMA-induced phosphorylation, demonstrating that DGKζ is phosphorylated by PKCα in vivo. The MARCKS PSD in DGKζ Is the Predominant Site of PKCα Phosphorylation—The MARCKS PSD in DGKζ contains several potential PKC phosphorylation sites (12Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We tested whether serine residues within the MARCKS PSD were phosphorylated by PKCα by examining in vitro phosphorylation of a mutant DGKζ in which all four serines in the MARCKS PSD were changed to asparagines (DGKζ S/N). As shown in Fig. 2A, both wild-type and mutant DGKζ were phosphorylated by PKCα in these experiments, but mutation of the serines to asparagines led to a 71% reduction in phosphorylation. Next we monitored 32P incorporation into DGKζ S/N in transfected HEK293 cells and found that changing the serines within the MARCKS PSD to asparagines dramatically reduced (∼55%) 32P incorporation into DGKζ after the addition of PMA (Fig. 2B). We also observed a similar reduction in phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo using another mutant, DGKζ S/D, in which the same four serines were mutated to aspartates (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the serine residues in the MARCKS PSD are the predominant PKCα phosphorylation sites. However, the remaining weak phosphorylation associated with the DGKζ mutants suggests that there are additional phosphorylation sites outside of the MARCKS motif. DGKζ Associates with PKCα and PLCγ1—Accumulating evidence suggests that targeting of protein kinases to distinct subcellular compartments ensures specificity of signal transduction by dictating which substrates are phosphorylated (20Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 21Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Given the large number of proteins that have consensus sequences for PKC phosphorylation, targeting of PKC to the close proximity of its proper substrates ensures that it phosphorylates them and prevents inappropriate phosphorylation of other proteins. To confirm that DGKζ is a physiologic substrate for PKCα, we investigated whether PKCα interacted with DGKζ in vivo. Rat brain extracts were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous DGKζ with an antibody against DGKζ, and coprecipitation of PKCα was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). In these experiments, we found that endogenous PKCα clearly coimmunoprecipitated with DGKζ, whereas no PKCα was detected when a non-immune antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, PLCγ1, an enzyme responsible for generating signaling DAG, was also detected in the DGKζ immunoprecipitates. Next we investigated the ability of DGKζ to interact with PKCα and PLCγ1 in HEK293 cells overexpressing these proteins. Consistent with our results from rat brain extracts, PKCα and PLCγ1 coimmunoprecipitated with DGKζ and were not detected in controls (Fig. 3B). Demonstrating specificity of the interaction, we did not observe coimmunoprecipitation of DGKζ with other PKC isoforms, PKCδ and PKCϵ, in rat brain extracts or in transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that DGKζ and PKCα associate with the same signaling complex in vivo, and that PLCγ1 also associates with DGKζ and may generate the DAG that activates PKCα. PKCα Inhibits DGKζ Activity in Cells—In many cases, protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism to regulate enzyme activity (20Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that one functional consequence of PKC-mediated DGKζ phosphorylation was to regulate its nuclear localization (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that this phosphorylation may have other effects. To investigate whether PKCα affects the activity of DGKζ in vivo, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with DGKζ and PKCα and then measured DGK activity after PMA treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, PMA treatment caused a marked reduction (∼40%) in DGKζ activity, which was substantially reversed by pretreatment with a PKC inhibitor, Gö 6983, suggesting that PKC activation was responsible for the observed inhibition of DGKζ activity. Furthermore, we observed that activation of endogenous PKC by PMA inhibited endogenous DGKζ activity by about 30% in cells. These data indicate that PKCα inhibits DGKζ activity in cells. Our initial data showed that PMA activates PKCα, which leads to phosphorylation of DGKζ in vivo (Fig. 1B), raising the possibility that by phosphorylating DGKζ, PKCα inhibits its DAG kinase activity. To test this possibility more directly, we transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type DGKζ or DGKζ S/D, which was mutated to mimic phosphorylation of all four serines in the MARCKS PSD (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Swierczynski S.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13436-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and then measured DAG kinase activity in the cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 4B, lysates from cells overexpressing DGKζ had at least 10-fold higher DAG kinase activity than control cells, demonstrating that the majority of measured DAG kinase activity was from the transfected DGKζ. We found that DGKζ S/D had significantly lower activity (∼50%) compared with wild-type DGKζ in these experiments, even though its protein expression level was almost identical to wild-type DGKζ (data not shown). We also measured the activity of DGKζ S/N, in which the same serines of the MARCKS PSD were mutated to asparagines. This mutant is similar in structure to DGKζ S/D but does not contain negatively charged amino acids that mimic the properties of phosphoserine. DGKζ S/N had activity levels similar to wild-type DGKζ and much higher activity than DGKζ S/D. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a negative charge introduced by mutation (S/D) or phosphorylation of the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ attenuates its DAG kinase activity. To verify this observation, we examined the effect of PMA on the activity of DGKζ S/D. We reasoned that because PKCα could not phosphorylate the MARCKS PSD of DGKζ S/D, activation of PKCα should not inhibit its DAG kinase activity. As expected, PMA treatment did not affect the activity of DGKζ S/D (Fig. 4C). This finding provides strong evidence that PKCα negatively regulates DGKζ activity by phosphorylating its MARCKS PSD. Phosphorylation of DGKζ Affects Cellular DAG Levels and Cell Proliferation—To test for the physiologic consequence of phosphorylating DGKζ and the resulting reduction in its DAG kinase activity, we assessed whether this phosphorylation affected DAG levels in cells. In HEK293 cells treated with thrombin, cellular DAG rose ∼50% above basal levels in 5 min (data not shown). Transfection of DGKζ S/N or S/D mutants reduced cellular DAG in thrombin-stimulated cells compared with vector transfection (Fig. 5A). However, DGKζ S/N had a more prominent effect (∼60% reduction) compared with DGKζ S/D, which reduced DAG only by ∼30%. We also observed in unstimulated cells that DAG levels in DGKζ S/D-transfected cells were higher than those in DGKζ S/N-transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, phosphorylation of DGKζ attenuates its ability to metabolize signaling DAG in cells. DAG signaling has an important role in cell proliferation and the cell cycle (23Divecha N. Banfic H. Treagus J.E. Vann L. Irvine R.F. D'Santos C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Balciunaite E. Jones S. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We observed that phosphorylating DGKζ affected cellular DAG levels. Thus, we considered whether this phosphorylation affected cell proliferation. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of the DGKζ S/N or S/D mutants on the proliferation of HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, expression of DGKζ S/N significantly reduced cell proliferation (∼35%), which is consistent with our previous data showing that expression of DGKζ inhibited cell growth (14Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As expected, because of its reduced activity, expression of DGKζ S/D only modestly attenuated (∼10%) cell proliferation. Importantly, cells transfected with DGKζ S/D (which have higher DAG levels) had a higher rate (∼130%) of cell proliferation compared with cells transfected with DGKζ S/N (which have lower DAG levels). We also observed that kinase-inactive DGKζ did not affect cell proliferation (data not shown). Together, these data strongly support the contention that cellular DAG concentration, controlled by DGK activity, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and that regulation of DGKζ activity affects cellular DAG levels and, consequently, cell growth. DAG initiates a broad range of cellular responses by activating PKC isoforms and other proteins (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 5Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). DGKs attenuate this signaling by converting DAG to PA (6Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For proper DAG signaling to occur, DGK activity must be precisely controlled. However, relatively little is known about how the activity of DGK is regulated in cells. In this study, we demonstrate that PKCα phosphorylates DGKζ on the MARCKS PSD, and this phosphorylation inhibits DGKζ activity in transfected HEK293 cells. Confirming this, we found that mutating serines within the MARCKS PSD to aspartates (to mimic phosphorylation) (DGKζ S/D) reduced its DAG kinase activity and that this mutant could not attenuate cellular DAG as efficiently as a mutant (DGKζ S/N) that could not be phosphorylated. Consequently, cells expressing DGKζ S/D had a higher proliferation index than those expressing DGKζ S/N. Together, these data suggest a novel mechanism to regulate DAG signaling. PKCα, a downstream effector of DAG signaling, seems to modulate DAG accumulation by phosphorylating and negatively regulating DGKζ activity. Evidence indicates that protein kinases and their substrates often localize in close proximity rather than distribute in a widespread and random manner throughout the cell (21Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Directly interacting with their substrates provides protein kinases an important mechanism to avoid indiscriminate phosphorylation and ensures that only proper targets are phosphorylated (20Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 27Smith F.D. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R32-R40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In fact, many PKC substrates, such as adducin, GAP43, MARCKS, and MARCKS-related proteins, bind directly to PKCs (26Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 28Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12747-12753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DGK and PKC activity are often confined to the same subcellular locations such as the cytoskeleton (26Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 30van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that the pattern of tissue and cellular expression of PKCα closely paralleled that of DGKζ (data not shown) and that these two proteins could interact, suggesting that they reside in the same signaling complex. Combined with the fact that PKCα can phosphorylate DGKζ, these observations strongly suggest that DGKζ is a physiologic target of PKCα in cells. This idea is supported further by the fact that PLCγ1, an enzyme generating signaling DAG, is also associated with DGKζ, thus indicating that it may also reside in the PKCα-DGKζ complex. Indeed, PLC activity has been reported to associate with DGK in the cytoskeleton where PKC exists and participates in cytoskeletal remodeling (31Payrastre B. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Breton M. den Hartigh J.C. Plantavid M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15705-15709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Rojnuckarin P. Kaushansky K. Blood. 2001; 97: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would not be surprising that PKCα is in the proximity of its activator (PLC) and a substrate (DGKζ), restricting its activation and enhancing both its specificity and efficiency. Santos et al. (35Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of the MARCKS motif of rat DGKζ did not affect its activity. These results conflict with ours, perhaps because of differences in experimental design, including the source of DGKζ (human versus rat), the DAG kinase assay system, and the different cell types used for the experiments. The last point is important because differences in endogenous DGK activity and transfection efficiency may mask changes caused by phosphorylation of the transfected DGKζ. We found consistent and statistically significant reductions in DGKζ activity upon activation of PKCα. This inhibition could be reproduced by mutating the MARCKS PSD to mimic its phosphorylation. It is worth noting that DAG kinase activity is significantly reduced upon phosphorylation but is not abolished. DGKζ S/D had ∼50% of the activity of wild-type DGKζ. Most importantly, we found that cells expressing phosphorylation-mimicking DGKζ S/D had higher cellular DAG levels compared with cells expressing the mutant DGKζ S/N. Also, DAG levels in DGKζ S/D-transfected cells were higher than those in wild-type DGKζ-transfected cells (data not shown). Together, our data provide compelling evidence that phosphorylation of the MARCKS PSD reduces the activity of DGKζ and limits its ability to metabolize signaling DAG in cells. We recently demonstrated that DGKζ binds to PKCα and inhibits its activity by metabolizing DAG and that phosphorylation of the MARCKS PSD in DGKζ abolishes their interaction, relieving the inhibition of PKCα imposed by DGKζ (16Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This may allow prolonged activation of PKCα, which is essential for some cellular responses such as cell proliferation and differentiation (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 36Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of DGKζ also reduces its DAG kinase activity. Thus, phosphorylation of DGKζ has two roles. It terminates association with PKCα and reduces DAG kinase activity. Both consequences limit the ability of DGKζ to regulate PKCα, which may allow transient or even prolonged PKCα activation in cells. One consequence of this regulation may be to modulate cell growth. Indeed, Besson and Yong (37Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Balciunaite et al. (24Balciunaite E. Jones S. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PKC activity was an important component regulating cell proliferation and that a sustained increase in the cellular DAG and, consequently, PKC activity was required for cell cycle progression. Consistent with their data, we found that HEK293 cells expressing DGKζ S/D had higher DAG levels and a higher rate of proliferation compared with cells expressing DGKζ S/N. Our data suggest that by phosphorylating DGKζ, PKCα may modulate the duration of its own activation and, consequently, cell growth. In addition to activating PKC, DAG can activate other C1 domain-containing proteins (4Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 5Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, DAG binds to and activates Unc-13, a protein that is involved in neurotransmitter secretion (38Nurrish S. Segalat L. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that DGKζ also regulated the activity of RasGRP (15Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCα may have a role in regulating RasGRP through its effect on DGKζ. Additionally, because PA, the product of the DGK reaction, has numerous signaling functions (9Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), regulation of DGKζ by PKCα may affect PA-mediated cellular events as well. For example, indirect evidence suggests that DGK activity may participate in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, possibly by producing PA (8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Payrastre B. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Breton M. den Hartigh J.C. Plantavid M. Verkleij A.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that PKCα is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, in part by controlling DGKζ activity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that DGKζ is a physiologic substrate of PKCα. Phosphorylation by PKCα inhibits its DAG kinase activity, leading to an accumulation of DAG that consequently affects the proliferation rate of cells and likely other events as well. We thank Drs. Debra Regier and Mark Wade for many helpful discussions. We also thank Debra Regier, Ellen Wilson, and Diana Lim for help in the preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1990040492,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a highly reactive product generated by the myeloperoxidase reaction during the oxidative burst of activated neutrophils, which is implicated in many bactericidal and cytotoxic responses. Recent evidence suggests that HOCl may also play a role in the modulation of redox sensitive signaling pathways. The short half-life of HOCl and the requirement for a continuous presence of H2O2 as a substrate for its myeloperoxidase-catalyzed generation make the study of HOCl-mediated responses very difficult. We describe here an enzymatic model consisting of glucose/glucose oxidase, catalase, and myeloperoxidase (GOX/CAT/MPO) that allows the controlled generation of both HOCl and H2O2 and thus, mimics the oxidative burst of activated neutrophils. By employing this model we show that HOCl prevents the H2O2-mediated activation of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), a central post-transcriptional regulator of mammalian iron metabolism. Activated IRP1 binds to ®iron-responsive elements” (IREs) within the mRNAs encoding proteins of iron metabolism and thereby controls their translation or stability. The inhibitory effect of HOCl is not a result of a direct modification of IRP1 by this oxidant. Kinetics experiments provide evidence that HOCl intervenes with the signaling cascade, which results in the activation of IRP1. We further demonstrate that HOCl antagonizes the H2O2-mediated increase in the levels of transferrin receptor, which is a downstream target of IRP1. Our findings suggest that HOCl can modulate signaling pathways in a concerted action with H2O2. The GOX/CAT/MPO system provides a valuable tool for studying the regulatory function of HOCl.

Phagocytic cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, have an important function in the inflammatory response. Upon stimulation, they undergo an ®oxidative burst” resulting in the generation of large amounts of superoxide by a membrane associated NADPH oxidase, which is further metabolized to H2O2 by either spontaneously or by superoxide dismutases (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1988: 391-443Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide is mostly utilized by the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; GOX, glucose/glucose oxidase; CAT, catalase; IRE, iron responsive element; IRP, iron regulatory protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; TfR, transferrin receptor1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; GOX, glucose/glucose oxidase; CAT, catalase; IRE, iron responsive element; IRP, iron regulatory protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; TfR, transferrin receptor that is released from azurophilic granules upon neutrophil activation. Being activated, myeloperoxidase is able to oxidize Cl- to hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Approximately up to 70% of H2O2 is converted by myeloperoxidase (2Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everese K.M. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton of Florida1991: 1-35Google Scholar) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a highly reactive species with potent microbicidal and cytotoxic properties (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1988: 391-443Google Scholar). On the other hand, activated MPO oxidizes a wide variety of different substrates by abstracting only one electron under formation of radical products. These substrates include tyrosine, tryptophan, sulfhydryls, phenol, and indole derivatives, nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, xenobiotics, and others (3Burner U. Jantschko W. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Kettle A.J. Koppenol W.H. Obinger C. J. Biol.

While the generation of HOCl is of fundamental significance for combating infection, sustained levels of this oxidant are associated with side effects of inflammation, such as cell injury and tissue damage (6Eley D.W. Eley J.M. Korecky B. Fliss H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Schraufstatter I. Hyslop P.A. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin.

Recent studies demonstrate the presence of HOCl-modified proteins in inflammatory bowel disease (9McKenzie S.J. Baker M.S. Buffinton G.D. Doe W.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and in atherosclerotic plaques (10Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). HOCl is cell permeable and reacts readily with thiols, thioethers and amino groups (11Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 12Arnhold J. Hammerschmidt S. Wagner M. Mueller S. Arnold K. Grimm E. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1990; 49: 991-997PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of red cells or endothelial cells to HOCl results in an early decrease of the glutathione pool (13Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Vissers M.C. Carr A.C. Chapman A.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This suggests that HOCl could modulate cell processes in a manner similar to that seen with H2O2 or peroxynitrite. Most studies on cellular responses to HOCl have focused on the toxic nature of this oxidant (6Eley D.W. Eley J.M. Korecky B. Fliss H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Schraufstatter I. Hyslop P.A. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, regulatory functions of MPO and MPO-derived products have recently been identified. Cell-bound MPO rapidly transcytoses the intact endothelium and localizes at the basolateral site of the endothelium closely associated with interstitial matrix proteins such as fibronectin (15Baldus S. Eiserich J.P. Mani A. Castro L. Figueroa M. Chumley P. Ma W. Tousson A. White C.R. Bullard D.C. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Moore K.P. Freeman B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1759-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In inflammatory models, the immunoreactivity of MPO strongly colocalizes with the formation of nitrotyrosine in subendothelial and epithelial tissue regions (16Baldus S. Eiserich J.P. Brennan M.L. Jackson R.M. Alexander C.B. Freeman B.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, MPO impairs the NO-dependent blood vessel relaxation (17Eiserich J.P. Baldus S. Brennan M.L. Ma W. Zhang C. Tousson A. Castro L. Lusis A.J. Nauseef W.M. White C.R. Freeman B.A. Science. 2002; 296: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). MPO and especially HOCl are apparently involved in apoptosis induction (18Engelmann I. Dormann S. Saran M. Bauer G. Redox. Rep. 2000; 5: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Darby C.J. Burns C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22461-22469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). While HOCl prevents the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules at sublethal concentrations (20Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it has also been demonstrated to activate important regulatory molecules as the tumor supressor protein p53 (21Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and members of the MAP kinase pathway (22Midwinter R.G. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The lack of appropriate models for HOCl generation poses an obvious limitation for studying and understanding the signaling functions of this oxidant. The high reactivity of HOCl toward functional protein groups makes impossible to sustain steady-state nontoxic concentrations of the oxidant in cell culture media. In addition, the employment of myeloperoxidase for a physiologically relevant continuous release of HOCl requires sustained nontoxic levels of substrate (H2O2), which is extremely labile and gets rapidly metabolized by catalases and/or glutathione peroxidases. H2O2 itself has signaling functions and is involved in redox-sensitive regulatory pathways (23Reth M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells or tissues to H2O2 results in activation of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) (24Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 26Mueller S. Pantopoulos K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 29Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubic iron-sulfur cluster and functions as a cytosolic aconitase. In iron-starved cells, or cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO) or H2O2, the ironsulfur cluster is removed and IRP1 is activated for binding to mRNA ®iron-responsive elements” (IREs). IRE/IRP interactions in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) stabilize transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA against degradation. Conversely, IRE/IRP interactions in the 5′ UTR inhibit translation of ferritin (H- and L-) mRNAs. Thus, the IRE/IRP system accounts for the coordinate regulation of TfR and ferritin expression, key proteins involved in cellular iron uptake and storage, respectively, but also of other proteins of iron and energy metabolism (24Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 26Mueller S.

While iron chelators promote a slow (>4 h) response, H2O2 activates IRP1 within 30 min. The mechanism does not involve a direct attack of the iron-sulfur cluster by H2O2, and a mere increase in intracellular H2O2 levels is not sufficient to activate IRP1 (27Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It appears that extracellular H2O2, but not H2O2 released from the mitochondrial or peroxisomal compartments, elicits a signaling cascade, which ultimately leads to IRP1 activation. The oxidative stress-mediated activation of IRP1 is associated with an increase in iron uptake via the TfR (30Caltagirone A. Weiss G. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 22Google Scholar). The well-established role of iron and H2O2 in tissue injury (31Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar), based on Fenton chemistry, e.g. the iron-catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 to aggressive hydroxyl radicals, suggests that this response may have important pathophysiological implications. This is particularly relevant in inflammation, where cytotoxic immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species. As extracellular H2O2 poses an efficient and rapid activating signal for IRP1, much attention has been drawn to inflammatory cells like neutrophils, which represent a major source of extracellular oxidative stress during their respiratory burst (32Baggiolini M. Theian M. Sies H. Oxidative stress: oxidants and antioxidants. Harcourt Braze Jovanovich, London1991Google Scholar). In stimulated neutrophils the release of H2O2 can increase by a factor of 10 and reach micromolar concentrations (26Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hubner C.A. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23192-23196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our recent findings on IRP1 activation by H2O2, the importance of both H2O2 and HOCl in the context of inflammation and the potential of both molecules to be involved in cytotoxic and signaling activities, prompted us to establish a model for quantitative HOCl generation and study the role of respiratory burst products in iron homeostasis.

Chem. 1966; 70: 2798-3806Crossref Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and ϵ230 = 74 liter mol-1 cm-1 (34Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for NaOCl and H2O2, respectively). For cell experiments with NaOCl, a Hanks' buffer (HBSS) was used: pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1.47 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2 Cell Culture—Murine B6 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Exposure of Cells to HOCl—NaOCl was diluted in HBSS immediately before addition to the cells. NaOCl solutions contain about equimolar concentrations of HOCl and OCl- (pK a = 7.5) at pH 7.4 and can be applied as sources of HOCl. Unless otherwise indicated, all cell experiments were performed in 10-cm culture dishes (Fa. Greiner, Germany) with a cell density of 8 × 106 cells/dish corresponding to 960 μg of protein (confluence ∼80%); prediluted HOCl was then added in a total volume of 8 ml HBSS. HOCl was rapidly consumed on addition to the cells with a half-time of less than 1 min, as reported earlier (35Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HBSS was demonstrated to modulate TfR expression when exposed longer than 1 h and longer incubation of cells with HBSS affected cell viability (60% survived 8 h). Exposure times to HBSS were kept below 60 min. In 24-hour experiments to study TfR expression, HBSS was replaced by cell culture medium after the 60-min incubation period. In the pulse-chase experiments, cells were only exposed for 5 min to HBSS and NaOCl at varying time points as indicated. Cell lysates were treated with HOCl in a total volume of 60 μl. The addition of HOCl was at room temperature; subsequent incubations were at 37 °C. Determination of Catalase and GOX Activity—Actual activities of GOX, catalase, and MPO were determined at very low H2O2 concentrations prior to the experiment using a sensitive chemiluminescence technique (36Mueller S. Riedel D.H. Stremmel W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Mueller S. Riedel H.D. Stremmel W. Blood. 1997; 90: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of both enzymes were mixed in HBSS with 5 mm glucose to yield low H2O2 concentrations. Continuous measurements on culture supernatants confirmed the maintenance of steady-state concentrations of H2O2 during the experiments (38Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Determination of MPO Activity—The enzymatic activity of MPO was determined by measuring the H2O2 degradation as previously described for catalase activity (36Mueller S. Riedel D.H. Stremmel W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, 450 μl of HBSS containing known concentrations of H2O2 were mixed with luminol. After addition of 50 μl of MPO, MPO-mediated H2O2 decay was measured by addition of NaOCl in intervals of 10 s. Prior to the NaOCl injection, the so-called luminol-dependent chemiluminescence by luminol, and MPO was measured and subtracted. The zero order decay of H2O2 at high H2O2 concentrations was described as k 1MPO. At low H2O2 concentrations, an exponential decay of H2O2 was observed, described herein as k 2MPO and found to be 31 s-1(stock solution). The rate constants k 1MPO and k 2MPO for H2O2 decomposition by MPO were obtained by using linear fit software (Microcal Origin 6.0, Microcal Software Inc.). To better compare our results with those reported in the literature, MPO activity was also determined by means of the conventional guaiacol assay (39Capeillere-Blandin C. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Chance B. Maehly A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 764-775Crossref Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). The standard molar activity of MPO was defined reaction mix of 10 μm H2O2, 88.7 mm guaiacol, and 10 nm MPO in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The oxidation of guaiacol was followed spectrophotometrically at 470 nm. An activity k 1MPO of 15 ± 0.8 μm s-1 was obtained for the MPO stock concentration that corresponded very well with 18 μm s-1 as determined with the luminol/NaOCl technique. Determination of MPO-derived Oxidants in the GOX/CAT/MPO System—MPO-derived oxidants were detected in real-time using the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (41Dahlgren C. Stendahl O. Inf. Immun. 1983; 39: 736-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Albrecht D. Jungi T.W. J. Leuk. Biol. 1993; 54: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although this assay does not allow for specific HOCl determination but also detects unspecific one electron transitions by the MPO compound I (43Misra H.P. Squatrito P.M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 44Nakamura M. Nakamura S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is very sensitive in demonstrating the enzymatic activity of the MPO in real time. Final concentrations of luminol were 5 × 10-5m. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as described recently using a radiolabeled human ferritin H-chain IRE probe (45Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RNA-protein complex formation was quantified by densitometric scanning of the depicted autoradiographs. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed directly in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer and lysates immediately boiled for 10 min. Equal aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose filters. The blots were saturated with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with TfR (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. Dilutions for antibodies were 1:4000 (TfR) and 1:500 (β-actin). After a wash with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the blots with TfR monoclonal antibodies were further incubated with rabbit antimouse IgG (1:6000 dilution). The blots with β-actin antibodies were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution). Detection of the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies was performed with the ECL® method (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were quantified by densitometric scanning using the TotalLab software version 1.11 (Nonlinear Dynamics Inc.). Cytotoxicity Studies—Cell viability was determined with the MTT assay. Briefly, the tetrazolium salt (MTT) is converted into a blue formazan product that is detected using a 96-well plate reader at 570 nm. The kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A Titrated Mixture of GOX/CAT/MPO Allows the Continuous Generation of HOCl at Physiologically Relevant Concentrations—A treatment of cultured cells with a single bolus of HOCl does not mimic in vivo conditions of HOCl release by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. On the other hand, the employment of MPO for generation of HOCl requires the continuous presence of H2O2 that may itself regulate redox-sensitive pathways. No system allowing the controlled and independent generation of HOCl and H2O2 has been described thus far. We have recently shown that a mixture of glucose/glucose oxidase titrated with catalase (GOX/CAT) generates stable H2O2 steady-state concentrations over hours (38Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 46Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Stremmel W. Hastings J.W. Kricka L.J. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Baffins Lane, Chichester, Sussex1997: 338-341Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows real-time H2O2 measurements at very low H2O2 concentrations for GOX (a), CAT (b), and MPO (c). The specific kinetic patterns are visualized using linear as well as semilogarithmic plots. In the GOX/CAT system, the stability of the equilibrium is based on the specific kinetics of these enzymes: While GOX generates H2O2 under saturating conditions at pseudo zero order rate (Fig. 1a), catalase is not saturated by its substrate H2O2 up to molar concentrations, and H2O2 decay follows an exponential pattern (Fig. 1b). As a consequence, at a given GOX concentration, H2O2 is formed at a constant rate. In the presence of catalase, the concentration of H2O2 reaches steady-state levels when the rate of its degradation by catalase equals the rate of its production by GOX. GOX has already earlier been used as H2O2 source for MPO (18Engelmann I. Dormann S. Saran M. Bauer G. Redox. Rep. 2000; 5: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Darby C.J. Burns C.P. J. Biol.

Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch Biochem.

However, in these reports the concentration and generation rate of H2O2 was not characterized. Aimed at developing a system for the controlled generation of H2O2 and HOCl, we first set up experiments to study the removal of H2O2 by MPO. Direct and real-time measurement of MPO-mediated H2O2 degradation reveal two different phases (Fig. 1c). At H2O2 concentrations above 5 μm, the enzyme is saturated and degradation rate is independent of substrate, following a zero order decay. At H2O2 concentrations below 0.5 μm, and similar to catalase, the degradation rate linearly depends on substrate. In conclusion, no stable H2O2 steady state can be formed by simply mixing MPO and GOX when substrate concentrations exceed 0.5 μm. To establish controlled conditions for H2O2 generation and degradation, in order to reach steady-state concentrations, the addition of catalase is necessary. In such a triple enzyme system (GOX/CAT/MPO) glucose/glucose oxidase and catalase are mainly responsible for maintaining stable H2O2 concentrations in a wide concentration range, while myeloperoxidase controls the rate of HOCl formation. The formation of the H2O2 equilibrium for the GOX/CAT-system in the presence or absence of myeloperoxidase is illustrated in Fig. 2a. The steady state is reached within 10 min and can be maintained over several hours, regardless of the presence of myeloperoxidase. Fig. 2b demonstrates the real-time generation of MPO-derived oxidants (mainly HOCl) by the GOX/CAT/MPO system using the unspecific luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (41Dahlgren C. Stendahl O. Inf. Immun. 1983; 39: 736-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the amount of GOX remains constant, H2O2 generation rate and oxygen consumption are similar in the presence or absence of myeloperoxidase. Consequently, the GOX/CAT/MPO system represents a first experimental model that mimics the release of HOCl and H2O2 by activated neutrophils during inflammation. Establishment of Nontoxic Conditions for HOCl and H 2 O 2 Release by the GOX/CAT/MPO System—The primary focus of this study is to investigate the regulatory functions of HOCl. This requires to establish conditions where HOCl is continuously generated at relatively low, nontoxic and physiologically relevant concentrations. Due to the high reactivity of HOCl toward functional groups present in media, serum, and cells, all treatments of cells with HOCl were carried out in serum-free Hanks' buffer. To determine the cytotoxicity threshold for H2O2 and NaOCl, we utilized B6 mouse fibroblasts. H2O2 and NaOCl were administered to the cells independently, either as a single bolus, or at steady state/flux conditions by using the GOX/CAT or the GOX/MPO/CAT system, respectively. Table I shows the LD50 for bolus administration of H2O2 and NaOCl and Table II indicates the survival of B6 fibroblasts in the GOX/CAT/MPO system under various conditions. Exposure of B6 cells to a bolus of HOCl or H2O2 resulted in dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity as reflected in the MTT assay. Under these conditions, HOCl concentrations below 100 μm were nontoxic. Virtually no cell survived exposure to HOCl concentrations >1 mm, corresponding to LD50 for NaOCl of 450 μm (Table I). Similarly, the LD50 for H2O2 was estimated to be 150 μm.Table ICytotoxicity of bolus NaOCl versus H2O2 in cultured B6 fibroblasts w/o HBSSConditionsH2O2 LD50NaOCl LD50μMμM24 h DMEM30020001 h HBSS - 23 h DMEM150450 Open table in a new tab Table IICytotoxicity of continuous H2O2 and HOCl generation with the GOX/CAT/MPO-system(1 h HBSS — 23 h DMEM)H2O2 ssHOCl fluxCumulative HOClGOXaGOX (+) = k GOX 3.4 × 10—8 M s—1,bGOX (++) = k GOX 3.4 × 10-7 M s—1CATcCAT (+), = k CAT 0.0034 s—1,dCAT (+++) = k CAT 0.034MPOeMPO (+) = k 1MPO 1.8 × 10—9 M s—1,fMPO (+++) = k 1MPO 3.4 × 10—8 M s—1SurvivalμMnM s—1μM%00100100++95102.810+++9010++++90125100++++15a GOX (+) = k GOX 3.4 × 10—8 M s—1b GOX (++) = k GOX 3.4 × 10-7 M s—1c CAT (+), = k CAT 0.0034 s—1d CAT (+++) = k CAT 0.034e MPO (+) = k 1MPO 1.8 × 10—9 M s—1f MPO (+++) = k 1MPO 3.4 × 10—8 M s—1 Open table in a new tab We found that upon continuous exposure of B6 fibroblasts to steady-"
https://openalex.org/W2050196094,"During lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs and instances of inflammatory trafficking, the rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium is mediated by transient interactions between L-selectin on leukocytes and several carbohydrate-modified ligands on the endothelium. Most L-selectin ligands such as CD34 and podocalyxin present sulfated carbohydrate structures (6-sulfated sialyl Lewis x or 6-sulfo-sLex) as a recognition determinant within their heavily glycosylated mucin domains. We recently identified endoglycan as a new member of the CD34 family. We report here that endoglycan, like the two other members of this family (CD34 and podocalyxin) can function as a L-selectin ligand. However, endoglycan employs a different binding mechanism, interacting with L-selectin through sulfation on two tyrosine residues and O-linked sLex structures that are presented within its highly acidic amino-terminal region. Our analysis establishes striking parallels with PSGL-1, a leukocyte ligand that interacts with all three selectins, mediating leukocyte-endothelial, leukocyte-leukocyte, and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Since the distribution of endoglycan includes hematopoietic precursors and leukocyte subpopulations, in addition to endothelial cells, our findings suggest several potential settings for endoglycan-mediated adhesion events."

We analyzed the potential of the cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase to synthesize P1 antigen, because Gb3/CD77 and P1 share a common structure, Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glc (NAc)–. L cell transfectants with Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNA expressed marginal levels of P1 on the cell surface but contained high levels of P1 in the cytoplasm. P2-type erythrocytes, which were serotyped as P2, also contained definite P1 antigen inside cells, although the amounts were lower than those of P1 cells. Only p erythrocytes lacked P1 antigen corresponding with function-losing mutations in the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene. Synthesis of P1 antigen from paragloboside in vitro was demonstrated using membrane fraction of the transfectants and a fusion enzyme with protein A. These results strongly suggested that P1 synthase is identical to Gb3/CD77 synthase and appear to propose a clue for the solution of the long-pending P1/P2/p puzzle.

Namely, Pk is globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) synthesized from lactosylceramide with the action of Gb3/CD77 synthase. Lack of Gb3 synthase results in p phenotype expressing neither Gb3 nor P (Gb4), because P is generated from Gb3 with Gb4 synthase (12Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In fact, multiple mutations in the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene leading to functional loss of the enzyme activity were identified in the individuals with p phenotype (9Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J.

On the other hand, P1/P2 (P1 negative) is the last glycolipid antigen system for which the genetic mechanisms has not yet been clarified, because the P1 synthase gene has not been isolated to date. P1 is a member of the neolacto-series glycosphingolipids with α1,4-linked galactose at the non-reducing end (14Naiki M. Fong J. Ledeen R. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Table I), sharing a very similar structure with Pk, Gb3/CD77 antigen. This similarity of the antigen structures between P1 and Gb3/CD77 suggests that a single α1,4-galactosyltransferase gene is responsible for the synthesis of both antigens. The P1/P2 polymorphism is linked to 22q11.3-ter (15McAlpine P.J. Kaita H. Lewis M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1978; 22: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene is assigned at 22q13.2, supporting the idea that these two synthases are identical or closely linked. However, the approximate frequencies of P1 and P2 are 80 and 20%, respectively, in Caucasians (16Landsteiner K. Levine P. Proc. Soc. Biol. Exp. Biol. N.

Actually, no relevant polymorphic sequences in the coding region of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene could be detected between P1 and P2 individuals, and no P1 synthase activity could be found in cell lysates transfected with a Gb3/CD77 synthase expression vector (8Kojima Y.

Consequently, it appears difficult to accept that P1 synthase and Gb3/CD77 synthase are identical.

Thus, the genetic basis of P1 synthesis has been clarified, whereas fine mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation need to be investigated. Materials—Anti-P1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) HIRO-59 (3D4) and anti-Gb4 mAb HIRO-34 (9H6) were established. 2M. Uchikawa, Y. Suzuki, T. Toyoda, and M. Satake, manuscript under preparation.

Albino (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. A stable transfectant of L cells (L-VTR) was established as described previously (9Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H.

Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of Gb3/CD77 and P1 was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described previously (22Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). mAbs 38.13 or HIRO-59 were used with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM or anti-human IgM (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH), respectively. Glycolipid Extraction—Glycolipids were extracted as described previously (23Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For TLC immunostaining, a neutral glycolipid fraction derived from 0.25 ml of each blood sample was spotted on each lane. TLC and TLC Immunostaining—TLC was performed on high performance TLC plates (Merck) using the solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8) and sprayed by orcinol. The identity of P1 was confirmed by TLC immunostaining using an aluminum-backed silica plate (Merck) as described previously (24Ishikawa D. Taki T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 157-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After TLC, the plate was heat-blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in 5% skim milk in PBS, the plate was incubated with mAb and then antibody binding was detected with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) combined with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glycosidase Treatment—A neutral glycolipid fraction from erythrocytes was treated with α- or β-galactosidases according to the methods described by Bailly et al. (25Bailly P. Chevaleyre J. Sondag D. Francois-Gerard C. Piquet Y. Vezon G. Carton J.-P. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with modification. Hydrolysis of neutral glycolipids was carried out with 0.05 units of α-galactosidase in 20 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mg/ml of γ-galactonolactone with or without 1% BSA. Hydrolysis was carried out with 0.1 unit of β-galactosidase in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, with or without 1% BSA, 2 mm EDTA. After incubation for 20 h at 37 °C with shaking, the products were isolated using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by TLC immunostaining using anti-P1 mAb. Then, the same membrane was immunostained using anti-Gb4 mAb HIRO-34. The intensity of the P1 bands was corrected with the intensity of the Gb4 bands using cricket graph software. Immunofluorescence Assay and Immunocytochemistry—For immunofluorescence assay, cells were plated in 60-well plates (Greiner) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. On the following day, cells were stained with mAbs and corresponding second antibodies as described in flow cytometry and observed under fluorescence microscopy (BX60; Olympus, Tokyo). For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated on cover glasses. On the following day, they were fixed with 90% acetone containing 10% PBS and then were stained with anti-P1 mAb HIRO-59 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgM. The staining pattern was observed using a μ Radiance® confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Treatment of Erythrocytes—Erythrocytes from P2- and p-type donors were washed with PBS and then treated with trypsin (0.25%) for 7 min at 37 °C, with papain (80 mg/ml) in 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.4, for 7 min, or with Pronase (10 μg/ml) in PBS containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. After treatment, they were washed twice and then used for flow cytometry as described above. Enzyme Assay—Gb3/CD77 synthase activity was measured as described previously (8Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of α1,4Gal-T to generate P1 structure was measured as described previously (26Bailly P. Piller F. Gillard B. Veyrieres A. Marcus D. Cartron J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 228: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions were prepared as described (8Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the assay contained the following in a volume of 50 μl: 0.2 mm UDP-Gal (Sigma), UDP-[14C]Gal (2.5 × 105 dpm) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2.5 μg of nLc4, 20 μm CDP-choline, and 100 μg of phosphatidylglycerol (Sigma), and after evaporation, 20 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 mm galactonolactone (Sigma), 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 250 μg of α-lactalbumin, and membrane fraction containing 100 μg of protein. The protein concentration was determined by the methods of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products was isolated by a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by TLC and autofluorography using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Reaction products was detected by TLC immunostaining using anti-P1 mAb. Construction and Generation of α1,4Gal-T Proteins Fused with Protein A—The putative catalytic domain of α1,4Gal-T was expressed as a secreted protein fused with protein A. DNA fragment encoding a C-terminal portion of α1,4Gal-T was amplified by PCR. The PCR was performed using 5′- and 3′-primer sequences flanked with EcoRI and XhoI sequences, respectively, forming a DNA fragment that codes 306 amino acids of α1,4Gal-T at the C′-terminal region. The primer sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGGAATTCCCCAAGGAGAAAGGGCAGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCTCGAGGCGGGCCCCTCACAAGTACA-3′. The amplified fragment was first TA-cloned using pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the insert DNA was excised by EcoRI and XhoI and was inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCDSA (kindly provided by S. Tsuji at Riken Institute, Wako, Japan). This plasmid, pProt/α1,4Gal-T, was transfected into L cells with the DEAE-dextran method (8Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the secreted fusion protein was collected and concentrated 20 times. Ten μl of the concentrated solution was used in the enzyme assay after dialysis as described above. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from human red blood cells (1 ml) prepared from healthy donors with their consent. cDNA was synthesized by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 3 μg of total RNA as a template. For PCR amplification, the sense primer 5′-TGGAAGTTCGGCGGCATCTA-3′ corresponding to nucleotides (nt) +550 to +569 (5′-CTGGACTCACAACTGCAGTT-3′; position +1 = A of ATG of α1,4Gal-T cDNA) downstream of the ATG codon and the antisense primer 5′-CAGGGGGCAGGGTGGTGACG-3′ corresponding to nucleotides +825 to +844 were used, and PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 24–39 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). For amplification of GAPDH cDNA, the sense primer 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′ were used. The reactions were performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min and then 24–36 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed in agarose gel and visualized using etidium bromide. The intensities of bands of products in RT-PCR were quantified by scanning the bands in pictures of gels using the public domain NIH Image program. Relative intensities of α1,4Gal-T gene amplified from P1- and P2-type erythrocytes were determined by comparing with the most intense band of P1-type individual and were plotted. For GAPDH, relative intensities of bands compared with the maximum in individual samples were determined and plotted. The cycle numbers of PCR with which band intensities reach 50% of the plateau were obtained from the graphs. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) Analysis—A modified RACE analysis was performed to clone gene-specific 5′-ends using the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human prostate sample was obtained with informed consent. First strand cDNAs were synthesized by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase from 0.7 μg of total RNA. oligo(dT) primer with two degenerate nucleotide positions at the 3′-end was used. Then, 5′-RACE was performed with primers consisting of a gene-specific primer and long or short 5′-primers as provided in the kit. The gene-specific antisense reverse transcription primer corresponding to nucleotides +71 to +95 (5′-AACGTGAACTTGAAGCCGATGATGA-3′; position +1 = A of ATG of α1,4Gal-T cDNA) (8Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used. The reactions were performed by the following conditions: five cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 3 min, five cycles of 93 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 3 min and then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. The amplified product was TA-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequence Analysis of the α1,4Gal-T Gene—Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers who had given informed consent. After isolation of mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation, genomic DNA was extracted with 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 500 μg of proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, overnight at 55 °C. After treatment with RNase and phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. About 2 kb upstream genomic region from the transcriptional start site of α1,4Gal-T gene was amplified by PCR using LA Taq (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Two sets of primers used are as follows: 1) 5′-primer, 5′-TCTCGATCTCCTGCCCTTGT-3′ (nt –1991 to –1972) and 3′-primer, 5′-CCCAAGCCAATGAGAAAATG-3′ (nt –804 to –785); 2) 5′-primer, 5′-AGCCTGTGATGGGAATGACC-3′ (nt –1075 to –1056) and 3′-primer, 5′-ACAAATGTCGCCTCCAGAAC-3′ (nt +180 to +199); position +1 = G of the first nucleotide of exon 1, which was determined as the transcription initiation site by 5′-RACE. Subsequently they were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy termination method using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Direct Sequence—The promoter region of α1,4Gal-T gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNAs extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells and PfuTurbo™ DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Two sets of primers used are as follows: 1) 5′-primer, 5′-GAGGTTCCATTTTCTCAGTG-3′ (nt –811 to –792) and 3′-primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCCAGTTATTTGC-3′ (nt –481 to –462); 2) 5′-primer, 5′-ATGGGGAAAACGGGATGGTA-3′ (nt –306 to –287) and 3′-primer, 5′-ACAAATGTCGCCTCCAGAAC-3′ (nt +180 to +199). PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified products were sequenced directly by the dideoxy termination method. For sequence of PCR products with primer set 1, another primer was used i.e. 3′-primer, 5′-TCCTGGTGCTTTTAGTTCTT-3′, corresponding to –687 to –668 to avoid the point with insertional mutation. Construction of Plasmids for Luciferase Assay—The upstream genomic region from the α1,4Gal-T gene transcriptional start site was amplified by PCR using PfuTurbo™ DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from genomic DNAs extracted from P1 and P2 peripheral mononuclear cells. Three sets of primers used are as follows: 1) 5′-primer, 5′-CCCTCGAGAGCCTGTGATGGGAATGACC-3′ (nt –1075 to –1056) and 3′-primer, 5′-CCAAGCTTTAGCTCCAGCGG-CGGCGGGC-3′ (nt +1 to +20); 2) 5′-primer, 5′-CCCTCGAGGAGGTT-CCATTTTCTCAGTG-3′ (nt –811 to –792) and 3′-primer, 5′-CCAAGCTT-ACAAATGTCGCCTCCAGAAC-3′ (nt +180 to +199); 3) 5′-primer, 5′-CCCTCGAGAGCCTGTGATGGGAATGACC-3′ (nt –1075 to –1056) and 3′-primer, 5′-CCAAGCTTACAAATGTCGCCTCCAGAAC-3′ (nt +180 to +199); position +1 = G of first nucleotide of exon 1, which was determined by 5′-RACE. PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 30 s, and then extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min. Subsequently PCR products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and inserts were sequenced for confirmation. Inserts were digested with XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes and cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Luciferase Assay for Promoter Activity—The Dual Luciferase™ reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to evaluate the promoter activity. Luciferase expression vectors described above were cotransfected with pRL-TK vector for normalization of transfection efficiency into NCC-IT cells using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and lysates were prepared to independently measure luciferase activity. The luciferase assay was performed using Pica Gene™ (Toyo Ink Corp., Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity was calculated. Statistical Analysis—Significance of the obtained luciferase activities was examined with Student's t test, taking the case of p < 0.05 as statistically significant. Expression of P1 Antigen on Gb3/CD77 Synthase Gene Transfectant Cells—L-VTR1 cells (transfectant cells with pMIKneo/VTR-1) expressed a high level of Gb3/CD77 antigen as expected (Fig. 1A, left). In these cells, P1 was also expressed, although the positive population was low (Fig. 1A, right). P1 Antigen Was Significantly Synthesized in Gb3/CD77 Gene Transfectant Cells—To analyze the presence of P1 antigen in the transfectant cells of Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNA, glycolipids were extracted from the parent L cells and from L-VTR and served for TLC immunostaining. L-VTR cells definitely showed a clear band stained with anti-P1 mAb as did the extracts from erythrocytes of P1-type individuals (Fig. 1B). P1 Antigen Was Present Mainly in Cytoplasm—To examine the localization of P1 antigen in the transfectant cells, immunocytostaining was performed for unfixed and fixed cells using anti-P1 mAb. In immunofluorescence assay, a few cells in the transfectants were stained, whereas L cells were completely negative (Fig. 1C, a and b). On the other hand, the majority of fixed L-VTR cells were clearly stained, and P1 antigen appeared to be localized more abundantly in cytoplasm rather than at the surface membrane (Fig. 1C, d). Expression of P1 Antigen in p/P1/P2 Group Erythrocytes— Serological analysis of P1 antigen expression on various erythrocytes was performed with flow cytometry. P1 erythrocytes showed fairly high levels of P1 expression, whereas P2 cells showed completely negative or marginal levels of P1 antigen (Fig. 2A). Erythrocytes from p individuals were also negative as expected. P1 Antigen in P2 Erythrocytes Is Cryptic—To analyze the crypticity of P1 antigen in erythrocytes, p and P2 erythrocytes were treated by three kind of proteases and then P1 antigen expression was analyzed by flow cytometry compared with untreated cells. Only P2 erythrocytes showed low levels of P1 antigen on the cell surface after treatment with papain or Pronase (Fig. 2B), suggesting that P2 erythrocytes contained cryptic P1 antigen, which might be masked with cell surface proteins. P2 Erythrocytes Contain P1 Antigen at Lower Levels Than P1 Erythrocytes—To examine the presence/absence of P1 antigen in p and P2 individuals, glycolipids of erythrocytes from two p donors, in whom function-losing mutations were found in the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene (13Furukawa K. Iwamura K. Uchikawa M. Sojka B.N. Wiels J. Okajima T. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37752-37756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and five P2 samples, as well as three P1 samples, were analyzed. In TLC, Gb3 and Gb4 were not found in the two p samples, whereas bands of lactosylceramide were increased in intensity as detected with orcinol (Fig. 3A). In TLC immunostaining, all five P2 individuals showed definite bands migrating at the same levels of the P1 bands detected in P1 individual erythrocytes with anti-P1 mAb (Fig. 2B). However, the intensity of the bands in P2 erythrocytes was generally weaker than that in P1 erythrocytes, suggesting the difference in the P1 quantity between P1 and P2 erythrocytes. Neutral glycolipids from p individuals showed no P1 band (Fig. 3B), confirming that p individuals really lack P1 antigen. The"
https://openalex.org/W2075568856,"The stromal processing peptidase (SPP) catalyzes removal of transit peptides from a diversity of precursor proteins imported into chloroplasts. SPP contains an HXXEH zinc-binding motif characteristic of members of the metallopeptidase family M16. We previously found that the three steps of precursor processing by SPP (i.e. transit peptide binding, removal, and conversion to a degradable subfragment) are mediated by features that reside in the C-terminal 10–15 residues of the transit peptide. In this study, we performed a mutational analysis of SPP to identify structural elements that determine its function. SPP loses the ability to proteolytically remove the transit peptide when residues of the HXXEH motif, found in an N-terminal region, are mutated. Deletion of 240 amino acids from its C terminus also abolishes activity. Interestingly, however, SPP can still carry out the initial binding step, recognizing the C-terminal residues of the transit peptide. Hence, transit peptide binding and removal are two separable steps of the overall processing reaction. Transit peptide conversion to a subfragment also depends on the HXXEH motif. The precursor of SPP, containing an unusually long transit peptide itself, is not proteolytically active. Thus, the SPP precursor is synthesized as a latent form of the metallopeptidase.

Chloroplast biogenesis and function depends on the import of a large diversity of proteins from the cytoplasm. These proteins are synthesized as precursors containing an N-terminal targeting signal, called the transit peptide, that mediates multiple steps in the import pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 1Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Chen K. Chen X.

Whereas the chloroplast is unique to the plant cell, the mitochondrion and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SPP, stromal processing peptidase; preFD, precursor of ferredoxin; preSPP, precursor of stromal processing peptidase; preRBCA, precursor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; RBCA, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase. are two other major eukaryotic organelles that depend on massive protein translocation mediated by N-terminal targeting signals. It has been predicted for Arabidopsis thaliana that up to 11,000 different precursor proteins may be targeted to these three organelles, ∼3,500 to the chloroplast alone (5Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7166) Google Scholar). Distinct properties of the targeting signals ensure organelle-specific sorting and translocation of the precursor proteins. Ultimately, highly specialized proteolytic enzymes that reside in each organelle remove the targeting signals (for a review, see Ref. 6Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have identified a general stromal processing peptidase (SPP) that removes transit peptides from an array of precursors involved in different biosynthetic pathways and destined for different chloroplast compartments (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The activity of SPP, which is a soluble, monomeric enzyme, depends on metal ions (8Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of a full-length SPP cDNA from pea revealed that the enzyme contains an HXXEH zinc-binding motif characteristic of members of the metallopeptidase family M16, such as pitrilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and the β-subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) (9Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 10VanderVere P.S. Bennett T.M. Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Conservation extends beyond the zinc-binding motif, where 25–30% identity is found in an N-terminal region of ∼200 residues of SPP. The residues of the HXXEH motif are predicted to be essential for the catalytic function of these metallopeptidases (9Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 11Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2537-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To verify the function of SPP in vivo, we demonstrated by the expression of an antisense gene for SPP in both transgenic tobacco and A. thaliana plants that not only is SPP essential in chloroplast biogenesis but also is required for normal plant development (12Wan J. Bringloe D. Lamppa G.K. Plant J. 1998; 15: 459-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Zhong R. Wan J. Jin R. Lamppa G.K. Plant J. 2003; 34: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of SPP in A. thaliana, containing only one SPP gene, yielded many lines that were seedling-lethal. In surviving plants, import of a recombinant precursor of the green fluorescent protein was defective, indicating a critical role for SPP in the general protein import pathway. To elucidate the mechanism of transit peptide removal, we used recombinant SPP in an affinity assay (14Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We found that SPP initially recognizes a precursor by binding to its transit peptide and then removes the transit peptide in a single endoproteolytic step. The mature protein is immediately released, whereas the transit peptide remains bound to SPP. SPP unexpectedly terminates this interaction by a second cleavage that converts the transit peptide to a subfragment form. Thus, SPP is regenerated for multiple rounds of processing of precursors that enter the stroma. These experiments indicate that SPP contains a high affinity binding site for the transit peptide, and additional proteolysis of the transit peptide produces a subfragment that is no longer recognized by the enzyme. Interestingly, we discovered that a chloroplast extract not only converts the transit peptide to the subfragment form but also rapidly degrades the subfragment by a novel proteolytic activity that is ATP- and metal ion-dependent. Previously, we investigated the functional organization of the transit peptide to identify determinants for the specific protein-protein interaction required for precursor recognition and cleavage by SPP (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Competition experiments using synthetic oligopeptides of the transit peptide of the ferredoxin precursor (preFD) showed that the C-terminal 12-mer of the transit peptide blocked binding, removal, and internal cleavage of the preFD transit peptide. Hence, this region alone is necessary to mediate each of the three steps catalyzed by SPP in a processing reaction that finally leads to the release of a degradable transit peptide subfragment (14Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we initiated a mutational analysis of SPP to identify structural determinants essential for its enzymatic function. We demonstrate that the HXXEH motif and the structural integrity of the entire SPP polypeptide are requirements for the proteolytic removal of the transit peptide, but they are not needed for the initial binding step. Moreover, these features of SPP are also determinants for the conversion of the transit peptide to the subfragment. Interestingly, the precursor of SPP (preSPP) exhibits a low affinity for the preFD transit peptide and does not carry out precursor cleavage, indicating that preSPP is a latent form of the enzyme. Preparation of Radioactive-labeled Substrates—The cDNA construct of the precursor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (preRBCA) from Spinacia oleracea (16Werneke J.M. Zielinski R.E. Ogren W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize radiolabeled [35S]Met preRBCA in vitro as described previously (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The [35S]Met preFD transit peptide was prepared according to an earlier protocol (14Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Synthetic Oligopeptides—The oligopeptides T-(1–24) (MASTLSTLSVSASLLPKQQPMVAS) and T-(25–48) (SLPTNMGQALFGLKAGSRGRVTAM), representing the N- and C-terminal halves of preFD transit peptide (17Smeekens S. van Binsbergen J. Weisbeek P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3179-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), respectively, were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University (New Haven, CT). The oligopeptide representing the human tumor necrosis factor-α fragment 46–65 (NQLVVPSEGLYLIYSQVLFK) was from Sigma (18Pennica D. Nedwin G.E. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Derynck R.

Preparation of SPP, SPP Mutants, and preSPP—A cDNA fragment encoding SPP from pea (Pisum sativum) (GenBank accession no. U25111) (10VanderVere P.S. Bennett T.M. Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector pBEX5BA (20Richter S. Hess W.R. Krause M. Messer W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to express active SPP N-terminally fused to a peptide tag that contains a biotin residue, which is naturally attached in Escherichia coli cells (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The SPP mutants E97Q and H94L were generated using the SPP expression vector construct as DNA template for a PCR-based mutagenesis method published previously (21Langer U. Richter S. Roth A. Weigel C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fragments encoding preSPP and the deletion mutants SPP-(1–574), SPP-(564–1115), and SPP-(1–874) were amplified by PCR from the SPP cDNA and inserted into pBEX5BA as described above. The site-directed mutations and fragment deletions were verified by sequencing. All fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli for preparation of soluble cell extracts as outlined previously (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Extracts were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, for 20 h at 4 °C. Relative amounts of biotinylated fusion proteins were compared using biotin blotting (see below) and adjusted by either diluting with 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, or concentrating using a centrifugal filter device (Centriplus; Millipore). Extracts were either directly tested for processing or incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) for immobilization of the fusion proteins, which were used in binding and conversion assays. Biotin Blotting—Biotinylated fusion proteins were separated by standard SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-PSQ; Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.1% SDS (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min, membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 for 60 min. Immobilized alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using an enhanced chemifluorescent substrate (ECF; Amersham Biosciences) for scanning with the STORM 860 PhosphorImaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Because each fusion protein molecule is labeled with only one biotin residue, quantification of the biotin blots with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) yields relative molar concentrations, which were used to adjust the amount of protein in each experiment and to normalize data from the binding assays. Precursor Processing Assay—Processing reactions were performed by combining 20 μl of soluble extract of E. coli cells expressing an SPP construct (wild type, mutant, and precursor) with 1 μl of [35S]Met preRBCA in a 25-μl total volume of 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete/EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Incubation was for 6 h at 24 °C. Samples were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE. Assays for Binding and Conversion of a Transit Peptide—The assays for binding and conversion of [35S]Met preFD transit peptide were carried out as described previously (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled peptide samples were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), and analyzed using the STORM 860 scanner coupled with ImageQuant software. Proteolytic Processing Requires Residues of the HXXEH Zinc-binding Motif—In earlier experiments, we demonstrated that steps of the processing reaction include binding and cleavage of the precursor followed by conversion of the transit peptide to a subfragment form (see Introduction). To identify structural elements in SPP that determine these steps, we initiated a mutation and deletion study of the enzyme. Mature SPP from pea consists of 1115 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 123,752. An N-terminal region, extending from amino acid 53 to 288, contains the signature zinc-binding motif HXXEH that is found in all members of the metallopeptidase family M16; thus, we refer to it as the M16 peptidase region (www.merops.ac.uk) (25Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of the HXXEH motif for the processing reaction, glutamic acid-97 and histidine-94 of SPP were replaced by glutamine (E97Q) and leucine (H94L), respectively (Fig. 1). Examination of the mutant sequences using the Network Protein Sequence Analysis program package predicts that each substitution will not alter local secondary structure (see web site: npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr) (26Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The processing activity of the mutants was tested using equal amounts of wild-type SPP, E97Q, and H94L (Fig. 2A) in a reaction with the radiolabeled substrate [35S]Met preRBCA. In earlier experiments using similar conditions, we have shown that SPP needs less than 20 min to complete processing of preRBCA (14Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither mutant generated detectable amounts of mature RBCA even after 6 h of incubation, which was in sharp contrast to wild-type SPP (Fig. 2B). Another precursor, preFD, was not processed by the SPP mutants either (data not shown). Thus, our findings verify that the residues of the HXXEH motif are essential for SPP activity, suggesting a critical role for the M16 peptidase region in precursor processing.Fig. 2Processing activity of SPP depends on the HXXEH motif. A, extracts (20 μl) containing biotinylated SPP, E97Q, and H94L were analyzed by biotin blotting (lanes 1–3). B, similar amounts of SPP, E97Q, and H94L were incubated with [35S]Met preRBCA (P) (lane S) and analyzed for production of mature [35S]Met RBCA (M) by standard SDS-PAGE (lanes 1–3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation of the HXXEH Motif Does Not Block Binding to the Transit Peptide—Binding of the transit peptide to SPP initiates the processing reaction. To test whether the inactive mutants still interact with the substrate, preparations of wild-type SPP, E97Q, and H94L were immobilized onto magnetic bead matrix and incubated with [35S]Met preFD transit peptide (see “Materials and Methods”). The assay was stopped after 2 min, before the conversion to the subfragment by wild-type SPP would occur (see Introduction). Surprisingly, examination of the matrix fractions demonstrated that both mutants still bind the intact transit peptide (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Quantification of an image of the binding experiment generated with a Phosphor-Imager (see Materials and Methods) indicated that wild-type SPP and E97Q bound similar amounts of transit peptide, and binding to H94L was reduced by only 10%. To test the specificity of the interaction, binding assays were carried out in presence of the synthesized oligopeptides T-(1–24) and T-(25–48), representing the N- and C-terminal halves of the preFD transit peptide, respectively (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Analysis of the bound fractions revealed that the two oligopeptides have a different effect on binding by the SPP mutants (Fig. 3B). The presence of the N-terminal half T-(1–24) did not change the amount of bound transit peptide, whereas, in striking contrast, a concentration of 10 μm of the C-terminal half T-(25–48) reduced binding to E97Q and H94L by 69 and 61%, respectively. In a control experiment, an unrelated oligopeptide, tumor necrosis factor-α-(46–65) (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), did not interfere with binding. We conclude that the SPP mutants retained a specific affinity for the C-terminal half of the transit peptide. Hence, the HXXEH motif is not involved in substrate recognition, although it is essential for peptide bond cleavage, indicating there are two separable steps in the reaction carried out by SPP. Conversion of the Transit Peptide to Its Subfragment Depends on the HXXEH Motif—The above results raised the question of whether an HXXEH-mutant could still convert the transit peptide to its subfragment form. Because the conversion reaction occurs after the removal of the transit peptide from the precursor, we investigated this question using a radiolabeled transit peptide as a substrate. A time course analysis with immobilized E97Q and the [35S]Met preFD transit peptide showed that the SPP mutant did not carry out the reaction (Fig. 4). Therefore, both functions of SPP, precursor cleavage and transit peptide conversion, depend on the HXXEH motif. Separation of the N- and C-terminal Halves of SPP Abolishes Precursor Processing Whereas the N-terminal Half Alone Retains an Affinity for the Transit Peptide—Alignment of the SPP sequences from pea and A. thaliana revealed an identical stretch of mostly acidic residues and prolines, EPIEPEPELE, between the highly conserved N- and C-terminal halves of the proteins (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The acidic, proline-rich stretch is predicted to be a flexible spacer often found to link functionally and structurally defined domains in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins (27Choo Y. Klug A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3341-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28de Chateau M. Bjorck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8490-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this region marks the transition between two functional domains within SPP, the N- and the C-terminal halves of SPP were expressed separately, yielding the constructs SPP-(1–574) and SPP-(564–1115), respectively (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a data base search of the genome of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 identified the open reading frame ALL1021 (29Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Wolk P.C. Kuritz T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Ishikawa A. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Tkazawa M. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) with significant similarities to SPP. ALL1021 is characterized by an N-terminal M16 peptidase region containing the HXXEH motif. Interestingly, in contrast to the other members of the M16 family with a sequence similarity restricted to the N-terminal region, SPP and ALL1021 also share 22% identity within 240 residues near their C termini. To examine whether this C-terminal region of SPP has a critical function in processing, a third construct, SPP-(1–874) (Fig. 1), was made by deleting the 240 residues from SPP. Using the in vitro processing assay, we found that none of the deletion mutant constructs cleaved [35S]Met preRBCA (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 2–4). We then tested whether the deletion of the C terminus in SPP-(1–574) and SPP-(1–874) could be complemented by the construct SPP-(564–1115), representing the C-terminal half of SPP. However, combining the constructs did not reconstitute processing activity (Fig. 5B, lane 5; not shown for SPP-(1–874) in combination with SPP-(564–1115)). Moreover, a test for conversion of the preFD transit peptide by these deletion constructs was negative as well (data not shown). We conclude that the intact SPP polypeptide is required to adopt an active conformation, which includes the C-terminal region with sequence similarity to the putative M16-type peptidase from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. We next examined the affinity of the three deletion mutant constructs for the [35S]Met preFD transit peptide in a binding assay (Fig. 5C). The two constructs containing the M16 peptidase region, SPP-(1–574) and SPP-(1–874), bound 35 and 32% of [35S]Met preFD transit peptide, respectively, compared with intact SPP. But binding by the C-terminal half, SPP-(564–1115), was reduced to ∼5%. Thus, the N-terminal half of SPP represented by SPP-(1–574) contains structural elements necessary for interaction with the transit peptide. However, the lower amount of transit peptide bound to SPP-(1–574) or SPP-(1–874) indicates that the N-terminal half, either alone or extended downstream by 300 amino acids, is not sufficient to constitute the fully functional substrate binding site present in intact SPP. PreSPP Is a Latent Form of the Metallopeptidase—The full-length SPP cDNA from pea encodes the precursor protein pre-SPP with an N-terminal region of 142 amino acids containing features characteristic of chloroplast transit peptides; i.e. it is enriched for the polar amino acids serine and threonine, the overall charge is basic, and 75% of the peptide is predicted to be devoid of regular secondary structure. We found previously that radiolabeled preSPP is imported into chloroplasts in vitro and processed by recombinant SPP in trans (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When cleavage of preSPP was carried out in the presence of oligopeptides corresponding to regions of the preFD transit peptide, our results indicated that the determinants for preSPP transit peptide removal reside within the C-terminal 10–15 residues preceding the cleavage site, a feature shared with other transit peptides (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the preSPP transit peptide is unusually long, and contains some additional features that might play a special role (see “Discussion”). Here we used a preSPP expression construct to test whether the transit peptide affects SPP activity (Fig. 1). Similar amounts of SPP and preSPP (Fig. 6A) were assayed for processing activity by incubation with [35S]Met preRBCA as described above. The analysis shows that preSPP cannot produce mature RBCA (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, a binding assay using the [35S]Met preFD transit peptide revealed that binding to preSPP is reduced to 14% compared with mature SPP (Fig. 6C). Hence, the transit peptide region of preSPP strongly reduces the ability of the enzyme to interact with the substrate and it completely blocks the cleavage reaction. In this study, we have analyzed SPP to identify determinants required for the post-translational removal of transit peptides from chloroplast precursors. Our previous work has shown that SPP interacts with a stretch of 10–15 amino acids at the C terminus of the transit peptide to cleave at a specific site and release the mature protein and produce a degradable transit peptide subfragment (see Introduction). In this study, mutant and deletion constructs have allowed us to gain insights into the role that certain features of SPP play during processing. Four important points emerge from our study. First, SPP depends on the HXXEH zinc-binding motif for catalytic activity, as we predicted based on the conservation of this motif in members of the M16 metallopeptidase family (see below). Moreover, adopting a proteolytic active conformation apparently requires the structural integrity of the SPP polypeptide. Second, binding to the transit peptide does not depend on catalytic activity, demonstrating that there are two separable steps in the overall processing reaction. Interestingly, an N-terminal domain of SPP contains structural determinants for binding to the transit peptide. Third, conversion of the transit peptide to the subfragment depends on the same catalytic site needed for precursor processing. Finally, the transit peptide region of preSPP blocks the processing activity. Hence, preSPP synthesized in the cytoplasm is prevented from prematurely processing other precursors that are post-translationally targeted to the chloroplast. Interestingly, our experiments with the SPP mutants E97Q and H94L now demonstrate that the residues of the HXXEH zinc-binding motif play an essential role during processing of chloroplast precursors. In earlier works, mutant analyses of this motif were done with other M16 peptidases, each hydrolyzing a distinct range of substrates (e.g. pitrilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and MPP β-subunit (30Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1996; 335: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). In all cases, nonconservative mutations of the defined residues of the motif abolished proteolytic activity, similar to our findings with the SPP mutants. Hence, the HXXEH motif is crucial for the activity of M16 peptidases, indicating a similar catalytic mechanism despite the diversity of the substrates cleaved by this family of peptidases. In fact, a crystal structure analysis of MPP localized the residues of the motif as part of an α-helix at the catalytic center, with the two histidines separated by one helical turn and complexed to a metal ion (presumably Zn2+). The internal glutamic acid was near a water molecule that was also bound to the metal ion (35Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A model for catalysis based on the metallopeptidase thermolysin proposes that the internal glutamic acid polarizes the zinc-bound water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond in the substrate (11Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2537-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our earlier work has shown that SPP is a monomeric polypeptide (7Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because of SPP's relatively large size of 124 kDa, we examined the possibility that a “proteolytic” domain separable from other parts of the enzyme mediates its processing activity. However, we found that not even a construct of SPP's M16 peptidase region extended downstream by nearly 600 residues (i.e. SPP-(1–874) was sufficient to carry out precursor processing. The functional counterpart to SPP in mitochondria, MPP, is a heterodimeric complex of ∼100 kDa cooperatively formed by α- and β-subunits of similar size (35Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity to SPP, however, is restricted to the M16 peptidase region present in β-subunit (see above). We asked if the SPP polypeptide analogous to MPP is organized into two functional “subunit regions” that cooperate to produce an active enzyme. However, combining constructs representing the N- and C-terminal halves of SPP did not reconstitute processing activity. Therefore, we conclude that only the structurally intact SPP polypeptide is capable of adopting a proteolytic active conformation. The requirements for the binding to the transit peptide and its proteolytic removal depend on different features of SPP. The inactive mutants E97Q and H94L can still interact with the transit peptide, and specific determinants required for this interaction are present in the N-terminal half. However, the lower affinity for the transit peptide displayed by the N-terminal half alone, only 35% of that found for mature SPP, indicates that multiple subsites of the intact metallopeptidase participate for optimal substrate binding. We have previously shown that SPP possesses a unique property. It catalyzes a second cleavage reaction, converting the transit peptide to a subfragment form (see Introduction) (14Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicates that both conversion and precursor processing depend on the HXXEH motif. A reaction comparable with the transit peptide conversion has not been observed in mitochondria. The isolated targeting signal of a mitochondrial precursor remained stable in the presence of MPP (36Arretz M. Schneider H. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a targeting signal was produced during processing in the mitochondrial matrix, however, its rapid hydrolysis by a novel peptidase occurred without detectable intermediates (37Stahl A. Moberg P. Ytterberg J. Panfilov O. Brockenhuus von Lowenhielm H. Nilsson F. Glaser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41931-41939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, in human ER membranes and E. coli inner membranes, proteolytic enzymes have been identified that internally cleave targeting signals after they have been removed from precursor proteins by signal peptidases (38Novak P. Dev I.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The human ER enzyme is an aspartyl protease that has its active site in the ER intramembrane space, whereas the E. coli enzyme is a serine protease associated with the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Hence, in contrast to the protein translocation pathways into mitochondria, the ER lumen, and bacterial periplasm, the turnover of the transit peptide mediating the chloroplast protein import is initiated by the enzyme responsible for targeting signal removal (i.e. SPP itself). We have found that preSPP has a low binding affinity for the transit peptide and does not carry out the cleavage reaction. Thus, preSPP is a latent form of the processing enzyme. The mechanism by which the transit peptide region interferes with the mature protein remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, a sequence alignment of the preSPP transit peptides from pea and A. thaliana, which have a low overall identity (24%) compared with the respective mature proteins (80%), identified up to three cysteine residues that could potentially complex the zinc ion in the HXXEH active site. Until transit peptide removal, a “cysteine switch” mechanism could keep the zinc ion in a noncatalytic state (40Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), as observed for members of the M10 and M12 families, such as matrix metalloproteinases and tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (9Rawlings N.D.

However, many questions remain to be answered if we are to understand how SPP is able to cleave such a diverse group of precursors possessing transit peptides that show little sequence, or apparent structural, similarity. Our earlier analyses showed that SPP recognizes the C-terminal region of the transit peptide, which has a positive net charge but lacks defined secondary structures. That transit peptide binding can be separated from the proteolysis per se by the mutation of the HXXEH motif should facilitate the design of future experiments to establish the protein-protein interactions that occur and how SPP achieves its specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2015005615,"Hsp90 is a dimeric, ATP-regulated molecular chaperone. Its ATPase cycle involves the N-terminal ATP binding domain (amino acids (aa) 1–272) and, in addition, to some extent the middle domain (aa 273–528) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (aa 529–709). To analyze the contribution of the different domains and the oligomeric state on the progression of the ATPase cycle of yeast Hsp90, we created deletion constructs lacking either the C-terminal or both the C-terminal and the middle domain. To test the effect of dimerization on the ATPase activity of the different constructs, we introduced a Cys residue at the C-terminal ends of the constructs, which allowed covalent dimerization. We show that all monomeric constructs tested exhibit reduced ATPase activity and a decreased affinity for ATP in comparison with wild type Hsp90. The covalently linked dimers lacking only the C-terminal domain hydrolyze ATP as efficiently as the wild type protein. Furthermore, this construct is able to trap the ATP molecule similar to the full-length protein. This demonstrates that in the ATPase cycle, the C-terminal domain can be replaced by a cystine bridge. In contrast, the ATPase activity of the artificially linked N-terminal domains remains very low and bound ATP is not trapped. Taken together, we show that both the dimerization of the N-terminal domains and the association of the N-terminal with the middle domain are important for the efficiency of the ATPase cycle. These reactions are synergistic and require Hsp90 to be in the dimeric state. Hsp90 is a dimeric, ATP-regulated molecular chaperone.

In contrast to other chaperones, a number of in vivo substrates are known for Hsp90 (1Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 2Picard D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Studies in eukaryotes revealed the specific association of Hsp90 with proteins involved in signal transduction such as tyrosine kinases and steroid hormone receptors (3Smith D.F. Schowalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with the importance of the substrate proteins, Hsp90 was found to be an essential protein in yeast (4Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Hsp90-mediated client protein activation is not completely understood. In general, Hsp90 is thought to maintain an otherwise unstable conformation of a substrate (1Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This reaction seems to involve the ATPase activity of Hsp90, because ATP binding and hydrolysis were found to be essential for the function of Hsp90 (5Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A.

The ATP hydrolysis cycle seems to involve the entire Hsp90 molecule (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is a dimeric protein. The dimerization site was shown to reside in the very C-terminal domain of Hsp90 (12Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For yeast Hsp90, a dissociation constant of 60 nm was determined (13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is followed by the middle domain. This domain, for which the three-dimensional structure was reported recently (14Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), seems to have a number of different functions. The N-terminal domain of Hsp90 contains a unique nucleotide binding site that differs substantially from that of other chaperones. This site was identified in the crystal structure with either ADP or the Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin (15Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). According to this structure, it has been proposed that Hsp90 belongs to the GHKL superfamily of ATP binding proteins that includes the DNA repair protein MutL, DNA gyrase, topoisomerase II, and histidine kinases (17Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The nucleotide is bound in an unusual kinked conformation with the adenosine moiety buried and the phosphate groups pointing to the outside of the molecule. The β-phosphate and probably even more the γ-phosphate of ATP are solvent-accessible in the crystal structure. Although the crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 in the presence and absence of nucleotide did not reveal significant structural differences, large conformational changes, as observed for other chaperones (18Todd M.J.

The kinetic analysis of the ATPase cycle revealed that Hsp90 has a weak affinity for ATP (16Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 23Scheibel T. Neuhofen S. Weikl T. Mayr C. Reinstein J. Vogel P.D. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After binding, a conformational change in Hsp90 traps the ATP molecule (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This trapped ATP molecule is committed to hydrolysis and resistant to exchange for unbound ATP. Because the isolated, monomeric N-terminal domain was not able to trap ATP (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), trapping seems to require additional parts of the protein or the second N-terminal domain. In this context, it had been shown that the N-terminal domains of the full-length protein associate during the ATPase cycle and that this association is required for efficient catalysis (13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal deletion variants of yeast Hsp90 lacking the first 24 amino acids are severely impaired in their ability to hydrolyze ATP (26Richter K. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44905-44910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore this region seems to be critical for the N-terminal association of Hsp90. Furthermore, fragments of yeast Hsp90 lacking C-terminal domains were considerably less active than full-length Hsp90 (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address the contribution of the different domains to the ATPase reaction, we designed constructs comprising the N-terminal domain or the N-terminal domain together with the middle domain. Additionally, we included a cysteine residue at the C terminus of these constructs, which allowed us to produce covalently cross-linked dimers. Hsp90 does naturally not contain cysteines. The analysis of monomeric and dimeric domain constructs of Hsp90 revealed that in the Hsp90 dimer both the N-terminal and the middle domain contribute in a synergistic manner to the progression of the ATPase cycle. Materials—Geldanamycin was a kind gift of the NCI Experimental Drug Division, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Bacterial Strains—Escherichia coli K12 derivative JM109 (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 relA1 Δ(lac-proAB)/F′ traD36 proAB lacIq lacZ DM15) was used for cloning and propagation, whereas strain M15[pREP4] (KmR NalS SmS rif S lac – ara – gal – mtl – F – recA + uvr +) was used as the expression host for the pQE system. All strains were grown in LB or dYT (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0,5% NaCl, pH 7). Ampicillin was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and kanamycin at 35 μg/ml. Hsp90 Constructs—The template for amplification of fragments using polymerase chain reactions was the full-length Hsp90 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We chose the pQE30 vector of the QIAexpress system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to clone the wild type (wt) Hsp90 gene and fragments adding an N-terminal His6 tag to all proteins expressed. The pQE30 plasmids containing the N- and C-terminal Hsp90 fragments N527Cys (amino acids 1–527-GSA-C-G), 529C (529–709) and N272Cys (1–272-GSA-C-G) were cloned via BamHI and PstI into pQE30. The extension “Cys” denotes the addition of a linker consisting of the amino acids glycine, serine, alanine, a cysteine residue, and glycine as the C-terminal amino acid. Protein Expression and Purification—M15[pREP4] was grown at 37 °C in dYT-Amp/Kan medium until A 600 reached 0.6–0.8. Expression of His-tagged wt-Hsp90 and fragments was induced by the addition of 2mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). Cells were lysed using a cell disruption system (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK). All His-tagged proteins were purified on a chelating nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with 100 mm NiSO4. Cell lysis and loading of the proteins was performed in loading buffer (100 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8). The column was washed with washing buffer (100 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8) before elution was performed by a step gradient with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole (elution buffer). In a next step, a ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences) was used to further purify the proteins. The protein was applied in 40 mm Tris/HCl, 20 mm KCl, pH 8, and eluted with a gradient from 20 to 500 mm KCl in the same buffer. As a final purification step, a Superdex 200 HiLoad (wt-Hsp90, N527Cys) or Superdex 75 HiLoad (529C, N272Cys) (Amersham Biosciences) was employed in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5. Proteins were stored in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, at concentrations of 3–10 mg/ml at –80 °C. Formation of Disulfide Bonds—After ion exchange chromatography, disulfide bonds between the monomeric fragments were formed under oxidating conditions by aeration of the buffer. Monomers and dimers were subsequently separated using the size exclusion chromatography columns Superdex 200 HiLoad and Superdex 75 HiLoad, respectively. Radioactive ATPase Assay—The radioactive ATPase assays were performed according to Kornberg et al. (27Kornberg A. Scott J.F. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp90 and the N-terminal fragments were incubated in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. For the N-terminal fragments and wt-Hsp90, a concentration of 5 μm was used in each assay. Hsp90 and the N-terminal fragments were incubated and measured at 37 °C. For single turnover experiments, the ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of an ATP mixture containing 0.1–1.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). The protein to ATP ratio was kept constant at 1:0.8. ATP hydrolysis was stopped at individual time points by the addition of 60 mm EDTA, and the samples were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Thin-layer chromatography was performed in 0.5 m LiCl and 2 m formic acid. Plates were dried under red light, and the ATP to ADP ratio was quantified using a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Hydrolysis rates were corrected for uncatalysed, spontaneous ATP hydrolysis. Quenching the ATPase reaction with trichloroacetic acid gave results that were identical with those obtained by quenching with EDTA. Inhibition of ATPase activity was achieved by the addition of 5 mm geldanamycin dissolved in Me2SO. In control experiments, 1% Me2SO alone did not affect the ATPase activities. Nucleotide Binding—Stopped-flow measurements were performed with a HiTech SF-61 DX2 instrument in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The excitation slit was 0.5 nm, the excitation wavelength was 334 nm, and emission was detected through a cut-off filter above 418 nm. The temperature was set to 25 °C unless indicated otherwise. Typically, each experiment was performed 6–10 times, and the resulting time traces were averaged with the HiTech Scientific software. Displacement experiments were performed with an excess of displacing ligand to ensure irreversible displacement; otherwise the observed rate constant for displacement would constitute a mixture of dissociation and rebinding kinetics (28Fersht A.R. in Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 103-131Google Scholar). In the case of experiments measuring the association of fluorescent ligands, either the concentration of enzyme or that of the ligand was at least 3-fold in excess to ensure proper pseudo first-order binding kinetics (29Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences: Receptors, Transmitters and Catalysts. University Press, Cambridge1995: 59-63Google Scholar). The primary data were analyzed using HiTech Scientific software with the following single exponential equations for the displacement reaction (Equation 1) and for the binding of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP (Equation 2). F=Fo-A(1-exp(-kt))(Eq. 1) F=Fo+A(1-exp(-kt))(Eq. 2) where F is signal, A is amplitude, Fo is offset, k is observed rate constant, and t is time. The secondary data of binding experiments (observed rate constants as obtained from a single exponential fit of each time trace versus concentration of ligand in excess) were analyzed with a linear equation. This follows from the fact that under pseudo first-order conditions (one ligand in excess) and for a simple one-step binding mechanism (k obs = k on × L excess + k off), a plot of k obs versus L excess gives k off as the intercept and k on as the slope, with L excess being the concentration of ligand in excess. Addition of a Cysteine Residue at the C Terminus of N-terminal Hsp90 Fragments Allows Artificial Dimerization— Earlier studies had shown that C-terminal deletion mutants of yeast Hsp90, which contain the N-terminal ATP-binding site, exhibited considerably lower ATPase activity than the wt protein (11Weikl T.

We were interested in analyzing how the C-terminal domain (amino acids 529–709) influences the ATP hydrolysis of Hsp90. Because the C-terminal domain mediates dimerization of Hsp90, its function could either be restricted to dimerization, or additionally, it could be directly involved in stimulating the ATPase activity. To differentiate between the two possibilities, we decided to create yeast Hsp90 variants that lack the C-terminal dimerization domain and contain an additional cysteine residue at the C-terminal end. Hsp90 does not naturally contain cysteines. The artificially introduced cysteine allows the covalent linking of the respective Hsp90 monomers and thus the production of artificial dimers. One fragment we chose to use contains amino acids 1–527 (N527Cys) (Fig. 1). A shorter fragment comprising the N-terminal ATP binding domain and the charged linker region was also constructed (N272Cys). As a complementary C-terminal fragment we used 529C, which contains amino acids 529–709 (Fig. 1). This protein represents the C-terminal dimerization domain, which is able to form heterodimers with Hsp90 (13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Scheibel T. Weikl T. Rimerman R. Smith D. Lindquist S. Buchner J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structure and stability of the Hsp90 fragments were analyzed by CD spectroscopy and urea-induced unfolding transitions. All fragments are structured and exhibit cooperative unfolding transitions with midpoints of unfolding between 3.5 and 4.5 m urea (data not shown). The dimeric species of N527Cys and N272Cys migrated at the expected positions in the gel (Fig. 2). Samples that had been incubated with a reducing agent before separation migrated at the position of the respective monomer (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE confirmed that the dimers were covalently linked. Taken together, these experiments show that it is possible to produce dimeric Hsp90 fragments that are linked via a C-terminal disulfide bond. Artificial Dimerization of N-terminal Fragments Leads to Increased ATP Hydrolysis—Dimerization of wt-Hsp90 is a dynamic process allowing the formation of heterodimers (13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Scheibel T. Weikl T. Rimerman R. Smith D. Lindquist S. Buchner J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). If a monomer-dimer transition mediated via the C-terminal dimerization domain was an important step in the ATPase cycle of yeast Hsp90, covalently linked dimers would be compromised in the ATPase activity. Similarly, if the C-terminal domain was required for specific interaction in addition to providing a dimerization site, a negative influence on the ATPase reaction would be expected. Analyzing monomeric and dimeric Hsp90 fragments, we found that the ATPase of the N527Cys monomer (k obs) was 0.15 ± 0.05 min–1 (Table I, Fig. 3A), whereas that of the N527Cys dimer was 1.1 ± 0.2 min–1 (Table I, Fig. 3A). Thus, the activity of the dimer is seven times higher than the activity of the monomer and even 10% higher than the activity of wt-Hsp90. In a control experiment, we added reducing agent to the dimeric N527Cys fragment. This addition resulted in the reduction of the disulfide bond and the subsequent monomerization of the N527Cys fragment. Concomitantly, the ATPase activity decreased to the levels of the monomer (Fig. 3B). These results show that artificial dimerization of N527Cys by a C-terminal disulfide bond is sufficient for wt ATPase activity.Table IComparison of ATP hydrolysis rate constants (kcat) and Km values of different Hsp90 variantsProteinkcatKmmin-1μ mwt-Hsp901.0 ± 0.2350 ± 40wt-Hsp90·Hsp90(529C)0.17 ± 0.02NDHsp90-N527Cys dimer1.1 ± 0.2328 ± 35Hsp90-N527Cys monomer0.15 ± 0.05520 ± 40Hsp90-N272Cys dimer0.015 ± 0.005760 ± 100Hsp90-N272Cys monomer0.007 ± 0.0031000 ± 150 Open table in a new tab Next, we wanted to determine whether the middle domain was also obsolete in the presence of a covalent linkage. To test this, we used artificially dimerized N272Cys fragments, consisting only of the ATP binding domain and the charged linker. In agreement with previous results, the monomeric species of N272Cys exhibited an ATPase activity of about 0.007 ± 0.003 min–1, which is less than 1% of wt activity (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The covalent N272Cys dimer showed an ATPase activity of 0.015 ± 0.005 min–1. This means that dimerization of the N-terminal ATP binding domain increased the ATPase activity by a factor of approximately 2. However, it should be noted that this value represents only 2% of the activity of wt-Hsp90 or of the larger dimeric fragment N527Cys. Because of the calculated dissociation constant (KD) of 60 nm for dimeric yeast Hsp90 (13Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the direct determination of the activity of monomeric wt-Hsp90 is practically impossible. To solve this problem, we used the C-terminal fragment 529C, which comprises the dimerization domain. The addition of an excess of the C-terminal fragment 529C to wt-Hsp90 results in the formation of wt-Hsp90·529C heterodimers and 529C homodimers. As the C-terminal fragments show no ATPase activity, only the wt-Hsp90·529C heterodimer contributes to the ATPase activity measured. Thus, the ATPase activity of the heterodimer corresponds to the activity of the wt-Hsp90 monomer. When increasing amounts of 529C (1–100 μm) were added to wt-Hsp90 (2 μm), a concentration-dependent decrease in the ATPase activity was observed (Fig. 3C). The rate constant (k cat) of ATP hydrolysis for the wt-Hsp90·529C heterodimer was 0.17 ± 0.02 min–1 compared with 1.0 ± 0.2 min–1 for the wt-Hsp90 homodimer. This means that dimeric wt-Hsp90 hydrolyzes ATP by a factor of 5 more efficiently than the respective monomeric species. Furthermore, the addition of 529C to N527Cys-D and N527Cys-M did not appear to have any effect on their ATPase activities (Fig. 3C). ATP Binding Properties of Hsp90 Fragments—To gain more insight into the underlying mechanistic differences of the ATPase of Hsp90 fragments, we determined their Km values for ATP (Fig. 4). The rate constants (k obs) measured exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on the ATP concentrations (50 μm to 4 mm ATP). A plot of kobs–1 versus [ATP]–1 (Lineweaver-Burk plot, not shown) allowed us to determine the apparent Km values for the different constructs. The limiting rate constants (k cat) for ATP hydrolysis of wt-Hsp90, N527Cys-D, N527Cys-M, N272Cys-D, and N272Cys-M were determined to be ∼1.0 ± 0.2 min–1, 1.1 ± 0.2 min–1, 0.15 ± 0.05 min–1, 0.015 ± 0.005 min–1, and 0.007 ± 0.003 min–1, respectively, at saturating ATP concentrations (see Table I). As shown in Table I, the Km values of wt-Hsp90 and N527Cys-D do not differ significantly, whereas the Km of N527Cys-M is lower by a factor of 1.5. The Km values of N272Cys-M and N272Cys-D differ slightly and are about three times lower than with wt-Hsp90. This leads to the assumption that the middle domain and N-terminal dimerization contribute to the interaction with ATP Kinetics of ATP Binding to Hsp90 Fragments—To further analyze the nucleotide binding properties of the monomeric and dimeric fragments lacking the C-terminal domain in comparison to wt-Hsp90, we performed stopped-flow experiments with (Pγ)-MABA-ATP, a fluorescently labeled ATP analogue. (Pγ)-MABA-ATP emits fluorescence at 418 nm when excited at 334 nm, and this fluorescence increases upon binding to Hsp90 (11Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This allowed us to determine association and dissociation rate constants for the interaction of Hsp90 fragments with ATP. First, we determined the release rate for the nucleotide by direct displacement of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP from the preformed complexes with an excess of unlabeled nucleotide. Complexes of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP and each wt-Hsp90, N527Cys-M, and N527Cys-D were incubated for 30 min to allow complex formation. Subsequently, this solution was rapidly mixed with an excess of unlabeled ATP to ensure complete displacement. Thus, the observed rate constant will be equal to the rate constant for dissociation (k off) of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP. The reactions followed a single exponential function with observed rate constants of 2.57 ± 0.2 s–1, 2.90 ± 0.2 s–1, and 2.71 ± 0.2 s–1 for wt-Hsp90, N527Cys-D, and N527Cys-M, respectively (Fig. 5, A–C; Table II).Table IIKinetic analysis of ATP binding to different Hsp90 variantsProteinkonkoffKDμm-1 s-1s-1μmwt-Hsp900.16 ± 0.022.572 ± 0.216 ± 0.2Hsp90-N527Cys dimer0.21 ± 0.022.898 ± 0.213.8 ± 0.2Hsp90-N527Cys monomer0.07 ± 0.022.708 ± 0.238.7 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Next, we determined the association kinetics for wt-Hsp90 and the N-terminal fragments. The change of fluorescence upon binding of the nucleotide to Hsp90 can be described by a single exponential function yielding observed rate constants (k on) of 0.16 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1, 0.21 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1, and 0.07 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1 for wt-Hsp90, N527Cys-D, and N527Cys-M, respectively (Fig. 5, D and F; Table II). Each of these experiments was performed at different protein concentrations, and the observed rate constants were plotted versus protein concentration (data not shown). The binding of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP to Hsp90 and fragments can be described by a simple one-step reversible reaction. The slopes of the least square fitted solid lines reveal the rate constants for association (k on) of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP to wt-Hsp90 and the N-terminal fragments (28Fersht A.R. in Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding.

https://openalex.org/W2067142804,"The parasitic protozoa <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> utilizes a novel cofactor (trypanothione, T(SH)<sub>2</sub>), which is a conjugate of GSH and spermidine, to maintain cellular redox balance. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of GSH. To evaluate the importance of thiol metabolism to the parasite, RNA<sub>i</sub> methods were used to knock down gene expression of γ-GCS in procyclic <i>T. brucei</i> cells. Induction of γ-GCS RNA<sub>i</sub> with tetracycline led to cell death within 4–6 days post-induction. Cell death was preceded by the depletion of the γ-GCS protein and RNA and by the loss of the cellular pools of GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub>. The addition of GSH (80 μm) to cell cultures rescued the RNA<sub>i</sub> cell death phenotype and restored the intracellular thiol pools to wild-type levels. Treatment of cells with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an enzyme-activated inhibitor of γ-GCS, also resulted in cell death. However, the toxicity of the inhibitor was not reversed by GSH, suggesting that BSO has more than one cellular target. BSO depletes intracellular thiols to a similar extent as γ-GCS RNA<sub>i</sub>; however, addition of GSH did not restore the pools of GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub>. These data suggest that BSO also acts to inhibit the transport of GSH or its peptide metabolites into the cell. The ability of BSO to inhibit both synthesis and transport of GSH likely makes it a more effective cytotoxic agent than an inhibitor with a single mode of action. Finally the potential for the T(SH)<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic enzymes to be regulated in response to reduced thiol levels was studied. The expression levels of ornithine decarboxylase and of <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, two essential enzymes in spermidine biosynthesis, remained constant in induced γ-GCS RNA<sub>i</sub> cell lines."

PA is then proteolytically processed on the cell surface by furin and membrane furin-like peptidases, to a 63-kDa form (PA63), which oligomerizes and binds LF or EF (3Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Curr.

The lethal toxin (PA + LF) and the edema toxin (PA + EF) are then endocytosed by a lipid raft-mediated clathrin-dependent process (9Abrami L. Liu S. Cosson P. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J.

The active site zinc ion is coordinated tetrahedrally to the domain 4 of LF (residues 551–777) by a water molecule and three side chains (i.e. His-686, His-690, and Glu-735), in a structural arrangement shared by metalloproteases of the thermolysin family (17Pannifer A.D.

Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol.

Here, we present a detailed analysis of the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates designed on the basis of the consensus motif of MAPKK N termini and of the inhibition caused by the substrates themselves. These findings are relevant to the design of novel inhibitors of LF and for the understanding of the macrophage toxicity of LF.

Peptides from the Leu P2 residue to the N-terminal amino acid (see Table I) were synthesized by Fmoc (9-fluorenyl methyloxy-carbonyl)-solid phase peptide synthesis (22Fields G.B Noble R.L. Int. J.

Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Bachem. The proper C-terminal P1 amino acid residue (Pro or Arg; see Table I) derivatized with p-nitroaniline (pNA) or with 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (Bachem) was coupled to the peptides by a condensation reaction in dimethylformamide with N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (Millipore) as coupling reagent and 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (Merck) as base (23Johansson A.

Bernardi L. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the LF peptide chromogenic substrates listed in Table I were designed and synthesized. These substrates contain at their C terminus the pNA or the AMC group, which are released upon the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by LF. Product (i.e. pNA and AMC) concentration is easily determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm and spectrofluorometrically at 460 nm (λecc = 360 nm), respectively. Under all the experimental conditions, product formation (i.e. pNA and AMC release from peptide chromogenic substrates) catalyzed by LF was monitored for 5–10 min, and it was linear over the assay time; no substrate hydrolysis was detected in the presence of apo-LF (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, LF undergoes total substrate inhibition, indicating that the substrate may bind to the enzyme with different geometries and that the substrate bound in the non-productive binding mode(s) impairs LF action. Total substrate inhibition is in keeping with the observation that the LF·MAPKK-2 substrate adduct is the first example of a protease in complex with its uncleaved substrate (17Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C.

It is worth noting that although the closest main-chain approach to the Zn2+ ion is the scissile bond following MAPKK-2 Pro-10 (i.e. the P1-P1′ bond), it is about 6 Å from the zinc-bound water. Modeling studies have shown that a rotation about a main-chain dihedral angle at Lys-6 (i.e. P5) would allow Pro-10 (i.e. P1) to swing down into the S1 specificity subsite to generate the productive cleavage complex. The substrate productive conformation requires an abrupt 90° turn in the peptide chain (favored by the Pro-10 residue) at the P1 position (Fig. 1) (17Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The analysis of the data shown in Fig. 2, according to Equation 1, provided the values of Km and k cat for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide chromogenic substrates, as well as of Ki for enzyme inhibition by the pNA- and AMC-derivatized substrates (Table I). At 1 μm LF concentration, the value of k cat (expressed as s–1) corresponds to that of V max (expressed as substrate micromoles hydrolized/second by micromole of enzyme). The turnover number of LF shows a limited variation (from one to six molecules of substrate hydrolyzed/second by one molecule of LF) upon changing the length of peptide substrates and the number of Arg residues, whose addition at the N terminus renders peptides permeable to the plasma membrane of cells (18Tonello F. Seveso M. Marin O. Mock M. Montecucco C. Nature. 2002; 418: 386Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This figure can be compared with that of the prototype metalloproteinase, thermolysin, whose turnover is comprised in the range of 6–16 substrate molecules hydrolyzed/second by one molecule of thermolysin (28Morgan G. Fruton J.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The values of Km and Ki for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide chromogenic substrates containing 6–9 residues are very favorable, and the Km /k cat values indicate that the LF substrates that we have prepared are very specific and that peptides containing more Arg residues are cleaved more efficiently. The Km values decrease (i.e. the LF:substrate affinity increases) by adding positively charged Arg residues at the N-terminal region of the peptide substrates (Table I). Although one cannot disregard the effect of increasing length, this finding can be taken as an additional evidence of the importance of electrostatic interactions in LF-substrate recognition. It is in agreement with the decrease of the initial velocity (i.e. vi) for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide chromogenic substrate AcMLARRRPVLP-pNA on increasing the ionic strength (i.e. the NaCl concentration) (Fig. 3). Moreover, the negatively charged residues Glu-336, Glu-334, Asp-387, and Asp-394 located in the elongated cleft-shaped recognition site of LF (Fig. 1) are located in such a position within the active site as to suggest that they interact directly with the N-terminal positively charged lateral residues of the arginines, thus playing a major role in the binding and the positioning of the substrate (17Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, values of K cat for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide chromogenic substrates are essentially substrate-independent (Table I). This may reflect a common rate-limiting step in catalysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the maximum initial velocity (i.e. vi) for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of AcMLARRRPVLP-pNA occurs at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, corresponding to pH and temperature values of the cytosol of mammalian cells, which is the site of action of LF. It should be noted that values of K cat for the LF-catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide substrates conjugated with pNA or with AMC, which differ considerably in size, are almost identical (Table I). This is in agreement with the previous findings (15Vitale G. Bernardi L. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Pannifer A.D.

Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) that the main determinants of the substrate binding into the active site cleft of LF are located on the N terminus side. The AMC-derivatized substrate AcRRRRVLR-AMC offers a much higher sensitivity than the pNA-derivatized substrates (about 100-fold higher), allowing one to follow the proteolytic activity of minute amounts of LF. The hydrolysis of both types of substrates can be monitored with very simple instruments and in a wide range of experimental conditions, including high throughput assays. This is the first detailed study of the kinetics parameters of the metalloproteolytic activity of LF in vitro obtained with ad hoc designed chromogenic substrates whose hydrolysis can be monitored with very simple and widely available techniques. It describes the substrate inhibition of LF hydrolytic activity. The subtle modulation of LF activity by total substrate inhibition is in keeping with the non-productive binding mode of MAPKK-2 N terminus to LF (17Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and could be relevant for the enzyme action in vivo. In fact, LF cleaves several isoforms of MAPKK present within the cytosol of cells. Given the different structural properties of these cellular substrates and their different subcellular locations (29Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar, 30Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it is very likely that they are cleaved with different velocities and that there is a non-uniform LF-induced cleavage of the MAPKK isoforms. Such heterogeneity of cleavage of MAPKK isoforms could additionally vary among cells, giving rise to different cellular outcomes of the intoxication with LF. Indeed, the effect of LF varies with cell types and conditions. Upon exposure to lethal toxin, macrophages lyse in culture (19Friedlander A.M. J. Biol.

A quantitative analysis of the differential LF cleavage of MAPKK isoforms within cells is not a simple goal to achieve, but it appears to be essential for the molecular understanding of the in vivo action of LF."

The kinetic properties of Ca2+ release through this channel are inherently complex (2Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Patel S. Joseph S.K.

However, among the many factors that converge on the InsP3 R to influence Ca2+ release, Ca2+ itself is perhaps the most important regulator of channel open probability. It is firmly established that Ca2+ can act as a co-agonist along with InsP3 at the cytosolic face of the InsP3R to modulate Ca2+ release (12Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

J. 1995; 306: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most studies have examined the Type I InsP3R, although properties of the receptor differ somewhat depending on the particular isoform that is expressed (2Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Ramos-Franco J. Bare D. Caenepeel S. Nani A. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys.

The Type I InsP3R possesses a bell-shaped dependence on cytosolic [Ca2+], whereby Ca2+ efflux is negligible at very low cytosolic [Ca2+], but its activity rises as [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm increases (∼200–300 nm), and then again diminishes as [Ca2+] reaches high levels (above 1 μm). These fundamental observations have been indispensable for explaining the “excitability” of the receptor and have provided a mechanistic framework to account for a number of complex phenomena, ranging from Ca2+ oscillations (20Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) to the basis for metabolic control of Ca2+ signals via mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (21Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of intraluminal Ca2+ in regulating the InsP3R appears less clear, and different studies have come to conflicting conclusions on this point (22Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Combettes L. Cheek T.R. Taylor C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2086-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Nunn D.L.

It is obvious that luminal [Ca2+] might influence the kinetics of release (as assessed by the cytoplasmic transient) by virtue of changes in thermodynamic driving force for Ca2+ efflux when stores are full versus when they are empty. However, numerous reports have implied that there is an additional stimulatory action of intraluminal [Ca2+] on store emptying (16Bootman M.D. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Casteels R. J. Biol.

The idea that luminal Ca2+ can regulate its own efflux has been proposed to underlie the phenomenon of “quantal” or “incremental” Ca2+ release, whereby a submaximal dose of InsP3 is able to rapidly release just a portion of the stored Ca2+ (34Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). While there is evidence for direct binding of Ca2+ to the InsP3R (Type 1) at a luminal site (35Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as well as evidence that luminal Ca2+ can promote a conformation of the InsP3R that has increased affinity for InsP3 (29Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25206-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Oldershaw K.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), many other studies have disputed the stimulatory action of luminal Ca2+ entirely (27Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and Thrower et al. (11Thrower E.C. Mobasheri H. Dargan S. Marius P. Lea E.J. Dawson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36049-36055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) even provided evidence in a reconstituted bilayer system indicating that the Type 1 InsP3R is negatively regulated by high (1 mm) intraluminal [Ca2+] in the absence of cytoplasmic ATP. Horne and Meyer (37Horne J.H. Meyer T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12738-12746Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have suggested that the regulation by intraluminal [Ca2+] is an indirect consequence of positive modulation by cytosolic calcium ions. To further complicate this scenario, intraluminal Ca2+ can also modulate the Ca2+ pump SERCA, which is able to transport Ca2+ more rapidly when stores are empty due to a reduction in thermodynamic gradient for calcium (6Meldolesi J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol.

This mechanism has been proposed previously to contribute to quantal Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptor (40Steenbergen J.M. Fay F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1821-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and InsP3R-dependent pathways (41van de Put F.H. De Pont J.J. Willems P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, although it seems that intraluminal Ca2+ may play multiple roles in the regulation of channels and pumps involved in Ca2+ signaling, the exact mechanisms of this modulation still need to be assessed. One of the difficulties in addressing this issue experimentally has been the lack of methods for precisely manipulating luminal [Ca2+] within the store. This is particularly true in intact cells. Ideally, the effects of luminal [Ca2+] on the release process would be examined under conditions where cytosolic buffering and cellular Ca2+ handling mechanisms are preserved. Here we have reevaluated this issue in a physiological model system using N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene diamine (TPEN), a membrane-permeant heavy metal chelator (43Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that also has low affinity for Ca2+. TPEN can be used to elicit rapid and reversible changes in free [Ca2+] in internal stores of intact cells without directly altering cytoplasmic [Ca2+], InsP3 receptors, or SERCA pumps (44Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have combined this tool with direct measurements of free luminal [Ca2+] changes using the trapped fluorescent low affinity Ca2+ indicator, mag-fura-2, in intact BHK-21 cells (45Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 46Hofer A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 114: 249-265PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this way we were able to assess the actions of luminal reduction of free [Ca2+] in single living cells with rapid time resolution. Our experiments also employed conditions of native Ca2+ buffering in the cytosol and did not require perturbation of Ca2+ uptake mechanisms (SERCAs). Our data show that acutely lowering free [Ca2+] within the store with TPEN does indeed attenuate the extent of InsP3-induced release. A substantial portion of this action can be accounted for compensatory activities of the SERCA, which is able to more rapidly restore Ca2+ in the compartment when the luminal content is reduced, providing a “brake” on store release. When cytosolic [Ca2+] was clamped using the strong Ca2+ buffer BAPTA, the action of lowering luminal [Ca2+] was still observed, even in the presence of SERCA inhibitors. Thus we conclude that high luminal Ca2+ does exert a direct stimulatory action on store release. Cell Culture and Dye Loading—BHK-21 cells (purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in the presence of 5% C02/95% air. Cells were seeded at low density on glass coverslips and used the following day for microspectrofluorimetric measurements of cytoplasmic or intraorganellar free [Ca2+] with fura-2-AM (48Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or mag-fura-2-AM (49Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Cells were loaded in tissue culture medium at 37 °C for 20 min with fura-2-AM (7 μm) or for 35–45 min with mag-fura-2-AM (2–5 μm). When cells were preloaded with BAPTA-AM, the chelator was added during the last 20 min of dye loading to ensure cytosolic retention (final concentration: 40 μm). Subcultures were prepared by trypsinization and the cells used for not more than 10 passages following receipt from the distributor. Microspectrofluorimetric Measurements—Coverslips with dye-loaded cells were mounted into a heated metal flow-through perfusion chamber described previously placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM 35, Oberkochen, Germany) and perfused by gravity feed at a rate of 1.5–2 ml/min. Emitted fluorescence from single cells was measured in response to alternate pulses of excitation light (5-ms duration) at 340 and 380 nm, using a computer-controlled four-place sliding filter holder manufactured in-house. The emitted fluorescence (510 nm) was focused on a photomultiplier tube, amplified, digitally converted, and sampled on an IBM-compatible computer. The filter exchange system and data sampling software were designed by Giuseppe and Antonio Troccoli (Bari, Italy). All measurements were automatically corrected for background. The ratio of emitted light from the two excitation wavelengths (340/380) of fura-2 or mag-fura-2 provide a measure of ionized cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (48Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or intrastore [Ca2+] (45Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 47Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), respectively. Ratio Imaging Experiments—In some experiments, fura-2 and magfura-2 measurements were carried out using a ratio imaging set-up running Metafluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Coverslips with dye-loaded cells were mounted in an open-topped perfusion chamber (Series 20, Warner Instrument Corp, Hamden, CT) and placed on the heated stage of a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope. Cells were excited alternately for 80 ms through a 40× (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective. The 340/380 nm excitation wavelengths were generated by a microprocessor controlled filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) placed in the path of a 100-watt mercury light source. Pairs of fluorescence images (emission collected above 510 nm) were captured by a Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera every 4 s and converted to a ratio image by the Metafluor software. Cell Permeabilization—As described previously (50Hofer A.M. Schlue W.R. Curci S. Machen T.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 51Hofer A.M. Tepikin A.V. Calcium Signalling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 111-124Google Scholar), dye-loaded cells were rinsed briefly in a high K+ solution (in mm: 125 KCI, 25 NaCI, 0.1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.20) and then exposed for 2–3 min to an “intracellular buffer” at 37 °C (the same solution with free [Ca2+] clamped to 170 nm using Ca/EGTA buffers and supplemented with 0.375 mm Na2ATP) also containing 5 μg/ml digitonin. After plasma membrane permeabilization, cells were continuously superfused with intracellular buffer (without digitonin). Measurements of mag-fura-2 fluorescence were performed as above for intact cells. Solutions and Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Mílano, Italy), Fluka AG (Buchs, Switzerland) or Sigma. Experiments were performed with a Ringer's solution containing (in mm): 121 NaCl, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4. 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5.5 glucose, 10 Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.40. Bradykinin and ionomycin were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.; InsP3, fura-2-AM, mag-fura-2-AM, TPEN, tBHQ, and BAPTA-AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). TPEN was either added to experimental solutions from a 200 mm stock prepared in 100% ethanol, or TPEN crystals were added directly to solutions and stirred for several hours until dissolved. When Me2SO or ethanol was used as a solvent, the final solvent concentration never exceeded 0.01 or 0.1%, respectively. Data Analysis—Responses to Ca2+ mobilizing agonists were compared in the same cell in the presence and absence of agents used to alter [Ca2+] within the store (TPEN, tBHQ, etc.). This approach eliminated concerns about the variability of the starting mag-fura-2 ratio, which can differ substantially depending on which system (imaging versus microspectrofluorimetric) was used to collect data. These paired data were assessed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with n equal to the number of experimental runs. The moderate affinity of TPEN for Ca2+ (Kd ∼100 μm), and the fact that it is uncharged and membrane permeant in its uncomplexed form, makes this compound particularly suitable for rapidly and reversibly chelating Ca2+ within stores. Due to its low affinity for Ca2+, TPEN does not influence cytosolic [Ca2+]. On the other hand, in compartments where free [Ca2+] is comparable with the Kd of TPEN (such as the InsP3-sensitive internal store) the compound binds Ca2+ and rapidly reduces its free concentration. The opposite happens when the chelator in the medium is washed out. Therefore, by grading the TPEN concentration in the bath, it is possible to cause graded and reversible decreases of the [Ca2+] within the lumen of the store (44Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 51Hofer A.M. Tepikin A.V. Calcium Signalling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 111-124Google Scholar). Effect of 200 μ m TPEN on Ca2 + Release as Measured by Trapped mag-fura-2—Luminal [Ca2+] changes were monitored directly using the trapped fluorescent low-affinity Ca2+ indicator, mag-fura-2, in intact and permeabilized BHK-21 cells. The BHK-21 cell model can be used for monitoring intraorganellar [Ca2+] without permeabilizing the plasma membrane, since as we observed earlier, these cells have the tendency to export cytoplasmic dye with prolonged loading. We have established previously that under these conditions organelle-trapped magfura-2 measures [Ca2+] changes exclusively in InsP3/agoinstand thapsigargin-sensitive internal stores (47Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 50Hofer A.M. Schlue W.R. Curci S. Machen T.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a representative experiment in intact BHK-21 cells loaded with mag-fura-2, where addition of 200 μm TPEN to the Ca2+-free medium (Ca2+-free solutions were used to ensure that the effective concentration of the membrane-permeant, free form of TPEN remained sufficiently high outside of the cell) resulted in a rapid drop of the mag-fura-2 ratio, indicating a drop in [Ca2+] in the stores. This decrease in the ratio amounted to 28.6 ± 4.1% of the decrease in the ratio observed following treatment under control conditions with a maximal dose of bradykinin (BK; 100 nm), a Ca2+ mobilizing agonist in these cells. Thus, this dose of TPEN reduces the free releasable Ca2+ within the store by roughly 20%. When cells were stimulated with BK in the presence of 200 μm TPEN, there was a further decrease in the ratio as a result of Ca2+ release from the stores through the InsP3 receptor. Following washout of TPEN, cells were again stimulated with BK alone. Comparison of the two responses showed that the extent of the Ca2+ decrease in response to agonist was significantly (p < 0.003) attenuated in the presence of TPEN, which was 82.8 ± 3.3% of control (n = 11). Similar results were obtained in digitonin-permeabilized cells stimulated to release Ca2+ with a maximal dose of InsP3 (6 μm; Fig. 1B). In this case the presence of TPEN significantly (p < 0.004) reduced the extent of the response to 6 μm InsP3, which was 62.5 ± 5.3% of control (n = 10). The effects of TPEN on the release of intrastore Ca2+ were substantiated by experiments conducted in intact cells loaded with fura-2 to measure cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. As shown in Fig. 1C, the magnitude of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ spike induced by stimulation with BK in the presence of 200 μm TPEN (in absence of external Ca2+) was significantly reduced and was on average 57 ± 10% of the control response to BK (p < 0.01; n = 11). The Action of TPEN Is Not Due to Heavy Metal Binding or Enhanced Ca2 + Buffering—TPEN avidly chelates intracellular heavy metals such as Zn2+ because of its very high affinity for these cations (43Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since heavy metals can interfere considerably with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators (52Snitsarev V.A. McNulty T.J. Taylor C.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1048-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we performed control experiments using a low dose of TPEN (10 μm) to test whether the effects described in Fig. 1 might be attributed to changes in heavy metals rather than intrastore [Ca2+]. This lower dose of TPEN would be expected to completely bind any endogenous heavy metals (43Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Snitsarev V.A. McNulty T.J. Taylor C.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1048-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, 10 μm TPEN did not produce any detectable change in the mag-fura-2 ratio of intact BHK-21 cells and did not induce any significant change in the response to agonists (n = 6). Similar results (Fig. 2B) were obtained in permeabilized cells stimulated with InsP3 (n = 5). Moreover, no detectable changes in the fura-2 ratio or the response to bradykinin were observed after addition of this low dose (10 μm) of TPEN (n = 11; not shown). These experiments indicate that chelation of heavy metals by TPEN did not interfere with the observed responses in BHK-21 cells. We considered the possibility that TPEN might somehow alter Ca2+ release by augmenting the buffering capacity for Ca2+ in the store, particularly because the rate of free [Ca2+] change in the store during stimulation was very often slower in the presence of 200 μm TPEN (see Fig. 1, A and B). To test this idea, we devised conditions whereby the stores could be simultaneously loaded with TPEN (which should increase the buffering capacity of the store for Ca2+), and the free [Ca2+] restored to its original resting level. Cells were incubated in a solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ and 1.2 mm TPEN. The free [TPEN] in this solution was estimated to be 200 μm and free [Ca2+] ∼0.5 mm (assuming TPEN to have a K d for Ca2+ of ∼100 μm). As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment of cells with this solution caused an initial rapid drop in luminal [Ca2+], due to free TPEN entering the internal store. However, in contrast to what as observed in Ca2+-free external solutions, luminal [Ca2+] gradually recovered back to resting levels in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, since SERCAs, having a readily available supply of Ca2+ from outside the cell, were able to pump Ca2+ into the store. Cells were then challenged with agonist, revealing a drop in free Ca2+ that was on average even slightly larger (although not significantly so; 107 ± 4.2%) than that obtained under control conditions in the presence of 0.5 mm added Ca2+ (typical of n = 3 imaging experiments; data from 13 cells). These experiments suggest that the additional Ca2+ buffering introduced by TPEN in the store does not account for the results observed in Fig. 1, A and B. Effect of 200 μ m TPEN Is Not Eliminated in the Presence of BAPTA—Acutely lowering the Ca2+ content of the store will reduce the amount of Ca2+ available for release, and attenuate the cytoplasmic spike (refer to Fig. 1C). The effect of TPEN might therefore be ascribed to a secondary action of reduced Ca2+ at a cytoplasmic site on the InsP3R. As shown in Fig. 3, intact BHK-21 cells were stimulated in the absence and presence of TPEN (200 μm), similar to the experiment shown in Fig. 1A. The same cells were then treated for 20 min. on the microscope stage with the high-affinity Ca2+ buffer BAPTA-AM (40 μm), which was used to prevent cytoplasmic [Ca2+] transients (47Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the response to BK was still strongly reduced (68.2 ± 4.5% of control, p < 0.01, n = 6) in the presence of TPEN following BAPTA-AM treatment. These data exclude the possibility that cytoplasmic Ca2+ is the only modulator of the release mechanism. Role of the SERCA Pump in Limiting Ca2 + Release from Stores—Another possible explanation to account for the actions of luminal Ca2+ on the release process relates to the increased efficiency of the SERCA pump to accumulate Ca2+ following luminal depletion. In fact, acute treatment (∼1 min) with the SERCA inhibitor tBHQ prior to agonist addition consistently caused a much more profound release of Ca2+ from stores following agonist stimulation, which was 165 ± 14% of control (p < 0.0005; n = 14; not shown). Similar findings were reported previously by Yu and Hinkle (53Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in studies using genetically encoded “cameleon” reporters targeted to the ER lumen in HEK293 cells. One explanation for this enhanced stimulation of release following pump inhibition is that cytoplasmic Ca2+ was elevated, due to the passive leak of Ca2+ out of stores upon SERCA inhibition, causing the InsP3 receptor to become more “excitable.” However, in intact cells pretreated with BAPTAAM, the extent of release elicited by agonist following tBHQ treatment was also significantly enhanced, amounting to 178 ± 19% of the control release (n = 8; not shown). Moreover, similar results were seen in digitonin-permeabilized cells bathed in an EGTA-containing intracellular-like buffer, where brief pretreatment of cells with tBHQ caused InsP3-induced drop in the mag-fura-2 ratio to increase by 157 ± 17% of the control release in the absence of tBHQ (n = 10; not shown). Combined Effects of TPEN and SERCA Inhibitors—The previous results show that rapid re-accumulation of Ca2+ by ER pumps effectively restricts the net drop in ER [Ca2+] following InsP3 receptor activation. We next examined whether lowering luminal [Ca2+] with 200 μm TPEN at the same time as the SERCA was inhibited with tBHQ had any effect on the extent of agonist-induced release from internal stores. As shown in Fig. 4, cells were first treated with 200 μm TPEN in Ca2+-free solutions to lower the free [Ca2+] in the store, followed by exposure to 20 μm tBHQ for a brief period (∼1 min) prior to stimulation with BK. The magnitude of the ratio decrease due to agonist treatment was compared with that obtained in the absence of TPEN, i.e. after a 1-min pretreatment with only tBHQ. Interestingly, we could not detect a significant difference in the ratio decrease following stimulation in the control condition versus that in the presence of 200 μm TPEN (although the initial rate of release was significantly slower). Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that cytoplasmic [Ca2+] will be somewhat elevated following tBHQ treament, due to leakage of Ca2+ out of the stores. However, as described in more detail below, when cells were pretreated with BAPTA-AM, there was a significant difference between the ratio drop with tBHQ alone (control), compared with the drop in the presence of TPEN + tBHQ (82.9 ± 5.6% of control; n = 10). Similar results (not shown) were obtained in digitonin-permeabilized cells, where TPEN addition also significantly attenuated the extent of release elicited by 6 μm InsP3 (TPEN + tBHQ was 70.8 ± 4.0% of the control with tBHQ alone, p = 0.02; n = 8). The experiment shown in Fig. 5 summarizes our main findings. Intact mag-fura-2-loaded cells were pretreated with BAPTA-AM. Cells were first stimulated with agonist in the presence of tBHQ and 200 μm TPEN. The extent of this release was smaller than that observed when cells were stimulated following tBHQ treatment alone, indicating that luminal [Ca2+] modulates efflux independent of effects on the SERCA pump when cytosolic [Ca2+] has been clamped with BAPTAAM. When SERCA pumps were functional, the extent of release was much smaller (both in the presence and absence of TPEN) showing that Ca2+ sequestration has a powerful braking effect on the release process. The main point, however, is that the combined treatment of BAPTA-AM, tBHQ, and TPEN still resulted in an additional attenuation of Ca2+ efflux, indicating that luminal Ca2+ affects release by some additional mechanism that is independent of SERCA activity or cytoplasmic Ca2+. Since Robin Irvine first proposed in 1990 that regulation of the InsP3 receptor by luminal Ca2+ might account for the receptor's unusual kinetic properties (the so-called quantal or incremental release phenomenon) (34Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), numerous studies have attempted to examine this hypothesis, often with conflicting conclusions. More recently, the InsP3 receptor has become an attractive candidate for the molecular transducer that links the filling state of stores with the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (54Kiselyov K. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessahl I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnhaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 55Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to renewed interest in whether the InsP3R can be influenced by intrastore [Ca2+]. In this work we used a new tool for manipulating free [Ca2+] within the lumen of the agonist-sensitive store (TPEN). Our data clearly indicate that luminal [Ca2+] can modulate InsP3- and agonist-induced Ca2+ efflux, in large part through effects on Ca2+ pumps. There was, however, an additional component of regulation by luminal [Ca2+], which was independent of regulation by cytoplasmic [Ca2+] or actions on the SERCAs. The data presented here provide direct proof that luminal Ca2+ modulates Ca2+ release in intact cells where native buffering and Ca2+ handling mechanisms have been preserved. This regulation by luminal Ca2+ may constitute an additional means for tuning the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm during agonist stimulation. Our data do not allow us to say whether this regulation occurs directly at the level of the InsP3R, but the model system we have described here offers several advantages for pursuing this question in future studies. Importantly, our approach for manipulating luminal [Ca2+] did not require inhibition of the SERCA pump, and in fact, our data demonstrate that lowering ER [Ca2+] allows the pump to work much more effectively. This phenomenon probably constitutes the most important action of reduced luminal [Ca2+] in modulating the release process under physiological or pathological conditions. The fact that we were able to monitor intraluminal Ca2+ directly with magfura-2 allowed us to avoid the complications of other cellular Ca2+ handling mechanisms (i.e. the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase, buffering by mitochondria, etc.) that have confounded the interpretation of previous studies relying on measurement of cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Moreover, in contrast to 45Ca2+ measurements in permeabilized cell populations, this method also affords rapid time resolution in single intact cells, which is important since the rapid phase of the InsP3-induced release process is nearly complete within 60 s of stimulation. Apart from potentially providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the quantal Ca2+ release phenomenon and the coupling between the filling state of stores and capacitative entry, our studies also highlight the importance of store loading in determining the magnitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal following agonist stimulation. Calcium ions within stores have numerous regulatory roles (56Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), but until recently there has been little appreciation of conditions (physiological or pathological) whereby the filling state of the stores might become altered. For example, studies by Leissring et al. (57Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that expression of the mutated form of Presenilin-1, a resident ER protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, results in an increase in ER Ca2+ content. This overfilling of stores led to significant downstream defects in Ca2+ signaling, including heightened cytoplasmic spikes and attenuated Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane. Further recent data suggest that intraluminal ER [Ca2+] may serve as a control point for apoptosis (58Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Several groups have now shown that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 can lower [Ca2+] within the lumen of the ER, perhaps by creating a passive leak of Ca2+ out of this compartment that alters the resting steady state level of the cation (59Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 60Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that a reduction in the free [Ca2+] within the store attenuates Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm of intact cells, beyond that which is expected due to simple reduction of the store content. Thus, subtle changes in the resting free [Ca2+] within the ER that occur, for example, during apoptosis, may be amplified at the level of the cytoplasm, manifested as highly attenuated Ca2+ signals that ultimately influence key cellular functions governed by calcium signaling cascades. We thank Bonnie Lau for outstanding laboratory assistance and Roberto Tamma and Anna Di Brango for their participation during some of the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2053502484,"The transcription factor early growth response gene 1 (EGR1) has been implicated in diverse roles in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. Previous studies suggest that the effects of EGR1 on tumorigenesis are critically dependent on the cellular context. In a majority of prostate cancers, EGR1 is overexpressed and promotes prostate tumor progression. In contrast, in other tumor types such as breast cancers and glioblastomas, EGR1 is expressed at low levels and when overexpressed can inhibit tumor growth. To explore the role of EGR1 in prostate tumorigenesis, we examined the impact of EGR1 expression on the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. We show here that EGR1 binds to the AR in prostate carcinoma cells, and an EGR1-AR complex can be detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation at the enhancer of an endogenous AR target gene. Overexpression of EGR1 enhanced AR-mediated transactivation, whereas EGR1 knockdown by small interfering RNA inhibited AR signaling pathway activity. Furthermore, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed that constitutive overexpression of EGR1 promotes the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

In sum, the available evidence strongly suggests that the effects of EGR1 on tumor progression are critically dependent on the cellular context. We tested the hypothesis that interaction between EGR1 and the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway plays a role in the context-dependent pro-tumorigenic role of EGR1 in prostate tumorigenesis. Androgen receptor function plays a pivotal role in normal prostate development and physiology as well as prostate tumorigenesis. The transcriptional activity of the AR is modulated by a large and growing number of interacting proteins that function as coactivators and corepressors (15McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). We found that EGR1 functionally interacts with the androgen receptor in human prostate carcinoma cells. Overexpression and siRNA knockdown experiments indicate that EGR1 expression enhances AR-mediated activation of AR target genes. In addition, EGR1 enhanced the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thus EGR1 overexpression may promote prostate tumorigenesis at least in part by modulating androgen receptor function. Plasmid Constructs—pcDNA3.1-EGR1 construct was generated by subcloning an EcoRI/XbaI full-length EGR1 fragment that is resistant to the NAF1-A-binding protein (NAB) corepressors (16Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1 vector. Androgen receptor constructs consisting of pCMV-hAR, pGEX-AR1–562 (N-terminal domain), pGEX-AR544–634 (DNA-binding domain), and pGEX-AR624–924 (C-terminal domain) vectors (17Tan J.A. Hall S.H. Petrusz P. French F.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. F. S. French and J. Tan (University of North Carolina School of Medicine). A modified Renilla luciferase plasmid and the androgen-responsive luciferase reporter gene pARE luciferase plasmid were a gift from Dr. Xu Cao (University of Alabama at Birmingham) (18Bai S. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4176-4182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Stable Transfectants—The androgen receptor-positive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line DU145 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FBS, respectively. For the generation of LNCaP cell line stably expressing EGR1, LNCaP cells were plated overnight in 60-mm dishes. The cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-EGR1 or pcDNA3.1 control vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were subjected to selection using 800 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech) 48 h after transfection. The resistant clones were pooled 10–14 days later, and the cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 600 μg/ml G418. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cells lysates were prepared using extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mm hydrogen peroxide). Nuclear protein was extracted by the method of Dignam et al. (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent. Extracts containing 10–20 μg of protein were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto an Immobilon™ membrane (Millipore). The blotted membrane was treated with 5% fat-free dry milk at 4 °C overnight and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the antibodies described below. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). The membrane was rinsed, treated with ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for 1–3 min. The following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used: rabbit anti-human EGR1 antibody (1:500), mouse anti-human AR N-terminal antibody (1:500), and goat anti-actin antibody (1:1000). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation experiments, DU145 cells were grown in medium with 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (HyClone) for 24 h and then transfected with pCMV-hAR vector with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. The cells were treated with 10 nm 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma) 24 h after transfection. For LNCaP cells, the cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS for 3 days. The cells were treated with 10 nm DHT or vehicle for 1 h before harvest. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer. The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and subsequently cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent. 10 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were added to 1.5-ml microtubes containing 250 μl of cellular lysate (1 mg protein/ml) and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 rpm. Primary antibodies (anti-EGR1, anti-cyclin E (Santa Cruz), or rabbit IgG) and 10 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer. After the final wash, the precipitated protein complexes were resuspended in SDS sample loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged after vortexing, and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Production of GST-AR Fusions—BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) transformed with pGEXGST-AR1–562, pGEXGST-AR544–634, and pGEXGST-AR624–919 plasmids (17Tan J.A. Hall S.H. Petrusz P. French F.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were inoculated on a LB-agarose plate containing ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies of BL21 cells with the above plasmids were cultured in 12 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin to an A600 value of 0.6–0.8. GST fusion protein expression was induced by adding 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial pellets were lysed by sonication in 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were mixed 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). After beads with fusion protein were washed three times with PBS, fusion protein was collected by glutathione elution buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by Western blot using an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz). GST Pull-down Assay—Beads with the above GST-AR fusion protein were incubated with nuclear lysates from LNCaP cells. GST-AR-EGR1 complexes were washed with nuclear protein extraction buffer three times, eluted with SDS sample loading buffer, and then analyzed by Western blot. Dual Luciferase Gene Reporter Experiment—DU145 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated overnight in 6-well plates in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS. 24 h after transfection with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 10 nm DHT. The cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase was measured using a Promega (Madison, WI) dual luciferase assay kit. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—LNCaP-EGR1 and LNCaP-Neo control cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS for 3 days. The cells were treated with 10 nm DHT 90 min before harvesting. RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed. PCR was performed by SYBR® green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as described using the relative standard curve method (7Svaren J. Ehrig T. Abdulkadir S.A. Ehrengruber M.U. Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38524-38531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence of the SYBR green dye was monitored using a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All of the PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. The values were normalized to the relative amounts of 18 S mRNA. The sequences of primers used for PCR analyses are as follows: PSA, 5′-CAACCCTGGACCTCACACCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAAATGACCAGGCCAAGAC-3′ (antisense); 18 S, 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT-3′ (antisense). RNA Interference—LNCaP cells (1 × 105) were plated overnight in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% regular FBS. The transfection was performed as described by the manufacturer with TransIT-TKO® transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) using EGR1 siRNA or control GFP siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested. EGR1 expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Sequences of EGR1 siRNA and control GFP siRNA are 5′-AGAGGCAUACCAAGAUCCA-3′ and 5′-GCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS for 3 days. The cells were then treated with 10 nm DHT for 1 h and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, collected into PBS with protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitor mixture, incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated six times at 10 s each at 50% input using a Branson Ultrasonics Sonicator (Danbury, CT), followed by centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatants were diluted in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm NaCl, pH 8.1), followed by immunoclearing with salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human AR polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-human EGR1 polyclonal antibody, or rabbit IgG. After immunoprecipitation, protein A-agarose was added and incubated overnight. Agarose beads were washed sequentially for 10 min each in low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, and LiCl immune complex wash buffer. The beads were then washed two times with TE buffer and extracted two times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Histone-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was recovered by a Geneclean® III kit (Midwest Scientific). For PCR, 5 μl of 50 μl of DNA was used in 30 cycles of amplification. The AREIII primers used are 5′-GAGGTTCATGTTCACATTAGTACAC-3′ (sense), and 5′-ATTCTGGGTTTGGCAGTGGAGTGC-3′ (antisense). Immunofluorescence—LNCaP-EGR1 and LNCaP-Neo cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS on coverslips fixed in cold acetone for 10 min and air-dried. The cells were blocked in 4% normal serum in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 30 min. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-human AR antibody was used at 5 mg/ml and incubated for2hat room temperature followed by three 10-min washes. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores (Molecular Probes) were used at 5 mg/ml and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by three 10-min washes. The coverslips were mounted with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). The images were captured with a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments) mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope. EGR1 Binds to the AR in Prostate Carcinoma Cells—In previous studies using recombinant proteins produced in bacteria, EGR1 was shown to interact specifically with the androgen receptor in vitro (20Curtin D. Jenkins S. Farmer N. Anderson A.C. Haisenleder D.J. Rissman E. Wilson E.M. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGR1 interacts with AR in human prostate carcinoma cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145, which does not express detectable levels of AR, was transfected with the pCMV-AR plasmid encoding the full-length human androgen receptor cDNA (17Tan J.A. Hall S.H. Petrusz P. French F.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in (Fig. 1A), a 110-kDa band corresponding to the AR was detected in immunoprecipitates using anti-EGR1 antibody but not in those from control rabbit IgG. The interaction between EGR1 and AR was strongest in cells treated with DHT. This is probably a reflection of the fact that EGR1 is a nuclear protein, and the AR translocation to the nucleus is dependent on DHT. To investigate whether EGR1 binds to endogenous AR in prostate cancer cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using LNCaP cells, which express both AR and EGR1. Anti-EGR1 antibody, but not control IgG, coimmunoprecipitated AR in LNCaP cells grown in medium containing normal FBS (Fig. 1B). When grown in the absence of androgens, a weaker but readily detectable interaction between EGR1 and AR was observed in LNCaP cells, and this interaction is further increased by treatment with DHT or the testosterone analogue R1881 (Fig. 1, C and D). An additional control coimmunoprecipitation with anti-cyclin E antibody further demonstrates the specificity of the EGR1-AR interaction (Fig. 1C). EGR1 Binds to N-terminal Domain of AR—To determine which portion of AR interacts with EGR1, we used GST pull-down assays. We expressed and purified GST fusion proteins encoding different domains of the androgen receptor corresponding to the N-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2, A and B). GST pull-down experiments indicate that EGR1 interacts exclusively with the N-terminal activation domain of AR and that this interaction is independent of DHT (Fig. 2C). EGR1 Binds to Androgen Response Elements (AREs) in the Upstream Domain of the PSA Gene—After translocation to the nucleus, AR forms a complex on the androgen response elements (AREs) present in the regulatory regions of its target genes. To investigate whether EGR1 forms a complex with AR on the AREs of a native promoter in vivo, we used ChIP assays. We examined the interaction of AR and EGR1 on the AREIII element of the well known AR target gene, PSA (Fig. 3A). LNCaP cells were grown in medium containing charcoal/dextran-stripped serum for at least 3 days followed by treatment with 10 nm DHT. Specific antibodies against EGR1 or AR were used to immunoprecipitate bound genomic DNA fragments. As expected, AR antibody precipitated AREIII in a DHT-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Antibody against EGR1 also precipitated the AREIII element, indicating that EGR1 complexed with AR could interact with a native AR-target gene promoter/enhancer in vivo. Importantly, this interaction is dependent on DHT (Fig. 3B), supporting the conclusion that EGR1 does not directly bind to the AREIII but is recruited through complex formation with AR. Additional control ChIP experiments with normal rabbit IgG further demonstrate the specificity of the interactions. EGR1 Augments AR-mediated Transcription—To assess the functional significance of the EGR1-AR interaction, we assessed the effect of EGR1 expression on AR-mediated activation of an ARE luciferase promoter-reporter construct. In DU145 cells, transfection of EGR1 and AR in the absence of DHT had a modest stimulatory effect on ARE luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 4A). As expected, DHT treatment stimulated AR activity, and this ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of AR was further enhanced significantly by EGR1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Expression of EGR1 alone in the absence of AR had no effect on ARE luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that EGR1 augments AR-mediated transcription, and this effect is mediated through the interaction between the two proteins. EGR1 Expression Enhances Androgen-induced PSA mRNA Expression—To extend the above results to an endogenous AR target gene, we monitored the effect of EGR1 overexpression on the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. We first established LNCaP cell lines stably overexpressing EGR1 (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, relative to untreated LNCaP-Neo cells, DHT treatment induced PSA gene expression about 9-fold in LNCaP-Neo cells and ∼18-fold in LNCaP-EGR1 cells. Interestingly, LNCaP-EGR1 cells consistently showed elevated expression of PSA even in the absence of DHT (Fig. 5B). Effect of EGR1 on Nuclear Translocation of AR in LNCaP Cells—The observation that LNCaP-EGR1 cells expressed elevated levels of PSA even in the absence of androgens prompted us to examine whether EGR1 expression can promote the translocation of AR from cytoplasm to nucleus. In the absence of androgens, the AR is localized to the cytoplasm in an inactive complex that includes heat shock proteins. Upon binding to its cognate ligand, the AR undergoes a conformational change that results in a more compact and stable form of the AR. The activated AR dissociates from heat shock protein and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to consensus DNA sequences as a homodimer to influence transcription of down-stream genes (21Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). We observed changes in intracellular distribution of AR in LNCaP cells stably expressing EGR1 by Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. Western blot for nuclear protein showed that most of AR protein translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus in LNCaP-Neo and LNCaP-EGR1 1 h after exposure to 10 nm DHT (Fig. 6A). In the absence of DHT, there was a modestly higher level of nuclear AR protein in LNCaP-EGR1 cells compared with LNCaP-Neo cells. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed these results. Without DHT, AR protein in LNCaP-Neo control cells was mainly present in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus with DHT treatment (Fig. 6B). In LNCaP-EGR1 cells on the other hand, AR expression could be detected in the nucleus in addition to the cytoplasm in the absence of DHT. Nuclear AR reactivity was further increased upon DHT treatment. These results suggest that EGR1 overexpression can promote translocation of AR from cytoplasm to nucleus. RNA Interference with EGR1-siRNA Inhibits PSA Expression in LNCaP Cells—To determine whether down-regulation of endogenously expressed EGR1 in prostate carcinoma cells can modulate PSA gene expression, we employed siRNA targeting EGR1. LNCaP cells growing in medium containing 10% regular FBS were transfected with siEGR1 RNA duplexes or control siRNA specific for GFP. It should be noted that regular FBS contains testosterone and DHT, which drive androgen receptor-dependent PSA gene expression. Western blot analysis performed on extracts prepared 48 h after transfection indicates that the siEGR1 leads to a significant reduction in EGR1 protein levels without an effect on AR levels (Fig. 7A). PSA levels were measured by RT-PCR. The results show that EGR1 knockdown by siEGR1 resulted in down-regulation of PSA gene expression 3-fold relative to the expression in siGFP transfected cells (Fig. 7B). These results further confirm that EGR1 expression promotes AR transcriptional activity in prostate carcinoma cells. The androgen receptor signaling pathway plays a crucial role in normal prostate physiology and prostate tumorigenesis (21Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Human prostate carcinomas are generally androgen-sensitive and react to hormonal therapy by temporary remission, which is invariably followed by relapse to an androgen-independent state. The molecular mechanisms of transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence remain poorly understood, and a number of possibilities have been explored to explain this phenomenon. Earlier theories postulated that androgen-independent cells might not express the AR, or the AR gene could be mutated from androgen-independent tumors to a molecule unable to be activated by androgen. However, several studies show that there is a higher average of AR in androgen-dependent tumors, and the mutation in the AR is present in a low percentage of local recurrence of androgen-independent tumor (22van der Kwast T.H.

Urology. 2002; 60: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the AR signaling pathway remains active in androgen-independent prostate cancers (21Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). How are androgen-dependent genes activated in a low androgen medium such as that of patients under maximum androgen blockage? AR coactivators may contribute to the AR activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Their overexpression in prostate cancer could make AR signaling pathway be in a superactive state so that AR transcription is activated in a very low androgen concentration (25Gregory C.W. He B. Johnson R.T. Ford O.H. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4315-4319PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto N. Mizokami A. Harada S. Matsumoto T. Urology. 2001; 58: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that signaling pathways of some cytokines and growth factors may activate unliganded AR. They modify AR protein through interactions with AR or AR coactivators, activating AR signaling (27Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Eur.

However, in other tumor types such as breast cancer and glioblastoma, EGR1 behaves as a growth suppressor (12Huang R.P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M.M. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Calogero A. Arcella A. De Gregorio G. Porcellini A. Mercola D. Liu C. Lombari V. Zani M. Giannini G. Gagliardi F.M. Caruso R. Gulino A. Frati L. Ragona G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2788-2796PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the effects of EGR1 in promoting prostate tumorigenesis are mediated, at least in part, by functional interaction with the AR signaling pathway in prostate cells. EGR1 physically interacts with AR and is part of a complex that forms on the regulatory regions of endogenous AR target genes. Furthermore, this interaction translates into increased gene expression for the target gene we have examined, PSA. Our in vitro GST pull-down experiments mapped EGR1 interaction to the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor. Quantitation of PSA expression in LNCaP-EGR1 cells showed that EGR1 modestly enhanced AR-mediated gene activation even in the absence of androgens. This effect is likely due to the fact that significant EGR1 overexpression promotes the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It is possible that the outcome of EGR1-AR interaction could differ for other AR target genes. Also, our study has not examined the impact of EGR1-AR interaction on the regulation of EGR1 target genes. This is an interesting area for future investigation. In summary, we have identified interaction between EGR1 and AR in prostate carcinoma cells. The fact that EGR1 is frequently overexpressed in human prostate cancer makes this interaction potentially significant. We propose that the interaction between EGR1 and the AR signaling pathway may explain part of the prostate-specific pro-tumorigenic effect of EGR1. Further investigation of this interaction will increase our knowledge of context-dependent regulation of tumorigenesis and may help us to identify new steps that can be targeted for prostate cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2022828329,"ABCR, also known as ABCA4, is a member of the superfamily of ATP binding cassette transporters that is believed to transport retinal or retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine across photoreceptor disk membranes. Mutations in the ABCR gene are responsible for Stargardt macular dystrophy and related retinal dystrophies that cause severe loss in vision. ABCR consists of two tandemly arranged halves each containing a membrane spanning segment followed by a large extracellular/lumen domain, a multi-spanning membrane domain, and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). To define the role of each NBD, we examined the nucleotide binding and ATPase activities of the N and C halves of ABCR individually and co-expressed in COS-1 cells and derived from trypsin-cleaved ABCR in disk membranes. When disk membranes or membranes from co-transfected cells were photoaffinity labeled with 8-azido-ATP and 8-azido-ADP, only the NBD2 in the C-half bound and trapped the nucleotide. Co-expressed half-molecules displayed basal and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity similar to full-length ABCR. The individually expressed N-half displayed weak 8-azido-ATP labeling and low basal ATPase activity that was not stimulated by retinal, whereas the C-half did not bind ATP and exhibited little if any ATPase activity. Purified ABCR contained one tightly bound ADP, presumably in NBD1. Our results indicate that only NBD2 of ABCR binds and hydrolyzes ATP in the presence or absence of retinal. NBD1, containing a bound ADP, associates with NBD2 to play a crucial, non-catalytic role in ABCR function.

ABCR, formerly known as the Rim protein, is a member of the ABCA subclass of ATP binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; ROS, rod outer segments; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MSD, multi-spanning membrane domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; MRP1, multidrug resistance protein 1; TAP1/TAP2, transporter associated with antigen processing.1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; ROS, rod outer segments; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MSD, multi-spanning membrane domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; MRP1, multidrug resistance protein 1; TAP1/TAP2, transporter associated with antigen processing. transporters that is found along the rims and incisures of rod and cone photoreceptor outer segment disk membranes (1Papermaster D.S.

This transport process enables all-trans-retinal to be effectively reduced to all-trans-retinol by retinol dehydrogenase on the surface of disk membranes as a key step in the recycling of all-trans-retinal to 11-cis retinal for regeneration of rhodopsin and cone opsin. Importantly it prevents the buildup of retinal and retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine in disk membranes that otherwise can further react to form toxic diretinal side products (8Sakai N. Decatur J.

Stargardt macular dystrophy, the most common disease associated with mutations in ABCR, is an early onset disease characterized by progressive loss of central vision, delayed dark adaptation, accumulation of yellow deposits known as lipofuscin within the central retina, and atrophy of macular region of the retina and underlying retinal pigment epithelial cells. Abcr knockout mice exhibit many of these features including delayed dark adaptation, accumulation of lipofuscin deposits containing the diretinyl compound A2E in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and slow progressive photoreceptor degeneration (7Weng J.

Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).ABC transporters typically consist of two multi-spanning membrane domains (MSDs) that serve as a pathway for the translocation of a substrate across membranes and two ATP binding cassettes or nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) that provide the energy for substrate transport (18Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic ABC transporters, these domains are typically found either on a single long polypeptide chain as in the case of CFTR and the multidrug resistance proteins, P-glycoprotein and MRP1, or as a complex of two identical or similar “half-molecule” subunits each having an MSD and an NBD, as found in the TAP1/TAP2 ABC transporter associated with peptide antigen processing. ABCR belongs in the first category, because it consists of a single 2273-amino acid polypeptide comprised of two tandemly arranged halves (2Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L.

Each half contains an MSD followed by a cytoplasmic NBD. A distinguishing feature of ABCR and other members of the ABCA subfamily is the presence of a large exocytoplasmic (extracellular/lumen) domain that connects the first transmembrane segment to the MSD in each half of the protein (2Illing M.

In the case of P-glycoprotein, the NBDs of the N and C halves both exhibit ATP binding properties and ATPase activities, but interaction of both halves is required for drug-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP-dependent drug transport (21Loo T.W.

NBD1 on the N-half of MRP1 is preferentially labeled with 8-azido-ATP when the N-half is expressed by itself or together with the C-half, whereas NBD2 on the C-half traps 8-azido-ADP, but only if this half is co-expressed with the N-half (23Gao M.

The functioning of MRP1 as a leukotriene C4 transporter also requires the interaction of both halves of MRP1 (25Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Nucleotide binding studies have also been carried out on TAP1/TAP2, CFTR, and SUR1, a subunit of the pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive (K ATP) channel (26Karttunen J.T. Lehner P.J. Gupta S.S.

In these proteins, stable ATP binding occurs at NBD1, whereas ATP hydrolysis and/or ADP trapping takes place at NBD2. These studies indicate that the nucleotide binding and enzymatic properties of each NBD differ significantly for these ABC transporters. To date analysis of the nucleotide binding and ATPase activity of the individual NBD in context of the half-molecules has not been studied for any of the ABCA subfamily members.To define the functional role of each NBD of ABCR, we have analyzed the ATPase activity, ATP/ADP photoaffinity labeling, ADP trapping, and nucleotide content of full-length and the N and C halves generated by individual or co-expression in COS-1 cells and trypsin cleavage of ABCR in ROS disk membranes. Here, we show that the N and C halves of ABCR associate to form a complex having basal and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity and 8-azido-ATP labeling properties similar to full-length ABCR. The two NBDs have remarkably different, although interdependent functions. NBD2 in the full-length or NC complex binds and hydrolyzes ATP, whereas NBD1 appears to contain a tightly bound ADP suggesting that this domain may play a non-catalytic function. In contrast, the individually expressed N-half exhibits very weak 8-azido-ATP labeling and low ATPase activity, and the C-half does not bind detectable levels of ATP and shows little if any ATPase activity. Our studies restrict possible mechanisms by which ABCR utilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across photoreceptor disk membranes.MATERIALS AND METHODSMonoclonal Antibodies and Plasmids—The Rim3F4 and Rim5B4 monoclonal antibodies directed against defined epitopes on the C-half and N-half of ABCR, respectively, and the Rho 1D4 monoclonal antibody to the nine-amino acid C-terminal sequence of rhodopsin have been described previously (2Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 3Molday L.L. Rabin A.R. Molday R.S. Nat.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Human ABCR cDNA, generously provided by J. Nathans, The Johns Hopkins University, was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce pcABCR. The cDNAs coding for the N-half (amino acids 1–1325) and C-half (amino acids 1326–2273) of ABCR were constructed by PCR using pcABCR as a template and the following primer pairs: N-half, GAGCCCTGTGGCCGGCCAGCTGTG (FseI) and GCTCTAGATTACGGCGCCCCTGGGGAGCAGACATTGG (XbaI); N-half-1D4, GAGCCCTGTGGCCGGCCAGCTGTG (FseI) and GCTCTAGATTAGGCAGGCGCCACTTGGCTGGTCTCTGTCGGCGCCCCTGGGGAGCAGACATTGG (XbaI); C-half, TGCTCCAAGCTTAGCATGGCTGCTCACCCAGAGGG (HindIII) and CAGGGGTACTCCGGAAGC (BspE1). The restriction sites used to insert the PCR products are indicated in parentheses and underlined when introduced within the primer sequence. The bases coding for the 1D4 epitope are shown in italics. The PCR products were digested with the indicated restriction enzymes and ligated into pcA-BCR that had been digested with the same enzymes. K969M and K1978M mutations were inserted by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and the following mutagenic primers (introduced mutations in bold): K969M, CCACAATGGAGCTGGGATGACCACCACCTTGTCC and GGACAAGGTGGTGGTCATCCCAGCTCCATTGTGG; K1978M, GAATGGTGCCGGCATGACAACCACATTCAAGATGC and GCATCTTGAATGTGGTTGTCATGCCGGCACCATTC. The AflII-ClaI (1.9 kb) and the Eco72I (0.26 kb) fragments of the resulting PCR products containing the K969M and K1978M mutations, respectively, were cloned into the original pcABCR. For the K969M/K1978M double mutant, the AflII-FseI restriction fragment of pcABCR[K1978M] was replaced with that of pcABCR[K969M]. To create the C-half[K1978M] mutant, the HindIII/-BspE1 digested PCR product from above (for constructing the C-half) was used to replace the 4-kb HindIII/BspE1 fragment of pcABCR[K1978M]. The cDNA for the N-half-1D4 of ABCA1 (amino acids 1–1302) was made by replacing the 4.2-kb PmlI-XbaI fragment of pcABCA1 with a 0.9-kb PCR product amplified with the following primers: CACATCTGGTTCTATGCC and CCTCTAGATTAGGCAGGCGCCACTTGGCTGGTCTCTGTGGATTCTGGGTCTATGTC. The cDNA coding for the C-half of ABCA1 (amino acids 1303–2261) containing the 3F4 epitope was synthesized by PCR (2.9 kb) with the following primers: ACTGATGCGGCCGCGGGAACATGGAATCCAGAGAGACAGACTTG and TCCGCTAGCGTTTAAACTCATCCAGTTCGAGGGTGCAAAGGCAGATCGTATACATAGCTTTCTTTCAC (bases coding for the 3F4 epitope in italics) and cloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) at the NotI/PmeI sites. All PCR amplified sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Transfection of COS-1 and 293-EBNA Cells—Monkey kidney fibroblast cell line COS-1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were grown in the above Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 g/liter G418. Cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and transfected the following day with 30 μg of plasmid per dish using the calcium phosphate method. The next day, cells were rinsed with 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and supplied with complete medium for 24 h.Purification and Reconstitution—ABCR was purified and reconstituted following previously published procedures (5Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Ahn J. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 864-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cell suspension (from two 10-cm dishes) was added slowly to 1.0 ml of Buffer C (10 mg/ml sonicated soybean phospholipids, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4) containing 18 mm CHAPS and COMPLETE protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and stirred for 20 min on ice. The supernatant after a 10-min centrifugation at 90,000 × g (TLA100.4 rotor in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge) was mixed with 50 μlof Rim3F4-Sepharose 2B beads for1hat4 °C. The beads were washed six times in Buffer C containing 10 mm CHAPS and eluted with 0.2 mg/ml Rim3F4 peptide. Purified protein (24 μl) was incubated with 9 μl of 50 mg/ml lipid (1:1 mixture of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and brain polar lipid, by weight) and 3 μl of n-octylglucoside for 30 min on ice. The mixture was diluted rapidly with 200 μl of Buffer E (1 mm DTT, 1mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4) and passed through 200 μl of Extracti-gel resin (Pierce). The flow-through containing the reconstituted protein was used for determination of ATPase activity.ATPase Activity—ATP hydrolysis was measured using 50 μm [α-32P]ATP and thin layer chromatography as described previously (30Ahn J. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 864-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The all-trans-retinal concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ383 nm = 42.88 mm–1 cm–1). Protein concentration was estimated from the eluate before reconstitution by laser densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. This method gives an overestimation of the actual protein content after reconstitution (hence lower specific activity), because recovery from the Extracti-gel column is less than 100%. Direct protein measurements after reconstitution by densitometry of Western blots were about half of that in the eluate. However, the latter method gave variable results, so protein concentration after reconstitution was extrapolated from that in the eluate assuming 100% recovery.Preparation of Membranes—Membranes from transfected cells were prepared as described previously (19Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the protocol was scaled down, and the cell homogenate from one or two 10-cm dishes, after passing through a 26-gauge needle (six times), was centrifuged on a discontinuous gradient consisting of 5 and 60% sucrose for 30 min at 77,000 × g (TLS55 rotor).8-Azido-ATP Photoaffinity Labeling—Membranes (50–150 μg of protein) in 50 μl of labeling buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) were incubated with 1–5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (13 Ci/mmol; Affinity Labeling Technologies) on ice with gentle shaking under UV light (254 nm) for 10 min at a distance of 10 cm. Ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation (TLA45 rotor, 55000 × g, 15 min). The membranes were resuspended in 200 μl in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) and added to 200 μl of 2% Triton X-100 in TBS. After 30 min on ice, the cleared extract was mixed with 25 μl of antibody coupled to Sepharose 2B for 1–12 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and eluted twice, 30 μl each, in 4% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100, TBS.8-Azido-ATP Trapping—Membranes were incubated with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in 50 μl of labeling buffer with or without 800 μm sodium orthovanadate for 10 min at 37 °C. All-trans-retinal and 50 μm DTT were added where indicated. Binding was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation and washed one more time. Samples exposed to orthovanadate were washed in the presence of 800 μm orthovanadate. In some experiments MgATP (10 mm) was included in the wash step but had no effect. The membranes were suspended in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, irradiated with UV light for 10 min on ice, diluted to 200 μl with TBS, and solubilized as described above for azido-ATP binding.Trypsin Cleavage of Bovine ABCR—Bovine ROS were isolated as described previously (31Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and treated with 1.6–4.0 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 0 °C (19Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor.8-Azido-ADP Photoaffinity Labeling—Thoroughly washed ROS membranes were labeled with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (16.8 Ci/mmol; Affinity Labeling Technologies) for 15 to 30 min as described for 8-azido-ATP labeling. DTT at a final concentration of 10 mm was added to quench the reaction. After 15 min, ice-cold Tris-EDTA buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was added, and the membranes were washed five times by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 15 min (TLA45). The membranes were suspended in 50 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, and an equal volume of buffer containing trypsin (4 μg) was added. After 30 min on ice, the membranes were treated with trypsin inhibitor (50 μg). Cold Tris-EDTA buffer was added, and the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation.To remove tightly bound nucleotides, membranes were treated as follows (32Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The washed membrane pellet (4 mg) was resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm Na2SO4, 50% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2,50mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against three changes of the same buffer at 4 °C (2 × 500 ml for 3 h each, 1000 ml overnight). The sample (100 μl) was diluted with labeling buffer and photolabeled as described above.The washed membranes (4 mg) were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm Na2SO4, 50% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm CHAPS, stirred in a glass tube at 4 °C for 1 h, and dialyzed against three changes of resuspension buffer. The solubilized membranes, 100 μl, were centrifuged through a column of Sephadex G-50 (previously equilibrated with labeling buffer). The volume was made up to 100 μl with labeling buffer, and the sample was photoaffinity labeled as described above. This was then passed through another column centrifugation procedure to remove unbound label. Half of the labeled sample was subjected to trypsin digestion as described above.Determination of Adenine Nucleotide Content—Typically, 48 mg of ROS membranes were used to purify ABCR by immunoaffinity chromatography with or without nucleotide treatment during solubilization. Nucleotide determinations were done in triplicate. The solubilized, immunoaffinity purified ABCR was concentrated to about 400–500 μl by centrifugation (8000 × g for 30 min) using a 2-ml Amicon Centricon (8000 molecular weight cut-off). Approximately 400 μl of concentrated ABCR in an acid-washed glass tube was heated in a water bath for 10 min. A tube with buffer only was similarly treated and used as the background subtract. This method was chosen so as to avoid the possibility of any released ATP being hydrolyzed by ABCR (see analogous situation with F1-ATPase (33Senior A.E. Lee R.S. al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). The test tubes were then placed on ice and cooled for 10 min followed by centrifugation in a table-top centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min. Samples containing known amounts of ATP and ADP were similarly treated so as to determine the percent hydrolysis of nucleotides under similar conditions. Usually, duplicates of 10, 100, and 1000 nm concentrations of ATP and ADP were used. An aliquot of each sample was used for ATP determinations (100 μl for each assay). The remaining 200-μl sample was used to convert ADP to ATP by adding 100 μl of pyruvate kinase-phosphoenol pyruvate ADP assay mixture, prepared as described by Hampp (34Hampp R. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. 2. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 370-378Google Scholar). The luminometric procedure outlined by Sigma in their ATP bioluminescent assay kit (technical bulletin BAAB-1) was used to assay for ATP. Samples (100 μl for ATP and 10 μl for ATP + ADP) of each fraction were made up to 100 μl, if necessary, with a buffer of 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 24 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. This was then added to 100 μl of diluted (1:1) ATP assay mix at room temperature. The relative intensity was noted after 10 s. The instrument used in these assays was the LKB 1250 luminometer linked to an LKB 1250 display and recorder unit. Light intensity was calibrated by comparison with light emissions from known concentrations of ATP (usually in the 100 nm range). Bound ADP was calculated from the difference between total nucleotide (after conversion of ADP to ATP with pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate) and the concentration of ATP (determined without conversion of ADP to ATP). Hence the moles of ATP and ADP present were calculated. Essentially, the procedures outlined by Beharry and Bragg (35Beharry S. Bragg P.D. Biochem.

Note that only acid-washed glassware was used throughout the experiments, and all the precautions mentioned in the papers above were observed.The protein concentrations were determined from Coomassie Blue-stained gels using laser densitometry and/or a FluorChem TM 8000 gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). A set of bovine serum albumin standards (0.1 to 1.0 μg) were run, and the protein concentration of the ABCR used was determined from the plot of the standards. From the calculated moles of ATP and ADP and ABCR, the mol ATP and ADP/mol ABCR were determined.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels (unless noted otherwise), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained in 10% acetic acid, and soaked in water. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to a storage phosphor screen. Duplicate samples were run on another gel for transfer and analysis by Western blots (6Ahn J. Wong J.T. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

CarA is homologous to β-lactam synthetase (β-LS), which is involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. The catalytic cycles of CarA and β-LS mediate substrate adenylation followed by β-lactamization via a tetrahedral intermediate or transition state. Another member of this family of ATP/Mg2+-dependent enzymes, asparagine synthetase (AS-B), catalyzes intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, amide bond formation in asparagine biosynthesis. The crystal structures of apo-CarA and CarA complexed with the substrate (2S,5S)-5-carboxymethylproline (CMPr), ATP analog α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-CPP), and a single Mg2+ ion have been determined. CarA forms a tetramer. Each monomer resembles β-LS and AS-B in overall fold, but key differences are observed. The N-terminal domain lacks the glutaminase active site found in AS-B, and an extended loop region not observed in β-LS or AS-B is present. Comparison of the C-terminal synthetase active site to that in β-LS reveals that the ATP binding site is highly conserved. By contrast, variations in the substrate binding pocket reflect the different substrates of the two enzymes. The Mg2+ coordination is also different. Several key residues in the active site are conserved between CarA and β-LS, supporting proposed roles in β-lactam formation. These data provide further insight into the structures of this class of enzymes and suggest that CarA might be a versatile target for protein engineering experiments aimed at developing improved production methods and new carbapenem antibiotics.

The carbapenem class of β-lactam antibiotics exhibits a broad spectrum of activity and is resistant to inactivation by β-lactamases (1Neu H.C. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 7: S3-S10Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The core structure of carbapenems consists of a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a five-membered ring containing only carbon atoms (2McGowan S.J. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P.C.

A detailed understanding of carbapenem biosynthesis is thus crucial to developing improved production procedures as well as new antibiotics. Whereas knowledge of carbapenem biosynthesis by the streptomycetes remains limited, the genes encoding carbapenem biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned from two Gram-negative bacteria, Erwinia carotovora (6McGowan S.J.

Both of these organisms produce the simplest carbapenem, (5R)-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid (8Parker W.L. Rathnum M.L. Wells J.S. Trejo W.H. Principe P.A. Sykes R.B. J.

Although this compound itself is not clinically useful, it contains the same nucleus as the thienamycin derivatives, suggesting that its biosynthesis could be engineered to generate other carbapenem antibiotics or semisynthetic intermediates. Five proteins, encoded by the carA-E genes, are involved in (5R)-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid biosynthesis, and three, encoded by carA-C and called CarA, CarB, and CarC, are absolutely essential (9McGowan S.J.

Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CarC is weakly homologous to clavaminate synthase, a nonheme iron α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes hydroxylation, cyclization, and desaturation reactions in clavulanic acid biosynthesis (13Salowe S.P. Marsh E.N. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6499-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Z. Ren J. Stammers D.K. Baldwin J.E. Harlos K. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct.

The crystal structure of CarC reveals a jellyroll fold characteristic of this enzyme family and details of Fe(II), α-ketoglutarate, and substrate binding (5Clifton I.J. Doan L.X. Sleeman M.C. Topf M.

CarA is homologous to β-lactam synthetase (β-LS), an ATP/Mg2+-dependent enzyme that catalyzes formation of the β-lactam ring in clavulanic acid (Fig. 1) (15Bachmann B.O. Li R. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16McNaughton H.J. Thirkettle J.E. Zhang Z. Schofield C.J. Jensen S.E. Barton B. Greaves P. Chem.

A. 2002; 99: 14752-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) data, the β-LS mechanism is proposed to involve substrate adenylation followed by β-lactamization via a tetrahedral intermediate or transition state. The chemistry performed by CarA is similar. Its ability to catalyze β-lactam formation in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ has been demonstrated in vitro, and activity assays with alternative substrates are consistent with formation of an adenylated intermediate (12Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sequence homology and mechanistic parallels between CarA and β-LS extend to class B asparagine synthetase (AS-B), which converts aspartic acid to asparagine (20Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 145-198PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas CarA and β-LS catalyze intramolecular amide bond formation, the AS-B reaction involves intermolecular amide bond formation between adenylated aspartic acid and ammonia. AS-B contains two active sites, an N-terminal glutaminase site where ammonia is generated by hydrolysis of glutamine and a C-terminal synthetase site where aspartic acid is adenylated and then reacts with ammonia to form asparagine. The two active sites are connected by an extended tunnel (21Larsen T.M. Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G.J. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the AS-B N-terminal domain is conserved in β-LS, glutaminase activity is not observed (15Bachmann B.O. Li R. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), consistent with the absence of crucial catalytic residues and the tunnel between domains (18Miller M.T. Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The differences between the β-LS and AS-B N-terminal domains together with variations in the C-terminal active sites reveal how the two enzymes accommodate β-lactam formation versus asparagine synthesis (18Miller M.T. Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further investigate the evolutionary connections among this family of ATP/Mg2+-dependent amide synthesizing enzymes, we have determined the x-ray structure of CarA in the absence of exogenous ligands (apo) and in the presence of substrate, CMPr, ATP analog, α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-CPP), and a single Mg2+ ion. Protein Overexpression and Purification—CarA for initial crystallization trials and soaking experiments was expressed as described previously (12Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To generate selenomethionine-substituted protein, the expression vector pET24a/carA (10Li R. Stapon A. Blanchfield J.T. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9296-9297Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3) (Novagen). Colonies from this transformation were used to inoculate two 5-ml tubes of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After 16 h at 37 °C, 5 ml were used to inoculate a 100-ml culture in LB. This culture was incubated for 6 h, and then the cells were split into two 500-ml cultures of M9 minimal medium supplemented with amino acids, vitamins, 40 mg/liter selenomethionine, and 50 mg/liter kanamycin (22Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown in 2-liter baffled Erlenmeyer flasks for 16 h and then transferred to a fermenter containing 10 liters of the same medium supplemented with 200 ml 20% (w/v) glucose. At an A 600 of 0.9, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 200 ml 20% (w/v) glucose, and 2 ml antifoam (Sigma) were added. During the induction period, the impellor speed was increased to 750 rpm, the airflow rate was maximized, and a pH of 7 was maintained by manual addition of ammonium hydroxide. Three hours after induction, at an A 600 of 2.0, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The purification protocols for both native and selenomethionine-substituted CarA were based on described procedures (12Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thawed cell paste (∼50 g) was resuspended in 200 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.8 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. While stirring on ice, 0.75 μg/ml lysozyme (Research Organics) was added to the solution followed 10 min later by 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Research Organics) and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm. The solution was sonicated at 4 °C using a Sonic Dismembrator (VWR Scientific) with a 0.5 inch probe for 5 min of 1 s pulses at power level 7. The sonicated suspension was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. After 35 and 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation, the pellet from the 65% cut was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT. This solution was transferred to a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff SnakeSkin dialysis membrane (Pierce) and dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT at 4 °C for 12 h with three changes of buffer. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a 53 ml High Load 16/10 Q-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 4 column volumes of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT, CarA was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl 10 column volume gradient. CarA-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, applied in 5-ml aliquots to a 175-ml Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted at 1 ml/min with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Purified CarA was concentrated to 13 mg/ml using an Amicon stirred cell with a YM-10 membrane followed by a Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore) and stored at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay calibrated with a bovine serum albumin standard. The native molecular mass of purified CarA was estimated by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S300HR column calibrated with the following protein standards (Amersham Biosciences): ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). Each protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—Initial crystallization trials for both native and selenomethionine-substituted CarA were conducted using the Hampton Research Crystal Screens HT™ and Index HT™ in 96-well sitting drop trays. Crystallization drops containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of well solution were equilibrated versus 50 μl of each screen solution. The optimized precipitant solution for selenomethionine-substituted protein consisted of 30% (w/v) PEG 3350, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.3. For data collection, these crystals were transferred to a cryosolution composed of 30% (w/v) PEG 3350, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.3, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 250 mm NaCl. After a 1–5-min soak, the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of native CarA were obtained by the hanging drop method using 23–26% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 210–250 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm cesium chloride. Microseeding was required to produce sufficiently large crystals. Soaking was performed in a solution containing 26% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm cesium chloride, 5 mm AMP-CPP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm CMPr. CMPr was synthesized as described previously (12Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After 6 h, crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at –160 °C by using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9–1. Data for multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing were collected using the inverse beam technique. Both the selenomethionine-substituted and native CarA crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 61.1 Å, b = 180.4 Å, c = 96.6 Å, β = 97.5° and a = 103.0 Å, b = 61.9 Å, c = 175.9 Å, β = 97.0°, respectively.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains four monomers labeled A, B, C, and D. The initial model from RESOLVE included 1453 of a possible 2012 residues and served as a starting point for manual model building with XtalView (26McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Initially, only monomer A was built and refined with iterative cycles of simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement using CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Once monomer A was complete, it was used to replace the partially modeled B, C, and D monomers using the program LSQMAN (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 9-14Google Scholar), and iterative refinement and model adjustment were continued. The final model consists of residues A2-A441, A451-A501, B2-B441, B451-B501, C2-C441, C451-C501, and D2-D441, D468-D500, and 312 water molecules.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicate that the model exhibits good geometry with 90.7% of the residues in the most favored region and all others in the additionally allowed regions. The structure of selenomethionine-substituted CarA was used as a starting model for refinement of the structure of native CarA in the presence of AMP-CPP, Mg2+, and CMPr. All four monomers in the asymmetric unit were located with molecular replacement using MOL-REP (30Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

All four active sites contain one molecule each of AMP-CPP, Mg2+, and CMPr. The model exhibits good geometry according to Ramachandran plots generated using PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. J. Appl.

The N-terminal domain includes residues 2–207, and the C-terminal domain consists of residues 208–501. The N-terminal domain is composed of two antiparallel six-stranded β-sheets that form a sandwich, flanked on each side by two α-helices. This fold is quite similar to that of the β-LS (18Miller M.T. Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and AS-B (21Larsen T.M. Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G.J. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) N-terminal domains (Fig. 3). In β-LS, one of the sheets is five-stranded and is covered by disordered loop regions. These regions correspond to an additional strand and two helices in CarA. In AS-B, the N-terminal domain houses the glutaminase active site, which includes the catalytically important N-terminal cysteine residue and other residues involved in glutamine binding. The cysteine is replaced with a phenylalanine in β-LS, and nine additional N-terminal residues fill the space corresponding to the AS-B glutaminase site. The CarA N-terminal residue, a serine, occupies approximately the same position as the AS-B cysteine, but several key structural elements that constitute the AS-B glutaminase site are missing. First, an extended loop comprising AS-B residues 49–59 is not conserved in CarA (Fig. 3). Second, residues 224–228 from the AS-B C-terminal domain extend toward the glutamine binding site, whereas the equivalent residues in CarA are shifted back toward the second domain. Finally, specific residues that interact with glutamine in AS-B are not conserved in CarA. As a result, there is no glutamine binding pocket in CarA. The N-terminal domain of CarA is further distinguished from those of the other two enzymes by the presence of an extended loop region encompassing residues 148–173 (Fig. 2). These residues interact with the C-terminal domain and are completely absent in β-LS and AS-B (Fig. 3). Part of the equivalent region in AS-B is occupied by the C-terminal residues of the second domain.Fig. 3Structure-based sequence alignment of CarA, β-LS, and AS-B. Secondary structure elements are superimposed on each sequence. Helices are shown as yellow cylinders, and β-strands are shown as blue arrows. Key residues in the CarA active site are highlighted magenta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An extended linker region connects the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2a). The interface between the two domains is large with ∼3800 Å2 buried surface area. The C-terminal domain consists of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet and 14 α-helices, six on one side and eight on the other. Two additional short parallel β-strands are located on the exterior of the protein near the domain linker. The active site is situated in a cleft between four β-strands and five α-helices, in the same position as the β-LS and AS-B active sites. Structural comparisons of β-LS and AS-B revealed several features that allow the β-LS active site to accommodate the elongated N 2-(carboxyethyl)-l-arginine (CEA) molecule (∼12 Å) as opposed to the more compact aspartic acid (∼5 Å) (18Miller M.T. Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One such feature that is also observed in CarA is the presence of a loop at residues 377–388 (Fig. 2a). The analogous residues in AS-B form a helix, constricting the active site. Several additional adjustments in the CarA active site are consistent with the intermediate size of CMPr (∼8 Å). Residues 371–375 are shifted slightly toward the active site in CarA as compared with β-LS. In addition, the Arg-374 and Ile-375 side chains point toward the active site in contrast to their β-LS counterparts, Phe-377 and Asp-378, the side chains of which are oriented away from the active site. A loop comprising residues 442–450 covers the active site in the substrate structure (Fig. 2a) but is not observed in the apo structure. Part of this region, spanning residues 445–451, forms a 310 helix. Subunit Interactions—In both structures, the four monomers in the asymmetri"
https://openalex.org/W2001444296,"The p300 and closely related CBP histone acetyltransferases (HAT) function as global transcriptional co-activators that play roles in many cell differentiation and signal transduction pathways. Despite their similarities, p300 and CBP have distinct functions during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. F9 cells constitute a well established model system for investigating the first steps of early development and retinoic acid signaling <i>ex vivo</i>. p300, but not CBP, was shown to be essential for F9 differentiation. In this study we have investigated the regulation of p300 during F9 differentiation. We report a dramatic decrease of p300, but not CBP protein levels, after 48 h of retinoic acid treatment. p300 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although the large majority of p300 is degraded, its global HAT activity stays constant during F9 differentiation, which means that its specific HAT activity increases considerably. p300 is strongly phosphorylated in both undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells; its HAT activity, however, is independent of phosphorylation before differentiation and becomes dependent on phosphorylation during differentiation. Furthermore, we show that protein kinase A affects p300 HAT activity both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> as well as p300 phosphorylation in differentiated cells. Thus, we show that p300 is differentially phosphorylated in undifferentiated <i>versus</i> differentiated cells and that the changes in phosphorylation affect its HAT activity. Moreover, our study suggests an explanation for the functional switch of p300-mediated repression <i>versus</i> activation during F9 differentiation."

Both subunits are synthesized as membrane-spanning type 1 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; however, while the meprin β subunit remains membrane-bound through the secretory pathway and at the plasma membrane, the meprin α subunit is proteolytically processed during biosynthesis and thus loses its transmembrane domain and is secreted unless it associates with meprin β (6Marchand P.

For example, meprin α is expressed and secreted in colon cancer cells, while meprin β is expressed in breast cancer cells. The different enzymatic properties, expression profiles, and localization of the subunits indicate different functions for meprin α and β.

The increasing knowledge accumulating about the regulation and substrate specificities of these enzymes will help to define the role of these proteinases in physiologic and pathological processes. The aim of the study herein was to shed light on the molecular basis for the differences in the specificity of the subunits. Homology models and sequence alignments of the meprin active sites were examined for potential residues affecting peptide bond specificity of the subunits. Three amino acid residues in positions within the active sites were identified as potential contributors to the differences in specificities of meprins α and β. These residues were studied by mutational and kinetic analyses of purified recombinant secreted forms of meprin α and β expressed in human 293 cells. Reagents and Materials—Peptides, proteins, and reagents were purchased from Sigma with the following exceptions. pcDNA 3.1+ plasmid, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDITOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; αMSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; CCK8s, sulfated cholecystokinin. DMEM/F-12, and Geneticin (G418) were purchased from Invitrogen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. The HiTrap chelating column was from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The cDNA for mouse meprin α truncated at 615 was constructed with a His tag at the carboxyl terminus. The primers 5′-GCAATAAGCTTACCATGGCAAGGAGGCTTGGCAGATCC-3′ and 5′-GTCTGCTCGAGTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCCGGTTCAGGTGGGTGAGGTC-3′ were used to amplify the truncated cDNA from the full-length mouse meprin α cDNA. The restriction sites for HindIII and XhoI were utilized to ligate the PCR product into pcDNA 3.1+. The cDNA for the rat meprin β subunit was described previously (17Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The active site mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Mutagenic primers for mouse meprin αY199K were 5′-GGTGGGATCAAATCATTACAGACAAGGAACATAATTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAATTATGTTCCTTGTCTGTAATGATTTGATCCCACC-3′. The αF161R mouse meprin primers were 5′-CCATTGGTGAGGGATGTGACTTTAAGGCCACCATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATGGTGGCCTTAAAGTCACATCCCTCACCAATGG-3′. Mouse meprin αP228K primers were 5′-GAGTCCCTGATGCACTACGGGCCATTTTCGTTTAACAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCTTGTTAAACGAAAATGGCCCGTAGTGCATCAGGGACTC-3′. The primers 5′-GGGACAGGATCTTGTCCGGCTACGAACACAATTTCAACATC-3′ and 5′-GATGGTGAAATTGTGTTCGTAGCCGGACAAGATCCTGTCCC-3′ were used to mutate the His-tagged rat meprin β plasmid to construct the βK185Y mutant. All constructs were fully sequenced. Stable Line Production and Purification—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC 1573 CRL) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Meprin cDNAs were transfected into 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using 10 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid in 100-mm tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with trypsin 24 h after transfection and split 1:500 for selection in 0.5 mg/ml G418. Stable clones were selected and grown in the presence of G418. Stable clones were split onto 500-cm2 plates. Once the cells became 90% confluent, DMEM/F-12 supplemented with G418 lacking fetal bovine serum was added. Meprin was detected by Western blot analysis. Media were collected, and the protein was purified utilizing the His tag as described previously (17Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of gels. Activation, Enzymatic Assays, and Identification of Cleavage Sites—To activate the purified meprins, trypsin was added at a molar ratio of 1:20 trypsin to meprin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, soybean trypsin inhibitor (type II-S, Sigma) was added at 2-fold excess over trypsin. As a control, promeprins were incubated with trypsin preincubated with soybean trypsin inhibitor; no meprin proteolytic activity was observed under these conditions. Azocaseinase activity was measured as described previously (18Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses for peptide hydrolysis were determined by quantitative HPLC analysis (3Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

Cleavage sites were determined as described previously using a Perceptive Biosystems Linear Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) machine with continuous extraction (3Bertenshaw G.P.

Homology Models of Astacin Family Protease Domains—The protease domain structures of astacin family members were determined using knowledge-based homology modeling. The input consisted of a sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of the astacin family member to be modeled and the coordinates obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank for the crystal structure of astacin (code 1AST, Ref. 19Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The model of the mouse α subunit has been described in detail elsewhere (3Bertenshaw G.P.

For other members modeling was performed using SwissPdbViewer 3.2b and the on-line modeling program SWISS MODEL in the optimize mode (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Basic Amino Acid Differences within the Active Sites of Meprins α and β Revealed by Sequence Alignment and Homology Models—The protease domains of the meprin α and β subunits of mouse, rat, and human have a high degree (∼55%) of amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). Six positions were identified in the protease domain in which the basic residues Arg or Lys were conserved within meprin β for all species, while the corresponding meprin α amino acid residues were not basic. At these sites, the equivalent residues are meprin αMet-111, a deletion at 150, αPhe/Tyr-161, αGln/Glu-194, αTyr-199, and αPro-228. Because of the preference of meprin β for negatively charged substrates, it was reasoned that the identified basic amino acid residues may be important for peptide bond specificity. Homology models of meprin protease domains, based on the crystal structure of astacin, were utilized to determine the positions of the potentially critical basic residues in meprin β implicated by the sequence alignments (Fig. 2). Three residues, denoted by arrows, which were electrostatically different in the subunits and located within the active site, were proposed to be potentially critical to substrate interactions. The three residues are αPhe-161, αTyr-199, and αPro-228; the corresponding residues are βArg-147, βLys-185, and βLys-214. The localization of these basic amino acids in the meprin β subunit implicates these residues in acidic substrate specificity. The αPhe-161 residue (βArg-147) is located at a potentially critical position within the central α-helix containing two of the His zinc ligands and the catalytic Glu residue. Residue αTyr-199 (βLys-185) protrudes into the active site from the lower floor of the cleft. Residues αPro-228 and βLys-214, also at the floor of the active site cleft, are located just two residues after a tyrosine residue in the SXMHY sequence of the “Met turn,” a structural feature of astacin proteases involved in transition state stabilization (19Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These three potentially critical residues were mutated in mouse α to the corresponding basic meprin β residue to determine whether they contribute to subunit substrate specificity differences. General Proteolytic Activity of Mutants—The three mutants, αF161R, αY199K, and αP228K, were expressed in 293 cells and purified utilizing a His tag placed at the mature COOH terminus (17Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine overall stability and activability, the mutant proteins were subjected to proteolysis by trypsin. Each mutant was enzymatically activated and decreased in mass by trypsin to the same extent as wild-type meprin (data not shown), indicating that the prosequence was removed; there was no evidence of extensive degradation of these mutants, which has been observed to occur with unstable mutants (22Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutations affected overall proteolytic activity, hydrolysis of the protein substrate azocasein was examined (Table I). Mutants αY199K and αF161R degraded azocasein with specific activity similar to wild-type meprin α, while the αP228K mutant hydrolyzed the protein substrate less efficiently. This decreased activity may be due to an alteration in the orientation of Tyr residue involved in the transition state in the conserved Met turn sequence thus affecting the catalytic efficiency (23Yiallouros I. Berkhoff E.G. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Doll B.A. Villa J.P. Ishmael F.T. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Overall, however, these results indicate that the three meprin α mutants are proteolytically active and that there are no major changes in stability of the proteins to trypsin.Table IProteolytic activity of wild-type meprin α and mutants against the protein substrate azocaseinAzocaseinase activityunits/mgWild-type meprin α12,407 ± 255αY199K15,381 ± 3,678αF161R15,704 ± 1,690αP228K3,641 ± 1,002 Open table in a new tab Mutations of Amino Acid Residues Identified Above Enable Meprin α Hydrolysis of Gastrin 17—Several peptides were incubated with wild-type mouse meprin α, αY199K, αF161R, and αP228K to further examine whether substrate specificity was altered by the mutations (Table II). The substrates tested had previously been determined to be either cleaved by meprin β only (gastrin and orcokinin), cleaved by both meprin α and β (cholecystokinin), or cleaved by meprin α only (neurotensin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, and bradykinin). The most marked affect was that all three meprin α active site mutations were able to cleave the β-specific peptide gastrin 17. The meprin αY199K mutant was the most effective against gastrin. By contrast, another meprin β-specific peptide, orcokinin, was not cleaved by any of the mutants. Meprin β has a much greater affinity for gastrin 17 compared with orcokinin (K m of 7 μm compared with 100 μm, respectively), and this might contribute to the differences observed for the meprin α mutants (3Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In general, the αY199K mutant was more effective against the other substrates tested (cholecystokinin, neurotensin, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) than the wild-type enzyme or the other mutants. The αP228K mutant either hydrolyzed the peptides to the same extent as the wild-type protein, or it was 2-fold less effective. The αF161R mutant was more effective in cleaving cholecystokinin and less effective in cleaving neurotensin than the wild-type enzyme.Table IIPercent hydrolysis of bioactive peptides by meprin α and active site mutantsPeptidePercent hydrolysis/2 hwtmmepααY199KαF161RαP228Kβ-specificGastrin 17: pEGPWLEEEEEAYGWMDFNH2ND42103Orcokinin: NFDEIDRSGFGFNNDNDNDNDα and βCholecystokinin 8 sulfate: DY*MGWMDFNH223705617α-specificNeurotensin: ELYENKPRRPYIL541002223LHRH: pEHWSYGLRPGNH245654823Bradykinin: RPPGFSPFR43464920 Open table in a new tab To better determine the interactions of peptide substrates with the mutant meprins, kinetic parameters were determined (Table III). Velocity was determined by evaluating the loss of substrate rather than the appearance of product due to the presence of multiple cleavage sites. For the αY199K mutant, the K m for gastrin was 440 μm and k cat was 10.8. This K m is much higher than for meprin β (1 μm), while the k cat values for αY199K and meprin β are comparable. The αY199K mutant was the only one for which the gastrin parameters k cat and K m could be determined due to the solubility limit of the peptide. However, the specificity constant (k cat/K m) of α F161R was determined to be 0.07 × 105m-1 s-1 by the method of Fersht (25Fersht A. Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar), 3-fold lower than for αY199K.Table IIIKinetic constants for wild-type meprin α and mutants against the bioactive peptides gastrin and cholecystokininK mkcatk cat/K mμ ms−1×105 m−1 s−1Gastrin 17Wt meprin αNDNDNDαY199K44010.80.24Wt meprin β1.0411.0105.8Cholecystokinin 8 sulfateWt meprin α4908.60.18αY199K11014.21.29αF161R23013.40.58αP228K2903.80.13Wt meprin β21113.90.66 Open table in a new tab The catalytic effectiveness of αY199K against cholecystokinin was ∼7-fold greater than the wild-type enzyme and the αP228K mutant and 2-fold greater than αF161R (Table III). All the mutants had lower K m values than the wild-type enzyme, and the αF161R and αY199K mutants showed modest increases in k cat values. The increased catalytic efficiency of the mutants was primarily due to greater affinity for the substrate. Effects of Mutation of Meprin βK185Y—Because the αY199K mutant was the most effective in enhancing activity of meprin α toward gastrin and other peptides, the equivalent residue in meprin β (βK185Y) was mutated. The wild-type rat meprin β and the βK185Y mutant had similar activity against azocasein (Table IV). The βK185Y mutant also retained the ability to hydrolyze gastrin and cholecystokinin. In addition, this mutant hydrolyzed αMSH more rapidly than the wild-type meprin β and was able to cleave neurotensin unlike the wild-type β protein.Table IVProteolytic activity of meprin β and the β K185Y mutantAzocaseinase activityunits/mgWild-type meprin β5,437 ± 916βK185Y5,164 ± 1,177PeptidePercent hydrolysis/2 hWild-type meprin ββK185YGastrin 17100100αMSH1555Cholecystokinin 8 sulfate8287NeurotensinND9 Open table in a new tab Mutation of the βLys-185 residue to Tyr significantly reduced the specificity constant for gastrin from 105 to 8.9 × 105m-1 s-1 (Table V). The k cat for gastrin hydrolysis was not substantially affected, but the K m was increased 20-fold by the single amino acid replacement, reflecting decreased binding affinity. To more fully examine the electrostatic interactions, salt concentrations were varied in the gastrin reactions. The increase in NaCl from 150 to 500 mm considerably decreased the k cat/K m (∼18-fold) for meprin β, while the βK185Y kinetic constants were only mildly affected by this difference in salt concentration. In the presence of 500 mm NaCl, the k cat values for the meprin β hydrolysis of gastrin were unaffected, but the K m value increased ∼18-fold. By contrast, the K m of the βK185Y mutant was increased less than 2-fold in the presence of 500 mm NaCl. The Lys substitution and increase in NaCl concentration increased the meprin β K m for hydrolysis to approximately the same extent indicating that βLys-185 is critical in the electrostatics governing substrate interactions with meprin.Table VKinetic constants for meprin βK185Y against the peptides gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK8s), and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormonePeptideWild-type meprin ββK185YK mkcatk cat/K mK mkcatk cat/K mμ ms−1× 105 m−1 s−1μ ms−1× 105 m−1 s−1Gastrin 17 (150 mm NaCl)1.0411.0105.820.017.88.9Gastrin 17 (500 mm NaCl)18.511.16.029.610.53.5CCK8s21113.90.6622022.71.03αMSH0.0428215.00.53 Open table in a new tab The kinetic constants for hydrolysis of CCK8s and αMSH were also determined for meprin β and the βK185Y mutant. The amino acid replacement resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in k cat/K m for CCK8s and a 13-fold increase in this value for αMSH. Therefore, while the βK185Y mutant cleaved gastrin less effectively than the wild-type protein, it was more effective for other substrates. Cleavage Site Analysis Demonstrates the Changes in Substrate Specificity for the Active Site Mutants—Determination of cleavage sites within the peptides gastrin, CCK8s, and αMSH were determined through the separation of products by HPLC and identification by MALDI-TOF (Table VI). This analysis revealed that the αY199K mutant hydrolyzed some of the same bonds within the gastrin peptide as meprin β; however, there was a cleavage site COOH-terminal to the Asp residue rather than NH2-terminal to this residue. The bond COOH-terminal to this Asp residue is also hydrolyzed by the αF161R mutant, but this is the only cleavage site for this mutant.Table VICleavage sites in peptides by meprinsCleavage sitesGastrin 17αY199KpEGPGWL ↓ E ↓ E ↓ E ↓ EEAYGWMD ↓ FNH2αF161RpEGPGWLEEEEEAYGWMD ↓ FNH2wtrmepβpEGPGWL ↓ E ↓ E ↓ E ↓ E ↓ EAYGWM ↓ DFNH2βK185YpEGPGWL ↓ E ↓ E ↓ E ↓ E ↓ EAYGWM ↓ DFNH2Cholecystokinin8 sulfateMeprin αDY*MGW ↓ MD ↓ FNH2αY199KDY*MGW ↓ MD ↓ FNH2αF161RDY*MGW ↓ MD ↓ FNH2αP228KDY*MGW ↓ MD ↓ FNH2wtrmepβDY*MGWM ↓ DRNH2βK185YDY*MGWM ↓ DFNH2 Open table in a new tab The cleavage site analysis of CCK8s revealed that meprin α and the three α mutants hydrolyze this peptide between a Trp and Met residue and between an Asp and Phe at the COOH terminus. Although the cleavage sites remain unchanged, the amount of hydrolysis at each site differs (Fig. 3). There is an approximately equal distribution of CCK8s hydrolysis product peaks for the wild-type meprin α and for the αP228K mutant. However, the product distribution was significantly different for the αY199K and αF161R meprin mutants. The αF161R mutant favored cleavage of the Trp-Met bond, while the αY199K mutant favored cleavage of the Asp-Phe bond. Meprin β and the βK185Y mutant both hydrolyzed the peptide between the Met-Asp in the COOH-terminal portion of the peptide. These results in combination with the cleavage site analysis indicate that the Lys-185 residue interaction with a negatively charged amino acid in the substrate enables hydrolysis at P1 or P1′. The studies herein provide insight into the molecular basis for the differences in the peptide bond preferences of the meprin α and β subunits. More specifically, they establish the importance of positively charged amino acid residues, particularly βLys-185, in the meprin β subunit active site. Mutation of this residue to a hydrophobic amino acid increased the K m for gastrin 20-fold as did increasing the salt concentration, indicating electrostatic interactions between gastrin and the enzyme are important for affinity. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that when a Lys residue was substituted into meprin α (αY199K) at the equivalent position (βLys-185), meprin α gained the ability to cleave gastrin at the same sites as meprin β and enhanced cleavage of CCK8s at a peptide bond COOH-terminal to an Asp residue. The results of this study indicate that amino acid βLys-185 interacts with substrates at both P1 and P1′, while βArg-147 appears to interact at P1. The αY199K mutant had a much higher K m value for gastrin than did meprin β, indicating that there are multiple factors in the meprin β active site that determine affinity. This is consistent with results of previous studies that had shown that meprins have a preference for substrates with a minimum of six to eight amino acids (3Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J.

The substrate specificity of many members of the metzincin superfamily have been studied, and the great majority of these metalloproteinases have preferences for small or hydrophobic amino acids flanking the scissile bond. For example, ADAM 17 (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme), stromelysin, matrilysin, collagenase, and gelatinases cleave bonds such as Ala-Val, Ala-Met, and Gly-Ile (27Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). There are some exceptions to this generality, e.g. aggrecanases cleave at Glu residues (28Tortorella M.D. Liu R.Q. Burn T. Newton R.C. Arner E. Matrix Biol. 2002; 6: 499-511Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two other members of the astacin family beside meprin β that cleave peptide bonds flanked by negatively charged amino acids are bone morphogenic protein-1, a mammalian procollagen C-proteinase, and flavastacin, an astacin in flavobacteria (4Johnson G.D.

Homology models of the protease domains of these enzymes implicate equivalent basic amino acids as substrate specificity determinants as in meprin β (Fig. 4). The models show the presence of prominent basic residues located on the lower active site cleft (see arrows) that resides in the putative primed substrate binding regions. Meprin α, crayfish astacin, and a fish hatching enzyme (high choriolytic enzyme-1) prefer small or hydrophobic amino acids at P1′, and these peptidases lack the basic residue at the base of the active site cleft (26Wolz R.L.

Thus, the results of the studies herein with meprins are applicable to other astacins. Insights into the meprin active site residues that affect affinity for substrates will be applicable to the design of inhibitors of these proteases. Meprins are not inhibited by any known naturally occurring metalloproteinase inhibitors (such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs), and specific inhibitors for the subunits are not yet available (3Bertenshaw G.P.

When we exposed baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) to agonist over a 24-h period, we instead observed an increase of ∼30% in both β1AR binding activity and immune-detected receptors. In contrast, β2AR expressed in these cells exhibited a decrease of ≥50%. We determined that the basal turnover rates of the two subtypes were similar (t ½ ∼ 7 h) and that agonist stimulation increased β2AR but not β1AR turnover. Blocking receptor trafficking to lysosomes with bafilomycin A1 had no effect on basal turnover of either subtype but blocked agonist-stimulated β2AR turnover. As β1AR mRNA levels increased in agonist-stimulated cells, β1AR up-regulation appeared to result from increased synthesis with no change in degradation. To explore the basis for the subtype differences, we expressed chimeras in which the C termini had been exchanged. Each chimera responded to persistent agonist stimulation based on the source of its C-tail; β1AR with a β2AR C-tail underwent down-regulation, and β2AR with a β1AR C-tail underwent up-regulation. The C-tails had a corresponding effect on agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and internalization with the order being β2AR > β1AR with β2AR C-tail > β2AR with a β1AR C-tail > β1AR. As internalization may be a prerequisite for down-regulation, we addressed this possibility by co-expressing each subtype with arrestin-2. Although β1AR internalization was increased to that of β2AR, down-regulation still did not occur. Instead, β1AR accumulated inside the cells. We conclude that in unstimulated cells, both subtypes appear to be turned over by the same mechanism.

Although all three subtypes respond to norepinephrine and epinephrine by activating adenylyl cyclase, they differ in their distribution, regulation, and interaction with other signaling pathways. This is evident in the heart where β1AR is the predominant subtype followed by β2AR and β3AR, and each subtype appears to differ in signaling properties (1Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). β2AR and β3AR couple to Gs and Gi whereas β1AR only couples to Gs. Overstimulation of β1AR is pro-apoptotic whereas β2AR stimulation is anti-apoptotic. During chronic heart failure, the compensating increase in sympathetic drive leads to high catecholamine levels and chronic β-adrenergic signaling, in particular the norepinephrine/β1AR component contributes to the progression of the disease (5Port J.D. Bristow M.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 887-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Because β1AR is implicated in chronic heart failure, there is considerable interest in its regulation. Persistent agonist stimulation also leads to receptor down-regulation. Down-regulation is defined as a reduction in the total number of receptors and is usually determined by loss of binding sites and often attributed to receptor proteolysis. Although the down-regulation of β2AR has been studied extensively, the mechanisms and pathways remain unresolved, which has led to the proposal of several models (6Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A major question is whether receptor down-regulation occurs in the absence of internalization or is dependent on endocytosis and trafficking to lysosomes. Some studies show that internalization of β2AR is necessary for its degradation. Following agonist-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, most of the receptors are recycled, but some enter the lysosomal pathway and are degraded (7Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, however, indicate that internalization and down-regulation of β2AR are independent of each other. Certain mutations of β2AR impair one process but not the other (9Valiquette M. Bonin H. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on a kinetic analysis, a two-pathway model of β2AR down-regulation has been proposed: a high-affinity, low-capacity, internalization-independent pathway and a low-affinity, high-capacity, internalization-dependent pathway (14Williams B.R. Barber R. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism observed in some cells is the cyclic AMP-mediated reduction in steady-state β2AR mRNA levels (15Bouvier M. Collins S. O'Dowd B.F. Campbell P.T. de Blasi A. Kobilka B.K.

The decrease is because of destabilization of the transcripts by proteins that bind to specific sequences in the 3′-untranslated region. Although some of these differences may be cell-specific, the precise mechanism of β2AR down-regulation is not fully understood. Less is known about the down-regulation of β1AR, but in general it is not as responsive to this type of regulation compared with β2AR. In rat C6 glioma cells exposed to the agonist ISO, down-regulation of both subtypes occurs at similar rates (19Neve K.A. Barrett D.A. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 235: 657-664PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fishman P.H. Miller T. Curran P.K. Feussner G.K. J. Recep. Res. 1994; 14: 281-296PubMed Google Scholar), but when the cells are exposed to atypical agonists, only β2AR levels are reduced (19Neve K.A. Barrett D.A. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 235: 657-664PubMed Google Scholar). When rat H9c2 heart cells are treated with agonist, β2AR but not β1AR undergoes down-regulation (21Dangel V. Giray J. Ratge D. Wisser H. Biochem.

Down-regulation is greater for β2AR than β1AR in fat cells isolated from dogs with chronically elevated plasma catecholamines (22Valet P. Montastruc J.L. Berlan M. Tran M.A. Lafontan M. Montastruc P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar) and in myocardial tissue from rats infused with norepinephrine (23Zhao M. Hagler H.K. Muntz K.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1762-H1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite, however, was found in tissue from human failing hearts (24Bristow M.R. Ginsburg R. Umans V. Fowler M. Minobe W.

The two subtypes have been directly compared by heterologously expressing each in the same cell line. β1AR is more resistant to agonist-mediated down-regulation than β2AR in CHW (25Suzuki T.

We initiated the present studies to identify some of the mechanisms involved in the resistance to down-regulation of human β1AR during persistent agonist stimulation. As β1AR also is more resistant than β2AR to agonist-mediated internalization (25Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhou X.M. Pak M. Wang Z. Fishman P.H. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28McLean A.J. Milligan G. Br. J.

In addition, we investigated whether the two subtypes differed in basal or agonist-mediated turnover and whether basal and agonist-mediated turnover involved different pathways. Finally, as the C-tails of GPCRs including the β2AR have been identified as important determinates of sorting between recycling and degradation (33Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M.

Our results indicate that in BHK cells, β1AR is resistant to agonist-mediated down-regulation and instead undergoes up-regulation as does its mRNA; increased β1AR internalization does not result in down-regulation; basal turnover is similar for both subtypes and appears to be non-lysosomal whereas agonist-mediated turnover of β2AR is lysosomal; and finally the C-tails are key determinants of down-regulation, the β1AR C-tail conferring resistance and the β2AR conferring C-tail susceptibility.

Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—The plasmids Zem228c-hβ1AR and -hβ2AR encoding the respective human receptors under control of the metallothionein promoter have been described (26Zhou X.M. Pak M. Wang Z. Fishman P.H. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the plasmids pcDNA3.1-hβ1AR and -hβ2AR were generated by the same procedure. The plasmid pcDNA3.1-HA-hβ1AR encoding an N-terminal, HA epitope-tagged hβ1AR (MYPYDVPDYAGAG–) was generated by PCR. The HA-tagged wild-type β2AR and chimeric βAR constructs in pCMV5 (32Shiina T. Kawasakii A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by H. Kurose (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). The latter encode the chimeric receptors (numbers refer to amino acid positions in wild-type βAR sequences), β1 Met1-Ser380/β2 Pro330-Leu413 (β1/β2ct-AR) and β2 Met1-Ser329/β1 Pro381-Val477 (β2/β1ct-AR) in which the entire C terminus of one subtype has been replaced with that of the other. The β1/β2ct-AR cDNA contains the 3′-untranslated region of the β2AR gene whereas the β2/β1ct-AR cDNA lacks any 3′-untranslated region of the β1AR gene. The HA-β2AR and HA-β1/β2ct-AR cDNAs were excised and inserted into the EcoRI/XbaI site of pcDNA3.1(+), and the HA-β2/β1ct-AR cDNA was into the EcoRI/HindIII site of pcDNA3.1(–), respectively. The plasmid pcDNA3-arrestin-2 was obtained from J. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). We generated Zem229-Arr2 by excising the coding region of the bovine arrestin-2 cDNA with NotI and ApaI and inserting it into the corresponding sites created in the BamHI cloning site of Zem229, which has a dihydrofolate reductase selectable marker. Cell Culture and Transfection—The BHK cell line (clone tk-ts13) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Clonal lines stably expressing β1AR or β2AR or co-expressing both arrestin-2 and either subtype were obtained by transfecting the cells with one of the Zem228c-hβAR plasmids or co-transfecting with both Zem228c-hβAR and Zem229-Arr2, selecting for resistance to G418 or both G418 and methotrexate, and by limiting dilution of the resistant cultures (26Zhou X.M. Pak M. Wang Z. Fishman P.H. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Arrestin-2 expression was confirmed by Western blotting. To obtain cells expressing wild-type or chimeric HA-βARs, cells were transfected with one of the pcDNA plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions and either used after 24 h or selected with G418. Although the resistant cultures were not cloned, βAR expression levels remained fairly constant during the experimental period. All stably transfected cells were maintained in the culture medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 and/or 2 μm methotrexate. βAR Binding Assays—Control and treated cells were assayed for total and surface receptors as described previously (27Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Dunigan C.D. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 329-343PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates or 35-mm dishes were incubated with 10 μm ISO at 37 °C for increasing times up to 24 h, rinsed with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DPBS, and lysed in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Portions of the lysates were assayed for protein and for total βAR activity with 250 pm125ICYP for 1 h at 37 °C. Portions also were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and used for Western blotting as described below. To measure surface βAR, cells grown in 24-well plates were exposed at 37 °C to 1 μm ISO for increasing times up to 30 min or to 10 μm ISO for up to 24 h. The plates were placed on a bed of ice, rapidly washed twice with ice-cold DPBS, and exposed to 5 nm [3H]CGP-12177 at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed as above and assayed for 3H and protein. For both assays, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm propranolol. βAR mRNA Assay—Control and agonist-treated cells were washed twice, scraped into ice-cold DPBS, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was suspended in TRIzol reagent (5–10 × 106 cells/ml), mixed well with ⅕ volume of chloroform, and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The clear upper layer containing RNA was removed, adjusted to 35% ethanol, and further purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA in 20 μl was generated from 500 ng of total RNA with Random Decamers using a RETROscript kit and protocol (Ambion). Portions (0.2–0.4 μl) of the cDNA were used to quantify the relative amounts of βAR mRNA by generating [α-32P]-labeled PCR products using a QuantumRNA 18 S Internal Standards kit and protocol (Ambion). For β1AR and β1/β2ct-AR cDNA amplification, the sense and antisense primers were 5′-CAAGTGCTGCGACTTCGTCACC-3′ and 5′-GCCGAGGAAACGGCGCTC-3′, which generated a 163-bp PCR product. For β2AR cDNA, the primers were 5′-ACAAAGCCCTCAAGACGTTAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCAAAGAAGACCTGCG-3′, which generated a 240-bp product. For β2/β1ct-AR cDNA, the β2AR sense primer was paired with a β1AR antisense primer, 5′-AGCAGAGCAGTCCCTGGAAG-3′, which generated a 219-bp product. The 18 S PCR primer pair in the kit was used in a ratio of 18 S PCR primer pairs:18 S PCR Competimer of 1:9 to generate an internal control PCR 324-bp product. Amplification was done in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR system 9600 with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (3 min for initial denaturation), annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, elongation at 74 °C for 45 s, 26 cycles, and final extension at 74 °C for 5 min. Pretests showed a liner correlation between the amount of βAR mRNA and its final PCR products under these conditions. The final PCR fragments were resolved on a 6% Tris/borate/EDTA gel, which was dried and exposed to a Bio-Rad storage phosphor screen-BI. The screen was scanned, and the labeled bands were detected and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS525 molecular imager system and multi-analysis/PC software. The abundance of each βAR mRNA was calculated relative to that of the control 18 S rRNA band from the same reaction. βAR Turnover Assay—Basal and agonist-mediated βAR turnover were determined by following the loss of surface-biotinylated receptors. Briefly, cells grown in 35-mm dishes were rinsed with ice-cold Buffer B (40 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.6), incubated with 1 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in Buffer B at 4 °C for 30 min, and rinsed with ice-cold DPBS, 20 mm glutamine (27Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells then were warmed to 37 °C in fresh medium in the absence or presence of 10 μm ISO and collected at different times as described above for the total βAR binding assay. Portions of the lysates were extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. βARs were immunoprecipitated from the soluble extracts using protein A-Sepharose beads coated with anti-β1AR or -β2AR antibodies, eluted from the beads by heating in SDS sample buffer at 60 °C for 15 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin as described below. Whole Cell Phosphorylation of βARs—BHK cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with one of the pcDNA3 plasmids encoding wild-type or chimeric HA-βARs (1 μg DNA/well; 3 wells per plasmid). After 24 h, one well of each set of three was assayed for total binding activity. The other two wells were washed with serum- and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hepes, incubated in the same medium containing 200 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate for 2.5 h and then for 10 min ± 1 μm ISO. The cells were washed extensively with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DPBS and lysed in 0.7 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were extracted and centrifuged as described above. The soluble extracts were pre-cleared by gently rotating with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. After removing the beads, the soluble samples were added to tubes containing 5 μl of anti-HA-Sepharose and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (added as carrier to have a visible pellet), and the tubes were rotated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 50–60 μl of sample buffer (based on lysate binding, adjusted to make βARs/μl the same in samples from control and stimulated cells) as described above. Portions of 40 μl were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for 20 to 30 h. The screen was scanned and analyzed as described above. We confirmed that equal amounts of receptors were immunoprecipitated from control and stimulated cells by transferring proteins from the gel to a blot that was probed with rat anti-HA and HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rat. Western Blotting—Immunoblotting of βAR proteins was done essentially as described previously (27Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, portions of cell lysates or immunoprecipitates dissolved in SDS sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The latter were blocked with casein in Tris-buffered saline, blotted with anti-β1AR (1:10000), anti-β2AR (1:4000), or anti-arrestin (1:4000) antibodies, washed, and blotted with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG or streptavidin (1:10000) as appropriate. Then the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the images were captured on Eastman Kodak Co. Bio-Max MR or Lite 2 film and quantified using NIH Imaging software. β1AR produces a linear response between 2.5 and 25 fmol (27Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with β2AR (data not shown). Data Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, each experiment was repeated at least three times, and each data point within an experiment was done in triplicate. Data were fitted to curves by nonlinear regression analysis and analyzed for statistical significance by one- or two-way analysis of variance or two-tailed t test using Prism 3 (GraphPad Software). Opposite Changes in Levels of β 1AR and β 2AR by Persistent Agonist Stimulation—To investigate the effects of persistent agonist stimulation on β1AR and β2AR, we exposed clonal lines of BHK cells stably expressing either subtype at ∼ 1 pmol/mg protein (BHK-hβ1 and -hβ2 cells) to 10 μm ISO for up to 24 h. The cells then were lysed and assayed for total βAR binding activity using the hydrophobic radioligand 125ICYP. The number of β2AR binding sites decreased to 52% of control with a t ½ of 2.6 h whereas that of β1AR increased to 131% of control (Fig. 1A). Although there was an initial, modest reduction of β1AR binding, overall β1AR underwent up-regulation in contrast to the rapid down-regulation of β2AR. To determine whether the changes in binding activity reflected corresponding changes in βAR proteins, we subjected the same samples to Western blotting with antibodies to βAR C-terminal sequences. With increasing time of agonist treatment, the levels of immune-detected β1AR increased, and those of β2AR decreased (Fig. 1, B and C), establishing that the respective up- and down-regulation of binding activities occurred at the receptor protein level. β2AR binding activity initially decreased more rapid than the immune-detected receptor proteins (see Fig. 1 and Table I). A similar delay was observed in the down-regulation of HA-β2AR expressed in mouse l-cells (13Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In general, our results are consistent with previous studies that β1AR is more resistant to agonist-mediated down-regulation than β2AR.Table IKinetic parameters of acute and persistent agonist-mediated regulation of β1AR and β2AR expressed in BHK cellsCells expressingTotal βAR binding sitesImmune-detected βAR proteinβAR turnoverInternalization of surface βAR-ISO+ISOt½ (h)% of cont½ (h)% of cont½ (h)t½ (h)t½ (min)% maxβ1AR129 ± 9.2144 ± 3.36.54 ± 0.75.00 ± 0.53.18 ± 0.615.6 ± 1.3β2AR2.6 ± 0.851.9 ± 5.74.4 ± 0.636.3 ± 3.96.87 ± 1.82.97 ± 0.352.87 ± 0.337.8 ± 1.6β1AR/Arr2107 ± 7.11.59 ± 0.151.8 ± 1.8β2AR/Arr27.4 ± 0.457.7 ± 3.81.54 ± 0.164.1 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab The changes in β1AR and β2AR binding activity after 24 h was dependent on agonist concentration with half-maximal effects occurring at ∼1–3 nm ISO (Fig. 2A). When we compared short term and prolonged agonist stimulation on βAR regulation, we found that a 15-min exposure had only a slight immediate effect on total βAR binding activity but led to changes 24 h later, especially for β1AR (Fig. 2B). β1AR levels after 15 min were 103 ± 2% of control and increased to 126 ± 3% after 24 h. β2AR levels decreased to 92.8 ± 9 and 79.6 ± 1% of control after 15 min and 24 h, respectively. Thus, the up-regulation of β1AR after 15 min of agonist stimulation followed by 24 h without agonist treatment was substantial when compared with the up-regulation obtained with constant agonist stimulation for 24 h. In contrast, the down-regulation of β2AR over the same time period was small in comparison to the maximum caused by prolonged stimulation. As cAMP has been reported to mediate down-regulation in some cells heterologously expressing βARs (15Bouvier M. Collins S. O'Dowd B.F. Campbell P.T. de Blasi A. Kobilka B.K. MacGregor C. Irons G.P.

The effect was an up-regulation of β1AR (129 ± 1% of control; p < 0.001, n = 3) similar to that induced by agonist. There was no β2AR down-regulation but instead a small, not quite significant up-regulation (116 ± 7.5% of control; p = 0.07). Thus up-regulation of β1AR levels may be me"
https://openalex.org/W2023206399,"Here we report on the cloning of a Candida tropicalis gene, ETR2, that is closely related to ETR1. Both genes encode enzymatically active 2-enoyl thioester reductases involved in mitochondrial synthesis of fatty acids (fatty acid synthesis type II) and respiratory competence. The 5′- and 3′-flanking (coding) regions of ETR2 and ETR1 are about 90% (97%) identical, indicating that the genes have evolved via gene duplication. The gene products differ in three amino acid residues: Ile67 (Val), Ala92 (Thr), and Lys251 (Arg) in Etr2p (Etr1p). Quantitative PCR analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that both genes were expressed about equally in fermenting and ETR1 predominantly respiring yeast cells. Like the situation with ETR1, expression of ETR2 in respiration-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant cells devoid of Ybr026p/Etr1p was able to restore growth on glycerol. Triclosan that is used as an antibacterial agent against fatty acid synthesis type II 2-enoyl thioester reductases inhibited growth of FabI overexpressing mutant yeast cells but was not able to inhibit respiratory growth of the ETR2- or ETR1-complemented mutant yeast cells. Resolving of crystal structures obtained via Etr2p and Etr1p co-crystallization indicated that all possible dimer variants occur in the same asymmetric unit, suggesting that similar dimer formation also takes place in vivo.

Candida tropicalis is an asporogenic diploid yeast that is specialized for growth on lipid-rich media. When n-alkanes or fatty acids are available as a carbon and energy source, C. tropicalis cells enhance expression of several lipid-metabolizing enzymes (1Picataggio S. Deanda K. Mielenz J. Mol. Cell.

Consequently, these enzymes are present as an array of isoforms, each of which can be targeted to different subcellular locations and may serve either identical or different metabolic functions.

In the present study we describe a further C. tropicalis mitochondrial 2-enoyl thioester reductase, Etr2p, that is closely related to Etr1p and compare the function of the two enzymes. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the expression pattern of the two reductase genes in C. tropicalis. The ability of ETR2 to rescue the respiratory-deficient phenotype of the ybr026cΔ strain from S. cerevisiae was also studied. Crystallization experiments on a mixture of purified Etr2p and Etr1p was undertaken to see whether homo- and heterodimeric variants were possible. The results are discussed in terms of genetic redundancy in lipid metabolism and its significance for the maintaining mitochondrial respiratory function. Cloning of ETR2 and ETR1—The primers used in this study are described in Table I. The CTGEN1 genomic fragment revealing the sequence for ETR1 and other genomic fragments, among them CTPVU25 and CTHAE10 (see Fig. 1A), were obtained by PCR, ligation-mediated PCR, and screening of a C. tropicalis genomic DNA library as described (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The sequences of the partially overlapping genomic fragments (CTPVU25, CT55PCR, CTPVUB10, and CTHAE10; see Fig. 1A) were highly similar but not identical in all regions. Primers CTRED18 and CTRED19 corresponding to the 5′-flanking and reverse 3′-flanking sequences of CTPVU25 and CTHAE10, respectively, were used in PCR with genomic DNA as template. A DNA fragment of 3 kb was obtained (CTGEN2; see Fig. 1A), cloned into pUC18, and sequenced, revealing the sequence for ETR2.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′ → 3′)CTRED18CTGCGGAGTTATCCTGTATCTGGCTRED19AGAACCCAACATCGACCCAGGTCCTRED2RGGCCAAGTTGTCGTCATCAATCTCAVal67IleForwCATTGGGCTCCCCAATCAACCCTVal67IleRevCGGAAGGGTTGATTGGGGAGCCCAATGThr92AlaForwCTGGGTTTGGCACAGCCGAACCTGCAGCThr92AlaRevGCTGCAGGTTCGGCTGTGCCAAACCCAGArg251LysForwGACCAGAACAACTCAAAGGAATTTGGCCCTACCArg251LysRevGGTAGGGCCAAATTCCTTTGAGTTGTTCTGGTCETR1senseGTCCGGCGGTGAAGCCETR1antisenseCAACTTTCTGGCGATACCGGTETR2senseTCTACCCATCGAAACCGGCETR2antisenseTTACCGCAAGGTGCTGCAGETR1fluoroFam-CCCTCAACTGTGTCGGTGGTAAGAGCTC-TamraETR2fluoroFam-AAGACTACTGGGTTTGGCACAGCCGAA-Tamra18SsenseTGGTCGCTTGGCTGAAACTTAAAG18SantisenseAGTCAAATTAAGCCGCAGGC18SfluoroVic-CCTGGTGGTGCCCTTCCGTCA-Tamra Open table in a new tab Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis—Preparation of C. tropicalis chromosomal DNA and pulsed field gel electrophoresis were carried out according to the Bio-Rad instruction manual for CHEF-DR pulsed field electrophoresis systems (Rev. B, Bulletin # 9086), available on the Bio-Rad Website (www.Bio-Rad.com) and the protocol for the preparation of agarose-embedded yeast DNA. The correct amount of cells required for the procedure was estimated by spinning down the cells to obtain a wet pellet corresponding to a volume of 50 μl (17Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Chromosomes were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetate, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), for 24 h at 150 V and 200 s of switch time at 13 °C, followed by 48 h at 100 V and 700 s of switch time at 10 °C. After electrophoresis, the DNA was blotted onto a Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) following the Bio-Rad instruction manual procedure for Megabase blotting. The 32P-labeled probe used to detect ETR2 and ETR1 was generated using the Roche Random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The template for probe generation was a 553-bp PstI-SacI fragment from the ETR1 coding region. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C as described (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Analysis of Gene Expression by 5′-RACE and Quantitative PCR— C. tropicalis pK233 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) propagated overnight in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% d-glucose) were transferred at an A 600 of 0.1 to YP medium containing 2% glucose or 0.2% oleic acid as a sole carbon source and grown for 7 h at 30 °C. The cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until required. RNA was extracted with a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR amplification of the 5′-RACE fragments included the primers CTRED2R (Table I) corresponding to a sequence of the reductase and AP1 corresponding to the ligated adaptor (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). PCR fragments were ligated into pUC18, transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and screened with 32P-labeled CTRED2R. The positive colonies were isolated and sequenced. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) were used for the first strand cDNA synthesis. The synthesis product was used for the PCR performed with ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan chemistry and a pair of sense and antisense primers specific to ETR2 or ETR1. The products of the quantitative PCR were detected using bifunctional fluorogenic probes ETR2fluoro and ETR1fluoro, respectively. The results were normalized to 18 S RNA quantified from the same samples. The probe 18Sfluoro was used for the 18 S amplicon detection. The p values were determined as described (19Glanz S. Primer of Biostatistics. 3rd ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1992Google Scholar). Protein Overexpression and Purification—pYE352::ETR2 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pYE352::ETR1 (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I.

The resulting pYE352::ETR2 was used to transform the BJ1991-based S. cerevisiae ybr026cΔ strain for Etr2p overexpression (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W.

Genetics. 1977; 85: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Etr2p was purified in a manner similar to that described for Etr1p (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W.

Soluble protein extracts were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Great Dunmow, Essex, UK). Reductase activities were determined as described (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in addition to which, the reaction mixture was supplemented with 50 μg/ml of essentially fatty acid free albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Mass Spectrometry—Purified Etr2p or Etr1p at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was diluted 1:40 in 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix, prepared as saturated solution in 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Mass measurements were carried out on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE™ STR Biospectrometry work station operating in linear mode. The mass spectra were calibrated with bovine serum albumin as an external standard. Crystallization of Etr2p and Etr1p, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals containing the dimers Etr1p-Etr1p, Etr1p-Etr2p, and Etr2p-Etr2p were obtained with the hanging drop method (22Zeelen J.P. Pauptit R.A. Wierenga R.K. Kunau W.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using 20 mg/ml mixture of Etr1p:Etr2p in a 1:1 ratio and 1.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m N-(2-acetamido)-2-iminodiacetic acid/NaOH (pH 7.0) as a precipitant. Crystallization drops were also supplemented with 5 mm NADPH and 1 mm octanoyl-CoA. The data for the crystal structure were collected at the beam line I711 of the MAX-lab synchrotron (Lund, Sweden). The structure was solved with molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (CCP4 suite). Analysis of Etr1p apoenzyme crystal structure without bound NADPH has been reported previously (23Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was used as a starting model in the calculations. Refinement of the structure was initiated by one cycle of simulated annealing using CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Waters were added by Arp/Warp (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The ligand could be reliably built into the structure only after all waters were assigned at the final stage of the refinement, when only small gaps were present in the ligand density and with clear density for the phosphates and the ring structures. The crystal characteristics and refinement statistics are shown in Table II. The geometries of the structures were analyzed with the programs O, WHAT IF (28Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar), and PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Glycerol medium plus 0.125, 0.5, or 1.0 μg/ml of triclosan was prepared to examine the effect of the drug on the reductase function and viability of respiring yeast cells. After autoclaving the culture medium, triclosan was added from a 10 mg/ml (ethanol) stock solution. Triclosan was a gift from Louis Widmer (Dermatologica Widmer, Helsinki, Finland). C. tropicalis Genomic DNA Contains a Novel Gene ETR2 Related to ETR1—Sequencing of a C. tropicalis genomic fragment (CTGEN2; see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1158 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 386 amino acid residues that was termed Etr2p (Fig. 1A). CTGEN2 included 958 and 828 bp of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences from ETR2, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of the ETR2 and ETR1 (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were compared and found to be 96.8% identical. Differences between Etr2p and Etr1p were seen in three residues: Ile67 in Etr2p is replaced by Val, Ala92 is replaced by Thr, and Lys251 is replaced by Arg in Etr1p. The ETR2 nucleotide sequence and the respective product Etr2p in comparison with Etr1p is shown in Fig. 2. The flanking regions of ETR2 and ETR1 revealed identities of 90.2% (664 bp) and 89.2% (814 bp) on the 5′ and 3′ sequences, respectively. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from C. tropicalis using a 32P-labeled fragment consisting of ETR1 (CTGEN1; see “Experimental Procedures”) as a probe yielded two hybridizing fragments in each of the genomic DNA samples, which had been digested and/or double-digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI, as shown in Fig. 1B. Because the probe did not contain any of these restriction sites, the data suggested that CTGEN2 and CTGEN1 are at different loci in the genome. Subsequently, pulsed field gel electrophoresis was applied to separate chromosomal DNA followed by Southern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, eight chromosomal bands were separated on the gel. When compared with previously reported data, the chromosomal pattern we obtained correlated well with results of Kamiryo et al. (31Kamiryo T. Mito N. Niki T. Suzuki T. Yeast. 1991; 7: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but differed slightly from the data reported by Doi et al. (32Doi M. Homma M. Chindamporn A. Tanaka K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our probe hybridized with bands VI and VII (Fig. 1C), indicating that ETR2 and ETR1 reside on separate chromosomes in the genome of C. tropicalis. Both ETR2 and ETR1 Are Expressed in C. tropicalis under Various Growth Conditions—5′-RACE was carried out with total RNAs of 2% glucose and 0.2% oleic acid-grown C. tropicalis cells. Twenty five (twenty) 5′-RACE clones were obtained from glucose (oleic acid) grown yeast cells, the longest amplified fragments extending to the –33 (–19) position in the 5′-untranslated region. The 5′-RACE analysis showed that thirteen (six) amplified fragments presented ETR2 and twelve (fourteen) fragments presented ETR1 among the 5′-RACE clones from glucose (oleic acid)-grown yeast cells. To quantify ETR2 and ETR1 expression on different media quantitative PCR was carried out. Total RNA was extracted from cells grown on media containing glucose or oleic acid as sole carbon source. RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and amplified by PCR for quantification with ETR2- and ETR1-specific primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). Relative values for the amount of ETR2 RNA were 1.00 on glucose and 2.17 on oleic acid grown cells and for the amount of ETR1 RNA 1.31 on glucose and 2.95 on oleic acid, indicating that both genes were more strongly expressed on oleic acid than on glucose as a carbon source (Table III).Table IIIExpression of ETR1 and ETR2 under glucose and oleic acid as a sole carbon sourceGeneGlucoseOleic acidRT-PCRETR11.31 ± 0.192.95 ± 1.24p < 0.01ETR21.00 ± 0.122.17 ± 1.04p < 0.015′-RACEETR148%70%ETR252%30% Open table in a new tab The ETR2 Gene Product Encodes an Etr1p-like 2-Enoyl Thioester Reductase with a Preference for Short and Medium Chain over Long Chain Enoyl Thioesters—To analyze the function of Etr2p as a 2-enoyl thioester reductase and to characterize its substrate specificity, it was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and chromatographically purified to apparent homogeneity. As a comparison, Etr1p was also examined. When the purified proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, the overall spectra of Etr2p and Etr1p were identical, signifying preservation of the secondary structure elements. Mass spectrometry analysis gave molecular masses which corresponded to theoretical values of 39.34 and 39.39 kDa for Etr2p and Etr1p, respectively, excluding the mitochondrial targeting signals, not present in the mature proteins (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mass difference was attributed to the difference in three amino acid residues deduced from cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). The specific reductase activities were determined using trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA (C6), trans-2-decenoyl-CoA (C10), and trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA (C16) as substrates. The respective values obtained for Etr2p and Etr1p were 17.3 and 18.0 μmol/min/mg of protein with trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA, 13.6 and 11.7 μmol/min/mg of protein with trans-2-decenoyl-CoA, and 4.3 and 5.8 μmol/min/mg of protein with trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA. Hence, both proteins showed a similar preference toward short and medium chain 2-enoyl thioesters. Gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction end products demonstrated that, like Etr1p (10Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), also Etr2p was able to carry out the reduction of the trans-2 double bond both in monounsaturated trans-2- and conjugated trans-2,trans-4-enoyl thioesters. Similarly to Etr1p, Etr2p was specific for NADPH and could not utilize NADH as hydrogen donor in the catalysis. Etr2p-Etr1p Heterodimerization Enables Generation of Various Native Forms of the Enzyme—The present results indicated that C. tropicalis simultaneously expresses two highly similar enoyl thioester reductases. Because previous data using purified Etr1p indicated that it functions as a dimer (23Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this raised the issue of whether the two reductases may form a heterodimer. Purified Etr2p and Etr1p were mixed, and crystals were grown that diffracted at 1.98 Å resolution. Determination of the crystal structure allowed the identification of the locations of Ile67 (Val), Ala92 (Thr), and Lys251 (Arg) in Etr2p (Etr1p). Detection of these different amino acids in the asymmetric unit in the crystal revealed the existence of all possible dimer variants, Etr1p-Etr1p, Etr1p-Etr2p, and Etr2p-Etr2p (Fig. 3, A and B). Fragmented electron density for the NADPH co-factor could be seen in three of six polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit. Each type of dimer was liganded with one NADPH, and in the heterodimer Etr1p binds the co-factor in this crystal (Fig. 3A). Thus, the structure contains both Etr2p and Etr1p in liganded and unliganded form. Electron density for the octanoyl-CoA, present in the crystallization mixture, was not observed. When comparing the apo-Etr1p component in the heterodimeric crystal to the structures of Etr1p with and without the bound ligand (Ref. 23Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; 1GUF and 1GU7 in the Protein Data Bank, respectively), it is noted that apo-structures show identical conformation and the conformational change from the apo- to holoenzyme form upon binding of NADPH (Fig. 3, C and D) is similar for the two proteins. It is also worth noting that despite this dynamics in the molecule, the apo- and holoenzymes are sufficiently similar as crystallizable species such that they can be incorporated into the same crystal lattice. The three amino acids distinguishing Etr2p and Etr1p were neither involved in crystal contacts nor restricted dimer formation. Of the differing amino acids Ala92 (Thr) and Lys251 (Arg) are located on the protein surface facing the solvent; the former in the middle of a large loop between helix α2 and strand β4 and the latter in the beginning of helix αE (the nomenclature of secondary structures according to Airenne et al. (23Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Ile67 (Val) at the end of strand β3, on the other hand, is located deep inside the nucleotide- and substrate-binding pocket but spatially separated from the catalytic Tyr79 by an intervening helix α2 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the differing residues are not in the near vicinity of the active site.

https://openalex.org/W2032033438,"Ecto-ATPase (CD39L1) corresponds to the type 2 enzyme of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase family (E-NTPDase). We have isolated from human ECV304 cells three cDNAs with high homology with members of the E-NTPDase family that encode predicted proteins of 495, 472, and 450 amino acids. Sequencing of a genomic DNA clone confirmed that these three sequences correspond to splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2α,-2β, and -2γ). Although all three enzyme forms were expressed heterologously to similar levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells clone K-1 (CHO-K1) cells, only the 495-amino acid protein (NTPDase2α exhibited ecto-ATPase activity. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that NTPDase2α is fully processed and trafficked to the plasma membrane, whereas the NTPDase2β and -2γ splice variants were retained in not fully glycosylated forms in the endoplasmic reticulum. The potential roles of two highly conserved residues, Cys399 and Asn443, in the activity and cellular trafficking of the ecto-ATPase were examined. Mutation of Cys399, which is absent in NTPDase2β and -2γ, produced a protein completely devoid of nucleotidase activity, while mutation of Asn443 to Asp resulted in substantial loss of activity. Neither the Cys399 nor Asn443 mutants were fully glycosylated, and both were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the lack of ecto-nucleotidase activity exhibited by NTPDase2β and -2γ and the C399S mutant, as well as the large reduction of activity in the N443D mutant are due to alterations in the folding/maturation of these proteins. Ecto-ATPase (CD39L1) corresponds to the type 2 enzyme of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase family (E-NTPDase). We have isolated from human ECV304 cells three cDNAs with high homology with members of the E-NTPDase family that encode predicted proteins of 495, 472, and 450 amino acids. Sequencing of a genomic DNA clone confirmed that these three sequences correspond to splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2α,-2β, and -2γ). Although all three enzyme forms were expressed heterologously to similar levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells clone K-1 (CHO-K1) cells, only the 495-amino acid protein (NTPDase2α exhibited ecto-ATPase activity. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that NTPDase2α is fully processed and trafficked to the plasma membrane, whereas the NTPDase2β and -2γ splice variants were retained in not fully glycosylated forms in the endoplasmic reticulum. The potential roles of two highly conserved residues, Cys399 and Asn443, in the activity and cellular trafficking of the ecto-ATPase were examined. Mutation of Cys399, which is absent in NTPDase2β and -2γ, produced a protein completely devoid of nucleotidase activity, while mutation of Asn443 to Asp resulted in substantial loss of activity. Neither the Cys399 nor Asn443 mutants were fully glycosylated, and both were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the lack of ecto-nucleotidase activity exhibited by NTPDase2β and -2γ and the C399S mutant, as well as the large reduction of activity in the N443D mutant are due to alterations in the folding/maturation of these proteins. Extracellular nucleotides modulate many physiological responses through interaction with G protein-coupled metabotropic receptors (P2Y) and ligand-gated ionotropic receptors (P2X) (1Dubyak G.R.

Termination of nucleotide-promoted signaling is accomplished by rapid degradation and/or interconversion of extracellular nucleotides by ecto-nucleotidases. Although the primary function of ecto-nucleotidases involves the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides, the complete physiological significance of these enzymes is not fully understood. For example, ecto-nucleotidases also have been implicated in physiological phenomena as diverse as cell adhesion (4Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J.

The ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases) 1The abbreviations used are: E-NTPDase, ecto-nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphohydrolase; ACR, apyrase conserved regions; CD39, lymphoid cell activation antigen 39 (apyrase); CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary cells clone K-1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TGN, trans-Golgi network. are a family of ecto-nucleotidases, including ecto-ATPases and ecto-ATPDases (apyrases), that hydrolyze nucleoside 5′-tri- and diphosphates with isozyme-dependent nucleotide selectivities and biochemical properties. The E-NTPDase family includes membrane-associated enzymes (NTPDase1 to NTPDase4) and soluble enzymes (NTPDase5 and NTPDase6) (see Zimmermann (10Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) for a review). NTPDase2 (also known as ecto-ATPase or CD39L1) exhibits a strong preference for nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) over diphosphates (nucleoside diphosphates), hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphates at 3–5% of the rate of NTPs (10Zimmermann H.

NTPDase2 contains two transmembrane domains with very short cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini and a large extracellular loop comprising the catalytic site. Five apyrase conserved regions (ACRs) are common to all members of the E-NTPDase family and presumably are important for enzymatic activity (15Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 16Vasconcelos E.G. Ferreira S.T. Carvalho T.M. Souza W. Kettlun A.M. Mancilla M. Valenzuela M.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol.

NTPDase2 requires millimolar concentrations of divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+) and hydrolyzes all naturally occurring nucleoside 5′-triphosphates. Genes encoding NTPDase2 have been cloned from chicken gizzard (13Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1076-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), rat brain (11Kegel B. Braun N. Heine P. Maliszewski C.R. Zimmermann H.

Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the predicted protein suggests that the human NTPDase2 contains six potential N-glycosylation sites and 10 highly conserved cysteine residues that may be involved in formation of disulfide bonds important for structure and enzymatic activity (17Schulte E.J. Sevigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A human ecto-ATPase sequence named CD39L1 was reported previously (21Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although enzyme activity was not measured, this sequence exhibited a high degree of homology with NTPDase2 (57–83%) and NTPDase1 (40–50%) from different species. Sequence comparisons of this protein from different species indicated that CD39L1 lacked a 23-amino acid sequence in the putative extracellular loop between ACR4 and ACR5. The full-length human ecto-ATPase was cloned and its activity determined (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility of the existence of splice variants for the human ecto-ATPase was established (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A novel rat ecto-ATPase mRNA was identified that contains an additional 193-bp exon arising from alternative splicing in the 3′-end of the gene (22Vlajkovic S.M. Housley G.D. Greenwood D. Thorne P.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 73: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Splice variants also were reported for the related ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family (E-NPP), where human phosphodiesterase-Iα (PD-Iα) and autotaxin likely represent splice variants of the NPP2 gene (23Mulero J.J.

Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of Cys399 for correct processing and trafficking to plasma membrane of the human NTPDase2. Absence of this residue is likely responsible for the lack of activity exhibited by the shorter splice variants of the enzyme, probably due to an impaired disulfide bond necessary for maintaining structure of the enzyme.

Flavobacterium meningosepticium peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against the trans-Golgi network (TGN38) were kindly provided by Dr. Sharon Milgram (Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill). All tissue culture reagents were from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center tissue culture facility at the University of North Carolina. Sources of other products were reported previously (27Boyer J.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—ECV304 human bladder tumor epithelial cells were grown in 199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Chinese hamster ovary cells clone K-1 (CHO-K1) were grown in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 4.5 g/liter of glucose. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Isolation of Splice Variants of the Human Ecto-ATPase—All DNA and RNA manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al. (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of mRNA from ECV304 cells. Messenger RNA was isolated from ECV304 cultures using the Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 0.1 μg of mRNA as template and oligo(dT) as primer for the reverse transcriptase (reverse transcriptase-PCR kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR reaction (100 μl) was developed in the presence of 5.0 Units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and contained 5 μl of the cDNA obtained in the reverse transcriptase reaction as the template and 0.4 μm of each of the amplification primers. The PCR primers were designed to amplify the complete coding sequence of the human ecto-ATPase CD39L1 (GenBank™ accession number U91510), and the amplified PCR products were ligated into the retroviral expression vector pLXPIH as we described previously (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification products were absolutely dependent on the presence of reverse transcriptase, indicating that the amplified sequences originated from mRNA. The amplified sequences contained open reading frames encoding predicted proteins of 495, 472, and 450 amino acids for the products obtained with the primers for CD39L1. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Human Ecto-ATPase—Mutagenesis of the full-length human ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2α) was performed by PCR. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows: Cys399 → Ser mutation: sense, 5′-CGC CTG GCC GAC TAC TCC GCC GGG GCC ATG TTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAA CAT GGC CCC GGC GGA GTA GTC GGC CAG GCG-3′ and N443D mutation: sense, 5′-CTC GGC TAC ATG CTG GAC CTG ACC AAC CTG ATC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAT CAG GTT GGT CAG GTC CAG CAT GTA GCC GAG-3′ (the mutated codons are underlined). Cloning of Human Ecto-ATPase Isoforms and Mutant cDNAs into pcDNA4/Myc-His Expression Vector—cDNAs encoding the three splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase and the two mutants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/Myc-His that allows immunodetection of the recombinant proteins with antibodies against Myc or hexa-His epitopes localized at the carboxyl terminus of each of the fusion proteins. To subclone the cDNAs into pcDNA4/Myc-His we took advantage of the EcoRI (5′) and XbaI (3′) sites of the multicloning site. An XbaI site was generated by PCR in the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the five cDNAs prior to the stop codon and in frame with the Myc and His6 tags in pcDNA4/Myc-His. The cDNAs cloned into the retoviral vector pLXPIH (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were utilized as the template for the PCR reactions. The sense primer internal to the coding sequences was 5′-TAC CTG GGA GCC ACA GCG GGT A-3′, and the antisense primer containing the new XbaI site at the 3′-end of the sequence was 5′-GAG ATC TAG AAT GGT GCT TGG CAG CTT GGC G-3′ (the XbaI is underlined). The PCR amplification products of each DNA were digested with BglII (unique restriction site present in the five sequences) and XbaI and ligated with the smaller product of digestion (EcoRI plus BglII) of pLXPIH-ecto-ATPase into pcDNA4/Myc-His previously digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The resulting DNA constructs were amplified and purified (Qiagen). DNAs were sequenced at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems Division) using the ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems Division). DNA Genomic Library Screening and Sequencing—To isolate the gene of the human ecto-ATPase we screened a Lambda FIX II genomic library from human placenta (Stratagene). Total genomic DNA was isolated from ECV304 cells (QIAamp blood kit, Qiagen) and used as template for PCR amplification to generate a [32P]dCTP radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe of ∼1,300 bp. Primers corresponding to the coding region of CD39L1 were utilized: sense primer, 5′-CAT CGT CCT GGA TGC TGG TTC TTC ACA CAC GTC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GGA CTG GTT GTC TCA AAA GTG ATC TGG GTA GAG GCA CC-3′. Positive clones were purified from the plates, and phage DNA was amplified by infecting TAP-90 cells. Following cell lysis, phage DNA was obtained using the Lambda DNA Kit (Qiagen). Purified Lambda DNA was sequenced as described above. Transient and Stable Transfection of CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells were plated at 75,000 cells/cm2. The cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method 24 h later with empty vector or with pcDNA4/Myc-His plasmid-DNA harboring the cDNAs corresponding to the ecto-ATPase mutants or the three spliced forms of the enzyme. Transfections were according to manufacturer's indications using 0.4 μg of DNA and 1.1 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 per cm2 of tissue culture area. Stable cell lines were isolated after growth of cells in the presence of zeocin (200 μg/ml). Membrane Preparation—CHO-K1 cells stably expressing each DNA construct were grown on 10-cm culture dishes. Confluent cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine), and harvested by scraping in the same lysis buffer. The cells were collected, homogenized in a Potter homogenizer, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered for further centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged under the same conditions. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mm sucrose and protease inhibitors. Assay of Ecto-ATPase Activity in Intact Cells and Membrane Preparations—Intact CHO-K1 cells stably or transiently expressing the two mutants, the three isoforms of human ecto-ATPase, and vector control were assayed in cells growing in 48-well plates 24 h after transfection for transient expression or after cells reached confluence for stable cell lines. Briefly, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-free saline solution (125 mm NaCl, 5.2 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm d-glucose), and incubated at 37 °C in 250 μl final volume of the same medium containing the indicated concentrations of nucleotide. The incubation was terminated by transferring the cell-free supernatants of each well to a new plate containing 50 μl/well of 60 mm EDTA (10 mm final concentration) at 4 °C. The cell supernatants were microwaved for 20 s to inactivate any released nucleotidase activity and kept on ice until assayed for inorganic phosphate content. Enzyme activity in total cell membrane preparations was determined at 37 °C in 200 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1.2 mm MgCl2) containing the indicated amount of nucleotide as the substrate and 0.3–1.0 μg of protein. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold 20 mm EDTA. Nucleotide hydrolysis was assayed by the release of inorganic phosphate. Phosphate Assay—Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically using a modification of the malachite green-based assay (28Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Supernatants (30 μl) from cell lysates or 100 μl of the membrane fraction were combined with 100 μl of malachite green reagent and the absorbance determined at 595 nm in a plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, model HTS 7000 bioassay reader). The inorganic phosphate content was determined by comparison against a standard curve constructed with known amounts of phosphate. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreis was performed according to standard procedures (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins, usually 5–10 μg per lane, were dissolved in reducing Laemmli's sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 65 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), separated on 5–8% polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was probed with mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc or hexa-His epitopes in 5% milk in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry Analysis—The recombinant proteins were localized by indirect immunofluorescence using the following protocol. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the Myc- and His6-tagged mutants and splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase were grown in glass coverslips for 24 h, washed with PBS, and fixed for 5–10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized for 4 min in 100% ethanol at –20 °C and subsequently blocked in blocking solution (12.5% (w/v) normal goat serum in PBS) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Anti-Myc antibody (dilution, 1:500) alone or in combination with TGN38 (dilution 1:800), a polyclonal antibody against vesicles of the trans-Golgi network (30Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were added in blocking solution and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies: anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red (dilution 1:200) or anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (dilution 1:200). In some experiments the cells were co-stained with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin (dilution 1:50) or alexa-concanavalin A (1:300). Both reagents were added together with the secondary antibody. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Photomicrographs were taken using a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Image Co.). Protein Assay—Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Human Ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2) Splice Variants—Chadwick and Frischauf (21Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported the cloning and chromosomal location of a human gene (named CD39L1) exhibiting high homology to other ecto-ATPases (NTPDase2) and CD39 ecto-apyrases (NTPDase types 1 and 3). Examination of the biological activity of the protein expressed from this gene was not reported. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR and primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of CD39L1, we isolated three cDNAs from human ECV304 cells following the procedure detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The isolated sequences contained open reading frames of 1485, 1416, and 1350 bp, encoding predicted proteins of 495, 472, and 450 amino acids, respectively. The three sequences are identical except that the cDNA encoding the 472-amino acid protein apparently is an alternative splice variant missing the codons for positions 384–406 found in the 495-amino acid protein and the cDNA encoding the 450-amino acid protein is apparently an alternative splice variant missing the codons for positions 384–428 found in the 495-amino acid protein. The spliced sequences are localized on the carboxyl-terminal region of the predicted extracellular face of the proteins (Fig. 1A). All three sequences contain the five ACRs that are present in other ecto-ATPases and apyrases (15Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and are presumed to be important for catalytic activity of the enzyme (16Vasconcelos E.G. Ferreira S.T. Carvalho T.M. Souza W. Kettlun A.M. Mancilla M. Valenzuela M.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22139-22145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Schulte E.J. Sevigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Six conserved N-glycosylation consensus sequences also are present in the three cDNAs (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To confirm that the isolated sequences correspond to splice variants of the enzyme, the genomic organization of the ecto-ATPase gene was examined. A human genomic library was screened, and a ∼9-kb clone encoding the entire coding sequence for the 495-amino acid ecto-ATPase was isolated. This clone was sequenced, and a sequence spanning ∼6 kb containing nine exons interrupted by eight introns was delineated that encoded the full-length 495-amino acid ecto-ATPase (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis revealed that the two cDNA sequences encoding the 472 and 450 amino acid proteins correspond to true alternative spliced forms of the human ecto-ATPase gene. That is, we identified the three alternative exon-intron flanking sequences (Fig. 1B) that produced the full-length (human NTPDase2α) and the two alternative spliced forms, NTPDase2β and -2γ. We previously reported that the 495-amino acid form is a functional ecto-ATPase (14Mateo J. Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the cDNA of NTPDase2α (495 amino acids) contains the entire eighth exon (135 bp), NTPDase2β (472 amino acids) contains only the 66 bp at the 3′-end of the eighth exon, and the eighth exon is completely spliced out of NTPDase2γ (450 amino acids) (Fig. 1B). NTPDase2β corresponds to the DNA-sequence named CD39L1 reported by Chadwick and Frischauf (21Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Splicing of the gene at the intron/exon boundaries indicated in Fig. 1 does not change the open reading frame of any of the three cDNAs reported here. Expression of Myc- and Hexahistidine-tagged Splice Variants of the Human NTPDase2—To study the expression and enzymatic activity of the splice variants of the human ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2α, -2β, and -2γ), we constructed expression vectors that incorporated Myc and hexa-His tags at the COOH terminus of the proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blot analyses indicated that all proteins were expressed at similar levels after stable and transient expression in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2A). Anti-Myc and anti-polyhistidine antibodies detected major bands of 66–70 kDa and a broad and very diffuse band migrating at 75–80 kDa for the full-length recombinant human ecto-ATPase (Fig. 2A). Essentially identical results were obtained in a Western blot of the untagged full-length ecto-ATPase blotted with anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies against residues 387–401 (RVPGQRARLADYCAG) or against the carboxyl terminus (LRQVHSAKLPSTI-COOH) of the human ecto-ATPase. Thus, the epitope tags had no effect on the expression of the enzyme or on its mobility in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobilities of the shorter splice variants of the ecto-ATPase (2β and 2γ) were reduced as predicted by their protein sequences (23 and 45 amino acids shorter, respectively); interest"

In contrast to its receptor-mediated endocytosis at neutral pH, addition of 25 μg/ml of either Alexa 568- or FITC-conjugated PGI to NIH-3T3 cells at progressively acid pH results in its quantitatively increased association with cell surface fibrillar structures that is particularly evident at pH 5. A similar pH-dependent cell surface association of PGI is observed for first passage human chondrocytes obtained from osteoarthritic joints. At acid pH, PGI colocalizes with fibronectin fibrils, and this association occurs directly upon addition of PGI to the cells. In contrast to the receptor-mediated endocytosis of PGI, fibril association of 25 μg/ml PGI at pH 5 is not competed with an excess (2 mg/ml) of unlabeled PGI. PGI binding at acid pH is therefore neither saturable nor mediated by its receptor. PGI is enzymatically active as a dimer and we show here by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis as well as by glutaraldehyde cross-linking that it exists at neutral pH in a tetrameric form. Increasingly acid pH results in the appearance of PGI monomers that correlates directly with its enhanced cell surface association. However, glutaraldehyde cross-linked PGI is endocytosed at neutral pH and still exhibits enhanced cell surface binding at pH 5. Circular dichroism analysis revealed pH-dependent changes in the near but not the far UV spectra indicating that the tertiary structure of the protein is specifically altered at pH 5. Conformational changes of PGI and exposure of the monomer-monomer interface under acidic conditions, such as those encountered in the synovial fluid of arthritic joints, could therefore result in its deposition on the surface of joints and the induction of an autoimmune response.

Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase or phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) 1The abbreviations used are: PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; AMF, autocrine motility factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CD, circular dichroism. is a glycolytic enzyme essential for neoglucogenesis that is equivalent to the autocrine motility factor (AMF)/neuroleukin/maturation factor (MF) cytokine (1Watanabe H.

Seiter K. Feldman E. Ahmed T. Chiao J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4502-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGI is therefore a cytosolic enzyme that upon release from the cell acquires a de novo function as a neurokine, lymphokine, and tumor cell cytokine (4Xu W. Seiter K. Feldman E. Ahmed T. Chiao J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4502-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gurney M.E. Apatoff B.R. Heinrich S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2264-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Gurney M.E.

While the mechanism of release of PGI remains uncertain, enhanced secretion of PGI following overexpression of PGI by stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells induces cellular transformation and tumorigenicity (9Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). Serum PGI activity has long been reported and is associated with tumor expression (10Bodansky O. Cancer. 1954; 7: 1200-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Schwartz M.K. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) indicating that this protein is actively released from both normal and tumor cells. PGI exists as a dimer and enzyme dimerization is necessary for its enzymatic activity (12Pon N.G. Schnackerz K.D. Blackburn M.N. Chatterjee G.C. Noltmann E.A. Biochem. 1970; 9: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Blackburn M.N. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5668-5674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bruch P.

Chem. 1968; 243: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme has been characterized by x-ray crystallography and is localized to the cleft between the two PGI monomers (16Arsenieva D. Hardre R. Salmon L. Jeffery C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Sun Y.J. Chou C.C. Chen W.S. Wu R.T. Meng M. Hsiao C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 309: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The motifs responsible for PGI cytokine activity remain to be determined. Inhibitors of PGI isomerase activity block its cytokine activity (1Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar, 20Funasaka T. Haga A.

Res. 2001; 16: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reports that the bacterial form of PGI, whose sequence homology with the mammalian enzyme is limited to residues in the enzymatic active site, presents cytokine activity further supported a role for the active site in PGI cytokine activity (17Sun Y.J. Chou C.C. Chen W.S. Wu R.T. Meng M. Hsiao C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5412-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Chou C.-C. Sun Y.-J. Meng M. Hsiao C.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23154-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, neither cytokine activity or receptor binding of the bacterial or yeast forms of the enzyme were detected in NIH-3T3 cells (23Amraei M. Nabi I.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and punctual mutations in the PGI sequence that disrupt its enzymatic activity do not affect its cytokine function (24Tsutsumi S. Gupta S.K. Hogan V. Tanaka N. Nakamura K.T. Nabi I.R. Raz A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The latter studies argue that motifs implicated in receptor binding include regions of the protein that present differences between the mammalian and bacterial forms of the enzyme including the N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal hook domains (18Jeffery C.J. Bahnson B.J. Chien W. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochem. 2000; 39: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The PGI receptor, gp78 or AMF-R, is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor (25Shimizu K. Tani M. Watanabe H. Nagamachi Y. Niinaka Y. Shiroishi T. Ohwada S. Raz A. Yokota J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AMF-R expression is significantly increased in neoplastic tissue and its expression is correlated with tumor malignancy and poor survival and prognosis of patients with gastric, colorectal, bladder and esophogeal carcinomas, cutaneous malignant melanoma, and pulmonary adenocarcinoma (26Hirono Y.

In normal brain, AMF-R expression is increased during development and associated with learning and development implicating PGI cytokine activity in normal cellular activity (33Leclerc N. Vallée A.

AMF-R is expressed both at the cell surface where it associates with caveolae as well as within a smooth domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (35Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Benlimame N. Simard D. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Wang H.-J.

AMF-R internalizes its ligand via both caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis to the smooth ER and clathrin-dependent endocytosis to multivesicular bodies (35Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Le P.U. Benlimame N. Lagana A. Raz A. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3227-3240PubMed Google Scholar, 41Le P.U. Guay G.

The latter pathway is associated with the recycling of AMF/PGI to cell surface fibronectin fibrils (40Le P.U. Benlimame N. Lagana A. Raz A. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3227-3240PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PGI has recently been identified as an autoantigen implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the K/BxN mouse model as well as in humans (44Matsumoto I. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1999; 286: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 45Schaller M. Burton D.R. Ditzel H.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PGI and anti-PGI are specifically localized to the articular surface of joints (45Schaller M. Burton D.R. Ditzel H.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Matsumoto I. Maccioni M. Lee D.M. Maurice M. Simmons B. Brenner M. Mathis D. Benoist C. Nat.

However, the basis for the selective binding of this protein to the surface of the synovial lining as well as for the generation of an immune response against this ubiquitous self-antigen remains a paradox (46Matsumoto I. Maccioni M. Lee D.M. Maurice M. Simmons B. Brenner M. Mathis D. Benoist C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 48Maccioni M. Zeder-Lutz G. Huang H. Ebel C.

Indeed, the extent to which PGI autoantibodies are prevalent in the sera of RA patients remains controversial. While earlier reports indicated that 64% of sera from RA patients contain antibodies to PGI (45Schaller M. Burton D.R. Ditzel H.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), more recent studies have questioned the prevalence and specificity of the PGI autoimmune response in RA (49Herve C.A. Wait R. Venables P.J. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2003; 212: 986-988Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Matsumoto I. Lee D.M. Goldbach-Mansky R. Sumida T. Hitchon C.A. Schur P.H. Anderson R.J. Coblyn J.S.

Bochtler P. Illges H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3 (discussion 412-413): 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Localization of the autoimmune response to PGI to lymph nodes adjacent to the affected joints in the K/BxN mouse led the authors to suggest that PGI in the joint is different in form or quantity than that circulating in other regions of the body (52Mandik-Nayak L. Wipke B.T. Shih F.F. Unanue E.R. Allen P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14368-14373Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here the dramatically increased binding of PGI to fibronectin fibrils at acid pH that corresponds directly to PGI denaturation and, more specifically, to changes in PGI tertiary structure. Localized acidosis in synovial fluid could therefore enable denaturation and consequent binding of circulating PGI to synovial cell extracellular matrix permitting the generation of an autoimmune response against exposed non-native PGI epitopes. Cells and Materials—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum, vitamins, non-essential amino acids, glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Canadian Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator as previously described (35Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human chondrocytes were obtained from articular cartilage (femoral condyles and tibial plateaus) of patients (aged 58 ± 8, mean ± S.D.) who had undergone total knee arthroplasty. All osteoarthritis (OA) patients were evaluated by a certified rheumatologist and were diagnosed as having OA based on the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA (53Altman R. Asch E. Bloch D. Bole G. Borenstein D. Brandt K. Christy W. Cooke T.D. Greenwald R. Hochberg M. et al.Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (5352) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were released from the articular cartilage by sequential enzymatic digestion at 37 °C as previously described (54Tardif G. Pelletier J.P. Dupuis M. Geng C. Cloutier J.M. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Canadian Life Technologies) and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Canadian Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Chondrocytes were used at first passage on Labtek plastic cover slips. Rabbit PGI (P9544) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Oakville, Ontario). Mouse anti-fibronectin was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Mississuaga, Ontario) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Nondenatured protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Sigma and Kaleidoscope SDS molecular weight markers from BioRad. The Alexa Fluor 568 protein labeling kit and the FluoReporter® FITC protein labeling kit were purchased from Molecular Probes, and Alexa 568 and FITC-PGI conjugates were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, PGI was incubated with either the succinimidyl ester of Alexa Fluor 568 carboxylic acid or fluorescein isothiocyanate in bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3-9) for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent PGI conjugates were separated from free dye by size exclusion chromatography using either a column (Alexa 568) or spin column (FITC). Immunofluorescence Labeling—60,000 NIH-3T3 cells were plated for 2 days on cover slips and incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 30 min with Alexa 568 or FITC-conjugated PGI (25 μg/ml) in bicarbonate containing medium in a CO2 incubator (controls) or in bicarbonate-free medium supplemented with 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 7.0, and 6.5 or with 100 mm MES at pH 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0 in a CO2-free incubator. Cells were then washed with PBS-CM and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cell associated fluorescence was then quantified using a Wallac VictorV fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer, Montreal, Quebec) and appropriate filter sets. Alternatively, labeled cells were visualized by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP-1 confocal microscope. Where indicated, cells incubated with Alexa 568-PGI were labeled with anti-fibronectin antibodies and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Non-denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—Lyophilized rabbit PGI was dissolved in water and protein concentration determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 1.5 μg of mammalian PGI was loaded on non-denaturating 8% acrylamide gels prepared with an upper gel using Laemmli buffers without SDS (55Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar). To a solution of 1.5 μg of PGI, HEPES or MES buffers at the indicated pH were added to a final concentration of 250 mm and then sample buffer consisting of glycerol and bromphenol blue was added. Protein bands and non-denatured protein markers (Jack bean urease: 272 kDa; bovine serum albumin: 132 and 66 kDa; chicken egg albumin: 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase: 29 kDa) were revealed by silver staining. PGI Cross-linking—Cross-linking of rabbit PGI with glutaraldehyde (MECALAB LTD. Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was carried out as previously described (56Darawshe S. Tsafadyah Y. Daniel E. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mg/ml PGI was incubated with 0.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 75 μl of PBS for different times at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples and SDS molecular weight markers were boiled and reduced, separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and protein bands revealed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Alternatively, Alexa 568 and FITC-PGI were cross-linked, diluted with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine for at least 30 min to quench the reaction and then concentrated using Amicon filter units and added to cells at 25 μg/ml for fluorescent visualization as described previously. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) analysis of PGI was performed using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter (Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec). Spectra were recorded in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette at room temperature in MES- or HEPES-based buffers at pH 7.5, 6, 5.5, and 5 and background signal obtained from parallel scans of the buffer alone were subtracted from the measurements. Far UV spectra of 0.1 μg/ml PGI were recorded from 260 to 190 nm at a speed of 100 nm/min in 0.2-nm steps and with a signal averaging time of 0.25 s. Near UV spectra of 0.5 μg/ml PGI were recorded from 320 to 250 nm at a speed of 20 nm/min in 0.2-nm steps and with a signal averaging time of 2 s. The presented spectra are representative of at least three separate scans. Increased Cell Surface Fibrillar Binding of PGI Binding at Acid pH—PGI is an intracellular glycolytic enzyme however its ability to associate with the articular surface of joints (45Schaller M. Burton D.R. Ditzel H.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Matsumoto I. Maccioni M. Lee D.M. Maurice M. Simmons B. Brenner M. Mathis D. Benoist C. Nat.

Incubation of NIH-3T3 cells with Alexa 568-conjugated PGI and fixation with paraformaldehyde results in the predominant visualization of its expression in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) as well as to more faintly labeled fibrils (40Le P.U. Benlimame N. Lagana A. Raz A. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3227-3240PubMed Google Scholar), a distribution still observed upon pH reduction of the medium to pH 6.5 (Fig. 1). At pH 6.0, fewer MVBs are labeled, likely due to inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis at low pH (57Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Further reduction to pH 5.5 and 5.0 results in the progressive accumulation of fibril-associated PGI such that at pH 5.0 the extent of cell-associated PGI is dramatically increased (Fig. 1). At pH 5.0, Alexa 568-PGI also exhibits significant association with cell-free regions of the substrate. Identical results were obtained using FITC-conjugated PGI although increased recycling of FITC-PGI to cell surface fibrils was observed at neutral pH compared with Alexa 568-PGI (not shown). Quantification of the binding of both Alexa 568 and FITC-PGI as a function of pH shows a dramatic increase in fluorescence at pH 5 (Fig. 2). In particular, a significant increase in binding is seen between labeling at pH 5 and pH 5.5. A similar pH-dependent increase in binding of Alexa 568-PGI to human chondrocytes obtained from patients with osteoarthritis was also observed (Fig. 3). As for NIH-3T3 cells, a dramatic increase in binding at pH 5 was observed compared with pH 5.5.Fig. 2Quantification of the acid-dependent cellular association of PGI. NIH-3T3 cells were incubated for 30 min with either 25 μg/ml Alexa 568-PGI (upper graph) or FITC-PGI (lower graph) in bicarbonate-free medium containing 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 or 6.5 or 100 mm MES at pH 6.0, 5.5, or 5.0, as indicated. After fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde, and several washes with PBS-CM, cell-associated fluorescence was quantified using a fluorescent plate reader and the appropriate filters. The values represent the average and S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3PGI also binds to osteoarthritic chondrocytes at acid pH. Primary cultures of chondrocytes obtained from cartilage of a patient with osteoarthritis were incubated with 25 μg/ml Alexa 568-PGI for 30 min in bicarbonate-free medium containing 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 or 100 mm MES at pH 5.5 or 5.0, as indicated. All images were acquired with the same confocal settings, and a similar dramatic increase in cell binding was observed at pH 5 for cells obtained from four different patients.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PGI labeling of NIH-3T3 cells at pH 5.0 colocalizes with fibronectin fibrils and is also observed to associate with non-fibrillar cell surface domains and the cell-free substrate (Fig. 4). Fibrillar association of PGI at pH 5.0 can be observed as early as 5 min after incubation with PGI (Fig. 4) indicating that PGI association with cell surface fibronectin occurs directly and not following PGI endocytosis and recycling (40Le P.U. Benlimame N. Lagana A. Raz A. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3227-3240PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced binding of PGI to the cells at acid pH was not due to loss of cell integrity as subsequent incubation of the cells at neutral pH resulted in the internalization of cell associated PGI (Fig. 5, A and B). While 2 mg/ml unlabeled PGI inhibits the endocytosis of 25 μg/ml Alexa 568-labeled PGI at pH 7.5, the same concentration of unlabeled PGI had only a minimal effect on the fibrillar association of PGI at pH 5.0 (Fig. 5, C-F). Therefore, in contrast to the limited, saturable number of PGI binding sites at neutral pH (23Amraei M. Nabi I.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Le P.U.

Oral Oncol. 2002; 38: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the association of PGI with cell surface fibronectin fibrils at pH 5.0 is not saturable, potentially nonspecific, and apparently not mediated by the PGI receptor, AMF-R.Fig. 5Binding of PGI to fibronectin fibrils at acid pH is not due to loss of cell integrity and is not saturable. NIH-3T3 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 μ g/ml Alexa568-PGI in bicarbonate-free medium supplemented with either 100 mm MES, pH 5.0 (A, B, E, F) or 100 mm HEPES pH 7.5 (C and D). In B, incubation at pH 5 was followed by a subsequent 30 min incubation in bicarbonate-free medium supplemented with 100 mm HEPES pH 7.5 that resulted in the endocytosis of cell-associated PGI demonstrating the viability of the cells. In D and F, incubation with Alexa 568-AMF was performed in the presence of 2 mg/ml unlabeled PGI. While excess PGI competed efficiently for PGI endocytosis at neutral pH (C and D) it did not prevent PGI fibril association at acid pH (E and F). The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and PGI distribution visualized by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Acid pH Induces Changes in PGI Conformation—PGI is active as a dimer of two monomers of ∼66 kDa each (12Pon N.G.

However, in non-denaturing gels, PGI equilibrated at pH 7.5 before loading migrates at 270 ± 14 kDa (Fig. 6A). In the presence of buffers at pH 6 and below, a band of 73 ± 4 kDa is detected corresponding to the monomeric form of the protein. While this band represents only a minor form at pH 6, increasing amounts of this band are detected at pH 5.5 and pH 5 such that at pH 5.0, only the monomeric form of the protein is present (Fig. 6A). The extent of formation of the monomeric form correlates directly with the extent of fibrillar PGI deposition at pH 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0 (Figs. 1, 2, 3).

Recent results from this laboratory demonstrated that a 22-mer RNA oligonucleotide containing a central U9 sequence exhibited sequence- and concentration-dependent stimulation of premature transcription termination and transcript release in trans. In an effort to better understand the different aspects of the U5NU stimulation of premature termination, we evaluated the activity of various oligonucleotides in vitro. Neither RNA containing a mutant U5NU signal nor single-stranded DNA containing T5NT was able to stimulate premature termination, demonstrating both sequence specificity and a requirement for ribose. Furthermore, neither oligonucleotide was able to compete with U5NU, demonstrating that each failed to bind to the U5NU recognition factor. Substitution of the U9 signal with either BrU9 or BrdU9 inhibited normal termination but did not stimulate premature termination. The addition of BrdU5NdU inhibited U5NU stimulation of premature termination, demonstrating that both oligonucleotides bind to the same site on the U5NU recognition factor. Finally, U5NU containing RNA as short as nine bases served as an effective stimulator of premature termination.

These observations impact directly on the development of oligonucleotide based anti-poxvirus therapeutic agents. Vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, possesses a double-stranded DNA genome of 191,686 base pairs (1Goebel S. Johnson G. Perkus M. Davis S. Winslow J. Paoletti E. Virology. 1990; 179: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) capable of encoding ∼200 proteins. Poxviruses replicate within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Their partial independence from host cell nuclear functions is aided by a distinctive replication and transcription apparatus encoded by viral genes (for review, see Ref. 2Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Martin M.A. Lamb R.A. Roizman B. Strauss S.E. Virology. Vol. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus genes are expressed in a cascade that is divided into three temporal classes: early, intermediate, and late. The multisubunit viral RNA polymerase requires separate and non-overlapping sets of auxiliary proteins to initiate transcription of each gene class (3Moss B. Ahn B.Y. Amegadzie B. Gershon P.D. Keck J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1355-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early genes are transcribed in the virus core immediately upon infection. Virions possess two forms of RNA polymerase that differ in subunit composition (4Ahn B.Y. Rosel J. Cole N.B. Moss B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 971-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kane E. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The one that is active in early gene transcription has one extra subunit, Rap94, the product of gene H4L (6Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Shut off of early gene transcription accompanies the onset of DNA replication. Intermediate genes are transcribed in the cytoplasm subsequent to DNA replication and require prior early gene expression (7Vos J.C. Sasker M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Rosales R. Harris N. Ahn B.Y. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14260-14267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Late gene transcription follows the intermediate class and requires the synthesis of three intermediate proteins (9Moss B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 661-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Host factors are also employed in both intermediate (10Rosales R. Sutter G. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During infection, signal-dependent transcription termination is restricted to early genes. In vitro, only RNA polymerase capable of recognizing early promoters is subject to signal-dependent termination, indicating that this form of RNA polymerase is uniquely termination-competent (16Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I), the product of D11L gene, serves as the ATPase employed in transcription termination (20Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An interaction between the C-terminal end of NPH I and the N-terminal end of Rap 94 is required for termination (17Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol.

Elongation proceeds through the sequence TTTTTNT in the nontemplate strand, yielding UUUUUNU in the nascent mRNA, which serves as a signal required for the termination event (23Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence UUUUUNU must be at least 30 nucleotides from the 3′ end, indicating that it is recognized “outside” of the RNA polymerase (25Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that the U5NU signal interacts with an undefined essential termination factor, and upon binding, this factor initiates the termination/release sequence of events. Recently, experiments were conducted in this laboratory in an attempt to identify the U5NU binding factor and to ascertain its role in termination. Surprisingly, the addition of a U5NU-containing oligonucleotide to a transcription reaction in vitro stimulated premature termination and transcript release rather than simply inhibiting termination. Stimulation was shown to be dependent on the presence of VTF, NPH I, and ATP or dATP and inhibited by antibodies directed against Rap 94, demonstrating the involvement of the normal transcription termination machinery (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this report we present the results of further studies on the oligonucleotide sequence and structural features required to stimulate premature transcription termination. We show that neither RNA containing a mutant U5NU signal nor ssDNA containing T5NT is able to stimulate premature termination, demonstrating both sequence specificity and a requirement for ribose. In addition, a dU9-containing RNA/DNA oligonucleotide chimera fails to stimulate premature termination, signifying the requirement for ribose in the signal sequence. Moreover, substitution of the U9 signal with either BrU9 or BrdU9 inhibits normal termination but does not stimulate premature termination. Furthermore, BrdU5NdU serves as competitive inhibitor of U5NU-dependent stimulation of premature termination and transcript release, demonstrating that both oligonucleotides bind to the same site on the U5NU recognition factor. Finally, U5NU RNA as short as 9 bases serves as an effective stimulator of premature termination. These observations impact directly on the design of oligonucleotide based anti-poxvirus therapeutic agents. Cells and Viruses—Propagation of the wild type (WT) vaccinia virus strain WR and the temperature-sensitive mutant virus, tsC50, was carried out in BSC40 African green monkey cells at 37 °C or the permissive temperature for ts mutants, 31 °C, respectively, as described (27Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Spizz G. Virology. 1983; 128: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Virus titers were determined by plaque formation on BSC40 cells at the permissive temperature, 31 °C, and the nonpermissive temperature, 40 °C, for tsC50 virus and at 37 °C for the WT virus. Transcription Extracts—Preparation of transcription extracts from virus-infected cells by lysolecithin treatment was described previously (16Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were infected with either WT virus or tsC50 mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 15, at 31 °C. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 40 °C medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and further incubated for another 24 h at 40 °C. The cells were washed and treated with 250 μg/ml lysolecithin, and extracts were prepared. In the case of the tsC50 virus-infected cells, this procedure permits the initial synthesis of active NPH I, which is required for intermediate and late gene expression. After switching to 40 °C, the endogenous NPH I is inactivated, and cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of new protein. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides used in this study were either chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology Inc. (IDT) or synthesized in vitro. The large scale in vitro synthesis of the two 36-mer oligonucleotides, pGEM-U5NU and pGEM-BrU5NU, was carried out using a procedure that was previously described by Higman et al. (29Higman M.A. Christen L.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Myette and Niles (30Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was synthesized by the transcription of linearized plasmid DNA template by T7 RNA polymerase. To produce the 36-nucleotide-long transcripts, the following plasmid was constructed. An oligonucleotide with the sequence AATTGGGCCGGCTTTTTTTTTGCGTTG was synthesized and annealed to an oligonucleotide of the complimentary sequence, yielding a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing AATT-5′ overhangs. This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pGEM3Zf(+), and the orientation was determined by sequencing the DNA. The downstream end retains the EcoRI recognition site so that cleavage with EcoRI yields a linear template used in run-off transcription. Transcription of the plasmid linearized at the EcoRI site yielded a 36-mer oligonucleotide with the sequence pppGGGCGAAUUGGGCCGGCUUUUUUUUUGCGUUGAAUU. Transcription was carried out in the presence of either UTP or bromo-UTP to synthesize either pGEMU5NU or pGEM-BrU5NU oligonucleotides, respectively. One-ml transcription reactions contained 200 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP or bromo-UTP and 500 units of T7 RNA polymerase. To facilitate the detection of RNA during purification, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP was included in each reaction. Transcription reactions were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched, and protein was extracted by adding an equal volume of 24:24:1 phenol-STE (150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid):chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. The RNA was precipi tated with 2.5 m ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of 95% ethanol. Transcription products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels and excised from the wet gels using an autoradiograph as a guide. RNA was eluted from the gel, precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate and three volumes of ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 250 μl of H2O. Transcription Using a Bead-bound Template—Construction of the G21(TER29)A78 template was described previously (25Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the plasmid containing this sequence was generously provided by Dr. Stewart Shuman of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The G21(TER29)A78 transcription unit contains a synthetic early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette, which is followed by 3 G residues at positions +21 to +23. RNA synthesis in the absence of GTP and the presence of 3′ O methyl GTP yields a 21-nucleotide product that can be identified by gel electrophoresis. Downstream of the G-less cassette lies a 57-nucleotide A-less cassette that is flanked at its 3′ end by 4 A residues at positions +78 to +81. A termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, lies within the A-less cassette, spanning position +29 to +37. The biotinylated 324-bp DNA template was amplified by PCR employing a 5′-biotinylated downstream primer and isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA fragment was then immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280; Dynal) as described (31Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bead-bound (B) template (typically 100 fmol) was first incubated with 3 μl of C50 or WT virus-infected cell extract in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.5 μm CTP, 0.1 mm UTP, and 0.5 mm 3′-OMe-GTP to synthesize the G21 transcript. The radiolabeled ternary complex was isolated, washed twice with 0.5 ml of transcription salts, resuspended, and incubated in the presence or absence of VTF, which was preincubated in the presence or absence of the oligonucleotide for 10 min on ice. Termination was then assessed after elongation of the ternary complex in the presence of 1 mm UTP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm CTP, and 1 mm ATP. The 3′-OMe-GMP nucleotide was removed from the 3′ end of the G21 RNA by the intrinsic transcript cleavage activity of the vaccinia RNA polymerase before elongation (31Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation of the G21 RNA to the end of the template would yield a read-through transcript (RT) of about 177 nucleotides in length. Normal U5NU-dependent termination would yield a termination product of about 75 nucleotides in length. Greater than 90% of the isolated ternary complexes were routinely elongated in the second RNA synthesis reaction. RNA products were separated by gel electrophoresis, observed by autoradiography, and quantified by densitometry of the exposed film. Termination efficiency was calculated as the molar ratio of terminated RNA to the sum of read-through and terminated RNA. Premature termination efficiency was calculated as the molar ratio of premature terminated RNA to the sum of read-through, terminated, and premature terminated RNA. Transcript Release from the G21 Ternary Complex—Bead-bound ternary complexes containing radiolabeled G21 RNA were constructed as described above using a tsC50 virus-infected cell extract. The ternary complex was isolated, washed, and resuspended. Transcript release from the paused ternary complex was assessed in the presence of VTF, NPH I, and dATP and the presence or absence of both the U5NU oligonucleotide and increasing concentrations of the BrdU5NdU oligonucleotide. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the bound transcript was separated from the free RNA using a magnet and quantified after gel electrophoresis as described above. Prior studies conducted in this laboratory demonstrated that UUUUUNU-containing oligonucleotides stimulate premature termination and transcript release (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The observed stimulation required viral proteins Rap94, VTF, NPH I, and ATP or dATP, demonstrating the involvement of the normal transcription termination machinery (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To further investigate this phenomenon we evaluated the ability of different oligonucleotides to stimulate premature termination in vitro (Fig. 1). Both U5NU (22-mer) and mutant U5NU were described previously (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). pGEM-U5NU and pGEM-BrU5NU are 36-mer RNA oligonucleotides that were synthesized in vitro with UTP or bromo-UTP by T7 RNA polymerase and contain a U9 or a BrU9 signal, respectively. Both dU5NdU and BrdU5NdU are 22-mer RNA/DNA chimeras that are identical to U5NU (22-mer) except for the substitution of the U9 signal sequence with either dU9 or BrdU9, respectively. The two ssDNA oligonucleotides, T5NT and mutant T5NT, represent the DNA equivalent of U5NU (22-mer) and mutant-U5NU, respectively. Finally, a series of truncated U5NU-containing oligonucleotides derived by 5′ and 3′ deletions of the original 22-mer were also tested (Fig. 1). To evaluate the effect of the different oligonucleotides on transcription termination separate from their effect on transcription initiation, a bead-bound template was employed (25Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Initially, selected oligonucleotides were tested for their ability to stimulate premature termination. Ternary complexes containing the radiolabeled G21 transcript were synthesized using the G21(TER29)A78 template, a wild type virus-infected cell extract, ATP, [α-32P]CTP, UTP, and 3′-OMe-GTP. The ternary complexes were isolated, washed, and further incubated with all nucleoside triphosphates in the presence or absence of VTF that was preincubated in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the different oligonucleotides. Extension of the G21 transcript in the absence of added factors yielded mostly the full-length RT (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Minor shorter pause products (P), including a collection of pause products at the T9 sequence (U9 P) (31Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the unelongated G21 RNA (lanes 1 and 10) can be identified. When VTF was added, lane 3, there was a decrease in the level of RT transcript and a corresponding increase in normal termination product, as expected when transcription occurs in a wild type virus-infected cell extract (21Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Condit R.C. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Virology. 1996; 220: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As observed previously, the addition of a U5NU-containing oligonucleotide resulted in a decrease in the production of the normal terminated transcript and a stimulation of the synthesis of a collection of short premature termination products (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–9). Importantly, premature termination was not stimulated by the addition of an RNA oligonucleotide containing a mutant signal sequence (Fig. 2B). Rather, one observes a minor inhibition of termination, corresponding to an increase in the read-through transcript, reflecting a general oligonucleotide inhibition of termination at high oligonucleotide concentrations (33Christen L. Sanders M. Niles E.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 36: 8072-8089Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The addition of increasing concentrations of a T5NT containing ssDNA oligonucleotide failed to stimulate premature termination and exhibited a similar general inhibition of termination at high concentration (Fig. 2C). Identical results were obtained using a mutant T5NT-containing oligonucleotide (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the stimulation of premature transcription termination requires a ribo-oligonucleotide containing the U5NU signal. To further evaluate the structural requirements, a chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotide, dU5NdU, which contains dU9, instead of the normal U9 signal sequence, flanked by RNA sequences, was tested. dU5NdU failed to stimulate premature termination, yet it did inhibit termination at high concentrations (Fig. 2D). This demonstrates the requirement for ribose for the correct recognition of the termination signal by the U5NU recognition factor. Furthermore, the inability of both T5NT and dU5NdU to stimulate premature termination also excludes the possibility that hybrid formation between U5NU and either the nascent transcript or the template strand contributes to the stimulation of premature termination. A prior report by Shuman and Moss (24Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows that transcription termination was inhibited by incorporation of bromo-UMP into nascent mRNA in vitro, demonstrating that the termination signal was RNA and not DNA. This result also suggested that U5NU recognition factor binding might have been inhibited by substitution of U with BrU. To evaluate the effect of substitution of U with BrdU on U5NU stimulation of premature termination, we tested the effect of adding increasing concentrations of a BrdU9-containing chimeric oligonucleotide, BrdU5NdU (Fig. 1), on transcription termination. The addition of BrdU5NdU significantly decreased normal transcription termination, exhibiting a corresponding increase in the read-through product (Fig. 3A). However, BrdU5NdU did not stimulate premature termination. These results demonstrate that the substitution of the U9 signal sequence in the oligonucleotide with BrdU9 interferes with the activity of the termination signal. However, termination was significantly inhibited at a low concentration, exhibiting an I 0.5 calculated to be about 30 nm. The effect of bromouracil substitution of uracil on oligonucleotide stimulation of premature transcription termination was tested directly. A BrU9 containing 36-mer RNA oligonucleotide, pGEM-BrU5NU (Fig. 1), was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. As a positive control, a U9-containing 36-mer RNA oligonucleotide, pGEM-U5NU (Fig. 1), was synthesized as well. Similar to the results obtained with the 22-mer U5NU oligonucleotide, the addition of pGEM-U5NU stimulated premature transcription termination in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–9). In contrast, the addition of pGEM-BrU5NU significantly decreased normal transcription termination, exhibiting a corresponding increase in the read-through product, yet failed to stimulate premature transcription termination (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with the prior observation by Shuman and Moss (24Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate a requirement for uracil for the oligonucleotide stimulation of premature termination. Lanes 1 and 10 show the unelongated G21 RNA and the 36-mer oligonucleotide, respectively. To determine whether BrdU5NdU binds to the same site on the recognition factor as U5NU, we tested its ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of U5NU-stimulated premature termination (Fig. 4A). Transcription was carried out in the presence of U5NU and the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of BrdU5NdU. The addition of BrdU5NdU prevented premature termination in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–9). Furthermore, inhibition of normal termination was observed at high BrdU5NdU concentrations, resulting in increased read-through RNA synthesis. This result demonstrates that both BrdU5NdU and U5NU bind to the same site on the recognition factor. The apparent KI for BrdU5NdU was calculated to be 37 nm (Table I) from a reciprocal plot of the data in Fig. 4E, similar to the I 0.5, estimated from the average of multiple repetitions of results represented in Fig. 3A.Table IKinetic constantsOligonucleotideA 0.5nmU5NU (9-mer)25U5NU (13-mer)13U5NU (17-mer)33U5NU (22-mer)13OligonucleotideKInmBrdU5NdU (22-mer)37dU5NdU (22-mer)77OligonucleotideI 0.5nmBrdU5NdU (22-mer)30 Open table in a new tab To determine whether mutant-U5NU, T5NT, or dU5NdU could bind to the U5NU binding site on the recognition factor, we tested their ability to compete with U5NU. In contrast to BrdU5NdU, neither the mutant-U5NU RNA nor the T5NT ssDNA showed any significant inhibition of the U5NU stimulation of premature termination (Figs. 4, B and C), respectively, demonstrating that neither oligonucleotide binds significantly to the U5NU recognition factor under these conditions. Interestingly, dU5NdU exhibited a moderate inhibition of the U5NU-stimulated premature termination (Fig. 4D). The KI for dU5NdU was calculated to be 77 nm (Table I). These results demonstrate that dU5NdU has a greater affinity to the recognition factor than either the mutant U5NU RNA or the T5NT ssDNA. A graphical representation of the average of multiple analyses of each oligonucleotide is shown in Fig. 4E. To further evaluate the interaction of BrdU5NdU with the recognition factor we tested the ability of BrdU5NdU to inhibit the U5NU-stimulated release of the G21 transcript (Fig. 5). Ternary complexes were constructed using a tsC50 mutant virus-infected cell extract. Incubations of the isolated, washed ternary complexes were conducted in the presence of NPH I, VTF, and dATP in the absence or presence of U5NU and/or BrdU5NdU. In the absence of any added oligonucleotide (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2) only 18% release was achieved. As observed previously (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the addition of U5NU stimulated the release of the G21 RNA up to 69% (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the addition of BrdU5NdU failed to stimulate the release of the G21 RNA (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16). However, BrdU5NdU was able to serve as a competitive inhibitor of the U5NU-stimulated release of the G21 transcript (Fig. 5, lanes 5–14). These results demonstrate that although BrdU5NdU fails to stimulate both premature termination (Fig. 3A) and transcript release (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16), this oligonucleotide can compete with U5NU for binding to the U5NU recognition factor (Figs. 4A and 5). To determine the effect of oligonucleotide length on the stimulation of premature termination, transcription was carried out in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of the different U5NU-containing oligonucleotides (22-, 17-, 13-, 9-, or 7-mer) (Fig. 6). Oligonucleotides 9–22 bases in length stimulated premature termination, with the 9- and 17-mer exhibiting less activity than the 22- and 13-mer oligonucleotides (Figs. 6, A–C). In contrast, both U7 and U5AU were dramatically impaired in their ability to support premature transcription termination. Fig. 6D shows a graphical representation of the average of multiple analyses. The concentration of each oligonucleotide required for half-maximal stimulation of premature termination, A 0.5, was calculated from a reciprocal plot of the average data in Fig. 6D. A summary of these results in Table I demonstrates that RNA as short as nine bases serves as effective stimulator of premature termination. Early poxvirus genes are unique in that transcription terminates in a signal- and factor-dependent manner (13Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yuen L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 320-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effective termination of early gene transcription requires the productive interplay of at least four factors including the virion form of RNA polymerase containing the Rap 94 subunit (16Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), VTF, a multifunctional transcription factor and mRNA-processing enzyme (14Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme NPH I (20Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the signal UUUUUNU in the nascent mRNA (23Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence UUUUUNU must be at least 30 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA, indicating that it resides outside of the RNA polymerase (25Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that the UUUUUNU signal is recognized by an undefined essential termination factor, and upon binding this factor initiates (or participates in) the termination/release sequence of events. The function of VTF, a known RNA-binding protein, is undefined, making it a likely candidate for the UUUUUNU recognition factor. It was shown that the D1R subunit of VTF can be cross-linked to bromo-UMP-substituted nascent RNA (31Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not determined whether the protein crosslinked directly to the U5NU signal or to another region in the short transcript. Direct proof of a role of VTF in recognizing the termination signal remains to be obtained. Recently experiments were conducted in this laboratory in an effort to identify the UUUUUNU binding factor and to ascertain its role in termination. These results demonstrated the ability of a U5NU-containing oligonucleotide to stimulate premature termination of early gene transcription irrespective of the template sequence (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Premature termination stimulation was dependent on Rap 94, VTF, NPH I, and ATP or dATP, demonstrating the involvement of the normal transcription termination machinery (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, U5NU was shown to stimulate the release of the G21 transcript from isolated ternary complexes, demonstrating that U5NU-dependent transcript release does not require an extensive interaction with the 5′ tail of the target RNA (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand aspects of the U5NU oligonucleotide-dependent stimulation of premature termination and transcript release, we evaluated the ability of various oligonucleotides to stimulate premature termination in vitro. As shown previously (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the addition of a 22-mer U5NU-containing oligonucleotide stimulated the premature termination of early gene transcription from the Ter29 template. Importantly, a 22-mer mutant U5NU-containing oligonucleotide failed to do so, demonstrating signal sequence specificity. Moreover, a T5NT-containing ssDNA oligonucleotide was shown to be inactive. In addition, a chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotide, dU5NdU, containing a signal consisting of 9 uracil residues linked to 2′ deoxyribose, failed to stimulate premature termination. These results demonstrate a requirement for the ribose sugar for the correct recognition of the termination signal by the U5NU recognition factor. Competition studies demonstrated that neither the mutant U5NU RNA nor the T5NT ssDNA competed with U5NU for binding to the U5NU recognition factor under these conditions. However, dU5NdU exhibited a moderate ability to inhibit premature termination and, at high concentrations, normal termination. These results show that dU5NdU exhibits a weak affinity to the U5NU recognition factor that is greater than that shown by mutant U5NU and T5NT. Nevertheless, despite its ability to bind weakly to the U5NU recognition factor, dU5NdU is unable to stimulate premature transcription termination. BrdU5NdU inhibited normal transcription termination, exhibiting a corresponding increase in the read through RNA product. However, it did not stimulate premature termination. Moreover, BrdU5NdU competed with U5NU, demonstrating that both oligonucleotides bind to the same site on the U5NU recognition factor. These results also demonstrate that the presence of the bromine in the 5 position of uracil in BrdU5NdU enhanced its binding activity in comparison to dU5NdU, allowing it to compete with U5NU for binding to the U5NU recognition factor. Nevertheless, despite its ability to bind, BrdU5NdU did not induce the activation of the U5NU recognition factor, resulting in its inability to stimulate premature termination. Furthermore, pGEM-BrU5NU inhibited normal transcription termination yet failed to stimulate premature termination, confirming that 5 bromouracil substitution of uracil prevents the oligonucleotide stimulation of premature termination. The results presented herein provide experimental support for a model offered by Deng and Shuman (34Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The U5NU recognition factor exists in two conformations. In the resting state, the U5NU recognition factor is inactive. In the presence of the U5NU signal, whether located in an oligonucleotide or in the nascent transcript, the factor binds to U5NU and assumes the active conformation. The U5NU-bound form initiates (or participates in) a sequence of events resulting in the release of the nascent RNA from the ternary complex. Although BrdU5NdU, and to a lesser extent dU5NdU, can bind to the U5NU recognition factor, both fail to induce its activation. These results demonstrate that oligonucleotide binding alone is not sufficient to induce the active conformation of the U5NU recognition factor. The correct docking of the termination signal to the recognition factor is required for its subsequent activation. This is prevented either by bromine substitution of the 5 position of uracil or by swapping ribose with 2′ deoxyribose. These observations complement prior results reported by Shuman and Moss (24Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Deng and Shuman (34Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) who showed that substitution of uracil with bromouracil or the presence of a phosphorothioate linkage in the U5NU signal prevented transcription termination. Collectively, these results demonstrate that stimulation of vaccinia virus early gene transcription termination requires a signal that consists of ribouridine nucleosides linked by phosphodiester bonds. The oligonucleotide length dependence for stimulation of premature termination showed that U5NU RNA as short as 9 bases served as an effective stimulator. In contrast, 7-mers were unable to support premature transcription termination. The addition of two nucleotides to the 7-mer dramatically enhanced the ability of the U5NU signal to activate the recognition factor. The addition of four nucleotides to the 9-mer yielded a 2-fold increase in activity (affinity). However, lengthening to 22 had no additional effect. These data indicate that the oligonucleotide binding site accommodates no more than 13 nucleotides and that an oligonucleotide of 9 nucleotides both binds well and is able to stabilize the active conformation of the recognition factor. These observations impact directly on the development of oligonucleotide-based anti-poxvirus therapeutic agents. We reason that a short U5NU-containing oligonucleotide might serve as an efficacious anti-poxvirus agent because it would prevent the synthesis of full-sized early mRNA. An inhibitor of early gene expression would be especially valuable because it would not only inhibit virus replication but it would also prevent the synthesis of a family of poxvirus-encoded proteins that inhibit the host response to the poxvirus infection (for review see Ref. 35Smith G.L. Symons J.A. Khanna A. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 159: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition would not be gene-specific, but rather, all RNA polymerases transcribing early genes would be susceptible to U5NU-stimulated premature termination. Experiments are under way to assess the ability of various U5NU-containing oligonucleotides to inhibit transcription within the virion cores. Finally, U5NU stimulation of premature termination eliminates one model of transcription that would require the transit of the U5NU signal through the RNA polymerase as an obligatory step in termination. Likewise, oligonucleotide stimulation of premature termination in trans does not support the model, which proposes that factor binding to the U5NU signal in the nascent transcript distorts the RNA in the ternary complex such that the growing chain cannot be elongated. Rather, it appears that U5NU binding activates a factor that directly attacks a stable ternary complex (26Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)."
