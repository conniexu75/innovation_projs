https://openalex.org/W2113035823,"The tumor suppressors BAP1 and ASXL1 interact to form a polycomb deubiquitinase complex that removes monoubiquitin from histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub). However, BAP1 and ASXL1 are mutated in distinct cancer types, consistent with independent roles in regulating epigenetic state and malignant transformation. Here we demonstrate that Bap1 loss in mice results in increased trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), elevated enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (Ezh2) expression, and enhanced repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. These findings contrast with the reduction in H3K27me3 levels seen with Asxl1 loss. Conditional deletion of Bap1 and Ezh2 in vivo abrogates the myeloid progenitor expansion induced by Bap1 loss alone. Loss of BAP1 results in a marked decrease in H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). Consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in the transcriptional regulation of EZH2, expression of SETD8-the H4K20me1 methyltransferase-reduces EZH2 expression and abrogates the proliferation of BAP1-mutant cells. Furthermore, mesothelioma cells that lack BAP1 are sensitive to EZH2 pharmacologic inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for BAP1-mutant malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1961375973,"Objective Research studies show that social media may be valuable tools in the disease surveillance toolkit used for improving public health professionals’ ability to detect disease outbreaks faster than traditional methods and to enhance outbreak response. A social media work group, consisting of surveillance practitioners, academic researchers, and other subject matter experts convened by the International Society for Disease Surveillance, conducted a systematic primary literature review using the PRISMA framework to identify research, published through February 2013, answering either of the following questions: Can social media be integrated into disease surveillance practice and outbreak management to support and improve public health? Can social media be used to effectively target populations, specifically vulnerable populations, to test an intervention and interact with a community to improve health outcomes? Examples of social media included are Facebook, MySpace, microblogs (e.g., Twitter), blogs, and discussion forums. For Question 1, 33 manuscripts were identified, starting in 2009 with topics on Influenza-like Illnesses (n = 15), Infectious Diseases (n = 6), Non-infectious Diseases (n = 4), Medication and Vaccines (n = 3), and Other (n = 5). For Question 2, 32 manuscripts were identified, the first in 2000 with topics on Health Risk Behaviors (n = 10), Infectious Diseases (n = 3), Non-infectious Diseases (n = 9), and Other (n = 10). Conclusions The literature on the use of social media to support public health practice has identified many gaps and biases in current knowledge. Despite the potential for success identified in exploratory studies, there are limited studies on interventions and little use of social media in practice. However, information gleaned from the articles demonstrates the effectiveness of social media in supporting and improving public health and in identifying target populations for intervention. A primary recommendation resulting from the review is to identify opportunities that enable public health professionals to integrate social media analytics into disease surveillance and outbreak management practice."
https://openalex.org/W2165315952,"The hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway is essential for clearing circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Whereas the transcriptional regulation of LDLR is well characterized, the post-transcriptional mechanisms that govern LDLR expression are just beginning to emerge. Here we develop a high-throughput genome-wide screening assay to systematically identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate LDLR activity in human hepatic cells. From this screen we identified and characterized miR-148a as a negative regulator of LDLR expression and activity and defined a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated pathway through which miR-148a regulates LDL-C uptake. In mice, inhibition of miR-148a increased hepatic LDLR expression and decreased plasma LDL-C. Moreover, we found that miR-148a regulates hepatic expression of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) and circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in vivo. These studies uncover a role for miR-148a as a key regulator of hepatic LDL-C clearance through direct modulation of LDLR expression and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting miR-148a to ameliorate an elevated LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease."

The striatum is thought to play a key role in reward-based learning and action selection, receiving glutamatergic sensorimotor signals and dopaminergic reward signals. Here, we obtain whole-cell membrane potential recordings from the dorsolateral striatum of mice trained to lick a reward spout after a whisker deflection. Striatal projection neurons showed strong task-related modulation, with more depolarization and action potential firing on hit trials compared to misses. Direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, exhibited a prominent early sensory response. Optogenetic stimulation of direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, readily substituted for whisker stimulation evoking a licking response. Our data are consistent with direct pathway striatonigral neurons contributing a ""go"" signal for goal-directed sensorimotor transformation leading to action initiation. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2177321125,"Functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been bringing novel insight into biological study, however it is still not trivial to accurately distinguish the lncRNA transcripts (LNCTs) from the protein coding ones (PCTs). As various information and data about lncRNAs are preserved by previous studies, it is appealing to develop novel methods to identify the lncRNAs more accurately. Our method lncRScan-SVM aims at classifying PCTs and LNCTs using support vector machine (SVM). The gold-standard datasets for lncRScan-SVM model training, lncRNA prediction and method comparison were constructed according to the GENCODE gene annotations of human and mouse respectively. By integrating features derived from gene structure, transcript sequence, potential codon sequence and conservation, lncRScan-SVM outperforms other approaches, which is evaluated by several criteria such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under curve (AUC). In addition, several known human lncRNA datasets were assessed using lncRScan-SVM. LncRScan-SVM is an efficient tool for predicting the lncRNAs, and it is quite useful for current lncRNA study."
https://openalex.org/W2178373460,"Ca(2+)-permeable type 2 two-pore channels (TPC2) are lysosomal proteins required for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-evoked Ca(2+) release in many diverse cell types. Here, we investigate the importance of TPC2 proteins for the physiology and pathophysiology of the heart. NAADP-AM failed to enhance Ca(2+) responses in cardiac myocytes from Tpcn2(-/-) mice, unlike myocytes from wild-type (WT) mice. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitors suppressed actions of NAADP in myocytes. Ca(2+) transients and contractions accompanying action potentials were increased by isoproterenol in myocytes from WT mice, but these effects of β-adrenoreceptor stimulation were reduced in myocytes from Tpcn2(-/-) mice. Increases in amplitude of L-type Ca(2+) currents evoked by isoproterenol remained unchanged in myocytes from Tpcn2(-/-) mice showing no loss of β-adrenoceptors or coupling mechanisms. Whole hearts from Tpcn2(-/-) mice also showed reduced inotropic effects of isoproterenol and a reduced tendency for arrhythmias following acute β-adrenoreceptor stimulation. Hearts from Tpcn2(-/-) mice chronically exposed to isoproterenol showed less cardiac hypertrophy and increased threshold for arrhythmogenesis compared with WT controls. Electron microscopy showed that lysosomes form close contacts with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (separation ∼ 25 nm). We propose that Ca(2+)-signaling nanodomains between lysosomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum dependent on NAADP and TPC2 comprise an important element in β-adrenoreceptor signal transduction in cardiac myocytes. In summary, our observations define a role for NAADP and TPC2 at lysosomal/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions as unexpected but major contributors in the acute actions of β-adrenergic signaling in the heart and also in stress pathways linking chronic stimulation of β-adrenoceptors to hypertrophy and associated arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W1960547245,"Adult neurogenesis creates new neurons and glia from stem cells in the human brain throughout life. It is best understood in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Circadian rhythms have been identified in the hippocampus, but the role of any endogenous circadian oscillator cells in hippocampal neurogenesis and their importance in learning or memory remains unclear. Any study of stem cell regulation by intrinsic circadian timing within the DG is complicated by modulation from circadian clocks elsewhere in the brain. To examine circadian oscillators in greater isolation, neurosphere cultures were prepared from the DG of two knockout mouse lines that lack a functional circadian clock and from mPer1::luc mice to identify circadian oscillations in gene expression. Circadian mPer1 gene activity rhythms were recorded in neurospheres maintained in a culture medium that induces neurogenesis but not in one that maintains the stem cell state. Although the differentiating neural stem progenitor cells of spheres were rhythmic, evidence of any mature neurons was extremely sparse. The circadian timing signal originated in undifferentiated cells within the neurosphere. This conclusion was supported by immunocytochemistry for mPER1 protein that was localized to the inner, more stem cell-like neurosphere core. To test for effects of the circadian clock on neurogenesis, media conditions were altered to induce neurospheres from BMAL1 knockout mice to differentiate. These cultures displayed unusually high differentiation into glia rather than neurons according to GFAP and NeuN expression, respectively, and very few BetaIII tubulin-positive, immature neurons were observed. The knockout neurospheres also displayed areas visibly devoid of cells and had overall higher cell death. Neurospheres from arrhythmic mice lacking two other core clock genes, Cry1 and Cry2, showed significantly reduced growth and increased astrocyte proliferation during differentiation, but they generated normal percentages of neuronal cells. Neuronal fate commitment therefore appears to be controlled through a non-clock function of BMAL1. This study provides insight into how cell autonomous circadian clocks and clock genes regulate adult neural stem cells with implications for treating neurodegenerative disorders and impaired brain functions by manipulating neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2267295695,"Dietary lipid overload and calorie excess during obesity is a low grade chronic inflammatory state with diminished ability to appropriately metabolize glucose or lipids. Macrophages are critical in maintaining adipose tissue homeostasis, in part by regulating lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and tissue remodeling. During high fat diet-induced obesity, macrophages are activated by lipid derived danger signals such as ceramides and palmitate and promote the adipose tissue inflammation in an Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Given that the metabolic fate of fatty acids in macrophages is not entirely elucidated, we have hypothesized that de novo synthesis of ceramide, through the rate-limiting enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase long chain (Sptlc)-2, is required for saturated fatty acid-driven Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Here we report that mitochondrial targeted overexpression of catalase, which is established to mitigate oxidative stress, controls ceramide-induced Nlrp3 inflammasome activation but does not affect the ATP-mediated caspase-1 cleavage. Surprisingly, myeloid cell-specific deletion of Sptlc2 is not required for palmitate-driven Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the ablation of Sptlc2 in macrophages did not impact macrophage polarization or obesity-induced adipose tissue leukocytosis. Consistent with these data, investigation of insulin resistance using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps revealed no significant differences in obese mice lacking ceramide de novo synthesis machinery in macrophages. These data suggest that alternate metabolic pathways control fatty acid-derived ceramide synthesis in macrophage and the Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1757242632,"Embryo cryopreservation remains an important technique to enhance the reconstitution and distribution of animal populations with high genetic merit. One of the major detrimental factors to this technique is the damage caused by oxidative stress. Melatonin is widely known as an antioxidant with multi-faceted ways to counteract the oxidative stress. In this paper, we investigated the role of melatonin in protecting rabbit embryos during preimplantation development from the potential harmful effects of oxidative stress induced by in vitro culture or vitrification. Rabbit embryos at morula stages were cultured for 2 hr with 0 or 10-3 M melatonin (C or M groups). Embryos of each group were either transferred to fresh culture media (CF and MF groups) or vitrified/devitrified (CV and MV groups), then cultured in vitro for 48 hr until the blastocyst stage. The culture media were used to measure the activity of antioxidant enzymes: glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the levels of two oxidative substrates: lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO). The blastocysts from each group were used to measure the expression of developmental-related genes (GJA1, POU5F1 and Nanog) and oxidative-stress-response-related genes (NFE2L2, SOD1 and GPX1). The data showed that melatonin promoted significantly (P<0.05) the blastocyst rate by 17% and 12% in MF and MV groups compared to their controls (CF and CV groups). The GST and SOD activity significantly increased by the treatment of melatonin in fresh or vitrified embryos, while the levels of LPO and NO decreased (P<0.05). Additionally, melatonin considerably stimulated the relative expression of GJA1, NFE2L2 and SOD1 genes in MF and MV embryos compared to CF group. Furthermore, melatonin significantly ameliorated the reduction of POU5F1 and GPX1 expression induced by vitrification. The results obtained from the current investigation provide new and clear molecular aspects regarding the mechanisms by which melatonin promotes development of both fresh and vitrified rabbit embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2177950604,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection worldwide. HPV is highly prevalent in sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) and has been associated with anal cancer, penile cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer.From March to September 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HPV prevalence among MSM above age 18 years. Participants were recruited using respondent driven sampling at Clinica Cayetano Heredia. All participants provided anal, genital, and oral samples for HPV DNA testing, and blood for HIV and HPV antibody testing.A total of 200 MSM were recruited in the study. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-59 years, SD = 9.4) and101 participants were HIV negative (99 HIV positive). HPV 6/11/16/18 or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) genotype seroprevalence among HIV negative and positive MSM was 64.3% (55%-75.9%) and 93.8% (87.6%-99.2%) respectively (p<0.001). HIV positivity was associated with a higher prevalence of HPV4 and HPV 16/18 DNA at external genital sites and the anal canal. HPV4 DNA prevalence at external genital sites among HIV negative and positive MSM was 14.9% and 28.7% (p = 0.02) respectively, at anal canal was 50.9% and 79.0% (p = 0.001), and at the oral cavity was 9.9% and 8.5% (p = 0.6).HPV4 seroprevalence was high in our study among both HIV positives and negatives, with HPV DNA prevalence much lower, and the anal canal being the anatomical site with the highest HPV DNA prevalence. HPV prevention interventions are needed among MSM at high-risk for HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2201320985,"The development of effective neuroprotective therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been severely hindered by the notable lack of an appropriate animal model for preclinical screening. Indeed, most models currently available are either acute in nature or fail to recapitulate all characteristic features of the disease. Here, we present a novel progressive model of PD, with behavioural and cellular features that closely approximate those observed in patients. Chronic exposure to dietary phytosterol glucosides has been found to be neurotoxic. When fed to rats, β-sitosterol β-d-glucoside (BSSG) triggers the progressive development of parkinsonism, with clinical signs and histopathology beginning to appear following cessation of exposure to the neurotoxic insult and continuing to develop over several months. Here, we characterize the progressive nature of this model, its non-motor features, the anatomical spread of synucleinopathy, and response to levodopa administration. In Sprague Dawley rats, chronic BSSG feeding for 4 months triggered the progressive development of a parkinsonian phenotype and pathological events that evolved slowly over time, with neuronal loss beginning only after toxin exposure was terminated. At approximately 3 months following initiation of BSSG exposure, animals displayed the early emergence of an olfactory deficit, in the absence of significant dopaminergic nigral cell loss or locomotor deficits. Locomotor deficits developed gradually over time, initially appearing as locomotor asymmetry and developing into akinesia/bradykinesia, which was reversed by levodopa treatment. Late-stage cognitive impairment was observed in the form of spatial working memory deficits, as assessed by the radial arm maze. In addition to the progressive loss of TH+ cells in the substantia nigra, the appearance of proteinase K-resistant intracellular α-synuclein aggregates was also observed to develop progressively, appearing first in the olfactory bulb, then the striatum, the substantia nigra and, finally, hippocampal and cortical regions. The slowly progressive nature of this model, together with its construct, face and predictive validity, make it ideal for the screening of potential neuroprotective therapies for the treatment of PD."
https://openalex.org/W1872257021,"The effects of at least some probiotics are restricted to live, metabolically active bacteria at their site of action. Colonization of and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract is thus contributing to the beneficial effects of these strains. In the present study, colonization of an anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium bifidum strain was studied in C57BL/6J mice under germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as well as during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. B. bifidum S17/pMGC was unable to stably colonize C57BL/6J mice under SPF conditions. Mono-association of GF mice by three doses on consecutive days led to long-term, stable detection of up to 109 colony forming units (CFU) of B. bifidum S17/pMGC per g feces. This stable population was rapidly outcompeted upon transfer of mono-associated animals to SPF conditions. A B. animalis strain was isolated from the microbiota of these re-conventionalized mice. This B. animalis strain displayed significantly higher adhesion to murine CMT–93 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) than to human Caco–2 IECs (p = 0.018). Conversely, B. bifidum S17/pMGC, i.e., a strain of human origin, adhered at significantly higher levels to human compared to murine IECs (p < 0.001). Disturbance of the gut ecology and induction of colitis by DSS-treatment did not promote colonization of the murine gastrointestinal tract (GIT) by B. bifidum S17/pMGC. Despite its poor colonization of the mouse GIT, B. bifidum S17/pMGC displayed a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis when administered as viable bacteria but not as UV-inactivated preparation. Collectively, these results suggest a selective disadvantage of B. bifidum S17/pMGC in the competition with the normal murine microbiota and an anti-inflammatory effect that requires live, metabolically active bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2172738006,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative obligate anaerobic bacterium, is considered to be a key pathogen in periodontal disease. The bacterium expresses Mfa1 fimbriae, which are composed of polymers of Mfa1. The minor accessory components Mfa3, Mfa4, and Mfa5 are incorporated into these fimbriae. In this study, we characterized Mfa4 using genetically modified strains. Deficiency in the mfa4 gene decreased, but did not eliminate, expression of Mfa1 fimbriae. However, Mfa3 and Mfa5 were not incorporated because of defects in posttranslational processing and leakage into the culture supernatant, respectively. Furthermore, the mfa4-deficient mutant had an increased tendency to auto-aggregate and form biofilms, reminiscent of a mutant completely lacking Mfa1. Notably, complementation of mfa4 restored expression of structurally intact and functional Mfa1 fimbriae. Taken together, these results indicate that the accessory proteins Mfa3, Mfa4, and Mfa5 are necessary for assembly of Mfa1 fimbriae and regulation of auto-aggregation and biofilm formation of P. gingivalis. In addition, we found that Mfa3 and Mfa4 are processed to maturity by the same RgpA/B protease that processes Mfa1 subunits prior to polymerization."

Additional data demonstrate that SOCS4 negatively regulates IL-23-mediated migration and invasion. On investigating the mechanisms involved in IL-23 mediated migration and invasion, we observed that miR-25 promotes the migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by directly binding to the 3'-UTR of SOCS4 that leads to the inhibition of SOCS4. In addition, we also demonstrated that IL-23 increases miR-25 expression levels, and overexpressed miR-25 is involved in IL-23-associated SOCS4 inhibition and cell migration and invasion. Together, our data suggest that IL-23 induces migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells by mediating the miR-25/SOCS4 signaling pathway."

Animal data suggest a role of carnosine supplementation in the prevention and treatment of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease but only limited human data exists.Samples of vastus lateralis muscle were obtained by needle biopsy. We measured muscle carnosine levels (high-performance liquid chromatography), % body fat (bioimpedance), abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging), insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), resting energy expenditure (REE, indirect calorimetry), free-living ambulatory physical activity (accelerometers) and lipid profile in 36 sedentary non-vegetarian middle aged men (45±7 years) with varying degrees of adiposity and glucose tolerance. Muscle carnosine content was positively related to % body fat (r = 0.35, p = 0.04) and subcutaneous (r = 0.38, p = 0.02) but not visceral fat (r = 0.17, p = 0.33). Muscle carnosine content was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.44, p = 0.008), REE (r = -0.58, p<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r = -0.34, p = 0.048). Insulin sensitivity and physical activity were the best predictors of muscle carnosine content after adjustment for adiposity.Our data shows that higher carnosine content in human skeletal muscle is positively associated with insulin resistance and fasting metabolic preference for glucose. Moreover, it is negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol and basal energy expenditure. Intervention studies targeting insulin resistance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factors are necessary to evaluate its putative role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

In this article we examined the involvement of the GAPDH/Siah1 interaction in human retinal pericyte (hRP) apoptosis. HRP were cultured in 5 mm normal glucose, 25 mm l- or d-glucose for 48 h (osmotic control and high glucose treatments, respectively). Siah1 siRNA was used to down-regulate Siah1 expression.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to analyze the effect of high glucose on the association of GAPDH and Siah1. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining and caspase-3 enzymatic activity assay. High glucose increased Siah1 total protein levels, induced the association between GAPDH and Siah1, and led to GAPDH nuclear translocation.

https://openalex.org/W1866180178,"Facilitation of general cognitive capacities such as executive functions through training has stirred considerable research interest during the last decade. Recently we demonstrated that training of auditory attention with forced attention dichotic listening not only facilitated that performance but also generalized to an untrained attentional task. In the present study, 13 participants underwent a 4-week dichotic listening training programme with instructions to report syllables presented to the left ear (FL training group). Another group (n = 13) was trained using the non-forced instruction, asked to report whichever syllable they heard the best (NF training group). The study aimed to replicate our previous behavioural results, and to explore the neurophysiological correlates of training through event-related brain potentials (ERPs). We partially replicated our previous behavioural training effects, as the FL training group tended to show more allocation of auditory spatial attention to the left ear in a standard dichotic listening task. ERP measures showed diminished N1 and enhanced P2 responses to dichotic stimuli after training in both groups, interpreted as improvement in early perceptual processing of the stimuli. Additionally, enhanced anterior N2 amplitudes were found after training, with relatively larger changes in the FL training group in the forced-left condition, suggesting improved top-down control on the trained task. These results show that top-down cognitive training can modulate the left-right allocation of auditory spatial attention, accompanied by a change in an evoked brain potential related to cognitive control."

Both types of anticancer drugs improve the overall survival of the patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although tumors often become refractory to this treatment. Despite several mechanisms by which the tumors become resistant having been described the effect of these compounds on anti-tumor immunity remains largely unknown.This study examines the effect of the cytotoxic drug Gemcitabine and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib on the expression of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands as well as the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the NK-mediated lysis.We demonstrate that Gemcitabine treatment leads to an enhanced expression, while Gefitinib downregulated the expression of molecules that act as key ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D and promote NK cell-mediated recognition and cytolysis. Gemcitabine activated ATM and ATM- and Rad-3-related protein kinase (ATR) pathways. The Gemcitabine-induced phosphorylation of ATM as well as the upregulation of the NKG2D ligand expression could be blocked by an ATM-ATR inhibitor. In contrast, Gefitinib attenuated NKG2D ligand expression. Silencing EGFR using siRNA or addition of the PI3K inhibitor resulted in downregulation of NKG2D ligands. The observations suggest that the EGFR/PI3K pathway also regulates the expression of NKG2D ligands. Additionally, we showed that both ATM-ATR and EGFR regulate MICA/B via miR20a.In keeping with the effect on NKG2D expression, Gemcitabine enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity while Gefitinib attenuated NK cell killing in NSCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2254548967,"Although late-phase (>35min post-administration) 11C-PiB-PET has good sensitivity in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), its specificity is poor due to frequently high uptake in healthy aged subjects. By detecting perfusion-like abnormalities, early-phase 11C-PiB-PET might add diagnostic value. Early-frame (1-6min) 11C-PiB-PET was obtained in 11 non-demented patients with probable CAA-related symptomatic lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (70±7yrs), 9 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) and 10 HCs <55yrs. There was a significant decrease in early-phase atrophy-corrected whole-cortex SUV relative to cerebellar vermis (SUVR) in the CAA vs age-matched HC group. None of the age-matched controls fell below the lower 95% confidence limit derived from the young HCs, while 6/11 CAA patients did (sensitivity = 55%, specificity = 100%). Combining both early- and late-phase 11C-PiB data did not change the sensitivity and specificity of late-phase PiB, but combined early- and late-phase positivity entails a very high suspicion of underlying Aβ-related clinical disorder, i.e., CAA or Alzheimer disease (AD). In order to clarify this ambiguity, we then show that the occipital/posterior cingulate ratio is markedly lower in CAA than in AD (N = 7). These pilot data suggest that early-phase 11C-PiB-PET may not only add to late-phase PiB-PET with respect to the unclear situation of late-phase positivity, but also help differentiate CAA from AD."
https://openalex.org/W2173461872,"Objective Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery would reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in metabolically active adipose tissue (AT) of obese rats, and this change would be related to decreases in body weight and improved glycemic control. Methods Omental, mesenteric and subcutaneous fat depots were collected from Sprague-Dawley rats: Sham control and RYGB; 90-days after surgery. NLRP3, caspase–1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), IL–1β, IL–18, IL–6 and MCP–1 gene and protein expression were quantified. Glucose metabolism was assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Results Compared to Sham surgery controls, RYGB surgery decreased IL–6, MCP–1, NLRP3, IL–18, caspase–1 and ASC in omental fat, and decreased IL–6, MCP1, IL–1β, IL–18, caspase–1 and ASC gene expression in mesenteric fat. We observed differential gene expression between visceral and subcutaneous fat for IL–6 and IL–1β, both being downregulated by RYGB in visceral, and upregulated in subcutaneous depots. These changes in gene expression were accompanied by a decrease in NLRP3, ASC, IL–18, caspase–1 and IL–1β protein expression in omental tissue. We found a positive correlation between caspase–1, ASC, MCP–1, IL–18 and IL–6 gene expression following surgery and glucose AUC response in omental fat, while the change in glucose AUC response correlated with caspase–1 gene expression in subcutaneous fat. Conclusion This study demonstrates that bariatric surgery reverses inflammation in visceral adipose tissue by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These are the first data to implicate the NLRP3 inflammasome in diabetes remission after RYGB surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1793927536,"Fish gills represent a complex organ composed of several cell types that perform multiple physiological functions. Among these cells, ionocytes are implicated in the maintenance of ion homeostasis. However, because the ionocyte represents only a small percent of whole gill tissue, its specific transcriptome can be overlooked among the numerous cell types included in the gill. The objective of this study is to better understand ionocyte functions by comparing the RNA expression of this cell type in freshwater and seawater acclimated rainbow trout. To realize this objective, ionocytes were captured from gill cryosections using laser capture microdissection after immunohistochemistry. Then, transcriptome analyses were performed on an Agilent trout oligonucleotide microarray. Gene expression analysis identified 108 unique annotated genes differentially expressed between freshwater and seawater ionocytes, with a fold change higher than 3. Most of these genes were up-regulated in freshwater cells. Interestingly, several genes implicated in ion transport, extracellular matrix and structural cellular proteins appeared up-regulated in freshwater ionocytes. Among them, several ion transporters, such as CIC2, SLC26A6, and NBC, were validated by qPCR and/or in situ hybridization. The latter technique allowed us to localize the transcripts of these ion transporters in only ionocytes and more particularly in the freshwater cells. Genes involved in metabolism and also several genes implicated in transcriptional regulation, cell signaling and the cell cycle were also enhanced in freshwater ionocytes. In conclusion, laser capture microdissection combined with microarray analysis allowed for the determination of the transcriptional signature of scarce cells in fish gills, such as ionocytes, and aided characterization of the transcriptome of these cells in freshwater and seawater acclimated trout."
https://openalex.org/W2179443734,"A splicing mutation in the IKBKAP gene causes Familial Dysautonomia (FD), affecting the IKAP protein expression levels and proper development and function of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Here we found new molecular insights for the IKAP role and the impact of the FD mutation in the human PNS lineage by using a novel and unique human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line homozygous to the FD mutation originated by pre implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) analysis. We found that IKBKAP downregulation during PNS differentiation affects normal migration in FD-hESC derived neural crest cells (NCC) while at later stages the PNS neurons show reduced intracellular colocalization between vesicular proteins and IKAP. Comparative wide transcriptome analysis of FD and WT hESC-derived neurons together with the analysis of human brains from FD and WT 12 weeks old embryos and experimental validation of the results confirmed that synaptic vesicular and neuronal transport genes are directly or indirectly affected by IKBKAP downregulation in FD neurons. Moreover we show that kinetin (a drug that corrects IKBKAP alternative splicing) promotes the recovery of IKAP expression and these IKAP functional associated genes identified in the study. Altogether, these results support the view that IKAP might be a vesicular like protein that might be involved in neuronal transport in hESC derived PNS neurons. This function seems to be mostly affected in FD-hESC derived PNS neurons probably reflecting some PNS neuronal dysfunction observed in FD."
https://openalex.org/W2190537650,"Background MicroRNA (miR) expression is commonly dysregulated in many cancers, including breast. MiR–92 is one of six miRs encoded by the miR-17-92 cluster, one of the best-characterised oncogenic miR clusters. We examined expression of miR–92 in the breast epithelium and stroma during breast cancer progression. We also investigated the role of miR–92 in fibroblasts in vitro and showed that down-regulation in normal fibroblasts enhances the invasion of breast cancer epithelial cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We used laser microdissection (LMD) to isolate epithelial cells from matched normal, DCIS and invasive tissue from 9 breast cancer patients and analysed miR–92 expression by qRT-PCR. Expression of ERβ1, a direct miR–92 target, was concurrently analysed for each case by immunohistochemistry. LMD was also used to isolate matched normal (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from 14 further cases. Effects of miR–92 inhibition in fibroblasts on epithelial cell invasion in vitro was examined using a Matrigel™ assay. miR–92 levels decreased in microdissected epithelial cells during breast cancer progression with highest levels in normal breast epithelium, decreasing in DCIS (p<0.01) and being lowest in invasive breast tissue (p<0.01). This was accompanied by a shift in cell localisation of ERβ1 from nuclear expression in normal breast epithelium to increased cytoplasmic expression during progression to DCIS (p = 0.0078) and invasive breast cancer (p = 0.031). ERβ1 immunoreactivity was also seen in stromal fibroblasts in tissues. Where miR–92 expression was low in microdissected NFs this increased in matched CAFs; a trend also seen in cultured primary fibroblasts. Down-regulation of miR–92 levels in NFs but not CAFs enhanced invasion of both MCF–7 and MDA-MB–231 breast cancer epithelial cells. Conclusions miR–92 is gradually lost in breast epithelial cells during cancer progression correlating with a shift in ERβ1 immunoreactivity from nuclei to the cytoplasm. Our data support a functional role in fibroblasts where modification of miR–92 expression can influence the invasive capacity of breast cancer epithelial cells. However in silico analysis suggests that ERβ1 may not be the most important miR–92 target in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2226902876,"To examine quadriceps muscle fatigue and central motor output during fatiguing single joint exercise at 40% and 80% maximal torque output in resistance trained men.Ten resistance trained men performed fatiguing isometric knee extensor exercise at 40% and 80% of maximal torque output. Maximal torque, rate of torque development, and measures of central motor output and peripheral muscle fatigue were recorded at two matched volumes of exercise, and after a final contraction performed to exhaustion. Central motor output was quantified from changes in voluntary activation, normalized surface electromyograms (EMG), and V-waves. Quadriceps muscle fatigue was assessed from changes in the size and shape of the resting potentiated twitch (Q.(pot.tw)). Central motor output during the exercise protocols was estimated from EMG and interpolated twitches applied during the task (VA(sub)).Greater reductions in maximal torque and rate of torque development were observed during the 40% protocol (p<0.05). Maximal central motor output did not change for either protocol. For the 40% protocol reductions from pre-exercise in rate and amplitude variables calculated from the Q.(pot.tw) between 66.2 to 70.8% (p<0.001) exceeded those observed during the 80% protocol (p<0.01). V-waves only declined during the 80% protocol between 56.8 ± 35.8% to 53.6 ± 37.4% (p<0.05). At the end of the final 80% contraction VA(sub) had increased from 91.2 ± 6.2% to 94.9 ± 4.7% (p = 0.005), but a greater increase was observed during the 40% contraction where VA(sub) had increased from 67.1 ± 6.1% to 88.9 ± 9.6% (p<0.001).Maximal central motor output in resistance trained men is well preserved despite varying levels of peripheral muscle fatigue. Upregulated central motor output during the 40% contraction protocol appeared to elicit greater peripheral fatigue. V-waves declines during the 80% protocol suggest intensity dependent modulation of the Ia afferent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2211065199,"Alexithymia, or ""no words for feelings"", is highly prevalent in samples with childhood maltreatment and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been identified as a key region involved in alexithymia, early life trauma, and PTSD. Functional alterations in the dACC also have been associated with alexithymia in PTSD. This study examined whether dACC morphology is a neural correlate of alexithymia in child maltreatment-related PTSD. Sixteen adults with PTSD and a history of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exposure to domestic violence, and 24 healthy controls (HC) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness of the dACC was measured using FreeSurfer, and values were correlated with TAS-20 scores, controlling for sex and age, in both groups. Average TAS-20 score was significantly higher in the PTSD than the HC group. TAS-20 scores were significantly positively associated with dACC thickness only in the PTSD group. This association was strongest in the left hemisphere and for TAS-20 subscales that assess difficulty identifying and describing feelings. We found that increasing dACC gray matter thickness is a neural correlate of greater alexithymia in the context of PTSD with childhood maltreatment. While findings are correlational, they motivate further inquiry into the relationships between childhood adversity, emotional awareness and expression, and dACC morphologic development in trauma-related psychopathology."

In the present study, we examined the host response to MAP infection in spleens of mice in order to investigate the host immunopathology accompanying host-pathogen interaction. Transcriptional profiles of the MAP-infected mice at 3 and 6 weeks p.i. showed severe histopathological changes, whereas those at 12 weeks p.i. displayed reduced lesion severity in the spleen and liver. MAP-infected mice at 3 and 6 weeks p.i. showed up-regulation of interferon-related genes, scavenger receptor, and complement components, suggesting an initial innate immune reaction, such as macrophage activation, bactericidal activity, and macrophage invasion of MAP. Concurrently, MAP-infected mice at 3 and 6 weeks p.i. were also suggested to express M2 macrophage phenotype with up-regulation of Mrc1, and Marco and down-regulation of MHC class II, Ccr7, and Irf5, and canonical pathways related to the T cell response including ICOS-ICOSL signaling in T helper cells, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, and CD28 signaling in T helper cell. These results provide information which furthers the understanding of the immunopathologic response to MAP infection in mice, thereby providing insights valuable for research into the pathogenesis for MAP infection."
https://openalex.org/W2191008885,"The large quantities of data now being transferred via high-speed networks have made deep packet inspection indispensable for security purposes. Scalable and low-cost signature-based network intrusion detection systems have been developed for deep packet inspection for various software platforms. Traditional approaches that only involve central processing units (CPUs) are now considered inadequate in terms of inspection speed. Graphic processing units (GPUs) have superior parallel processing power, but transmission bottlenecks can reduce optimal GPU efficiency. In this paper we describe our proposal for a hybrid CPU/GPU pattern-matching algorithm (HPMA) that divides and distributes the packet-inspecting workload between a CPU and GPU. All packets are initially inspected by the CPU and filtered using a simple pre-filtering algorithm, and packets that might contain malicious content are sent to the GPU for further inspection. Test results indicate that in terms of random payload traffic, the matching speed of our proposed algorithm was 3.4 times and 2.7 times faster than those of the AC-CPU and AC-GPU algorithms, respectively. Further, HPMA achieved higher energy efficiency than the other tested algorithms."

A gatekeeper chaperone complex directs translocator secretion during type three secretion.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies and secretion assays in Yersinia indicate that the C. pneumoniae Scc4 and Scc1 chaperones promote CopN secretion, and the Scc3 chaperone represses its secretion (23.Silva-Herzog E. Joseph S.S. Avery A.K. Coba J.A. Wolf K. Fields K.A. Plano G.V. Scc1 (CP0432) and Scc4 (CP0033) function as a type III secretion chaperone for CopN of Chlamydia pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3490-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how such seemingly disparate chaperone-CopN interactions are utilized during chlamydiae infection. We have previously discovered that C. trachomatis CT663 (hereafter referred to as Scc4) serves as a transcriptional regulator (17.Rao X. Deighan P. Hua Z. Hu X. Wang J. Luo M. Wang J. Liang Y. Zhong G. Hochschild A. Shen L. A regulator from Chlamydia trachomatis modulates the activity of RNA polymerase through direct interaction with the β subunit and the primary σ subunit.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1818-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in addition to being a T3S chaperone. Unlike most previously described bacterial transcriptional regulators (with the exception of bacteriophage T4 AsiA protein) (32.Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Inhibition of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase by bacteriophage T4 AsiA.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), C. trachomatis Scc4 targets region 4 of σ66 and the flap domain of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) β subunit in the context of the RNAP holoenzyme. The σ66RNAP transcribes the majority of the housekeeping genes, including T3S system genes, in C. trachomatis (33.Hefty P.S. Stephens R.S. Chlamydial type III secretion system is encoded on ten operons preceded by σ 70-like promoter elements.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34.Case E.D.

Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2569-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Scc4, through specific interaction with the σ66RNAP holoenzyme, plays a crucial role in facilitating a global change in gene expression involved in regulating the T3S process during C. trachomatis infection. Understanding the dynamic interactions between T3S chaperones and their binding partners is a necessary step toward elucidating the regulated T3S process. Here, using biochemistry, quantitative mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and genetic approaches, we characterize the fundamental functionality of T3S chaperones using C. trachomatis Scc4, Scc1, and CopN as a model for chaperone-effector interactions. Combined with our previous results (17.Rao X. Deighan P. Hua Z. Hu X. Wang J. Luo M. Wang J. Liang Y. Zhong G. Hochschild A. Shen L. A regulator from Chlamydia trachomatis modulates the activity of RNA polymerase through direct interaction with the β subunit and the primary σ subunit.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1818-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we now demonstrate a dual role for C. trachomatis Scc4 as a necessary part of the Scc4·Scc1·CopN complex and also as a participant in RNA transcription through its binding to the σ66RNAP holoenzyme. Our data extend the understanding of the role of Scc4 and Scc1 chaperones in CopN recognition and, importantly, provide a new paradigm for strict control of T3S system action that is mediated by Scc4 to ensure that the T3S system appropriately functions in response to developmental and environmental cues. The pETDuet-1TEVSiteHis6 derived from pETDuet-1 (Novagen) encodes a hexahistidine (His6) tag that is removable with tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) cleavage. The Scc1 coding region was amplified from genomic DNA of C. trachomatis serovar F/IC-Cal-3 (ATCC VR-346) by PCR and cloned into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pETDuet-1TEVSiteHis6 to yield pDuetScc1-His6. The PT7-Scc1 fragment from pDuetScc1-His6 was then subcloned into pACYC184 to generate pACYCScc1-His6. The Scc4 sequence from pHis663 (17.Rao X. Deighan P. Hua Z. Hu X. Wang J. Luo M. Wang J.

Similarly, the Scc4 sequence was cloned into pCDFlac (35.Montero-Diez C. Deighan P. Osmundson J. Darst S.A. Hochschild A.

A synthesized gBlock fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing multiple mutations in Scc4 was cloned into pCDFScc4 at the NcoI/XhoI sites to generate pCDFScc4_6A. The BamHI/SphI fragment from pCDFScc4_6A was subcloned into the BamHI/SphI sites of pCDFScc4, resulting in pCDFScc4_4A.

The identity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2.1) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and l-glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), a HeLa monolayer grown on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in 24-well plates was inoculated with C. trachomatis serovar F/Cal-I-13 with a dose that results in infection of ∼50% of cells. The plates were then centrifuged at 1600 × g for 40 min at 37 °C. Infected cells were cultured in medium containing 1 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37 °C for various times as indicated under “Results.” After fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilizing with 4% saponin, cells were subjected to immunostaining with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated (red) or FITC-conjugated (green) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Images were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and processed using AxioVision software. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against λCI and a mouse polyclonal antibody against Scc4 were described previously (17.Rao X. Deighan P. Hua Z. Hu X. Wang J. Luo M. Wang J. Liang Y. Zhong G.

A mouse polyclonal antibody against Scc1 and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Scc4 antibody were kindly provided by Guangming Zhong (University of Texas, San Antonio, TX). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Scc1, Scc3, or CopN were kindly provided by Dr. Ken Fields (University of Kentucky) (28.Fields K.A. Hackstadt T. Evidence for the secretion of Chlamydia trachomatis CopN by a type III secretion mechanism.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recombinant Scc4 and Scc1 with a His6 tag at its C terminus (Scc1-His6) were expressed in E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS cells harboring pET28-Scc4 or pCDFScc4 and/or pACYCScc1-His6. Cells were grown in LB broth at 37 °C to A600 = 0.8, and then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. 15N-Labeled proteins were expressed similarly in minimal media (36.Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. A method for efficient isotopic labeling of recombinant proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) containing 0.1% [15N]ammonium chloride. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol supplemented with DNase I (Roche Applied Science), RNase A (Sigma), and EDTA-free protease inhibitor were lysed using an Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer (Avestin). Cleared lysate obtained by centrifugation at 184,250 × g for 45 min was then loaded onto a 5-ml His-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare) (at 4 °C). The column-bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Proteins were then concentrated to ∼8 ml and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) for gel filtration purification. The purification of tag-free Scc4 protein was performed using anion exchange chromatography (Source Q, GE Healthcare), followed by gel filtration purification as described previously (17.Rao X. Deighan P. Hua Z. Hu X. Wang J. Luo M. Wang J. Liang Y. Zhong G. Hochschild A. Shen L.

The GST-tagged CopN and GST-tagged Scc3 proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-blue cells. Protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Harvested cells were resuspended in 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl and lysed using an Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer. The cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS to remove unbound proteins, bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The Scc1-His6 used in the NMR experiments was purified under denaturing conditions and refolded on the HisTrap column. Briefly, harvested cells were suspended in BugBusterTM protein extraction reagent supplemented with 6 m urea and lysed by sonication at 30% power for 120 s (3 × 30 s on/10 s off). Cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a 3-ml column containing Ni2+-Sepharose fast flow media (GE Healthcare) and washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 6 m urea. The column-bound Scc1-His6 protein was refolded using a linear gradient from 6 to 0 m urea (30 ml total at 0.1 ml/min) and eluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. Gel filtration analysis of N-terminal His6-tagged Scc4 (His6-Scc4) and the Scc4·Scc1-His6 complex was conducted under different buffer conditions as indicated under “Results.” Standard curves were produced using each buffer and a protein molecular weight standard mixture (bovine serum albumin (BSA), β-lactoglobulin, cytochrome c, and cytidine). Linear regression analysis was used to determine best-fit line equations, which were then used to calculate the apparent molecular weights of samples. For this study, either a HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 HR column (1 ml sample injection volume, 1.5 ml/min flow rate) or an ENrich 70 SEC column (50 μl sample injection volume, 1.0 ml/min flow rate) was used with a Bio-Rad Duoflow F10 work station. Purified [15N]Scc4 was incubated with purified Scc4·Scc1-His6 complex in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol at a ratio of 2:1 or 10:1 ([15N]Scc4/Scc4·Scc1-His6 complex) for 0.5 and 2.0 h. Free Scc4 was then separated from the complex using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column. After extensive washing, the bound complex was eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol and then concentrated with a 5,000 molecular weight cut-off Amicom filter (Millipore). Concentrated proteins were then subjected to trypsin digestion and LC/MS analysis to determine the amount of [15N]Scc4 that had incorporated into the Scc4·Scc1-His6 complex.

The present study reports extensive observations on the distribution, morphology, occurrence and association of burrows and fecal pellets of the polychaete Nereis diversicolor in the Kundalika Estuary on the west coast of India. Our holistic study of these modern-day traces suggests it to be a complex trace arising from domichnial, fodinichnial and possibly pascichnial behavior of polychaetes. The study for the first time reports extensive fecal pellet production, distribution and their preservation as thick stacks in modern estuarine environment. These observations testify the fossilization potential of pellets and provide an explanation to their origin in the geological record. Their occurrence as strings associated with mounds not only suggests pascichnial behaviour of polychaetes but also allows the assignment of post-Paleozoic Tomaculum to the activity of polychaete worms. The production of fecal pellets in such large quantities plays a major role in increasing the average grain size of the substrate of these estuarine tidal flats, thereby improving aeration within the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1866768071,"Manual palpation is a common and very informative diagnostic tool based on estimation of changes in the stiffness of tissues that result from pathology. In the case of a small lesion or a lesion that is located deep within the body, it is difficult for changes in mechanical properties of tissue to be detected or evaluated via palpation. Furthermore, palpation is non-quantitative and cannot be used to localize the lesion. Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) can also be used to evaluate the properties of biological tissues non-invasively. In this study, an MRgFUS system combines high field (7T) MR and 3 MHz focused ultrasound to provide high resolution MR imaging and a small ultrasonic interrogation region (~0.5 x 0.5 x 2 mm), as compared with current clinical systems. MR-Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (MR-ARFI) provides a reliable and efficient method for beam localization by detecting micron-scale displacements induced by ultrasound mechanical forces. The first aim of this study is to develop a sequence that can concurrently quantify acoustic radiation force displacements and image the resulting transient shear wave. Our motivation in combining these two measurements is to develop a technique that can rapidly provide both ARFI and shear wave velocity estimation data, making it suitable for use in interventional radiology. Secondly, we validate this sequence in vivo by estimating the displacement before and after high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, and we validate the shear wave velocity in vitro using tissue-mimicking gelatin and tofu phantoms. Such rapid acquisitions are especially useful in interventional radiology applications where minimizing scan time is highly desirable."
https://openalex.org/W1829795781,"Determining the foraging behaviour of free-ranging marine animals is fundamental for assessing their habitat use and how they may respond to changes in the environment. However, despite recent advances in bio-logging technology, collecting information on both at-sea movement patterns and activity budgets still remains difficult in small pelagic seabird species due to the constraints of instrument size. The short-tailed shearwater, the most abundant seabird species in Australia (ca 23 million individuals), is a highly pelagic procellariiform. Despite its ecological importance to the region, almost nothing is known about its at-sea behaviour, in particular, its foraging activity. Using a combination of GPS and tri-axial accelerometer data-loggers, the fine scale three-dimensional foraging behaviour of 10 breeding individuals from two colonies was investigated. Five at-sea behaviours were identified: (1) resting on water, (2) flapping flight, (3) gliding flight, (4) foraging (i.e., surface foraging and diving events), and (5) taking-off. There were substantial intra- and inter- individual variations in activity patterns, with individuals spending on average 45.8% (range: 17.1-70.0%) of time at sea resting on water and 18.2% (range: 2.3-49.6%) foraging. Individuals made 76.4 ± 65.3 dives (range: 8-237) per foraging trip (mean duration 9.0 ± 1.9 s), with dives also recorded during night-time. With the continued miniaturisation of recording devices, the use of combined data-loggers could provide us with further insights into the foraging behaviour of small procellariiforms, helping to better understand interactions with their prey."
https://openalex.org/W2278904651,"Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger 2 (PREX2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) GTPase, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac1. GTP-bound Rac1 then activates its downstream effectors, including p21-activated kinases (PAKs). PREX2 and Rac1 are frequently mutated in cancer and have key roles within the insulin-signaling pathway. Rac1 can be inactivated by multiple mechanisms; however, negative regulation by insulin is not well understood. Here, we show that in response to being activated after insulin stimulation, Rac1 initiates its own inactivation by decreasing PREX2 GEF activity. Following PREX2-mediated activation of Rac1 by the second messengers PIP3 or Gβγ, we found that PREX2 was phosphorylated through a PAK-dependent mechanism. PAK-mediated phosphorylation of PREX2 reduced GEF activity toward Rac1 by inhibiting PREX2 binding to PIP3 and Gβγ. Cell fractionation experiments also revealed that phosphorylation prevented PREX2 from localizing to the cellular membrane. Furthermore, the onset of insulin-induced phosphorylation of PREX2 was delayed compared with AKT. Altogether, we propose that second messengers activate the Rac1 signal, which sets in motion a cascade whereby PAKs phosphorylate and negatively regulate PREX2 to decrease Rac1 activation. This type of regulation would allow for transient activation of the PREX2-Rac1 signal and may be relevant in multiple physiological processes, including diseases such as diabetes and cancer when insulin signaling is chronically activated."

Herein, we developed a 99mTc labeled membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) specific binding peptide, [99mTc]-(HYNIC-AF7p)(tricine)(TPPTS), for in vivo detection of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). [99mTc]-(HYNIC-AF7p)(tricine)(TPPTS) demonstrated nice biostability and high MT1-MMP binding affinity in vitro and in vivo. Tumor-to-muscle ratio was found to reach to the highest (4.17±0.49) at 2 hour after intravenously administration of [99mTc]-(HYNIC-AF7P)(tricine)(TPPTS) into MDA-MB-231 tumor bearing mice. Overall, [99mTc]-(HYNIC-AF7P)(tricine)(TPPTS) demonstrated great potential for MT1-MMP targeted detection in vivo and it would be a promising molecular imaging probe that are probably beneficial to breast cancer early diagnoses."

To determine the prevalence of occult infections in Korean vaccinated individuals, 87 vaccinated subjects were screened for the presence of HBV DNA using both the nested PCR protocol and the VERSANT HBV DNA 3.0 assay. The mutation patterns of variants were analyzed in full-length HBV genome sequences. Their HBsAg secretion and replication capacities were investigated using both in vitro transient transfection and in vivo hydrodynamic injection. The presence of HBV DNA was confirmed in 6 subjects (6.9%). All six variants had a common mutation type (X8Del) composed of an 8-bp deletion in the C-terminal region of the HBV X gene (HBxAg). Our in vitro and in vivo analyses using the full-length HBV genome indicated that the X8Del HBxAg variant reduced the secretion of HBsAg and HBV virions compared to the wild type. In conclusion, our data suggest that a novel mutation (X8Del) may contribute to occult HBV infection in Korean vaccinated individuals via a reduced secretion of HBsAg and virions, possibly by compromising HBxAg's transacting capacity."

The antiviral activity of SAMHD1, particularly against HIV-1, has sparked interest because of its assembly and related catalytic mechanism (30Gramberg T. Kahle T. Bloch N. Wittmann S. Müllers E.

Previous structural studies have shown that SAMHD1 is regulated by two allosteric sites, namely, a guanine-specific activator site (A1) and a dNTP-binding activator site (A2), which require GTP/dGTP as an activator to induce the formation of a tetrameric quaternary structure that hydrolyzes the substrates dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, and even dUTP (32Zhu C.

The crystal structure of the SAMHD1 catalytic core (HD domain) is in complex with mixtures of nucleotides, providing a compelling mechanism for the regulation of SAMHD1 enzymatic activity (36Ji X. Tang C. Zhao Q. Wang W. Xiong Y. Structural basis of cellular dNTP regulation by SAMHD1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E4305-E4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that SAMHD1 can also be activated by GTP, resulting in the generation of a long-lived activated state that plays a key role in efficient dNTP depletion (37Hansen E.C. Seamon K.J. Cravens S.L. Stivers J.T. GTP activator and dNTP substrates of HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 generate a long-lived activated state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E1843-E1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we discovered the loose steady state of the SAMHD1C tetramer, which has a rapid initial rate of dNTPase activity and does not require additional free GTP/dGTP to maintain its conformation in vitro. Here we present the crystal structure of SAMHD1C in complex with GTP at a resolution of 2.6 Å. The structure is the first demonstration of the existence of a relatively stable tetrameric form as reported previously (37Hansen E.C. Seamon K.J. Cravens S.L. Stivers J.T. GTP activator and dNTP substrates of HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 generate a long-lived activated state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E1843-E1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The present study has shown that SAMHD1C undergoes similar tetramerization and activation to the full-length wild-type protein, thereby suggesting that this tetrameric form may represent one of the main biological assembly states of SAMHD1 in cells and may be responsible for efficient dNTP depletion. The DNA sequence encoding human SAMHD1 residues 109–626 (SAMHD1C) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pET28a-Plus vector with an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion. SAMHD1C mutations were generated from the wild-type SAMHD1C plasmid using a DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis kit, and mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. BL21(DE3)Transetta E. coli cells were transformed with the SAMHD1C plasmids. A single colony of resulting cells was grown in 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. The culture was then inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown with shaking at 37 °C to A600 = ∼1.0. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cells were grown for an additional 16 h at 20 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified by two-step liquid column chromatography, using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were stored in a gel filtration column chromatography buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm TCEP. SAMHD1C protein (15 mg/ml, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm TCEP) was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, equilibrated against a reservoir solution of 0.2 m lithium citrate tribasic tetrahydrate, 24% PEG3350. Crystals appeared after 4 days of incubation at 20 °C. The crystals were dehydrated and frozen in a cryoprotectant solution, which consisted of Paratone-N mixed with paraffin oil at a 3:7 volume ratio. Diffraction data were collected on beam station 3W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The data were processed and scaled to 2.6 Å using the HKL2000 software package. The crystals of SAMHD1C were found to belong to the space group P212121, with cell dimensions of a = 80.943 Å, b = 142.765 Å, c = 199.501 Å, with four copies of SAMHD1C in the unit cell. The initial phase was obtained by molecular replacement using one monomer of 3U1N as a template. The Phaser program (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J.

The model was built manually using the Coot program (39Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab dNTPase assays were carried out in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm dNTPs, each at 0.8 μm protein. Reactions were incubated for the indicated times at 25 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The volume of the entire reaction system was 250 μl. Protein was separated by using an Amicon Ultra 0.5-ml 10-kDa filter (Millipore) at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The nucleotide hydrolysis reactions were analyzed by using a Venusil MP-C18 (150 × 4.6 mm) column (Agela Technologies) on a Waters HPLC system. The column was equilibrated at 40 °C in a 10 mm solution of triethylamine in water, pH 5.0 (buffer A). Injected samples were eluted with an 8-min linear gradient of methanol (buffer B) from 0 to 35%, followed by an isocratic phase of 35% buffer B over 10 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The absorbance data recorded at 260 nm were employed to calculate the amount of product in all cases. Based on the complexity of the mechanism of allosteric regulation of SAMHD1, it is possible that multiple active oligomeric states exist under physiological conditions. We observed that the purified SAMHD1C (referred to P-SAMHD1C) from E. coli was in equilibrium with monomers, dimers, and novel tetrameric forms, even without the addition of dNTP/NTP. After dialysis into the buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm TCEP) overnight, the protein (referred to D-SAMHD1C) was mainly in its monomeric form, mixed with a few dimers, depending on the concentration (Fig. 1A). The addition of GTP strongly shifted the equilibrium of D-SAMHD1C to its dimeric form. Each D-SAMHD1C tetramer bound to GTP through a dATP substrate, and the hydrolysis of dATP followed, whereas the control experiment demonstrated D-SAMHD1C in a monomeric/dimeric form that was incapable of enzymatically acting without the addition of GTP. We also observed that the P-SAMHD1C underwent a rapid initial burst of dATP hydrolysis, which resulted in an almost-complete hydrolysis of dATP after 1 h, whereas ∼80% of the substrate still remained after 5 h of incubation in the presence of the D-SAMHD1C, even after the addition of the activator of GTP (Fig. 1B). Here, to P-SAMHD1C, the enzyme hydrolyzed dATP at a similar rate of ∼9 μm/min whether GTP was present or not. However, the D-SAMHD1C activity was about 90-fold lower, ∼0.1 μm/min, in the presence of GTP. Therefore, the results show that P-SAMHD1C from E. coli has a much higher catalytic activity than does a standard reaction of the dimeric form of SAMHD1C induced by GTP under similar conditions. The present study also demonstrated that GTP was unable to stimulate the hydrolysis of dATP beyond the activation provided by P-SAMHD1C (0.8 μm) alone. The addition of a saturating 0.1 mm of GTP resulted in an enzyme kinetic progress curve similar to that of P-SAMHD1C (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that P-SAMHD1C was already tightly bound to GTP during the heterologous expression in E. coli. To illustrate the mechanism of the instantaneous reaction caused by P-SAMHD1C, we determined the crystal structure of P-SAMHD1C. Interestingly, P-SAMHD1C was bound to GTP (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 4Q7H) in a novel loosely associated tetrameric form (Figs. 1C and 2A). Only three GTP molecules were clearly identified as binding to the A1 sites, whereas the electron density of GTP in subunit D was invisible. This loose tetrameric structure of SAMHD1C thus revealed relatively loose protein-protein interfaces that have not been previously observed. The buried interface between subunits A and B (∼1,800 Å2), as well as the interface between subunits B and D (464 Å2), was highly similar to that of the structure of SAMHD1c (120–626) (PDB ID: 3U1N). The interface between subunits A and C (540 Å2) was also a novel feature (Fig. 2B). The interactions between the two dimers might play an important role in the stabilization of the tetramer, because the mutations on the interface impaired the tetramerization of SAMHD1C (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3The interface between the A and C subunits is essential for the tetramer formation of SAMHD1C. A, mutations of residues involved in the interactions between subunits A and C of SAMHD1 affect tetramer formation. Purified recombinant SAMHD1C and SAMHD1C mutant proteins were incubated with 50 mm dGTP and separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The elution profiles were monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at A280 and compared with known molecular size markers. mAU, milliabsorbance units.

https://openalex.org/W2291965159,"From the perspective of systems science, tumorigenesis can be hypothesized as a critical transition (an abrupt shift from one state to another) between proliferative and apoptotic attractors on the state space of a molecular interaction network, for which an attractor is defined as a stable state to which all initial states ultimately converge, and the region of convergence is called the basin of attraction. Before the critical transition, a cellular state might transit between the basin of attraction for an apoptotic attractor and that for a proliferative attractor due to the noise induced by the inherent stochasticity in molecular interactions. Such a flickering state transition (state transition between the basins of attraction for alternative attractors from the impact of noise) would become more frequent as the cellular state approaches near the boundary of the basin of attraction, which can increase the variation in the estimate of the respective basin size. To investigate this for colorectal tumorigenesis, we have constructed a stochastic Boolean network model of the molecular interaction network that contains an important set of proteins known to be involved in cancer. In particular, we considered 100 representative sequences of 20 gene mutations that drive colorectal tumorigenesis. We investigated the appearance of cancerous cells by examining the basin size of apoptotic, quiescent, and proliferative attractors along with the sequential accumulation of gene mutations during colorectal tumorigenesis. We introduced a measure to detect the flickering state transition as the variation in the estimate of the basin sizes for three-phenotype attractors from the impact of noise. Interestingly, we found that this measure abruptly increases before a cell becomes cancerous during colorectal tumorigenesis in most of the gene mutation sequences under a certain level of stochastic noise. This suggests that a frequent flickering state transition can be a precritical phenomenon of colorectal tumorigenesis."

We investigated the trend of and factors associated with acute hepatitis C (AHC) among HIV-infected individuals in Taiwan.The National Disease Surveillance System collects characteristics of AHC, HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhea cases through mandatory reports and patient interviews. Reported AHC patients in 2014 were interviewed additionally on sexual and parenteral exposures. Information on HCV genotypes were collected from the largest medical center serving HIV-infected Taiwanese. We defined an HIV/AHC case as a documented negative HCV antibody test result followed within 12 months by a positive test in a previously reported HIV-infected individual. Each case was matched to two HIV-infected, non-AHC controls for age, age of HIV diagnosis, sex, transmission route, HIV diagnosis date, and county/city. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify associated characteristics.During 2001-2014, 93 of 6,624 AHC reports were HIV/AHC cases; the annual case count increased from one in 2009 to 34 in 2014. All were males (81 [87%] MSM) aged 21-49 years with AHC diagnosed 2-5,923 days after HIV diagnoses. Sixty-eight (73%) lived in the Taipei metropolitan area. Detected HCV genotypes were 2a (n = 6), 1b (n = 5), 1b + 2a (n = 1) and 2b (n = 1). Among 28 HIV/AHC patients interviewed in 2014, 13 (46%) reported engaging in unprotected sex ≤3 months before AHC diagnosis. Seventy-nine HIV/AHC cases were matched to 158 controls. HIV/AHC was associated with recent syphilis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2-28.6) and last syphilis >6 months (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9).HIV/AHC cases continued to increase particularly among sexually active HIV-infected MSM with a syphilis diagnosis in northern Taiwan. We recommend surveillance of associated behavioral and virologic characteristics and HCV counseling and testing for HIV-infected men in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2211886927,"Thyroid hormone treatment in brain-dead organ donors has been extensively studied and applied in the clinical setting. However, its clinical applicability remains controversial due to a varying degree of success and a lack of mechanistic understanding about the therapeutic effects of 3,3',5-Triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). T3 pre-conditioning leads to anti-apoptotic and pro-mitotic effects in liver tissue following ischemia/reperfusion injury. Therefore, we aimed to study the effects of T3 pre-conditioning in the liver of brain-dead rats.Brain death (BD) was induced in mechanically ventilated rats by inflation of a Fogarty catheter in the epidural space. T3 (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally 2 h prior to BD induction. After 4 h of BD, serum and liver tissue were collected. RT-qPCR, routine biochemistry, and immunohistochemistry were performed.Brain-dead animals treated with T3 had lower plasma levels of AST and ALT, reduced Bax gene expression, and less hepatic cleaved Caspase-3 activation compared to brain-dead animals treated with vehicle. Interestingly, no differences in the expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6, MCP-1, IL-1β) or the presence of pro-mitotic markers (Cyclin-D and Ki-67) were found in brain-dead animals treated with T3 compared to vehicle-treated animals.T3 pre-conditioning leads to beneficial effects in the liver of brain-dead rats as seen by lower cellular injury and reduced apoptosis, and supports the suggested role of T3 hormone therapy in the management of brain-dead donors."
https://openalex.org/W2221426131,"Antithrombotic therapy consisting of a dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) and oral anti-coagulation (OAC) with a vitamin k antagonist is often referred to as triple therapy. This combined anticoagulation is applied in patients undergoing coronary artery stent implantation while also having an indication for OAC. Triple therapy increases the risk for bleeding events compared to either DAPT or OAC alone and thereby might be associated with adverse outcomes. Clinical data on the frequency of bleeding events in patients on triple therapy from clinical trials derives from pre-selected patients and may differ from the real world patients. We report data on patient characteristics and bleeding incidence of patients dismissed on triple therapy from a single university hospital. Within the time span from January 2000 to December 2012, we identified a total of 213 patients undergoing PCI who were prescribed a triple therapy for at least 4 weeks (representing 0.86% of all patients treated). The usage of triple therapy significantly increased over the observed time period. The average CHA2DS2-VASc Score was 3.1 ± 1.1 with an average HAS-BLED score of 2.5 ± 0.86 representing a high-risk group for thromboembolic events as well as considerable risk for bleeding events. An on-treatment bleeding incidence of 9.4% was detected, with gastrointestinal and airway bleeding being the most frequent (5.1% and 1.4%, respectively). This is consistent with data from clinical trials and confirms the high risk of bleeding in patients on DAPT plus OAC. 29.0% of all patients receiving triple therapy had an indication for OAC other than non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This substantial patient group is underrepresented by clinical trials and needs further attention."
https://openalex.org/W1838821334,"In order to investigate the central effect of alarin on glucose uptake, we administered alarin and/ or its inhibitor, ala6-25Cys into the cerebral ventricles of the type 2 diabetic rats. Then the relative parameters about glucose uptake in skeletal muscles were measured. We found that central treatment with alarin significantly increased the food intake, body weight and glucose infusion rates in hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp tests of the animals. Besides, the treatment also enhanced 2-deoxy-[3H]-D-glucose uptake, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 contents, glucose transporter 4 protein and mRNA expression, as well as pAktThr308, pAktSer473 and total Akt levels in muscle cells, but reduced plasma glucose and insulin levels of the rats. All of the alarin-inducing events may be antagonised by central injection of ala6-25Cys. These results suggest that central administration of alarin stimulates glucose uptake mediated by activation of Akt signal pathway in type 2 diabetic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2176013417,"Nuptial gifts produced by males and transferred to females during copulation are common in insects. Yet, their precise composition and subsequent physiological effects on the female recipient remain unresolved. Male decorated crickets Gryllodes sigillatus transfer a spermatophore to the female during copulation that is composed of an edible gift, the spermatophylax, and the ampulla that contains the ejaculate. After transfer of the spermatophore, the female detaches the spermatophylax and starts to eat it while sperm from the ampulla are evacuated into the female reproductive tract. When the female has finished consuming the spermatophylax, she detaches the ampulla and terminates sperm transfer. Hence, one simple function of the spermatophylax is to ensure complete sperm transfer by distracting the female from prematurely removing the ampulla. However, the majority of orally active components of the spermatophylax itself and their subsequent effects on female behavior have not been identified. Here, we report the first analysis of the proteome of the G. sigillatus spermatophylax and the transcriptome of the male accessory glands that make these proteins. The accessory gland transcriptome was assembled into 17,691 transcripts whilst about 30 proteins were detected within the mature spermatophylax itself. Of these 30 proteins, 18 were encoded by accessory gland encoded messages. Most spermatophylax proteins show no similarity to proteins with known biological functions and are therefore largely novel. A spermatophylax protein shows similarity to protease inhibitors suggesting that it may protect the biologically active components from digestion within the gut of the female recipient. Another protein shares similarity with previously characterized insect polypeptide growth factors suggesting that it may play a role in altering female reproductive physiology concurrent with fertilization. Characterization of the spermatophylax proteome provides the first step in identifying the genes encoding these proteins in males and in understanding their biological functions in the female recipient."
https://openalex.org/W1943035200,"In psychiatry, hospital stays and transitions to the ambulatory sector are susceptible to major changes in drug therapy that lead to complex medication regimens and common non-adherence among psychiatric patients. A multi-dimensional and inter-sectoral intervention is hypothesized to improve the adherence of psychiatric patients to their pharmacotherapy.269 patients from a German university hospital were included in a prospective, open, clinical trial with consecutive control and intervention groups. Control patients (09/2012-03/2013) received usual care, whereas intervention patients (05/2013-12/2013) underwent a program to enhance adherence during their stay and up to three months after discharge. The program consisted of therapy simplification and individualized patient education (multi-dimensional component) during the stay and at discharge, as well as subsequent phone calls after discharge (inter-sectoral component). Adherence was measured by the ""Medication Adherence Report Scale"" (MARS) and the ""Drug Attitude Inventory"" (DAI).The improvement in the MARS score between admission and three months after discharge was 1.33 points (95% CI: 0.73-1.93) higher in the intervention group compared to controls. In addition, the DAI score improved 1.93 points (95% CI: 1.15-2.72) more for intervention patients.These two findings indicate significantly higher medication adherence following the investigated multi-dimensional and inter-sectoral program.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006358."
https://openalex.org/W2219570324,"Long-term morphine treatment leads to tolerance which attenuates analgesic effect and hampers clinical utilization. Recent studies have sought to reveal the mechanism of opioid receptors and neuroinflammation by observing morphological changes of cells in the rat spinal cord. This work proposes a high-content screening (HCS) based computational method, HCS-Morph, for predicting neuroinflammation in morphine tolerance to facilitate the development of tolerance therapy using immunostaining images for astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the spinal cord. HCS-Morph first extracts numerous HCS-based features of cellular phenotypes. Next, an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm is used to identify a minimal set of features by maximizing the prediction accuracy of neuroinflammation. Finally, a mathematic model using a support vector machine with the identified features is established to predict drug-treated images to assess the effects of tolerance therapy. The dataset consists of 15 saline controls (1 μl/h), 15 morphine-tolerant rats (15 μg/h), and 10 rats receiving a co-infusion of morphine (15 μg/h) and gabapentin (15 μg/h, Sigma). The three individual models of astrocytes, microglia, and neurons for predicting neuroinflammation yielded respective Jackknife test accuracies of 96.67%, 90.00%, and 86.67% on the 30 rats, and respective independent test accuracies of 100%, 90%, and 60% on the 10 co-infused rats. The experimental results suggest that neuroinflammation activity expresses more predominantly in astrocytes and microglia than in neuron cells. The set of features for predicting neuroinflammation from images of astrocytes comprises mean cell intensity, total cell area, and second-order geometric moment (relating to cell distribution), relevant to cell communication, cell extension, and cell migration, respectively. The present investigation provides the first evidence for the role of gabapentin in the attenuation of morphine tolerance from phenotypic changes of astrocytes and microglia. Based on neuroinflammation prediction, the proposed computer-aided image diagnosis system can greatly facilitate the development of tolerance therapy with anti-inflammatory drugs."

The ENDOR spectra obtained were similar for untreated PSII from T. vulcanus and spinach, as well as for Ca2+-containing and Sr2+-substituted PSII, indicating that the proton arrangements around the manganese cluster in cyanobacterial and higher plant PSII and Ca2+-containing and Sr2+-substituted PSII are similar in the S2 state, in agreement with the similarity of the crystal structure of both Ca2+-containing and Sr2+-substituted PSII in the S1 state. Nevertheless, slightly different hyperfine separations were found between Ca2+-containing and Sr2+-substituted PSII because of modifications of the water protons ligating to the Sr2+ ion. Importantly, Ca2+ depletion caused the loss of ENDOR signals with a 1.36-MHz separation because of the loss of the water proton W4 connecting Ca2+ and YZ directly. With respect to the crystal structure and the functions of Ca2+ in oxygen evolution, it was concluded that the roles of Ca2+ and Sr2+ involve the maintenance of the hydrogen bond network near the Ca2+ site and electron transfer pathway to the manganese cluster.

When a photon is absorbed by PSII antenna pigments, excitation energy is transferred to P680, the reaction center of PSII consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins, where charge separation occurs. The photoexcited electron is immediately transferred to the accepter side, QB, via pheophytin and QA, whereas the P680+ generated by this charge separation oxidizes a manganese cluster via a redox-active tyrosine residue YZ. The manganese cluster is the core device for water oxidation in PSII, which adopts five different redox states, termed Sn (where n = 0–4). When the manganese cluster is oxidized, the S state is advanced to the next state (namely, from Sn to Sn+1). One or two protons are released in each S state transition except for the transition from S1 to S2. S1 is the most stable state in the dark at room temperature, whereas S4 is a transit state that is difficult to detect experimentally and returns to the S0 state immediately upon excitation of the S3 state and evolution of the molecular oxygen (see reviews in Refs. 1.Nelson N.

Recently, the structure of the S1 state manganese cluster was solved by x-ray crystal structure analysis with 1.9 Å resolution (4.Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.-R. Kamiya N. Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å.Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar), which revealed that the manganese cluster has a distorted cubic structure formed by three manganeses, four oxygens, and one calcium, with another manganese ion (denoted as Mn4) and an oxygen atom connected at the outside of the cubane link the backrest of a chair; thus, the overall structure of the manganese cluster resembled a “distorted chair” form. In this cluster, two water molecules, W1 and W2, are ligated to the outside (dangler) manganese (Mn4), and other two water molecules, W3 and W4, are ligated to the Ca2+ ion (see Fig. 1). Although this structure was obtained at an unprecedentedly high resolution, the manganese cluster may have suffered slight radiation damage from the utilization of strong and continuous synchrotron x-rays. Recently, Suga et al. (5.Suga M. Akita F. Hirata K. Ueno G. Murakami H. Nakajima Y. Shimizu T. Yamashita K. Yamamoto M. Ago H. Shen J.-R.

The XFEL structure showed that the manganese-manganese distances are shortened by 0.1–0.2 Å, and based on the average distances between the manganese ions and their oxo-bridges and ligands, the manganese valences were assigned as Mn1(III), Mn2(IV), Mn3(IV), and Mn4(III) in the S1 state. The amino acid residues ligated to the manganese cluster were identified unambiguously by the x-ray structures, among which, D1-His332, D1-Asp342, and D1-Glu189 were ligated to Mn1; D1-Asp342, D1-Ala344, and CP43-Glu354 were ligated to Mn2; D1-Glu333 and CP43-Glu354 were ligated to Mn3; D1-Asp170 and D1-Glu333 were ligated to Mn4; and D1-Ala344 and D1-Asp170 were ligated to the Ca2+ ion (4.Umena Y.

However, the x-ray crystallographic analysis did not identify the location of protons, and the proton network structure and protonation states of μ-oxo-bridges and water molecules ligated to the manganese cluster are still unclear. The information of proton locations is essential for elucidating the precise structure of the manganese cluster and the mechanism of water splitting, because the proton and/or hydrogen coordinates seriously influence the interpretation of the valences of manganese and manganese-manganese distances, and the site of proton release must be determined before a complete mechanism of water splitting can be elucidated. The only cation other than manganese ions in the manganese cluster is Ca2+, and its exact function in water splitting is still largely unknown (see reviews in Refs. 6.Yocum C.F.

Chloride-depletion effects in the calcium-deficient oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12998-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FTIR results showed that chelators interact with carboxylate groups in the Ca2+-depleted PSII (35.Kimura Y. Ono T.A.

However, the dark stability of the multiline signal is not ascribed to the effect of the chelators (19.Haddy A. Ore B.M. An alternative method for calcium depletion of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II as revealed by the dark-stable multiline EPR signal.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3805-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although small magnetic interactions are concealed in the broad EPR line width, information concerning the positions and numbers of protons surrounding the manganese cluster is included in the EPR signal. There are different techniques to extract information regarding the position and number of the nuclei, such as pulsed ENDOR, ESEEM, and ELDOR. Previous studies using Q-band pulsed 55Mn ENDOR spectra indicated that 55Mn hyperfine couplings of untreated PSII and Ca2+-depleted (citrate-treated) PSII are similar (36.Lohmiller T. Cox N. Su J.-H. Messinger J. Lubitz W. The basic properties of the electronic structure of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II are not perturbed by Ca2+ removal.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 24721-24733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), even though the latter was in the “modified multiline” state. The spectral resolution of CW-ENDOR is generally higher than pulsed ENDOR/ELDOR; however, the measurement conditions are restricted because of the dependence of the relaxation properties of the electron and nuclei spins (37.Nagashima H. Mino H. Highly resolved proton matrix ENDOR of oriented photosystem II membranes in the S2 state.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ESEEM (HYSCORE) is an alternative technique to obtain the information regarding the nucleus; however, the treatments of blind spots and analysis are more complicated, and therefore careful treatments are required. These techniques should be used to complement each other to gain detailed information on the nuclei surrounding the manganese cluster. We detected six pairs of proton hyperfine signals in the untreated PSII membranes by the proton matrix ENDOR (37.Nagashima H. Mino H. Highly resolved proton matrix ENDOR of oriented photosystem II membranes in the S2 state.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38.Yamada H. Mino H. Itoh S. Protons bound to the Mn cluster in photosystem II oxygen evolving complex detected by proton matrix ENDOR.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is similar to the number of protons detected by HYSCORE (39.Milikisiyants S. Chatterjee R. Coates C.S. Koua F.H.M. Shen J.-R. Lakshmi K.V. The structure and activation of substrate water molecules in the S2 state of photosystem II studied by hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy.Energy Environ Sci. 2012; 5: 7747-7756Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Curiously, only a small number of the signals was detected in highly resolved CW-ENDOR spectra within ∼4 MHz hyperfine couplings, i.e. approximately within 6 Å (37.Nagashima H. Mino H. Highly resolved proton matrix ENDOR of oriented photosystem II membranes in the S2 state.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38.Yamada H. Mino H. Itoh S. Protons bound to the Mn cluster in photosystem II oxygen evolving complex detected by proton matrix ENDOR.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), despite more than 30 ENDOR detectable protons that could be inferred from the crystallographic data (4.Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.-R. Kamiya N. Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å.Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar, 5.Suga M. Akita F. Hirata K.

Native structure of photosystem II at 1.95 Å resolution viewed by femtosecond x-ray pulses.Nature. 2015; 517: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This may be ascribed to line broadening of the movable protons, and CW-ENDOR may have detected relatively immovable protons relative to the manganese coordinates. These proton signals, matrix ENDOR, are mainly composed of magnetic dipolar interactions with protons and electrons. Therefore, it is possible to identify the location of the protons from the electrons. By using a point dipole approximation, the locations of the protons are estimated to be 2.7–6.0 Å away from the manganese cluster, corresponding to a hyperfine separation of less than 4 MHz. However, the electrons are largely delocalized on the manganese cluster, and therefore the spin density distribution of individual manganese ions should be used. We previously obtained spin density distribution over the manganese ions using pulsed ELDOR measurements (30.Asada M. Nagashima H. Koua F.H.M. Shen J.-R. Kawamori A. Mino H. Electronic structure of S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II studied by PELDOR.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2189834960,"Live coral is harvested throughout the Indo-West Pacific to make lime, used in the consumption of the world's fourth-most consumed drug, betel nut. Coral harvesting is an environmental concern; however, because lime-making is one of the few sources of income in some areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG), the practice is unlikely to stop. To better manage coral harvest, we used standard fishery-yield methods to generate sustainable-harvest guidelines for corymbose Acropora species found on the reef flat and crest at Lababia, PNG. We constructed a yield curve (weight-specific net annual-dry-weight production) by: 1) describing the allometric relationship between colony size and dry weight, and using that relationship to estimate the dry weight of Acropora colonies in situ; 2) estimating annual growth of Acropora colonies by estimating in situ, and describing the relationship between, colony dry weight at the beginning and end of one year; and 3) conducting belt-transect surveys to describe weight-frequencies and ultimately to predict annual weight change per square meter for each weight class. Reef habitat covers a total 2,467,550 m2 at Lababia and produces an estimated 248,397 kg/y (dry weight) of corymbose Acropora, of which 203,897 kg is produced on the reef flat/crest. We conservatively estimate that 30,706.6 kg of whole, dry, corymbose, Acropora can be sustainably harvested from the reef flat/crest habitat each year provided each culled colony weighs at least 1805 g when dry (or is at least 46 cm along its major axis). Artisanal lime-makers convert 24.8% of whole-colony weight into marketable lime, thus we estimate 7615.2 g of lime can be sustainably produced annually from corymbose Acropora. This value incorporates several safety margins, and should lead to proper management of live coral harvest. Importantly, the guideline recognizes village rights to exploit its marine resources, is consistent with village needs for income, and balances an equally strong village desire to conserve its marine resources for future generations."
https://openalex.org/W2197950414,"In this study, we aimed to predict newly diagnosed patient responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging tools to explore changes in spontaneous brain activity. We recruited 21 newly diagnosed epileptic patients, 8 drug-resistant (DR) patients, 11 well-healed (WH) patients, and 13 healthy controls. After a 12-month follow-up, 11 newly diagnosed epileptic patients who showed a poor response to AEDs were placed into the seizures uncontrolled (SUC) group, while 10 patients were enrolled in the seizure-controlled (SC) group. By calculating the amplitude of fractional low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals to measure brain activity during rest, we found that the SUC patients showed increased activity in the bilateral occipital lobe, particularly in the cuneus and lingual gyrus compared with the SC group and healthy controls. Interestingly, DR patients also showed increased activity in the identical cuneus and lingual gyrus regions, which comprise Brodmann's area 17 (BA17), compared with the SUC patients; however, these abnormalities were not observed in SC and WH patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that the fALFF value of BA17 could differentiate SUC patients from SC patients and healthy controls with sufficient sensitivity and specificity prior to the administration of medication. Functional connectivity analysis was subsequently performed to evaluate the difference in connectivity between BA17 and other brain regions in the SUC, SC and control groups. Regions nearby the cuneus and lingual gyrus were found positive connectivity increased changes or positive connectivity changes with BA17 in the SUC patients, while remarkably negative connectivity increased changes or positive connectivity decreased changes were found in the SC patients. Additionally, default mode network (DMN) regions showed negative connectivity increased changes or negative changes with BA17 in the SUC patients. The abnormal increased in BA17 activity may be a key point that plays a substantial role in facilitating seizure onset."
