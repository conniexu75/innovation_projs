Other amino acids are destroyed to a lesser extent or in certain cases are released incompletely from peptide linkage. It is evident that these difficulties, as well as others, could be overcome by employing proteolytic enzymes as the sole agents for hydrolysis. The complete enzymic degradation of proteins was studied by several investigators in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Meissner (2), Kiihne and Chittenden (3, 4), Chittenden and Goodwin (5), and Neumeister (6, 7) demonstrated that pepsin and trypsin hydrolyzed proteins to produce a complex mixture of peptides called proteoses and peptones. These were considered to be the ultimate end products of proteolysis until 1901, when Cohnheim (8) showed that intestinal extracts (erepsin) hydrolyzed peptones to amino acids. Subsequent studies, in particular those of Frankel (9), showed that the combined action of pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin resulted in cleavage of over 90% of the peptide bonds in several purified proteins.1 Although it was evident from these early investigations that proteins could be degraded by enzymes to amino acids, later investigators did not develop a system for complete enzymic hydrolysis. This can be attributed to a variety of causes, but two major problems which only recently have been satisfactorily solved presented the most difficulty. Micromethods for the precise analysis and characterization of amino acids and peptides were not available, and secondly, purified proteolytic enzymes were not characterized sufficiently to be used as hydrolytic agents. With these considerations, we have developed methods that employ proteolytic enzymes for hydrolysis of proteins. Our studies demonstrate that digestion of a protein by papain (12), followed by treatment with the purified kidney peptidases, leucine aminopeptidase (13), and prolidase (14) results in essentially complete hydrolysis of all peptide bonds and gives high yields of tryptophan, glutamine, and asparagine."

https://openalex.org/W1987322282,Two pigeons were trained to peck at a transilluminated disk. The training procedure caused the rate of pecking to increase as a function of the luminance of the disk. The results suggest that the relation between apparent magnitude of light and physical intensity is a power function.

https://openalex.org/W1988159047,"DARCY1,2 has demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis the presence of a protein in the sera of fœtal, neonatal, pregnant, tumour-bearing and regenerating rats not found in the sera of healthy, non-pregnant adults of either sex. More recently, Beaton et al.3,4 and Heim5 have shown, in the sera of pregnant and neonatal rats, the existence of a distinct protein component in the electrophoretic pattern obtained by starch-gel electrophoresis which is absent from the patterns of sera from healthy, non-pregnant, adult rats. Beaton et al.4 also demonstrated this component in certain pathological conditions and Heim5 found it in sera from fœtal and lactating rats. The presence or absence of the new component, hereinafter termed reproduction-associated protein, has now been determined over most of the life-cycle of the rat and under certain experimental conditions. A hypothesis of identity of the reproduction-associated protein with the protein discovered by Darcy1 is suggested."

The exchange of oxygen through the membrane was studied by means of oxygen-18, and it grossly exceeded that obtained with membranes containing methemoglobin or only water."
https://openalex.org/W1965623278,"SEVERAL dehydrogenases have been resolved into isoenzymes by electrophoresis in starch gel. Attempts to fractionate L-glutamate dehydrogenase in this way, however, have so far failed. Markert and Moller1 found that this enzyme was electrophoretically immobile in starch gel, and Tsao2 obtained negative results in attempts to fractionate and render gluta-mate dehydrogenase visible."

https://openalex.org/W1988075999,"Seven unique wavelength responses, two inhibitory and five excitatory, with sensitivity maxima from 435 to 635 millimicrons, have been recorded from light-adapted, non-albino rabbits. Several combinations, usually one excitatory with one inhibitory response, often having characteristics suggesting mutual antagonism between them, were observed from single lateral geniculate cells."

https://openalex.org/W2007338410,"THE group-specific components of sera consist of electrophoretically variable α2-globulins demonstrable by means of an immuno-electrophoretic technique1. This system allows a division of human sera into three qualitatively different patterns characterized by the presence of a fast-moving group-specific component (Gc 1–1), a slow-moving component (Gc 2–2), which in immuno-electrophoresis both give normally arc-shaped precipitates, or the simultaneous presence of both fast- and slow-moving components (Gc 2–1), which in immuno-electrophoresis give an extended two-peaked precipitate due to a reaction of immunological identity between these electrophoretically different although immunologically identical fast-and slow-moving components1. Investigations on sera from 42 families with 137 children and more than 600 mother–child combinations have shown that these serum patterns are genetically determined by two autosomal alleles (Gc1 and Gc2) without dominance where the serum types Gc 1–1 and Gc 2–2 are the homozygotes and Gc 2–1 the heterozygote. Up to now, no exceptions to this genetical theory or unresolved typing difficulties has been found in the material investigated2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2074772892,"IT has been shown that animals with chronically implanted electrodes will repeatedly operate a pedal to stimulate certain areas of their own brains. The responding differs in several ways from that of orthodox conditioning procedures: it is highly resistant to satiation, fatigue and distraction, and it continues unaffected when known physiological needs are fully satiated. If the stimulating current is stopped, extinction follows almost immediately, although ‘one-trial’ relearning occurs when the current is again applied. To explain these features it has been suggested that the electrical shock to the brain serves merely to ‘energize’ a compulsive and automatic repetition of the general pattern of activity present before receipt of tho shock, and that electrical shock to the brain is not ‘rewarding’ in the usual sense1–3."
