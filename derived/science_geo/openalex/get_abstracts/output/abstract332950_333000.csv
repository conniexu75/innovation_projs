https://openalex.org/W2023899869,"According to the astronomical theory of climate, variations in the earth's orbit are the fundamental cause of the succession of Pleistocene ice ages. This article summarizes how the theory has evolved since the pioneer studies of James Croll and Milutin Milankovitch, reviews recent evidence that supports the theory, and argues that a major opportunity is at hand to investigate the physical mechanisms by which the climate system responds to orbital forcing. After a survey of the kinds of models that have been applied to this problem, a strategy is suggested for building simple, physically motivated models, and a time-dependent model is developed that simulates the history of planetary glaciation for the past 500,000 years. Ignoring anthropogenic and other possible sources of variation acting at frequencies higher than one cycle per 19,000 years, this model predicts that the long-term cooling trend which began some 6000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2054495841,"A thermally stable 3 x 3 octahedral molecular sieve corresponding to natural todorokite (OMS-1) has been synthesized by autoclaving layer-structure manganese oxides, which are prepared by reactions of MnO(4)(-) and Mn(2+) under markedly alkaline conditions. The nature and thermal stability of products depend strongly on preparation parameters, such as the MnO(4)(-)/Mn(2+) ratio, pH, aging, and autoclave conditions. The purest and the most thermally stable todorokite is obtained at a ratio of 0.30 to 0.40. Autoclave treatments at about 150 degrees to 180 degrees C for more than 2 days yield OMS-1, which is as thermally stable (500 degrees C) as natural todorokite minerals. Adsorption data give a tunnel size of 6.9 angstroms and an increase of cyclohexane or carbon tetrachloride uptake with dehydration temperature up to 500 degrees C. At 600 degrees C, the tunnel structure collapses. Both Lewis and Br√∂nsted acid sites have been observed in OMS-1. Particular applications of these materials include adsorption, electrochemical sensors, and oxidation catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2028187959,"Application of a direct-current electric field in soils that contain contaminated liquid is expected to produce an important in situ means of environmental restoration. The electric field induces a motion of the liquid and dissolved ions that transports the contaminant to wells for removal. Electrode chemistry plays an important role, and reagents can be introduced at the electrodes to enhance contaminant removal rates. Experiments and modeling demonstrate high degrees of contaminant removal, propagation of sharp acid and base wave fronts from the electrodes, and a ""focusing"" effect by which metals accumulate in regions of the soil."
https://openalex.org/W1977488457,"Nine common species of aquatic macrophytes took all their phosphorus from the sediments when grown in situ in both a mesotrophic and a mildly eutrophic bay. Even under hypertrophic conditions, the sediments contributed an average of 72 percent of all the phosphorus taken up during growth. These experiments unambiguously demonstrate for the first time that submergent macrophytes in nature over-whelmingly depend on the sediments for their phosphorus supply and characterize them as potential nutrient pumps to the open water."
https://openalex.org/W2072013831,"The 1992 global average total ozone, measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on the Nimbus-7 satellite, was 2 to 3 percent lower than any earlier year observed by TOMS (1979 to 1991). Ozone amounts were low in a wide range of latitudes in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and the largest decreases were in the regions from 10 degrees S to 20 degrees S and 100N to 60 degrees N. Global ozone in 1992 is at least 1.5 percent lower than would be predicted by a statistical model that includes a linear trend and accounts for solar cycle variation and the quasi-biennial oscillation. These results are confirmed by comparisons with data from other ozone monitoring instruments: the SBUV/2 instrument on the NOAA-11 satellite, the TOMS instrument on the Russian Meteor-3 satellite, the World Standard Dobson Instrument 83, and a collection of 22 ground-based Dobson instruments."
https://openalex.org/W2054320288,"In most soils of the humid tropics, kaolinitic topsoil horizons overlie more gibbsitic horizons. This arrangement cannot be produced simply by leaching. Quantitative measurement of the turnover of chemical elements in the litterfall in an Amazonian ecosystem indicates that the forest cycles a significant amount of elements, particularly silicon. As a result, fluids that percolate through topsoil horizons already contain dissolved silicon. This effect keeps silicon from being leached down and may account for the stability of kaolinite in the soil upper horizons. The soil mineral composition is thus maintained by biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2060820870,"Fullerene tubular structures can be generated by vapor condensation of carbon on an atomically flat graphite surface. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images revealed the presence of tubes with extremely small diameters (from 10 to 70 angstroms), most of which are terminated by hemispherical caps. Atomic resolution images of such structures showed that the tubes have a helical graphitic nature. The formation of the tubes under the quasi-free conditions suggests that the growth to tubular rather than spherical configurations is preferred for ""giant fullerenes."""
https://openalex.org/W2018581789,"Preferential loss of uranium-234 relative to uranium-238 from rocks into solutions has long been attributed to recoiling alpha-emitting nuclei. Direct evidence has been obtained for two mechanisms, first, recoil ejection from grains, and now release by natural etching of alpha-recoil tracks. The observations have implications for radon emanation and for the storage of alpha-emitting radioactive waste."
https://openalex.org/W1977079104,"The opposition effect, the sharp surge in brightness of an astronomical object observed near zero phase angle, which has been known for more than a century, has generally been explained by shadow hiding. The reflectances of several Apollo lunar soil samples have been measured as a function of phase angle in linearly and circularly polarized light. All samples exhibited a decrease in the linear polarization ratio and an increase in the circular polarization ratio in the opposition peak. This provides unequivocal proof that most of the lunar opposition effect is caused by coherent backscatter, not shadow hiding. This result has major implications for the interpretation of photometric observations of bodies in the solar system, including the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2051448221,"Ages of fossil bones were determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The electron spin resonance signal is associated with lattice defects or trapped centers produced by natural radiation in the bones and gives a measure of the total dose of natural radiation, or the archeological dose. Archeological doses were determined for samples of known age from a variety of sites and used to estimate apparent average annual rates of natural radiation at the sites. The method has the advantage that the sample need not be ground or heated, and it should be useful for dating biological materials."
https://openalex.org/W2062907177,A second mode of action has been found for the inhibition of chitin synthesis by diflubenzuron. This compound blocks synthesis of the imaginal cuticle by preventing formation of the adult epidermis in the pupal stage of the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans L.).
https://openalex.org/W1974659999,"Spring tidal currents produce homogeneous water columns in a number of estuaries that are moderately stratified during neap tides. In the York River estuary, this destratification redistributes ammonium and phosphate regenerated by the benthos as well as oxygen from the surface. This redistribution has significant implications for nutrient cycles, organism distributions, and the management of estuaries."
https://openalex.org/W2007348286,"Amargosa pupfish from a constant-temperature spring have a narrower range of temperature and oxygen tolerances than pupfish from the much more variable Amargosa River, indicating that the two populations have diverged genetically since their isolation. The reduced tolerances of the fish inhabiting a constant environment support the predictions of evolution theory."
https://openalex.org/W2016274449,"Experimental determination of oxygen self-diffusion in CaTiO3 perovskite, a structural analog of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite, confirms a theoretical relation between diffusion constants and anion porosity. Oxygen diffusion rates in (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite calculated with this relation increase by about eight orders of magnitude through the lower mantle. Electrical conductivity values calculated from these diffusion rates are consistent with inferred conductivity values for the lower mantle. This result suggests that the dominant conductivity mechanism in the deep mantle is ionic."
https://openalex.org/W2009974608,"Eastern Aphrodite Terra, a deformed region with high topographic relief on Venus, has been interpreted as analogous to a terrestrial extensional or convergent plate boundary. However, analysis of geological and structural relations indicates that the tectonics of eastern Aphrodite Terra is dominated by blistering of the crust by magma diapirs. The findings imply that, within this region, vertical tectonism dominates over horizontal tectonism and, consequently, that this region is neither a divergent nor a convergent plate boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2153045079,A latitudinal circulation model of solar wind flow in the near wake of Venus is presented. It is shown that solar wind fluxes entering through the polar terminator can be viscously forced to lower latitudes. The resulting motion produces a downstream elongation of the nightside polar ionosphere out to the downstream extension of the middle- and low-latitude ionopause. The geometry suggested by this flow circulation model provides a simple explanation of the ionospheric bulge inferred from the Pioneer Venus observations.
https://openalex.org/W1983218205,"New observations of Trojan asteroid 624, Hektor, in April 1979 establish that the high amplitude of the rotational light curve of this object is caused by its elongated shape and not by patches of dark and light albedo on opposing hemispheres. These observations confirm that Hektor is a very unusual object and are consistent with the hypothesis that it may be a compound asteroid formed when two Trojans of comparable size fell together-a rare fossilized example of a planetary accretion process."

https://openalex.org/W2093142754,"An intuitive model for the expansion of the universe is developed in which special relativity is used to describe events seen by a hypothetical observer in a Lorentz frame of reference. The cosmic microwave background photons he sees are the red-shifted remnants of hot photons emitted from the matter flying rapidly away from him. This special relativistic model, also called the Milne model, represents the extreme case of a Friedmann (general relativistic) universe in the limit of vanishingly small density of matter. The special relativistic model approximates an open universe (one that expands forever) with increasing accuracy as time evolves."
