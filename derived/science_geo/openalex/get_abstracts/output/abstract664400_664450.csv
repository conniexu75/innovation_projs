https://openalex.org/W3108942205,"Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps in knowledge and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3108891141,"SPECT imaging has been identified as an effective medical modality for diagnosis, treatment, evaluation and prevention of a range of serious diseases and medical conditions. Bone SPECT scan has the potential to provide more accurate assessment of disease stage and severity. Segmenting hotspot in bone SPECT images plays a crucial role to calculate metrics like tumor uptake and metabolic tumor burden. Deep learning techniques especially the convolutional neural networks have been widely exploited for reliable segmentation of hotspots or lesions, organs and tissues in the traditional structural medical images (i.e., CT and MRI) due to their ability of automatically learning the features from images in an optimal way. In order to segment hotspots in bone SPECT images for automatic assessment of metastasis, in this work, we develop several deep learning based segmentation models. Specifically, each original whole-body bone SPECT image is processed to extract the thorax area, followed by image mirror, translation and rotation operations, which augments the original dataset. We then build segmentation models based on two commonly-used famous deep networks including U-Net and Mask R-CNN by fine-tuning their structures. Experimental evaluation conducted on a group of real-world bone SEPCT images reveals that the built segmentation models are workable on identifying and segmenting hotspots of metastasis in bone SEPCT images, achieving a value of 0.9920, 0.7721, 0.6788 and 0.6103 for PA (accuracy), CPA (precision), Rec (recall) and IoU , respectively. Finally, we conclude that the deep learning technology have the huge potential to identify and segment hotspots in bone SPECT images."
https://openalex.org/W3108005262,"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs) are common tools for reducing malaria transmission. We studied a cohort in Uganda with universal access to LLINs after 5 years of sustained IRS to explore LLIN adherence when malaria transmission has been greatly reduced. Eighty households and 526 individuals in Nagongera, Uganda were followed from October 2017 –October 2019. Every two weeks, mosquitoes were collected from sleeping rooms and LLIN adherence the prior night assessed. Episodes of malaria were diagnosed using passive surveillance. Risk factors for LLIN non-adherence were evaluated using multi-level mixed logistic regression. An age-matched case-control design was used to measure the association between LLIN non-adherence and malaria. Across all time periods, and particularly in the last 6 months, non-adherence was higher among both children &lt;5 years (OR 3.31, 95% CI: 2.30–4.75; p&lt;0.001) and school-aged children 5–17 years (OR 6.88, 95% CI: 5.01–9.45; p&lt;0.001) compared to adults. In the first 18 months, collection of fewer mosquitoes was associated with non-adherence (OR 3.25, 95% CI: 2.92–3.63; p&lt;0.001), and, in the last 6 months, residents of poorer households were less adherent (OR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.17–22.2; p = 0.03). Any reported non-adherence over the prior two months was associated with a 15-fold increase in the odds of having malaria (OR 15.0, 95% CI: 1.95 to 114.9; p = 0.009). Knowledge about LLIN use was high, and the most frequently reported barriers to use included heat and low perceived risk of malaria. Children, particularly school-aged, participants exposed to fewer mosquitoes, and those from poorer households, were less likely to use LLINs. Non-adherence to LLINs was associated with an increased risk of malaria. Strategies, such as behavior change communications, should be prioritized to ensure consistent LLIN use even when malaria transmission has been greatly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3109482201,"Psychological distress is a common problem associated with cancer. The main objective of the present study was to test the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a sample of Ethiopian cancer patients and to compare the results with those obtained from a sample in Germany. Data were collected from 256 cancer patients who visited the University of Gondar Hospital between January 2019 and June 2019 using the HADS, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory MFI-20. The reliability of the HADS was good, with Cronbach’s α coefficients of 0.86 (anxiety), 0.85 (depression), and 0.91 (total scale). The Ethiopian cancer patients were more anxious (M = 7.9) and more depressed (M = 9.3) than the German patients (M = 6.8 for anxiety and M = 5.5 for depression). Only a weak level of measurement invariance was detected between the Ethiopian and the German sample. In the Ethiopian sample, anxiety and depression were associated with tumor stage (high levels in stage 4) and treatment (high levels for patients not receiving surgery and chemotherapy). Both anxiety and depression were significantly associated with all of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and MFI-20 scales. The HADS proved to be applicable for use with Ethiopian cancer patients. The high level of anxiety and depression present in that group indicates a need for psychosocial care."
https://openalex.org/W3108682321,"Cesarean scar defect often causes postmenstrual abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility, which are collectively known as cesarean scar syndrome (CSS). Several studies have reported that hysteroscopic surgery can restore fertility in women with CSS. The study aimed to identify factors that influence subsequent pregnancy following hysteroscopic surgery. Therefore, we studied 38 women with secondary infertility due to CSS who underwent hysteroscopic surgery at Shiga University of Medical Hospital between July 2014 and July 2019. Our hysteroscopic procedure included inferior edge resection and superficial cauterization of the cesarean scar defect under laparoscopic guidance. Patients were followed up for 3 to 40 months after surgery. Surgery was successful in all cases and no complications were observed. Twenty-seven patients (71%) became pregnant (pregnant group), while 11 (29%) did not (non-pregnant group). Baseline characteristics of age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean section, presence of endometriosis, retroflex uterus, and preoperative residual myometrial thickness were not significantly different between the groups. However, the median residual myometrium thickness was significantly higher after surgery than before surgery in the pregnant group (1.9 [1.1–3.6] vs 4.9 [3.4–6.6] mm, P&lt;0.0001), whereas this difference was not significant in the non-pregnant group. Of those who became pregnant, 85% conceived within 2 years of surgery. Although three pregnancies resulted in abortion and one is ongoing at the time of writing, 23 pregnancies resulted in healthy babies at 35–38 gestational weeks by scheduled cesarean sections with no obstetrical complications due to hysteroscopic surgery. The average birth weight was 3,076 g. Our findings support that hysteroscopic surgery is a safe and effective treatment for secondary infertility due to CSS. The thickness of the residual myometrium may be a key factor that influences subsequent pregnancy in women with CSS."
https://openalex.org/W3107373529,"Oligosaccharides are important components of milk, serving as substrates for the intestinal microbiota, acting as antimicrobials that prevent pathogen colonization, and supporting the developing gastrointestinal immune system of neonates. Nutrient composition of canine and feline milk samples has been described previously, but little is known about the oligosaccharide content. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize canine and feline milk samples using a high-throughput glycomics approach. 23 dogs (9 Labrador retriever and 14 Labrador retriever x golden retriever crossbreed) and 6 domestic shorthair cats were recruited to the study. Milk samples were collected by manual expression at time points after parturition. Samples were collected across 2 phases per species, differentiated by maternal diet. Following extraction, oligosaccharide content was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In canine milk samples, 3 structures accounted for over 90% of all oligosaccharides detected across two diet groups. These were 3’-sialyllactose, 6’-sialyllactose, and 2’-fucosyllactose. In feline samples, a more diverse range of oligosaccharides was detected, with up to 16 structures present at relative abundance &gt;1% of the total. Difucosyllactose-N-hexaose b, 3’-sialyllactose and lacto-N-neohexaose were all detected at abundances &gt;10% in feline milk samples. Statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in oligosaccharide abundances were observed between collection time points and between diet groups within species. These data explore the oligosaccharide content of canine and feline maternal milk, representing an opportunity to generate a fundamental understanding of the nutritional needs of new-born puppies and kittens."
https://openalex.org/W3108164903,"Background Hypertension, a leading risk for cardiovascular mortality, is an important co-morbidity among people living with HIV (PLHIV). In Tanzania, hypertension prevalence among PLHIV approaches 20 to 30%. However, most patients are unaware of their diagnosis and are not receiving treatment. Understanding the barriers to hypertension care is a critical first step in developing interventions to improve cardiovascular outcomes among PLHIV in Tanzania and similar settings. Methods Between September 1 st and November 26 th , 2018 thirteen semi structured in-depth interviews were conducted with hypertensive patients engaged in HIV care in two HIV clinics located in government health facilities in northern Tanzania. Interviews were audio-recorded, translated into English, transcribed and thematically coded using NVivo. Data analysis was conducted using applied thematic analysis. Results Participants had a median age of 54 (IQR 41–65) years. Of the 13 participants, eight stated they had used antihypertensive medication previously, but only one participant described current use of antihypertensive therapy. All participants were currently using antiretroviral therapy. The data revealed a range of themes including limited hypertension knowledge. Universally, all participants believed that “thinking too much”, i.e. stress, was the major contributor to hypertension and that by “reducing thoughts”, one may control hypertension. Additional emerging themes included a perceived overlap between hypertension and HIV, delays in hypertension diagnosis and linkage to care, challenges with provider communication and counseling, reluctance towards antihypertensive medication, lack of integration of hypertension and HIV care, and additional structural barriers to hypertension care. Conclusions Participants described multiple, intersecting challenges related to hypertension management. Barriers specific to PLHIV included siloed care, HIV-related stigma, and burden from multiple medical conditions. Multifaceted strategies that seek to address structural barriers, hypertension education, psychosocial stressors and stigma, and that are integrated within HIV care are urgently needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes among PLHIV in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3110049537,"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought significant challenges worldwide, with high mortality, increased use of hospital resources, and the collapse of healthcare systems. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients and assess the impact on the use of hospital resources and compare with critically ill medical patients without COVID-19. Methods and findings In this retrospective cohort study, we included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to a private ICU in Sao Paulo, Brazil from March to June 2020. We compared these patients with those admitted to the unit in the same period of the previous year. A total of 212 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared with 185 medical patients from the previous year. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently males (76% vs. 56%, p&lt;0.001) and morbidly obese (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.027), and had lower SAPS 3 (49.65 (12.19) vs. 55.63 (11.94), p&lt;0.001) and SOFA scores (3.78 (3.53) vs. 4.48 (3.11), p = 0.039). COVID-19 patients had a longer ICU stay (median of 7 vs. 3 days, p&lt;0.001), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (median of 9 vs. 4 days, p = 0.003), and more frequent tracheostomies (10.8 vs. 1.1%, p&lt;0.001). Survival rates until 28 days were not statistically different (91% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.111). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, SAPS 3, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, COVID-19 remained not associated with survival at 28 days (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33–1.06, p = 0.076). Among patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, the observed mortality at 28-days was 16.2% in COVID-19 patients compared to 34.6% in the previous year. Conclusions COVID-19 required more hospital resources, including invasive and non-invasive ventilation, had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and a more prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. There was no difference in all-cause mortality at 28 and 60 days, suggesting that health systems preparedness be an important determinant of clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3110629122,"Uganda’s cervical cancer age standardized incidence rate is four times the global estimate. Although Uganda’s ministry of health recommends screening for women aged 25–49 years, the screening remains low even in the most developed region (Central Uganda) of the country. This study examined the demographic, social, and economic predictors of cervical cancer screening in Central Uganda with the aim of informing targeted interventions to improve screening. The cross-sectional survey was conducted in Wakiso and Nakasongola districts in Central Uganda. A total of 845 women age 25–49 years participated in the study. Data were analyzed at bivariate and multivariate levels to examine the predictors of CC (cervical cancer) screening. Only 1 in 5 women (20.6%) had ever screened for cervical cancer. Our multivariate logistic regression model indicated that wealth index, source of information, and knowledge about CC and CC screening were significantly associated with cervical cancer screening. The odds of cervical cancer screening were higher among rich women compared with poor women [AOR = 1.93 (95%CI: 1.06–3.42), p = 0.031)], receiving information from health providers compared with radios [AOR = 4.14 (95%CI: 2.65–6.48), p&lt;0.001, and being more knowledgeable compared with being less knowledgeable about CC and CC screening [AOR = 2.46 (95%CI: 1.49–3.37), p&lt;0.001)]. Overall cervical cancer screening uptake in central Uganda was found to be low. The findings of the study indicate that women from a wealthy background, who had been sensitized by health workers and with high knowledge about CC and CC screening had higher odds of having ever screened compared with their counterparts. Efforts to increase uptake of screening must address disparities in access to resources and knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3108902409,"Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common complication following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, risk factors for this complication remain controversial. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 107 patients who underwent PD. POPF was diagnosed in strict accordance with the definition of the 2016 update of pancreatic fistula from the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for POPF. A total of 19 (17.8%) subjects of pancreatic fistula occurred after PD, including 15 (14.1%) with grade B POPF and 4 (3.7%) with grade C POPF. There were 33 (30.8%) patients with biochemical leak. Risk factors for POPF (grade B and C) were larger area of visceral fat (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; p = 0.040) and pathology other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatitis (OR, 12.45; p = 0.017) in the multivariate regression analysis. This result could assist the surgeon to identify patients at a high risk of developing POPF."
https://openalex.org/W3110182917,"In Nigeria, about 150000 babies are born annually with sickle cell disease (SCD), and this figure has been estimated to increase by 100% by the year 2050 without effective and sustainable control strategies. Despite the high prevalence, newborn screening for SCD which allows for early prophylactic treatment, education of parents/guardians and comprehensive management is not yet available. This study explored a strategy for screening in early infancy during the first and second immunization visits, determined the prevalence, feasibility and acceptability of early infant screening for SCD and the evaluation of the HemoTypeSC diagnostic test as compared to the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gold standard. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two selected primary health care centres in Somolu local government area (LGA) in Lagos, Nigeria. Two hundred and ninety-one mother-infant pairs who presented for the first or second immunization visit were consecutively enrolled in the study following written informed consent. The haemoglobin genotype of mother-infant pairs was determined using the HemoTypeSC rapid test kit. Confirmation of the infants' Hb genotype was done with HPLC. Data were analysed with SPSS version 22. Validity and Predictive value of HemotypeSC rapid screening test were also calculated. Infant screening for SCD was acceptable to 86% of mothers presenting to the immunization clinics. The prevalence of SCD among the infant cohort was 0.8%. The infants diagnosed with SCD were immediately enrolled in the paediatric SCD clinic for disease-specific care. The HemoTypeSC test had 100% sensitivity and specificity for sickle cell disease in early infancy compared to HPLC. This study affirms that it is feasible and acceptable for mothers to implement a SCD screening intervention program in early infancy in Lagos State. The study also demonstrates the utility of the HemotypeSC rapid testing for ease and reduced cost of screening infants for SCD."
https://openalex.org/W3109355449,"A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with relative molar sensitivity (RMS) based on 1 H quantitative NMR spectroscopy ( 1 H-qNMR) has been developed for food ingredients such as acteoside (verbascoside) and pedaliin (pedalitin-6- O -glucoside) without requiring authentic and identical standards as the reliable analytical methods. This method is used methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (MHB) as an alternative reference standard. Each RMS is also calculated from the ratio of each analyte's molar absorption coefficient to that of MHB after correcting the purities of the analytes and reference standard by 1 H-qNMR. Therefore, this method can quantify several analytes with metrological traceability to the International System of Units (SI) using the RMS and one alternative reference standard. In this study, the content of acteoside and pedaliin in several samples, such as dried sesame leaf powders and commercially processed foods, can be determined by the proposed RMS method and demonstrated in good agreement that obtained by a conventional method. Moreover, the proposed method yields analytical data with SI-traceability without the need for an authentic and identical analyte standard. Thus, the proposed RMS method is a useful and practical tool for determining acteoside and pedaliin in terms of the accuracy of quantitative values, the routine analysis, and the cost of reagents."
https://openalex.org/W3110590691,"The use of high quality facemasks is indispensable in the light of the current COVID pandemic. This study proposes a fully automatic technique to design a face specific mask. Through the use of stereophotogrammetry, computer-assisted design and three-dimensional (3D) printing, we describe a protocol for manufacturing facemasks perfectly adapted to the individual face characteristics. The face specific mask was compared to a universal design of facemask and different filter container’s designs were merged with the mask body. Subjective assessment of the face specific mask demonstrated tight closure at the nose, mouth and chin area, and permits the normal wearing of glasses. A screw-drive locking system is advised for easy assembly of the filter components. Automation of the process enables high volume production but still allows sufficient designer interaction to answer specific requirements. The suggested protocol can be used to provide more comfortable, effective and sustainable solution compared to a single use, standardized mask. Subsequent research on printing materials, sterilization technique and compliance with international regulations will facilitate the introduction of the face specific mask in clinical practice as well as for general use."
https://openalex.org/W3108239558,"Introduction Policies to adequately respond to the rise in multimorbidity have top-priority. To understand the actual burden of multimorbidity, this study aimed to: 1) estimate the trend in prevalence of multimorbidity in the Netherlands, 2) study the association between multimorbidity and physical and mental health outcomes and healthcare cost, and 3) investigate how the association between multimorbidity and health outcomes interacts with socio-economic status (SES). Methods Prevalence estimates were obtained from a nationally representative pharmacy database over 2007–2016. Impact on costs was estimated in a fixed effect regression model on claims data over 2009–2015. Data on physical and mental health and SES were obtained from the National Health Survey in 2017, in which the Katz-10 was used to measure limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI) to measure mental health. SES was approximated by the level of education. Generalized linear models (2-part models for ADL) were used to analyze the health data. In all models an indicator variable for the presence or absence of multimorbidity was included or a categorical variable for the number of chronic conditions. Interactions terms of multimorbidity and educational level were added into the previously mentioned models. Results Over the past ten years, there was an increase of 1.6%-point in the percentage of people with multimorbidity. The percentage of people with three or more conditions increased with +2.1%-point. People with multimorbidity had considerably worse physical and mental health outcomes than people without multimorbidity. For the ADL, the impact of multimorbidity was three times greater in the lowest educational level than in the highest educational level. For the MHI, the impact of multimorbidity was two times greater in the lowest than in the highest educational level. Each additional chronic condition was associated with a greater worsening in health outcomes. Similarly, for costs, where there was no evidence of a diminishing impact of additional conditions either. In patients with multimorbidity total healthcare costs were on average €874 higher than in patients with a single morbidity. Conclusion The impact of multimorbidity on health and costs seems to be greater in the sicker and lower educated population."
https://openalex.org/W3109629159,"Background Institutional delivery is one of the key interventions that have been proven to reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Ethiopia has initiated different efforts to enhance the acceptance of institutional delivery. In spite of this, the number of institutional deliverys is still very low in Ethiopia and varies from region to region. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the utilization of institutional delivery and of factors associated with it among mothers in Hossana Town, Southern Ethiopia. Methods This study was a community-based cross-sectional study of mothers who had given birth within 12 months before the study. Data were collected using a pretested questionnaire. During the study period, 403 mothers were selected using the systematic random sampling technique. Data entry was done using EpiData (version 3.1), and data were exported to SPSS (version 24) for analysis. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the associated factors at 95% CI. Results This study revealed that 53.6% of mothers delivered their infants at health facilities. The factors associated with the institutional delivery were primigravidas (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.4–4.7), the availability of antenatal care (AOR = 3.4; 95%CI, 1.7–7.2), having planned pregnancies (AOR = 3.9; 95%CI, 1.7–9.3) and the involvement of both parents in decision making (AOR = 2.4; 95%CI, 1.4–2.5). However, when only the mother was involved in the decision making regarding the delivery, the figure decreased by 70% (AOR = 0.3; 95%CI, 0.1–0.8). Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that high numbers of births occur without skilled attendants or are non- institutional delivery. In terms of the factors that are associated with institutional delivery, the study suggests that strengthening sustained provision of education during antenatal care and at community levels are crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3106647886,"Cochlear implant users hear pitch evoked by stimulation rate, but discrimination diminishes for rates above 300 Hz. This upper limit on rate pitch is surprising given the remarkable and specialized ability of the auditory nerve to respond synchronously to stimulation rates at least as high as 3 kHz and arguably as high as 10 kHz. Sensitivity to stimulation rate as a pitch cue varies widely across cochlear implant users and can be improved with training. The present study examines individual differences and perceptual learning of stimulation rate as a cue for pitch ranking. Adult cochlear implant users participated in electrode psychophysics that involved testing once per week for three weeks. Stimulation pulse rate discrimination was measured in bipolar and monopolar configurations for apical and basal electrodes. Base stimulation rates between 100 and 800 Hz were examined. Individual differences were quantified using psychophysically derived metrics of spatial tuning and temporal integration. This study examined distribution of measures across subjects, predictive power of psychophysically derived metrics of spatial tuning and temporal integration, and the effect of training on rate discrimination thresholds. Psychophysical metrics of spatial tuning and temporal integration were not predictive of stimulation rate discrimination, but discrimination thresholds improved at lower frequencies with training. Since most clinical devices do not use variable stimulation rates, it is unknown to what extent recipients may learn to use stimulation rate cues if provided in a clear and consistent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3107113496,"This paper proposes a method for classifying the river state (a flood risk exists or not) from river surveillance camera images by combining patch-based processing and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Although CNN needs much training data, the number of river surveillance camera images is limited because flood does not frequently occur. Also, river surveillance camera images include objects that are irrelevant to the flood risk. Therefore, the direct use of CNN may not work well for the river state classification. To overcome this limitation, this paper develops patch-based processing for adjusting CNN to the river state classification. By increasing training data via the patch segmentation of an image and selecting patches that are relevant to the river state, the adjustment of general CNNs to the river state classification becomes feasible. The proposed patch-based processing and CNN are developed independently. This yields the practical merits that any CNN can be used according to each user’s purposes, and the maintenance and improvement of each component of the whole system can be easily performed. In the experiment, river state classification is defined as the following problems using two datasets, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. First, river images from the public dataset called Places are classified to images with Muddy labels and images with Clear labels. Second, images from the river surveillance camera in Nagaoka City, Japan are classified to images captured when the government announced heavy rain or flood warning and the other images."
https://openalex.org/W3108170276,"Background Trust is a prerequisite for successful social relations. People tend to form a first impression of people‘s trustworthiness based on their facial appearance. The sex of the judging person and its congruency with the sex of the judged people influence these appraisals. Moreover, trustworthiness and happiness share some facial features, which has led to studies investigating the interplay between both social judgments. Studies revealed high correlation in judging happiness and trustworthiness across different facial identities. However, studies are missing that investigate whether this relationship exists on a within-subject level and whether in-group biases such as the congruency between the sex of the judging and judged individual influence this relationship. In the present study, we addressed these questions. Methods Data were collected in an online-survey in two separate samples (N = 30, German sample, N = 107 Dutch sample). Subjects assessed the intensity of happiness and trustworthiness expressed in neutral and calm facial expression of the same characters (50% males, 50% females). Statistical analyses comprised rm-Anova designs based on rating scores and estimates of within-subject associations between both judgments. Results Our findings replicate high correlations between happiness and trustworthiness ratings across facial identities based on average scores across participants. However, the strength of this association was strongly dependent on the methodological approach and inter-subject variability was high. Our data revealed an in-group advantage for trustworthiness in women. Moreover, the faces’ sex and emotional expressions differentially influenced the within-subject correlation between both judgments in men and women. Conclusion Our findings replicate previous studies on the association between happiness and trustworthiness judgments. We extend our understanding of the link between both social judgments by uncovering that within-subject variability is high and influenced by sex and the availability and appraisal of positive emotional facial cues."
https://openalex.org/W3109227747,"Background In South Africa, the trucking industry employs over 70,000 people and the prevalence of chronic pain in this occupational group was reported at 10%. We investigated factors associated with chronic pain in truck drivers including mental health, physical activity, and sleep, as no study has done so. Methods Southern African male, long-distance truck drivers were recruited at truck stops in Gauteng and Free State Provinces, South Africa (n = 614). Chronic pain was defined as pain present for at least the last three months. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, post-traumatic stress disorder with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), exposure to traumatic events with the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC-5) and daytime sleepiness with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Sleep quality was measured on a four-point Likert scale. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using the Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Associations between these factors, demographic factors and chronic pain were investigated. Results Multivariate analysis showed that working ≥ 2 nights/week (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.55–4.68) was associated with chronic pain and physical activity was protective (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98). In an exploratory analysis, greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.004), daytime sleepiness (p = 0.01) and worse sleep quality (p = 0.001) was associated with working ≥ 2 nights/week. Lower leisure-time physical activity was associated with worse sleep quality (p = 0.006), but not daytime sleepiness or depressive symptoms (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions There is a clear relationship between working nights and activity levels, and chronic pain, sleep quality, and depression in truck drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3109651274,"Background Risk-targeted testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a critical component of the United States’ (US) tuberculosis (TB) elimination strategy, but relatively low treatment completion rates remain a challenge. Both treatment persistence and completion may be facilitated by diagnosing LTBI using interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) rather than tuberculin skin tests (TST). Methods We used a national sample of administrative claims data to explore associations diagnostic test choice (TST, IGRA, TST with subsequent IGRA) and treatment persistence and completion in persons initiating a daily dose isoniazid LTBI treatment regimen in the US private healthcare sector between July 2011 and March 2014. Associations were analyzed with a generalized ordered logit model (completion) and a negative binomial regression model (persistence). Results Of 662 persons initiating treatment, 327 (49.4%) completed at least the 6-month regimen and 173 (26.1%) completed the 9-month regimen; 129 (19.5%) persisted in treatment one month or less. Six-month completion was least likely in persons receiving a TST (42.2%) relative to persons receiving an IGRA (55.0%) or TST then IGRA (67.2%; p = 0.001). Those receiving an IGRA or a TST followed by an IGRA had higher odds of completion compared to those receiving a TST (aOR = 1.59 and 2.50; p = 0.017 and 0.001, respectively). Receiving an IGRA or a TST and subsequent IGRA was associated with increased treatment persistence relative to TST (aIRR = 1.14 and 1.25; p = 0.027 and 0.009, respectively). Conclusions IGRA use is significantly associated with both higher levels of LTBI treatment completion and treatment persistence. These differences are apparent both when IGRAs alone were administered and when IGRAs were administered subsequent to a TST. Our results suggest that IGRAs contribute to more effective LTBI treatment and consequently individual and population protections against TB."
https://openalex.org/W3106975827,"Background The purpose of this analysis was to assess the variations in COVID-19 related mortality in relation to the time differences in the commencement of virus circulation and containment measures in the European Region. Methods The data for the current analysis (N = 50 countries) were retrieved from the John Hopkins University dataset on the 7 th of May 2020, with countries as study units. A piecewise regression analysis was conducted with mortality and cumulative incidence rates introduced as dependent variables and time interval (days from the 22 nd of January to the date when 100 first cases were reported) as the main predictor. The country average life expectancy at birth and outpatient contacts per person per year were statistically adjusted for in the regression model. Results Mortality and incidence were strongly and inversely intercorrelated with days from January 22, respectively -0.83 ( p &lt;0.001) and -0.73 ( p &lt;0.001). Adjusting for average life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year, between days 33 to 50 from the 22 nd of the January, the average mortality rate decreased by 30.1/million per day (95% CI: 22.7, 37.6, p &lt;0.001). During interval 51 to 73 days, the change in mortality was no longer statistically significant but still showed a decreasing trend. A similar relationship with time interval was found for incidence. Life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year were not associated with mortality rate. Conclusion Countries in Europe that had the earliest COVID-19 circulation suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. The drastic social isolation measures, quickly undertaken in response to those initial outbreaks appear effective, especially in Eastern European countries, where community circulation started after March 11 th . The study demonstrates that efforts to delay the early spread of the virus may have saved an average 30 deaths daily per one million inhabitants."
https://openalex.org/W3108030166,"Participation in creative activities has been linked with positive outcomes for people with mental illness. This longitudinal qualitative study is a one-year follow-up of eight mental health consumers who participated in a series of creative workshops in Brisbane, Australia that aimed to increase participants’ capacity and skills in sharing their stories of recovery with others. It also sought to understand successful factors of the creative workshops to inform future workshops. Semi-structured interviews gathered information regarding participants’ memories of the workshops and how they had shared their stories with others over the preceding 12 months. Interpretative phenomenological analysis identified that participants’ enjoyed being engaged in a range of creative mediums in a group setting; that peer mentor support was highly valued; and that participants’ recovery stories had become more positive and were shared more often and openly with others. Overall, participation in the creative workshops had long-lasting benefits for participants with respect to improved confidence and understanding about their illness. Future creative workshops should consider the inclusion of peer mentors with lived experience as a support for participants to reauthor their recovery story."
https://openalex.org/W3108334839,"Chronic pain and sleep have a bidirectional relationship that promotes a vicious circle making chronic pain more difficult to treat. Therefore, pain and sleep should be treated simultaneously. In our previous study, we suggested that hyperactivation of ascending serotonergic neurons could cause secondary sleep disturbance in chronic pain. This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline) and a selective 5-hydroxy-tryptamine 2A (5-HT 2A ) antagonist (MDL 100907) that adjust serotonergic transmission, on secondary sleep disturbance induced in a preclinical chronic pain model. We produced a chronic neuropathic pain model by partial sciatic nerve ligation in mice, analyzed their electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) using the SleepSign software, and evaluated the sleep condition of the pain model mice after administration of amitriptyline or MDL 100907. Amitriptyline improved thermal hyperalgesia and the amount of sleep, especially non-REM sleep. Time change of normalized power density of δ wave in the nerve ligation group with amitriptyline administration showed a normal pattern that was similar to sham mice. In addition, MDL 100907 normalized sleep condition similar to amitriptyline, without improvement in pain threshold. In conclusion, amitriptyline could improve sleep quantity and quality impaired by chronic pain. 5-HT 2A receptor antagonism could partially contribute to this sleep improvement, but is not associated with pain relief."

However, the muscle-bone interaction has not been fully elucidated regarding the upper extremities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mechanical muscle-bone interaction at the forearm by evaluating the relationship between the properties of three-dimensional (3D) forearm cortical bone models derived from conventional computed tomography (CT) images and handgrip strength (HGS). Methods A total of 108 women (mean age, 75.2 ± 9.4 years; range, 62–101 years) with a distal radius fracture who took conventional CT scans for the assessment of the fracture were included in this study. Distal radius 3D models were reconstructed and the average cortical bone density (Cd) and thickness (Ct) of the region of interest (ROI), which might be affected by the forearm flexor muscles, were calculated using a 3D modeling software. Clinical parameters including HGS, lumbar and hip bone mineral densities (BMDs), and other demographic factors were also obtained. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify relevant factors associated with HGS. Results HGS was found to be independently associated with height and Cd, but no significant difference was found between HGS and Ct, age, weight, as well as lumber and hip BMDs. Conclusions Cortical bone density might be associated with HGS, which is generated by the forearm flexor muscles. Hence, the mechanical muscle-bone interaction in the upper extremities could be supported by the present study."
https://openalex.org/W3080728010,"Rationale Fixed airflow obstruction (FAO) can complicate asthma. Inflammation is a proposed underlying mechanism. Objective Our aim in this cross-sectional investigation was to evaluate the blood leucocyte pattern and level of exhaled nitric oxide in asthmatics and non-asthmatics with or without FAO. Methods A total of 11,579 individuals aged ≥20 years from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included. They were grouped as: controls without asthma and FAO (n = 9,935), asthmatics without FAO (n = 674), asthmatics with FAO (n = 180) and non-asthmatics with FAO (n = 790). FAO was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; lower limit of normal. Exhaled nitric oxide ≥ 25ppb, blood eosinophil levels ≥300 cells/μL, and blood neutrophil levels ≥5100 cells/μL were defined as elevated. Stratified analyses for smoking and smoking history were performed. Results Elevated blood eosinophil levels were more common in all groups compared to the controls, with the highest prevalence in the group with asthma and fixed airflow obstruction (p&lt;0.01). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders including smoking, the asthma groups had significantly higher odds ratios for elevated B-Eos levels compared to the control group (odds ratio 1.4, (confidence interval: 1.1–1.7) for the asthma group without fixed airflow obstruction and 2.5 (1.4–4.2) for the asthma group with fixed airflow obstruction). The group with fixed airflow obstruction without asthma had higher odds ratio for elevated blood neutrophil levels compared to the controls: 1.4 (1.1–1.8). Smoking and a history of smoking were associated to elevated B-Neu levels. Conclusion Fixed airflow obstruction in asthma was associated with elevated blood eosinophil levels, whereas fixed airflow obstruction without asthma was associated with elevated blood neutrophil levels."
https://openalex.org/W3107758970,"Humans seek admiration to boost their social rank and engage in rivalry to protect it when fearing defeat. Traits such as narcissism and affective states such as depression are thought to influence perception of rank and motivation for dominance in opposite ways, but evidence of the underlying behavioral mechanisms is scant. We investigated the effects of dimensionally-assessed narcissism and depression on behavioral responses to social defeat in a rigged video game tournament designed to elicit rivalry (stealing points from opponents) and admiration-seeking (paying for rank). We tested an undergraduate sample (N = 70, mean age = 21.5 years) and a clinical sample of predominantly depressed elderly (N = 85, mean age = 62.6 years). Both rivalry and admiration-seeking increased with time on task and were particularly enhanced in individuals high in narcissism. Participants engaged in more rivalry when pitted against high-ranked opponents, but depression partially mitigated this tendency. Our findings provide behavioral evidence that narcissism manifests in increased rivalry and admiration-seeking during social contests. Depression does not suppress general competitiveness but selectively inhibits upward-focused rivalry."
https://openalex.org/W3108123499,"Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) receive federal funding to serve medically underserved areas and provide a range of services including comprehensive primary care, enabling services, and behavioral health care. Greater funding for FQHCs could increase the local availability of clinic-based care and help reduce more costly resource use, such as emergency department visits (ED).To examine the impact of funding increases for FQHCs after the ACA on the use of FQHCs and EDs.Retrospective study using the Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD) 2010-2013 that included APCD enrollees in 559 Massachusetts ZIP codes (N = 6,173,563 in 2010). We calculated shift-share predictions of changes in FQHC funding at the ZIP code-level for FQHCs that received Community Health Center funds in any year, 2010-13 (N = 31). Outcomes were the number of ZIP code enrollees with visits to FQHCs and EDs, overall and for emergent and non-emergent diagnoses.In 2010, 4% of study subjects visited a FQHC, and they were more likely to be younger, have Medicaid, and live in low-income areas. We found that a standard deviation increase in prior year FQHC funding (+31 percentage point (pp)) at the ZIP code level was associated with a 2.3pp (95% CI 0.7pp to 3.8pp) increase in enrollees with FQHC visits and a 1.3pp (95% CI -2.3pp to -0.3pp) decrease in enrollees with non-emergent ED visits, but no significant change in emergent ED visits (0.3pp, 95% CI -0.8pp to 1.4pp).We found that areas exposed to greater FQHC funding increases had more growth in the number of enrollees seen by FQHCs and greater reductions in ED visits for non-emergent conditions. Investment in FQHCs could be a promising approach to increase access to care for underserved populations and reduce costly ED visits, especially for primary care treatable or non-emergent conditions."

In this context β-lactamase production is a major contributing factor to resistance globally. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of phenotypic and genotypic extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in 296 E . coli isolates recovered from diarrhoeic children younger than five years in Kano whose susceptibility profile against 7 antimicrobials had been determined. The E . coli isolates were subjected to double disc synergy test for phenotypic ESBLs detection and ESBL associated genes ( bla CTX-M , bla TEM and bla SHV ) were detected using conventional PCR. Phenotypically, 12.8% (38/296) E . coli isolates presented a ESBLs phenotype, with a significantly higher proportion in isolates from females compared with males ( P-value = 0.024). bla CTX-M 73.3% and bla TEM 73.3% were the predominant resistance genes in the ESBLs positive E . coli (each detected in 22/30 isolates, of which 14 harboured both). In addition, 1/30 harboured bla CTX-M + bla TEM + bla SHV genes simultaneously. This study demonstrates the presence of ESBLs E . coli isolates in clinically affected children in Kano, and demonstrates the circulation of bla CTX-M and bla TEM associated with those phenotypes. Enactment of laws on prudent antibiotic use is urgently needed in Kano."
https://openalex.org/W3108730932,"The application of organic amendments to saline-alkaline soil has been recommended as an agricultural strategy to improve crop productivity and soil health. However, there has been limited research on how organic soil amendment strategies affect the health of oats and their associated rhizosphere fungal communities in saline-alkaline conditions. Thus, the objectives of this study were to understand the effects of oat cultivars with contrasting saline-alkaline tolerances and different amendments on plant morphologies, root exudates (soluble sugars and organic acids), and rhizosphere fungal communities in a saline-alkaline environment. Experiments were conducted on a saline-alkaline tolerant cultivar, Baiyan2, and a saline-alkaline sensitive cultivar, Caoyou1, under four different organic amendment strategies: 1. control (no amendment application), 2. bio-fertilizer application, 3. rotten straw application, and 4. a co-application of bio-fertilizer and rotten straw. Results showed that plant morphological characters of Baiyan2 were better than Caoyou1, and that soluble sugar and organic acid levels in the rhizosphere of Baiyan2 were significantly lower than Caoyou1. Compared to the control, oat root and plant development was significantly improved by the combined bio-fertilizer and rotten straw amendment. Bio-fertilizer application promoted malic and citric acid levels, contributing to a higher total organic acid level, and significantly increased the abundance of Rhizopus arrhizus and decreased the abundance of the fungal pathogens Alternaria , Cladosporium , Sarocladium and Heydenia of Ascomycota in both oat cultivars. All amendment treatments containing rotten straw, except the combined amendment in Baiyan2, significantly increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota (specifically Gibberella , Talaromyces , Fusarium , and Bipolaris ) and decreased the relative abundance of R . arrhizus by reducing soluble sugar and organic acid levels. For the combined amendment in Baiyan2, there were no significant changes in Gibberella and Rhizopus between the control and amendment treatment. Our results suggest that co-application of bio-fertilizer and rotten straw, combined with a tolerant oat cultivar, is an effective method to increase crop productivity and enhance soil health in a saline-alkaline environment."
https://openalex.org/W3108876120,"Many insect species rely on the polarization properties of object-reflected light for vital tasks like water or host detection. Unfortunately, typical glass-encapsulated photovoltaic modules, which are expected to cover increasingly large surfaces in the coming years, inadvertently attract various species of water-seeking aquatic insects by the horizontally polarized light they reflect. Such polarized light pollution can be extremely harmful to the entomofauna if polarotactic aquatic insects are trapped by this attractive light signal and perish before reproduction, or if they lay their eggs in unsuitable locations. Textured photovoltaic cover layers are usually engineered to maximize sunlight-harvesting, without taking into consideration their impact on polarized light pollution. The goal of the present study is therefore to experimentally and computationally assess the influence of the cover layer topography on polarized light pollution. By conducting field experiments with polarotactic horseflies (Diptera: Tabanidae) and a mayfly species (Ephemeroptera: Ephemera danica ), we demonstrate that bioreplicated cover layers (here obtained by directly copying the surface microtexture of rose petals) were almost unattractive to these species, which is indicative of reduced polarized light pollution. Relative to a planar cover layer, we find that, for the examined aquatic species, the bioreplicated texture can greatly reduce the numbers of landings. This observation is further analyzed and explained by means of imaging polarimetry and ray-tracing simulations. The results pave the way to novel photovoltaic cover layers, the interface of which can be designed to improve sunlight conversion efficiency while minimizing their detrimental influence on the ecology and conservation of polarotactic aquatic insects."
https://openalex.org/W3107944107,"Background Advanced imaging methods can enhance the identification of aneurysms of the infundibula, which can reduce unnecessary follow-ups or further work-up, fear, and anxiety in patients. Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the added diagnostic value of three-dimensional proton density-weighted vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (3D-PD MRI) in identifying aneurysms from index lesions refer to vascular bulging lesions without vessels arising from the apex, observed using volume-rendered TOF-MRA in the circle-of-Willis compared with time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA). Study type Retrospective. Population A total of 299 patients who underwent 3D-PD MRI, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and TOF-MRA between January 2012 and December 2016 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Field strength/sequence 3 Tesla, 3D-PD MRI. Assessment Three neuroradiologists independently evaluated TOF-MRA and 3D-PD MRI combined with TOF-MRA for the determination of intracranial aneurysms in patients with index lesions within the circle of Willis. Final diagnoses were made by another neuroradiologist and neurointerventionist in consensus using DSA as the reference standard. The diagnostic performance and proportions of undetermined lesions on TOF-MRA and 3D-PD MRI with TOF-MRA were assessed based on the final diagnoses. Statistical tests The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for the diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneurysms were calculated for each imaging modality. Results Of 452 lesions identified on volume-rendered TOF-MRA images, 173 (38%) aneurysms and 276 (61%) infundibula were finally diagnosed on DSA. 3D-PD MRI with TOF-MRA showed superior diagnostic performance (p = .001; accuracy, 85.5% versus 95.4%), superior area under the receiver operating characteristic curve over TOF-MRA (p = .001; 0.837 versus 0.947), and a lower proportion of undetermined lesions than TOF-MRA (p = .001; 25.1% versus 2.3%). Data conclusion For unruptured intracranial aneurysms in the circle of Willis, 3D-PD MRI can complement TOF-MRA to improve diagnostic performance and lower the proportion of undetermined lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3109833219,"Background Good nutrition and healthy growth during the first 1000days have lasting benefit throughout life. For this, equally important is the structural readiness of health facilities. However, structural readiness and nutrition services provision during the first 1000 days in Ethiopia is not well understood. The present study was part of a broader implementation research aimed at developing model nutrition districts by implementing evidence based, high impact and cost-effective package of nutrition interventions through the continuum of care. This study was aimed at assessing structural readiness of health facilities and the extent of nutrition service provision in the implementation districts. Methods This assessment was conducted in four districts of Ethiopia. We used mixed method; a quantitative study followed by qualitative exploration. The quantitative part of the study addressed two-dimensions, structural readiness and process of nutrition service delivery. The first dimension assessed attributes of context in which care is delivered by observing availability of essential logistics. The second dimension assessed the service provision through direct observation of care at different units of health facilities. For these dimensions, we conducted a total of 380 observations in 23 health centers and 33 health posts. The observations were conducted at the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses unit, immunization unit, Antenatal care unit and Postnatal care unit. The qualitative part included a total of 60 key informant interviews with key stakeholders and service providers. Result We assessed structural readiness of 56 health facilities. Both quantitative and qualitative findings revealed poor structural readiness and gap in nutrition services provision. Health facilities lack essential logistics which was found to be more prominent at health posts compared to health centers. The process evaluation showed a critical missed opportunity for anthropometric assessment and preventive nutrition counselling at different contact points. This was particularly prominent at immunization unit (where only 16.4% of children had their weight measured and only 16.2% of mothers with children under six month of age were counselled about exclusive breastfeeding). Although 90.4% of pregnant women who came for antenatal care were prescribed iron and folic acid supplementation, only 57.7% were counselled about the benefit and 42.4% were counselled about the side effect. The qualitative findings showed major service provision bottlenecks including non-functionality of the existing district nutrition coordination body and technical committees, training gaps, staff shortage, high staff turnover resulting in work related burden, fatigue and poor motivation among service providers. Conclusion We found a considerable poor structural readiness and gaps in delivering integrated nutrition services with a significant missed opportunity in nutrition screening and counselling. Ensuring availability of logistics and improving access to training might improve delivery of nutrition services. In addition, ensuring adequate human resource might reduce missed opportunity and enable providers to provide a thorough preventive counselling service."

So far, little is known about the number of IPC cycles required for the release of cardioprotective factors into the coronary effluent to successfully induce cardioprotection. This study investigated the cardioprotective potency of effluent obtained after various IPC cycles in the rat heart. Experiments were performed on isolated hearts of male Wistar rats, mounted onto a Langendorff system and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. In a first part, effluent was taken before (Con) and after each IPC cycle (Eff 1, Eff 2, Eff 3). IPC was induced by 3 cycles of 5 min of global myocardial ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion. In a second part, hearts of male Wistar rats were randomized to four groups (each group n = 4–5) and underwent 33 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. The previously obtained coronary effluent was administered for 10 minutes before ischemia as a preconditioning stimulus. Infarct size was determined at the end of reperfusion by triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) staining. Infarct size with control effluent was 54±12%. Effluent obtained after IPC confers a strong infarct size reduction independent of the number of IPC cycles (Eff 1: 27±5%; Eff 2: 35±7%; Eff 3: 35±8%, each P&lt;0.05 vs. Con). Effluent extracted after one cycle IPC is comparably protective as after two or three cycles IPC."
https://openalex.org/W3106972292,"Gait asymmetry is often observed in populations with varying degrees of neuromuscular control. While changes in vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) peak magnitude are associated with altered limb loading that can be observed during asymmetric gait, the challenge is identifying techniques with the sensitivity to detect these altered movement patterns. Autoregressive (AR) modeling has successfully delineated between healthy and pathological gait during running; but has been little explored in walking. Thus, AR modeling was implemented to assess differences in vGRF pattern dynamics during symmetric and asymmetric walking. We hypothesized that the AR model coefficients would better detect differences amongst the symmetric and asymmetric walking conditions than the vGRF peak magnitude mean. Seventeen healthy individuals performed a protocol that involved walking on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at different symmetric (0.75m/s, 1.0 m/s, 1.5 m/s) and asymmetric (Side 1: 0.75m/s-Side 2:1.0 m/s; Side 1:1.0m/s-Side 2:1.5 m/s) gait conditions. Vertical ground reaction force peaks extracted during the weight-acceptance and propulsive phase of each step were used to construct a vGRF peak time series. Then, a second order AR model was fit to the vGRF peak waveform data to determine the AR model coefficients. The resulting AR coefficients were plotted on a stationarity triangle and their distance from the triangle centroid was computed. Significant differences in vGRF patterns were detected amongst the symmetric and asymmetric conditions using the AR modeling coefficients (p = 0.01); however, no differences were found when comparing vGRF peak magnitude means. These findings suggest that AR modeling has the sensitivity to identify differences in gait asymmetry that could aid in monitoring rehabilitation progression."
https://openalex.org/W3107057666,"Single-cell RNA sequencing has become a valuable tool for investigating cell types in complex tissues, where clustering of cells enables the identification and comparison of cell populations. Although many studies have sought to develop and compare different clustering approaches, a deeper investigation into the properties of the resulting populations is lacking. Specifically, the presence of misclassified cells can influence downstream analyses, highlighting the need to assess subpopulation purity and to detect such cells. We developed DSAVE ( D own- SA mpling based V ariation E stimation), a method to evaluate the purity of single-cell transcriptome clusters and to identify misclassified cells. The method utilizes down-sampling to eliminate differences in sampling noise and uses a log-likelihood based metric to help identify misclassified cells. In addition, DSAVE estimates the number of cells needed in a population to achieve a stable average gene expression profile within a certain gene expression range. We show that DSAVE can be used to find potentially misclassified cells that are not detectable by similar tools and reveal the cause of their divergence from the other cells, such as differing cell state or cell type. With the growing use of single-cell RNA-seq, we foresee that DSAVE will be an increasingly useful tool for comparing and purifying subpopulations in single-cell RNA-Seq datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3107457656,"Family plays a significant role in shaping children's eating behaviors. The aim of the study was to assess whether mothers’ attachment style, their life satisfaction and their own body weight can be associated with family eating behaviors. The results from 52 dyads (mothers/children) covered by the Metabolic Disease Clinic were analyzed. A targeted sample selection was used, taking into account the weight (overweight/obesity) and age (≥11 years) criteria of the child. The results have shown that the mother's body weight is a significant determinant of her child's body weight. The anxiety-ambivalent attachment style in mothers is a significant predictor of behaviors aimed at regulating and controlling affective states by food. A decrease in the knowledge of nutrition is associated with an increase in the level of anxiety-ambivalent and avoidant style. The avoidant attachment style is significantly associated with the nutrition organisation and control. Dysfunctional eating behaviors predominate among mothers with a lower level of life satisfaction. The lower the level of life satisfaction, the greater the tendency to regulate affective states and family relationships through nutrition, and to manifest improper organisation of nutrition. Mothers with obesity, compared to mothers with overweight and with normal body weight show a higher level of regulating emotions through food, improper organisation of nutrition and lower control in this area. The research results indicateshow significant relationships between insecure attachment styles, life satisfaction, and the mother's weight with eating behaviors unfavorable to health. It is therefore necessary to include family factors in the process of creating effective intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3108217473,"Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The course of the disease is often highly dynamic with unforeseen critical deterioration within hours in a relevant proportion of patients. Besides antibiotic treatment, novel adjunctive therapies are under development. Their additive value needs to be explored in preclinical and clinical studies and corresponding therapy schedules require optimization prior to introduction into clinical practice. Biomathematical modeling of the underlying disease and therapy processes might be a useful aid to support these processes. We here propose a biomathematical model of murine immune response during infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae aiming at predicting the outcome of different treatment schedules. The model consists of a number of non-linear ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics and interactions of the pulmonal pneumococcal population and relevant cells of the innate immune response, namely alveolar- and inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils. The cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 and the chemokines CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL5 are considered as major mediators of the immune response. We also model the invasion of peripheral blood monocytes, their differentiation into macrophages and bacterial penetration through the epithelial barrier causing blood stream infections. We impose therapy effects on this system by modelling antibiotic therapy and treatment with the novel C5a-inactivator NOX-D19. All equations are derived by translating known biological mechanisms into equations and assuming appropriate response kinetics. Unknown model parameters were determined by fitting the predictions of the model to time series data derived from mice experiments with close-meshed time series of state parameters. Parameter fittings resulted in a good agreement of model and data for the experimental scenarios. The model can be used to predict the performance of alternative schedules of combined antibiotic and NOX-D19 treatment. We conclude that we established a comprehensive biomathematical model of pneumococcal lung infection, immune response and barrier function in mice allowing simulations of new treatment schedules. We aim to validate the model on the basis of further experimental data. We also plan the inclusion of further novel therapy principles and the translation of the model to the human situation in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3109724579,"Cluster of differentiation (CD) 166 or activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a transmembrane molecule known to be an intercellular adhesion factor. The expression and function of ALCAM in medulloblastoma (MB), a pediatric brain tumor with highly advanced molecular genetics, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the significance and functional role of ALCAM expression in MB. ALCAM expression in 45 patients with MB was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical specimens and the relationship between ALCAM expression and pathological type/molecular subgroup, such as WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4, was examined. Eight ALCAM positive (18%), seven partially positive (16%), and 30 negative (67%) cases were detected. All seven cases of the WNT molecular subgroup were ALCAM positive and ALCAM expression strongly correlated with this subgroup ( P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, functional studies using MB cell lines revealed ALCAM expression affected proliferation and migration as a positive regulator in vitro . However, ALCAM silencing did not affect survival or the formation of leptomeningeal dissemination in an orthotopic mouse model, but did induce a malignant phenotype with increased tumor cell invasion at the dissemination sites (P = 0.0029). In conclusion, our results revealed that ALCAM exhibited highly specific expression in the WNT subgroup of MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cell kinetics of MB cell lines can be altered by the expression of ALCAM."

Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): &lt;24 hours = 1.75 [1.55–1.98], p&lt;0.001; 1–3 days = 1 (reference value); 4–7 days = 1.53 [1.37–1.70], p&lt;0.001; &gt;7 days = 1.67 [1.44–1.94], p&lt;0.001. For pneumonia: &lt;24 hours = 1.49 [1.39–1.58], p&lt;0.001; 1–3 days = 1; 4–7 days = 1.48 [1.41–1.56], p&lt;0.001; &gt;7 days = 1.57 [1.46–1.69], p&lt;0.001. Limitations Using a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies. Conclusion The PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern. Further studies are needed to corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3107045725,"Fewer studies have focused on the independent association between mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and cognitive performance. This study was designed to characterize the cross-sectional association between MCV and cognitive performance in a large sample of Chinese residents (age≥45 years) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 4023 male and 4173 female adults with MCV ≥ 80 fl were included for analysis. By multivariable linear regression analysis, for the total subjects, MCV level was significantly negatively associated with global cognitive function and episodic memory. When adjusted by sex, only in male subjects, higher MCV level was associated with reduced scores for global cognitive function, episodic memory and mental status. Via binary logistic regression analysis, the higher MCV level (MCV&gt;100 fl) was associated with poor global cognitive function (OR = 1.601; 95% CI = 1.198–2.139; p = 0.001), episodic memory (OR = 1.679; 95% CI = 1.281–2.201; p&lt;0.001), and mental status (OR = 1.422; 95% CI = 1.032–1.959; p = 0.031) for the whole participants. When testing this association by sex, the significant relationship between higher MCV level with worse episodic memory was observed both in male (OR = 1.690; 95% CI = 1.211–2.358; p = 0.002) and female (OR = 1.729; 95% CI = 1.079–2.770; p = 0.023) subjects; while the association between higher MCV level and poor global cognitive function (OR = 1.885; 95% CI = 1.329, 2.675; p&lt;0.001) and mental status (OR = 1.544; 95% CI = 1.034, 2.306; p = 0.034) only existed in male subjects. Further studies are warranted to clarify the association between MCV level and cognitive performance by considering sex into consideration both cross-sectionally and longitudinally."
https://openalex.org/W3107703819,"Background and purpose Ischemic stroke is a widespread disease carrying high morbidity and mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered an important tool in the work-up of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients; its utility is limited by a semi-invasive nature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the probability of treatment change due to TEE findings (yield) in the work-up of AIS and TIA patients. Methods Retrospective data on patients with AIS or TIA who underwent TEE examination between 2000–2013 were collected from the institutional registry. Results The average age of 1284 patients who were included in the study was 57±10.4, 66% of patients were male. The most frequent TEE findings included aortic plaques in 54% and patent foramen ovale (PFO) in 15%. TEE findings led to treatment change in 135 (10.5%) patients; anticoagulant treatment was initiated in 110 of them (81%). Most common etiology for switch to anticoagulation was aortic plaques (71 patients); PFO was second most common reason (26 patients). Significant TEE findings (thrombus, endocarditis, tumor) were found in 1.9% of patients, they were more common in young patients (&lt;55; 56% of the patients). Conclusions The beginning of anticoagulation treatment in patients with thick and complicated plaques was found frequently in our study. Significant TEE findings, were infrequent, constituted an absolute indication for treatment change and were more common in younger patients."
https://openalex.org/W3108404430,"Background Preoperative bevacizumab has been reported to increase postoperative complication risk following cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). We sought to review our experience with preoperative bevacizumab in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for peritoneal surface malignancy. Methods This is a retrospective review of patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy with or without bevacizumab prior to CRS/HIPEC at a high-volume academic center from 2007–2018. Results Of 499 patients, a total of 88 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (n = 34) or in combination with bevacizumab (n = 54) within 3 months prior to CRS/HIPEC. No differences existed in 60-day major morbidity (17.6 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.81) or 60-day mortality (0 vs. 0%) between the two cohorts, and neoadjuvant bevacizumab was not associated with increased odds of overall complications (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.35–2.09, p = 0.73) or major morbidity (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24–3.00, p = 0.81). Stratifying patients by primary tumor origin and post-operative complications did not reveal any significant differences between the two treatment groups. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar in both cohorts. Conclusions Preoperative bevacizumab is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality following CRS/HIPEC. Neoadjuvant therapy employing this biologic agent is safe and should not be a deterrent for aggressive cytoreduction with curative intent."
https://openalex.org/W3108590960,"The proteostasis network comprises the biochemical pathways that together maintain and regulate proper protein synthesis, transport, folding, and degradation. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a failure of the proteostasis network to sustain the health of the proteome, resulting in protein misfolding, aggregation, and, often, neurotoxicity. Although important advances have been made in recent years to identify genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, we still know relatively little about environmental risk factors such as air pollution. Exposure to nano-sized particulate air pollution, referred to herein as nanoparticulate matter (nPM), has been shown to trigger the accumulation of misfolded and oligomerized amyloid beta in mice. This suggests that the ability to maintain proteostasis is likely compromised in Alzheimer 's disease (AD) pathogenesis upon exposure to nPM. We aim to determine whether this aspect of the environment interacts with proteostasis network machinery to trigger protein misfolding. This could at least partially explain how air pollution exacerbates the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases of aging, such as AD. We hypothesize that nPM challenges the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network by reducing the efficiency of folding for metastable proteins, thereby disrupting what has proven to be a very delicate proteostasis balance. We will test this hypothesis using C. elegans as our model system. Specifically, we will determine the impact of particulate air pollution on the aggregation and toxicity of disease-associated reporters of proteostasis and on transcriptional responses to stress."
https://openalex.org/W3108814821,"In vitro and ex vivo development of novel therapeutic agents requires reliable and accurate analyses of the cell conditions they were preclinical tested for, such as apoptosis. The detection of apoptotic cells by annexin V (AV) coupled to fluorophores has often shown limitations in the choice of the dye due to interference with other fluorescent-labeled cell markers. The SNAP-tag technology is an easy, rapid and versatile method for functionalization of proteins and was therefore used for labeling AV with various fluorophores. We generated the fusion protein AV-SNAP and analyzed its capacity for the specific display of apoptotic cells in various assays with therapeutic agents. AV-SNAP showed an efficient coupling reaction with five different fluorescent dyes. Two selected fluorophores were tested with suspension, adherent and peripheral blood cells, treated by heat-shock or apoptosis-inducing therapeutic agents. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptotic cells revealed a strong visualization using AV-SNAP coupled to these two fluorophores exemplary, which was comparable to a commercial AV-Assay-kit. The combination of the apoptosis-specific binding protein AV with the SNAP-tag provides a novel solid method to facilitate protein labeling using several, easy to change, fluorescent dyes at once. It avoids high costs and allows an ordinary exchange of dyes and easier use of other fluorescent-labeled cell markers, which is of high interest for the preclinical testing of therapeutic agents in e.g. cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W3109929145,"Southern green stink bug [ Nezara viridula (L.)] adults and other pentatomid pests can transmit pathogens (e.g., the bacterium Pantoea agglomerans ) that cause disease in cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) and other high-value cash crops worldwide. First instars of N . viridula were recently shown to ingest P . agglomerans strain Sc1R with rifampicin-resistance, and to retain the pathogen to the 2 nd instar. The objective of this study was to determine the acquisition of P . agglomerans Sc1R by early instars of N . viridula and determine persistence of P . agglomerans Sc1R across subsequent stadia. In three trials, early instars (1 st and 2 nd ) were exposed to P . agglomerans Sc1R and subsequently maintained to adulthood; cohorts were sampled at 3 rd and 5 th instars, as well as adults. In every trial, P . agglomerans Sc1R was detected in all stadia, including adults, but significantly higher frequencies of infection than expected were observed at the initial stage of infection (either 1 st or 2 nd instar). Higher densities of P . agglomerans Sc1R were detected in 1 st and 2 nd instars, and lower densities were observed in subsequent stadia. Densities of innate microbiota were generally lower when the initial stage of exposure was at 1 st instar than when the initial stage of exposure was at the 2 nd instar. Overall, half of the adults possessed P . agglomerans Sc1R. These findings demonstrated that N . viridula nymphs can acquire P . agglomerans Sc1R and retain the pathogen to adulthood. Potential avenues of research to further elucidate the implications of nymphs harboring pathogens to adulthood are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3110057499,"In this paper, we develop and analyze an SIS-type epidemiological-mathematical model of the interaction between pesticide use and infectious respiratory disease transmission for investigating the impact of pesticide intoxication on the spread of these types of diseases. We further investigate the role of educational treatment for appropriate pesticide use on the transmission dynamics. Two impulsive control events are proposed: pesticide use and educational treatment. From the proposed model, it was obtained that the rate of forgetfulness towards educational treatment is a determining factor for the reduction of intoxicated people, as well as for the reduction of costs associated with educational interventions. To get reduced intoxications, the population’s fraction to which is necessary to apply the educational treatment depends on its individual effectiveness level and the educational treatments’ forgetfulness rate. In addition, the turnover of agricultural workers plays a fundamental role in the dynamics of agrotoxic use, particularly in the application of educational treatment. For illustration, a flu-like disease with a basic reproductive number below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 is shown can acquire epidemic potential in a population at risk of pesticide exposure. Hence, our findings suggest that educational treatment targeting pesticide exposure is an effective tool to reduce the transmission rate of an infectious respiratory disease in a population exposed to the toxic substance."
https://openalex.org/W3108610730,"Bladder dysfunction is a common phenomenon in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. A research attempt was made to analyze the voiding efficiency (VE) and bladder functions in rats with PD induced by unilateral or bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle. PD rats were divided into unilateral- and bilateral-injected groups and subjected to rotation and beam walking tests. Further, the experimental rats underwent cystometric measurements for analyses of bladder dysfunction and VE. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to analyze the dopaminergic neuron depletion on the target area. Outcomes of the rotation and beam walking tests revealed the extent of parkinsonism in the experimental rats. Urodynamic observations denoted that rats with unilateral PD exhibited a significantly decreased VE (from 68.3±3.5% to 32.7±5.8%), while rats with bilateral PD displayed a much-reduced and substantially lower level of VE of 18.3±5.1% compared to the control value and to that of rats with unilateral PD. Rats with bilateral PD showed more-extensive behavioral deficits and urodynamic changes than did rats with unilateral PD. These significant changes in motor, behavioral, bladder function and VE were due to an extensive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region on both sides of the brain. The obtained results were substantiated with appropriate immunohistochemical results."
https://openalex.org/W3109165516,"Objective There are concerns that lumbar spine imaging represents low value care. Our aim was to examine the use of lumbar spine imaging [radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] over 20 years, and costs and person-level characteristics of imaging in a large cohort of Australian women. Methods The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) is a longitudinal population-based survey of women randomly selected from national health insurance scheme (Medicare) database. This study examined 13458 women born in 1973–1978 who consented to link their ALSWH and Medical Benefits Scheme records. Self-reported data on demographics, body mass index, depression, physical and mental health, and back pain were collected in each survey performed in 1996, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015. Data on lumbar spine imaging from 1996 to 2015 were obtained from the Medical Benefits Scheme database. Results 38.9% of women underwent some form of lumbar spine imaging over 20 years. While radiography increased from 1996 to 2011 and decreased thereafter, CT and MRI continued to increase from 1996 to 2015. In women with self-reported back pain, depression and poorer physical health were associated with imaging, with no significant differences in types of imaging. Based on imaging rates in ALSWH, the estimated costs for Australian women aged 30–39 years were AU$51,735,649 over 2011–2015. Conclusions Lumbar spine imaging was common in population-based Australian women, with rates increasing over 20 years. Depression and poor physical health were associated with lumbar spine imaging. Raising awareness of this in clinicians is likely to result in significant cost savings if clinical guidelines are followed, with the potential of freeing resources for high value care and health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3110338353,"Lisinopril and losartan manufacturer labels recommend twice-daily dosing (BID) if once-daily (QDay) is insufficient to lower blood pressure (BP).Retrospective cohort study of patients taking QDay lisinopril and losartan who experienced a dose-doubling (index date). A text-processing tool categorized BID and QDay groups at the index date based on administration instructions. We excluded: pregnant/hospice, regimens other than BID/QDay, and without BP measurements -6 months/+12 months of the index date. The most proximal BP measurements -6 months and +2 weeks to 12 months of the index date were used to evaluate BP differences. Propensity scores were generated, and differences in BP and adverse events (angioedema, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia) between BID/QDay groups were analyzed within dosing cohorts using inverse propensity of treatment-weighted regression models. Of 11,210 and 6,051 patients who met all criteria for lisinopril and losartan, 784 (7.0%) and 453 (7.5%) were taking BID, respectively. BID patients were older and had higher comorbidity and medication burdens. There were no differences in systolic/diastolic BP between BID and QDay, with absolute differences in mean systolic BP ranging from -1.8 to 0.7 mmHg and diastolic BP ranging from -1.1 to 0.1 mmHg (all 95% confidence intervals [CI] cross 0). Lisinopril 10mg BID was associated with an increased odds of angioedema compared to lisinopril 20mg QDay (odds ratio 2.27, 95%CI 1.13-4.58).Adjusted models do not support improved effectiveness or safety of BID lisinopril and losartan."
