We identify the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of 181,047 transcripts with extensive variation in transcripts arising from alternative promoter usage, splicing, and polyadenylation. There are 16,247 new mouse protein-coding transcripts, including 5154 encoding previously unidentified proteins. Genomic mapping of the transcriptome reveals transcriptional forests, with overlapping transcription on both strands, separated by deserts in which few transcripts are observed. The data provide a comprehensive platform for the comparative analysis of mammalian transcriptional regulation in differentiation and development."

These techniques are based on rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction. Separating and later recombining a singlet spin state provided a measurement of the spin dephasing time, T 2 *, of ∼10 nanoseconds, limited by hyperfine interactions with the gallium arsenide host nuclei. Rabi oscillations of two-electron spin states were demonstrated, and spin-echo pulse sequences were used to suppress hyperfine-induced dephasing. Using these quantum control techniques, a coherence time for two-electron spin states exceeding 1 microsecond was observed."

MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is specifically expressed and highly abundant in the human liver. We show that the sequestration of miR-122 in liver cells results in marked loss of autonomously replicating hepatitis C viral RNAs. A genetic interaction between miR-122 and the 5′ noncoding region of the viral genome was revealed by mutational analyses of the predicted microRNA binding site and ectopic expression of miR-122 molecules containing compensatory mutations. Studies with replication-defective RNAs suggested that miR-122 did not detectably affect mRNA translation or RNA stability. Therefore, miR-122 is likely to facilitate replication of the viral RNA, suggesting that miR-122 may present a target for antiviral intervention."

Global transcriptome analysis provides evidence that a large proportion of the genome can produce transcripts from both strands, and that antisense transcripts commonly link neighboring “genes” in complex loci into chains of linked transcriptional units. Expression profiling reveals frequent concordant regulation of sense/antisense pairs. We present experimental evidence that perturbation of an antisense RNA can alter the expression of sense messenger RNAs, suggesting that antisense transcription contributes to control of transcriptional outputs in mammals."

The small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 are key determinants of early and late endosomes, organizing effector proteins into specific membrane subdomains. Whether such Rab machineries are indefinitely maintained on membranes or can disassemble in the course of cargo transport is an open question. Here, we combined novel image-analysis algorithms with fast live-cell imaging. We found that the level of Rab5 dynamically fluctuates on individual early endosomes, linked by fusion and fission events into a network in time. Within it, degradative cargo concentrates in progressively fewer and larger endosomes that migrate from the cell periphery to the center where Rab5 is rapidly replaced with Rab7. The class C VPS/HOPS complex, an established GEF for Rab7, interacts with Rab5 and is required for Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion. Our results reveal unexpected dynamics of Rab domains and suggest Rab conversion as the mechanism of cargo progression between early and late endosomes.

The endocytic system of eukaryotic cells embraces a complex network of membrane compartments, each fulfilling a specific set of tasks in cargo sorting, distribution, and catabolism (for review, see Conner and Schmid, 2003Conner S.D.

After internalization in early endosomes, cargo to be recycled (exemplified by the transferrin receptor [TFR] or low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]) returns to the cell surface via recycling endosomes, whereas cargo destined for degradation (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) is transferred to late endosomes and, ultimately, to lysosomes. However, whereas there is a broad consensus on the organization of the endocytic pathway in terms of organelles and trafficking routes, the mechanisms whereby transport occurs from one endosomal compartment to another are still unsolved, as reflected by the different views formulated over the years. On the one hand, vesicular transport has been the general mechanistic paradigm, proposing that cargo moves by means of vesicles between distinct compartments of stable identity (Geuze et al., 1988Geuze H.J.

On the other hand, compartment maturation has been evoked as an alternative transport mode, with the membrane enclosing the cargo progressively changing its composition (Helenius et al., 1983Helenius A.

The traditional experimental repertoire, including morphological analysis of fixed specimens, subcellular fractionation, and in vitro transport assays, could not unambiguously distinguish between the aforementioned scenarios. A more suitable approach to address this long-standing problem would be the direct visualization of the dynamics of the endosome trafficking machinery, an approach brought within reach by recent advances in live-cell-imaging techniques. Besides vesicle coats and adaptors, SNAREs and Rab GTPases have been identified as central regulators of intracellular transport. Both SNAREs and Rab GTPases occur as large families in eukaryotic genomes (Bock et al., 2001Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. A genomic perspective on membrane compartment organization.Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), are enriched in specific membrane compartments, and participate in virtually every membrane trafficking reaction (Sollner et al., 1993Sollner T.

Rab GTPases mediate membrane tethering upstream of SNARE-mediated fusion (Rothman and Sollner, 1997Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H.

Rab proteins as membrane organizers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar) and function as membrane organizers by regulating a plethora of soluble effector molecules. Rab5 provides a striking example of the aforementioned principle, recruiting different effector proteins that oligomerize within a membrane domain enriched in PI(3)P (Christoforidis et al., 1999Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M.

Oligomeric complexes link Rab5 effectors with NSF and drive membrane fusion via interactions between EEA1 and syntaxin 13.Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Rab5, Rab4, and Rab11 occupy distinct membrane domains sequentially traversed by recycling cargo (Sonnichsen et al., 2000Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. Distinct membrane domains on endosomes in the recycling pathway visualized by multicolor imaging of Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Late endosomes also consist of separate Rab7 and Rab9 domains (Barbero et al., 2002Barbero P. Bittova L. Pfeffer S.R. Visualization of Rab9-mediated vesicle transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156 (Published online February 4, 2002): 511-518https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200109030Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and cargo destined for degradation is first internalized into Rab5 domains on early endosomes and later appears in Rab7 domains on late endosomes. Thus, from a molecular viewpoint, transport between endosomes can operationally be defined as transport of cargo between membranes harboring different Rab machineries. An important consideration in relation to the mechanisms of such transport is that the Rab machinery is peripherally associated with the membrane in a dynamic equilibrium that depends on the balance between guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In principle, such a dynamic GDP/GTP cycle could confer two completely different modes of function to the Rab machinery, being indefinitely maintained or remodeled along with the flow of cargo. In light of both the inherent dynamics of Rab domains and their suitability as compartmental identity markers, the question pertaining to the mechanism of transport from early to late endosomes can be rephrased as follows: is the Rab5 domain on early endosomes stably maintained or dynamically assembled and disassembled in the course of cargo transport? Is cargo transferred from stable Rab5-positive early endosomes to Rab7-positive late endosomes, or do Rab5-positive membranes eventually lose Rab5 and acquire Rab7? Discriminating between these two functional modes depends on the ability to study the dynamics of the Rab machineries on endosomes in the course of cargo transport. However, this is not a trivial task due to the high frequency of short- and long-range movements of endosomes on actin and microtubule filaments (Gasman et al., 2003Gasman S. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. RhoD regulates endosome dynamics through Diaphanous-related Formin and Src tyrosine kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 195-204Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Nielsen et al., 1999Nielsen E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which make their tracking increasingly difficult over long periods of time. We overcame this problem here by combining fast live-cell-imaging techniques with the development of new software tools to visualize and quantify the dynamics of membrane bound Rab5 and Rab7 during the transport of LDL from early to late endosomes. To probe the dynamics of Rab5 domains on early endosomes, we used an A431 cell line stably expressing moderate levels of GFP-Rab5 (1- to 5-fold over endogenous; Sonnichsen et al., 2000Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. Distinct membrane domains on endosomes in the recycling pathway visualized by multicolor imaging of Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Because these cells display neither enlarged endosomes, as under Rab5 hyperactivation (Stenmark et al., 1994Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Inhibition of rab5 GTPase activity stimulates membrane fusion in endocytosis.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), nor alterations in the kinetics of transferrin uptake and recycling (Sonnichsen et al., 2000Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. Distinct membrane domains on endosomes in the recycling pathway visualized by multicolor imaging of Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), GFP-Rab5 can be expected to faithfully reflect the dynamics of the endogenous protein. We developed an experimental strategy (Figure 1A ) to track early endosomes over long periods of time by combining high-speed 4D imaging with novel tracking algorithms (see Movie S1 and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures in the Supplemental Data available with this article online; Y.K., unpublished data). The imaging protocol did not cause any appreciable photodamage to the cells. First, cells did not contract but often continued to expand. Second, photobleaching of GFP over 30 min was below 20% of the total signal (Figure S1E). Third, endocytosis was not compromised since cells continued to internalize LDL throughout the experiment (see below). The accuracy of the tracking algorithm was ascertained by systematically comparing computer-generated with manually followed endosome tracks. Based on 200 endosomes from three different sequences, we estimated that the program correctly tracked a structure between successive frames with a probability of 99.4%. Premature track termination accounted for the majority of errors. Wrong connections occurred only in 0.08% of cases (Figures S2A–S2C). Using GFP-tagged rotavirus-like particles as standards (Charpilienne et al., 2001Charpilienne A. Nejmeddine M. Berois M. Parez N. Neumann E. Hewat E. Trugnan G. Cohen J. Individual rotavirus-like particles containing 120 molecules of fluorescent protein are visible in living cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (Published online May 16, 2001): 29361-29367https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101935200Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar; Figure S2D), we estimated that the smallest visible structures contained ∼300 molecules of GFP-Rab5. Reliable tracking required a minimum of 630 (±150, n = 3) molecules. Whereas the majority of endosomes contained 2–3 × 103 molecules of GFP-Rab5, the few brightest and biggest structures harbored ≥2 × 104 (Figure S2D). Most importantly, immunofluorescence microscopy of the very same structures previously visualized by high-speed imaging (Figure 1C) showed that they corresponded to essentially the entire complement of EEA1-positive membranes, thus establishing that the tracked structures were bona fide Rab5-positive early endosomes. Depending on whether Rab5 domains are permanent/long-lived or transient assemblies, two main scenarios can be envisaged. Transient assemblies would be indicated by GFP-Rab5 traces undergoing “fade in” and “fade out” (gradual brightening from/dimming to background level). Permanent association, on the other hand, would be incompatible with such events. Figure 1D shows the fluorescence-over-time traces of six exemplary endosomes, all tracked over 7 min and longer. Two conclusions could be drawn from this analysis. First, the half-life of Rab5-positive early endosomes is in the range of 2 min, as deduced from the distribution of track lengths (data not shown). However, since 70% of tracks are terminated by homotypic fusion events (Movie S1), these data indicate that the bulk of early endosomes are not subjected to rapid turnover. Second, the amount of Rab5 associated with a given endosome was unexpectedly found to vary considerably over time, as GFP-Rab5 fluorescence exhibited strong fluctuations (Figure 1, Figure 2). We can rule out the possibility that these fluctuations are imaging artifacts: (1) fluctuations are out of phase, excluding changes in laser intensity; (2) they occur over tens of seconds, making movements between focal planes an unlikely cause; and (3) in two color tracks (see below, Figure 3C ), they are not paralleled by fluctuations in cargo fluorescence.Figure 3Cargo Exit from Rab5-Positive StructuresShow full caption(A) A431 cells coinfected with adenoviruses expressing YFP-Rab4 (top) and CFP-Rab5 (middle; bottom: merge) 20 hr before the experiment were imaged at 37°C on an epifluorescence setup.

(D) Quantification of LDL exit mode from Rab5-positive endosomes, based on 22 Rab5/LDL-positive structures randomly chosen from three independent sequences. We next attempted to identify possible causes of these fluctuations by a close inspection of the image sequences. Interestingly, the frequent sharp upstrokes in a trace could mostly be attributed to a fusion event with another GFP-Rab5 endosome (Movie S2). We estimated that an early endosome undergoes up to two homotypic fusion events per min. However, despite such high frequency, the fluorescence signal of individual endosomes did not increase in a stepwise manner, as fusion events were generally followed by rapid (∼40–80 s) loss of GFP-Rab5 from the membrane. This was not mediated by visible fission events, which were observed, albeit with much lower frequency than fusions. Therefore, either fission of vesicles escaping detection or extraction of Rab5 from the membrane via Rab-GDI could explain such removal. We favor the latter since the loss of Rab5 often proceeds without a detectable change in diameter of the structure (see below), inconsistent with scission. Importantly, loss of Rab5 can proceed to apparent completion, as illustrated by the progressive dimming of the GFP-Rab5 fluorescence to background levels in the trace presented in Figure 1E (top, shaded section). The radius of such structures clearly resolved by the microscope optics remained constant throughout the dimming process (Figure 2C, bottom), ruling out breakdown as trivial cause. We reproducibly observed such rapid fade-out events, although fusion was by far the predominant mode of track termination. Furthermore, fade-out events occurred most frequently among big, vacuole-like endosomes. Altogether, GFP-Rab5 is stably maintained on membranes over long periods of time but can, under certain circumstances, completely and irreversibly dissociate. Since fade-out events were observed comparatively rarely during the visual inspection of a small set of endosome tracks, we sought to confirm the reversible membrane association of the Rab5 machinery by a systematic population analysis of endosomes. Given that large endosomes appeared to preferentially undergo fade out, we first asked whether the surface density of GFP-Rab5 was in any way dependent on endosome size. We subjected the very large number of individual endosome measurements in a track set (typically 300,000/15 min sequence) to a histogram analysis of Rab5 fluorescence intensity (I, defined as total fluorescence/2× cross-sectional area) versus radius (R). The individual data points were widely scattered, as expected from the low signal-to-noise ratio of the image sequences and the fluctuations in the individual tracks (Figure 1D). Strikingly, however, the I/R plot revealed that the intensity of Rab5 labeling increased with the size of the structures and the magnitude of such increase far exceeded the systematic error inherent to optical radius measurements (Figure 2A and Figure S1F). Assuming that the majority of visible endosomes are individual structures and further approximating them to spherical vesicles, our data suggest that large endosomes generally have a higher Rab5 surface density than smaller endosomes. In the case of very large structures, however, this trend appeared to reverse again, although the significance of this observation was tempered by the low density of data points in this region of the histogram. Even though the correlation between endosome size and intensity is not deterministic, as indicated by the broad scattering of individual measurements, it is highly reproducible (Figure 2B). The characteristic I/R relationship of GFP-Rab5 endosomes could reflect either a general progression from small and dim to large and bright structures or, alternatively, the existence of distinct, albeit partially overlapping, populations of endosomes with discrete I/R ratios. That the data points contributed by individual long tracks generally scattered over the entire width of the I/R diagram argued for the first hypothesis (Figure 2C). We next asked whether intensity or radius systematically change during the lifespan of endosomes. Interestingly, when examining large sets of tracks, we always detected a net increase of both I and R over the observation interval. The magnitude of the net change was always smaller than the SD of the measurement due to the large fluctuations and occasional fission events. Nevertheless, this result is significant. First, the standard error of the measurements was very small owing to the large data sets. Second, the net increases were independent of the length of the track fragments (between 50 and 600 frames). Third, all sequences examined invariably displayed a net increase in both I and R (Figure 2D). We therefore conclude that, on the whole, early endosomes grow in size and concomitantly increase the surface density of GFP-Rab5, thereby causing the characteristic shape of the I/R diagram. We next asked whether the population behavior of GFP-Rab5-positive endosomes was coordinated with endosome motility. When computationally analyzing the movement of all endosomes within a cell, we always detected net centripetal motility over most cellular areas (except for the cell edge, where rearrangements during cell locomotion interfere with the analysis; Figure 2E). The observed directionality is not a mere consequence of cell contraction since all cells analyzed actually expanded during the imaging. The directional component relative to total flow was small, consistent with the largely random movements at the single-endosome level. Thus, besides growing in I and R, endosomes also undergo a concomitant net movement from the cell periphery to the center. Since the directional changes were observed under steady-state conditions, one must deduce that Rab5 continuously redistributes from large structures in the cell center to small peripheral structures. The emergence of the latter is consistently visible in image sequences (Movie S3). The required loss of large structures is likely achieved by the fade-out events observed at the single-track level. This system analysis therefore strengthens our earlier conclusion that the Rab5 machinery is not indefinitely membrane associated. Loss of the Rab5 machinery from endosomal membranes may occur during the progression of cargo out of early endosomes. We therefore set up two-channel imaging protocols to visualize the dynamics of Rab5 in relation to markers of the recycling or degradative pathway (Rab4/Tf and Rab7/LDL, respectively). We observed the frequent outgrowth of Rab4-positive tubules from Rab5-positive endosomes (Figure 3A). Tf-containing tubules showed the same behavior (data not shown). Separation between Rab5 and Rab4 occurred by fission rather than loss of Rab5 (Figure 3A, Movie S4), likely reflecting the iterative removal of recycling cargo from early endosomes (Dunn et al., 1989Dunn K.W.

Next we investigated the possibility of Rab5 dissociation in conjunction with transport to late endosomes. Cells were allowed to internalize fluorescent LDL for 10 min prior to imaging. As expected, LDL entered GFP-Rab5-positive early endosomes, increasing almost linearly (Figures 3B and 3C). Small at first, LDL-positive endosomes gradually expanded, turning into vacuolar structures of ring-like morphology. Throughout, the Rab5 signal displayed the typical fluctuations described above (Figure 1D), which could again be mostly attributed to homotypic fusion with smaller Rab5 structures (data not shown). Interestingly, the exit of LDL from early endosomes, as indicated by a loss of colocalization between LDL and Rab5, occurred through a relatively rapid fade out of the Rab5 signal around the perimeter of the LDL-structure (Figures 3C and 3D), suggestive of GDI-mediated extraction. Consistently, the R of the LDL core hardly changed throughout this process (inset, Figure 3C). However, recovery of minor amounts of Rab5 in budding events cannot be entirely ruled out. LDL structures that had just undergone GFP-Rab5 loss were often found to transiently associate with GFP-Rab5-bearing endosomes (Figure 3C) without, however, reestablishing Rab5 association along the full perimeter of the membrane. Therefore, such events likely represent peripheral interactions with distinct vesicles, also confirmed by careful visual inspection of the underlying movie sequences (Movie S5). Following loss of GFP-Rab5, LDL structures tended to be much more motile than Rab5-positive structures of comparable diameter and often tubulated and fused with similar Rab5-negative structures (Movie S6). The sequence of events described above represents the general mode of transition from Rab5-positive to Rab5-negative membranes.

To accomplish this, normal human brain endothelial cells were transduced by lentiviral vectors incorporating human telomerase or SV40 T antigen. Among the many stable immortalized clones obtained by sequential limiting dilution cloning of the transduced cells, one was selected for expression of normal endothelial markers, including CD31, VE cadherin, and von Willebrand factor. This cell line, termed hCMEC/D3, showed a stable normal karyotype, maintained contact-inhibited monolayers in tissue culture, exhibited robust proliferation in response to endothelial growth factors, and formed capillary tubes in matrix but no colonies in soft agar. hCMEC/D3 cells expressed telomerase and grew indefinitely without phenotypic dedifferentiation. These cells expressed chemokine receptors, up-regulated adhesion molecules in response to inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrated blood-brain barrier characteristics, including tight junctional proteins and the capacity to actively exclude drugs. hCMEC/D3 are excellent candidates for studies of blood-brain barrier function, the responses of brain endothelium to inflammatory and infectious stimuli, and the interaction of brain endothelium with lymphocytes or tumor cells. Thus, hCMEC/D3 represents the first stable, fully characterized, well-differentiated human brain endothelial cell line and should serve as a widely usable research tool."

https://openalex.org/W1964628768,"Eukaryotic cells contain nontranslating messenger RNA concentrated in P-bodies, which are sites where the mRNA can be decapped and degraded. We present evidence that mRNA molecules within yeast P-bodies can also return to translation. First, inhibiting delivery of new mRNAs to P-bodies leads to their disassembly independent of mRNA decay. Second, P-bodies decline in a translation initiation–dependent manner during stress recovery. Third, reporter mRNAs concentrate in P-bodies when translation initiation is blocked and resume translation and exit P-bodies when translation is restored. Fourth, stationary phase yeast have large P-bodies containing mRNAs that reenter translation when growth resumes. The reciprocal movement of mRNAs between polysomes and P-bodies is likely to be important in the control of mRNA translation and degradation. Moreover, the presence of related proteins in P-bodies and maternal mRNA storage granules suggests this mechanism is widely adapted for mRNA storage."

https://openalex.org/W2113743444,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) repress transcriptional responses to diverse signaling pathways as an essential aspect of their biological activities, but mechanisms determining the specificity and functional consequences of transrepression remain poorly understood. Here, we report signal- and gene-specific repression of transcriptional responses initiated by engagement of toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 4, and 9 in macrophages. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) represses a large set of functionally related inflammatory response genes by disrupting p65/interferon regulatory factor (IRF) complexes required for TLR4- or TLR9-dependent, but not TLR3-dependent, transcriptional activation. This mechanism requires signaling through MyD88 and enables the GR to differentially regulate pathogen-specific programs of gene expression. PPARgamma and LXRs repress overlapping transcriptional targets by p65/IRF3-independent mechanisms and cooperate with the GR to synergistically transrepress distinct subsets of TLR-responsive genes. These findings reveal combinatorial control of homeostasis and immune responses by nuclear receptors and suggest new approaches for treatment of inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1995168697,"The aggressive clinical behavior of melanoma suggests that the developmental origins of melanocytes in the neural crest might be relevant to their metastatic propensity. Here we show that primary human melanocytes, transformed using a specific set of introduced genes, form melanomas that frequently metastasize to multiple secondary sites, whereas human fibroblasts and epithelial cells transformed using an identical set of genes generate primary tumors that rarely do so. Notably, these melanomas have a metastasis spectrum similar to that observed in humans with melanoma. These observations indicate that part of the metastatic proclivity of melanoma is attributable to lineage-specific factors expressed in melanocytes and not in other cell types analyzed. Analysis of microarray data from human nevi shows that the expression pattern of Slug, a master regulator of neural crest cell specification and migration, correlates with those of other genes that are important for neural crest cell migrations during development. Moreover, Slug is required for the metastasis of the transformed melanoma cells. These findings indicate that melanocyte-specific factors present before neoplastic transformation can have a pivotal role in governing melanoma progression."

Hereditary deficiency in mismatch repair (MMR) causes an increased rate of gene mutations and susceptibility to certain types of cancer, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Kolodner and Marsischky, 1999Kolodner R.D.

Recent evidence also suggests that MMR plays a role in DNA-damage response (Li, 1999Li G.-M. The role of mismatch repair in DNA damage-induced apoptosis.Oncol.

The methyl-directed MMR pathway in Escherichia coli is well characterized and provides an excellent model for eukaryotic MMR. In E. coli, 11 proteins carry out the repair reaction in three stages: initiation, excision, and repair DNA synthesis. MutS, MutL, and MutH recognize mismatches and incise the newly synthesized unmethylated DNA strand (initiation). One of four exonucleases (Exo1, Exo VII, Exo X, or RecJ) carries out 5′ or 3′ excision from the DNA-strand break in conjunction with UvrD helicase (excision). Finally, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme catalyzes repair DNA synthesis, and repair is completed by DNA ligase (for a review, see Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. DNA Mismatch Repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). MMR is a highly conserved pathway, such that MMR in eukaryotic cells is mechanistically similar to bacterial methyl-directed MMR and involves similar protein components. Since the strand-discrimination signal in eukaryotic cells has not been defined, how the eukaryotic MMR machinery specifically targets the newly synthesized DNA strand for repair is unknown. However, the strand-specific MMR reaction can be directed by a preexisting nick in vitro (Modrich and Lahue, 1996Modrich P. Lahue R. Mismatch repair in replication fidelity, genetic recombination, and cancer biology.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Although the nick-directed reaction may actually be a subreaction of MMR, repair of a nick-containing heteroduplex requires at least MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) or MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3), MutLα (MLH1-PMS2), RPA, PCNA, EXO1, HMGB1, RFC, and DNA polymerase δ (for a review, see Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. DNA Mismatch Repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Whereas the initiation, resynthesis, and ligation reactions in human cells are poorly understood, the excision step of base-base MMR in the human system was recently reconstituted using MutSα as a recognition protein and EXO1 as a nuclease (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L.

Interestingly, although eukaryotic EXO1s were originally identified as a 5′→3′ exonuclease (Lee and Wilson, 1999Lee B.I. Wilson 3rd., D.M.

Similarly, extracts from Exo1−/− mouse cells are partially defective in both 5′- and 3′-nick-directed MMR (Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). One possibility is that EXO1 possesses a cryptic 3′→5′ hydrolytic activity (Genschel et al., 2002Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. Human exonuclease I is required for 5′ and 3′ mismatch repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); alternatively, it could be attributed to EXO1’s ability to stabilize MMR protein complexes by playing both structural and enzymatic roles (Amin et al., 2001Amin N.S. Nguyen M.N. Oh S. Kolodner R.D. exo1-Dependent mutator mutations: model system for studying functional interactions in mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5142-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the presence of which may reveal the cryptic 3′→5′ nuclease activity by another component (or components) in the reaction. Nevertheless, the cryptic 3′→5′ nuclease activity associated with EXO1 requires further investigation. It is obvious that EXO1 is not the only nuclease involved in MMR, as Exo1 null mutants in yeast and mice confer only a partial MMR defect in vivo (Amin et al., 2001Amin N.S. Nguyen M.N. Oh S.

Despite the reconstitution of the excision step, how strand-specific excision is initiated is still quite controversial. Three distinct models have been proposed, and the major differences among these models are (1) both the translocation model (Allen et al., 1997Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. MutS mediates heteroduplex loop formation by a translocation mechanism.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and the sliding clamp model (Gradia et al., 1999Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. hMSH2-hMSH6 forms a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp on mismatched DNA.Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) propose that MutS or its homologs leave the mismatch in search of the strand-discrimination signal, but the DNA bending-mismatch verification model (Junop et al., 2001Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Composite active site of an ABC ATPase: MutS uses ATP to verify mismatch recognition and authorize DNA repair.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggests that MutS-like proteins stay at the mismatch during the repair process, and (2) the sliding model suggests that several MutS molecules need to be accumulated between the mismatch and the discrimination signal, whereas the other two models believe that a single MutS complex (dimer or tetramer) is sufficient for a heteroduplex repair. Clearly, these models require further evaluation. In addition, how mismatch-provoked excision is properly terminated is unknown. Although the requirement for RPA in MMR has been established (Lin et al., 1998Lin Y.L. Shivji M.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. The evolutionarily conserved zinc finger motif in the largest subunit of human replication protein A is required for DNA replication and mismatch repair but not for nucleotide excision repair.J.

Partial reconstitution of human DNA mismatch repair in vitro: characterization of the role of human replication protein A.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), its precise role in the reaction is not yet defined. Whereas RPA was initially reported to stimulate mismatch-provoked excision (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Ramilo et al., 2002Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.M. Partial reconstitution of human DNA mismatch repair in vitro: characterization of the role of human replication protein A.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that it negatively regulates the EXO1 processivity (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are still many fundamental questions about eukaryotic MMR to be answered. This study reports complete in vitro reconstitution of human MMR using purified proteins and a 5′-nicked heteroduplex DNA substrate. The reconstituted MMR system containing MutSα efficiently repairs both base-base and ID mismatches. In contrast, the reconstituted system using MutSβ has a limited role in repair of base-base mismatches but repairs ID mispairs much more efficiently than the MutSα system. HMGB1 and RPA stimulate MutSα- or MutSβ-activated, mismatch-provoked excision by EXO1. We show that MutLα regulates mismatch-provoked excision by EXO1 and terminates the excision upon mismatch removal. Titration experiments revealed that multiple MutSα-MutLα complexes are required for efficient repair of a single mismatch. These data provide novel insight into the initiation and termination of mismatch-provoked excision in human cells, and the reconstitution assays presented here offer ideal opportunities to investigate the mechanisms of MMR and the consequences of cancer-associated mutations in a variety of MMR genes. Human MMR proteins were purified to homogeneity (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), including MutSα, MutSβ, MutLα, RPA, EXO1, HMGB1, PCNA, RFC, and DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). MMR reactions were performed in the MutSα system (including all MMR components except MutSβ) or the MutSβ system (including all MMR components except MutSα). The MutSα system was tested initially with a G-T heteroduplex DNA substrate containing a strand break 128 bp 5′ to the mismatch (Figure 1A ). With the complete MutSα system, >50% of the G-T heteroduplex was repaired in 10 min (Figures 1B and 1C, reaction 1). The repair level in the reconstituted system is equivalent to the level repaired by 50 μg of human extracts for 15 min (Parsons et al., 1993Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Hypermutability and mismatch repair deficiency in RER+ tumor cells.Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The protein requirements for the MMR reaction were defined by systematically omitting one component of the reaction at a time. These assays showed that MutSα, EXO1, and pol δ are indispensable for repair (Figures 1B and 1C, reactions 2, 3, and 8 and data not shown). In contrast, omission of RPA or HMGB1 reduces repair efficiency slightly (Figures 1B and 1C, reactions 5 and 6), but omission of both RPA and HMGB1 reduces repair efficiency dramatically (Figures 1B and 1C, reaction 7). This suggests that HMGB1 and RPA play similar roles in MMR. Surprisingly, addition of MutLα appears to reduce the repair efficiency (Figures 1B and 1C, compare reaction 4 with reaction 1). Omission of PCNA or RFC from the reconstituted MMR assay reduces repair by ∼17% (Figures 1B and 1C, reaction 9), suggesting that, while PCNA and RFC facilitate pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis, pol δ alone is able to fill short gaps under the experimental conditions. The marginal dependence of the reconstituted reaction on RFC and PCNA seems to be in conflict with in vitro DNA-synthesis studies, where RFC and PCNA greatly stimulate pol δ processivity (Podust et al., 1998Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Ott R. Fanning E. Functional interactions among the subunits of replication factor C potentiate and modulate its ATPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12935-12942Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Xie et al., 2002Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Reconstitution and characterization of the human DNA polymerase delta four-subunit holoenzyme.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This discrepancy was found to be caused by different assay conditions. In particular, the repair assay in this study contained 110 mM KCl, but no monovalent salt was used in the in vitro synthesis assay (Podust et al., 1998Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Ott R. Fanning E.

Reconstitution and characterization of the human DNA polymerase delta four-subunit holoenzyme.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under the later conditions, RFC and PCNA, along with RPA, dramatically enhance pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis on a primed 6.4 kb f1MR1 ssDNA substrate (data not shown). However, these conditions do not support in vitro-reconstituted MMR (data not shown). The MutSβ system was also tested with the 5′-nicked G-T heteroduplex. The MutSα-to-MutSβ ratio in the cell is ∼6–10:1 (Drummond et al., 1997Drummond J.T. Genschel J. Wolf E. Modrich P. DHFR/MSH3 amplification in methotrexate-resistant cells alters the hMutSα/hMutSβ ratio and reduces the efficiency of base-base mismatch repair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), so MutSβ was added at an 8-fold lower concentration than MutSα. Under these conditions, MutSβ repaired ∼10% of the G-T substrate (Figure 1C), and no additional repair was observed at 8-fold higher concentration of MutSβ (data not shown). These data suggest that MutSβ does not play a major role in repair of base-base mismatches in human MMR. ID mispairs are a major class of DNA-replication error that are generated by strand slippage in tracts of simple repetitive DNA (Kunkel, 1993Kunkel T.A. Nucleotide repeats. Slippery DNA and diseases.Nature. 1993; 365: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The process by which ID mispairs are repaired by MMR is less well understood than the process by which base-base mismatches are repaired by MMR. Here, a 3 nt unpaired ID heteroduplex (Figure 1A) was tested for repair in the MutSα and MutSβ reconstituted systems. The result showed that the ID DNA substrate is efficiently processed by both the MutSα and MutSβ systems (Figures 2A–2C ), even though an 8-fold lower concentration of MutSβ was used in the MutSβ system. Furthermore, when MutSα and MutSβ were titrated in the assay for ID-mispair excision, the MutSβ system was much more active than the MutSα system. Under the same conditions, 100 fmol MutSβ efficiently promoted the removal of the ID mispair in nearly 60% of heteroduplexes, but 100 fmol MutSα could only mediate ∼25% of the DNA substrate for excision (Figure 2D). These results suggest that ID heteroduplexes are likely to be preferentially repaired by MutSβ in vivo, consistent with yeast genetic studies showing that the dependence of ID-heteroduplex repair on MSH3 increases as the size of the ID increases (Marsischky et al., 1996Marsischky G.T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, these data are consistent with the idea that the relatively low physiological concentration of MutSβ is sufficient to promote efficient repair of ID mismatches, while a high in vivo concentration of MutSβ could have deleterious effects on repair of base-base mismatches by reducing the in vivo MutSα concentration (Drummond et al., 1997Drummond J.T. Genschel J. Wolf E. Modrich P. DHFR/MSH3 amplification in methotrexate-resistant cells alters the hMutSα/hMutSβ ratio and reduces the efficiency of base-base mismatch repair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mismatch repair deficiency associated with overexpression of the MSH3 gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 8568-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We found that the repair of the ID mispair requires MutSα or MutSβ, EXO1, RPA, HMGB1, and pol δ (Figures 2A–2C and data not shown). The data shown in Figure 2D also indicate that excess amounts of MutSα or MutSβ are required for efficient repair of the 24 fmol ID substrate. Similar analysis was performed for the 5′ G-T substrate with various MutSα-to-DNA ratios (from 0.1 to 16). At a fixed DNA concentration (24 fmol), increasing the MutSα-to-DNA ratio resulted in increased excision (Figure 2E). Little excision was detected when the MutSα-to-DNA ratio was at 2 or less. A sharp increase in excision was observed when the ratio increased from 2 to 4 (Figure 2E), suggesting that a minimum of 4-fold excess MutSα is necessary to carry out efficient repair of the DNA heteroduplex used. Similar results were obtained by fixing the MutSα concentration (96 fmol) and changing the DNA concentration (Figure 2F). Reactions with a MutSα-to-DNA ratio ≤1 (lanes 10–12) generated little MMR-specific excision products. The signal from reactions with no proteins may be derived from incomplete digestion or minor impurity of the DNA substrate. These results strongly suggest that multiple molecules of MutSα are required for efficient repair of a single molecule of mismatch. A DNA ligase activity is required for the final step of MMR, but the human enzyme carrying out this reaction has not been identified. Given that DNA ligase I participates in nucleotide excision repair and interacts with PCNA (Aboussekhra et al., 1995Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D.

Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), this ligase might also play a role in MMR. Indeed, when DNA ligase I was incubated with the MutSα system and a G-T heteroduplex with a 36 nt gap 5′ to the mismatch, ∼40% of the DNA substrates were converted to covalently closed supercoiled DNA (Figure 3A , reaction 2). PCNA and RFC seem to have little impact on the ligation efficiency under the experimental conditions (see reaction 3). To determine if ligation products were repaired molecules, the supercoiled DNA was recovered from the gel and examined by restriction digestion with the repair scoring enzyme HindIII. The result showed that ∼60% of the supercoiled DNA was sensitive to HindIII (Figure 3B, reaction 3). This result indicates that DNA ligase I likely catalyzed the last step (ligation reaction) of the MMR reaction in the reconstituted MutSα system. Similar experiments were performed using the MutSβ system and the nicked 5′ CTG ID substrate (Figure 3A, reactions 10–12). Although close to 60% of DNA substrates became supercoiled (i.e., ligated; see Figure 3A, reactions 11 and 12), only ∼10% of the supercoiled DNA molecules were repaired products (Figure 3B, reaction 12), suggesting that the nicked heteroduplex was efficiently ligated by DNA ligase I before repair. A similar result was also seen when ligation assays were performed using the MutSα system and the nicked G-T or ID heteroduplex (Figures 3A and 3B, reactions 6 and 9). Nevertheless, these results indicate that DNA ligase I is competent to perform the ligation step in MMR. The role of MutLα in human MMR is still unclear. A previous study suggested that MutLα is not required for 5′-directed heteroduplex excision, but it promotes repair specificity by suppressing excision on homoduplex DNA in a MutSα-dependent manner (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown above, omission of MutLα has little effect on the efficiency of the MutSα reconstituted system (Figure 1), but it does result in lower yield of the 3.1 kb product (Figure 1B, reaction 4 versus reactions 1, 5, and 6). This could indicate that the 3.1 kb reaction product has more single-strandedness in reactions lacking MutLα than in reactions with MutLα. Single-stranded regions stain poorly with ethidium bromide and could result from less-efficient DNA resynthesis and/or more-vigorous DNA excision by EXO1. The total amount of DNA recovered in reactions lacking MutLα was also significantly lower than in reactions with MutLα (Figure 1B, reaction 4 versus reactions 1, 5, and 6), which is also consistent with more-vigorous DNA excision in the absence of MutLα. The extent of DNA excision in the reconstituted MutSα system was assessed in the absence of PCNA, RFC, and pol δ, as they are not essential for excision (Figure 4A , reaction 1 and Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Figure 4C shows that, in reactions containing MutLα, reaction products were either unreacted (starting at the nick) or were excised to a position past the nick and/or the mismatch site (Figure 4C, reactions 1–3 and 5–7; bracket). In contrast, in the reaction lacking MutLα, few excision products were detected (Figure 4C, reaction 4), even though the amount of unreacted DNA substrate in this reaction was similar to that of the complete reaction (reaction 1). This result suggests that excision without MutLα was so extensive that the probe annealing site (solid bar in Figure 4C) was degraded, implying that MutLα may regulate the extent of mismatch-provoked excision by EXO1 during MMR. Figure 4 also shows that HMGB1 and RPA regulate mismatch-provoked excision. When both HMGB1 and RPA were omitted from the reaction, the extent of excision was greatly reduced, and only ∼10% of the DNA substrate participated in excision (Figures 4A and 4C, reaction 7). In reactions containing HMGB1 but no RPA, extensive excision was detected (Figure 4C, reaction 5). In reactions containing RPA but no HMGB1, little unreacted DNA substrate remained, and a significant number of molecules were excised to just beyond the mismatch. Thus, the reaction products are similar in the complete reaction and in the reaction lacking only HMGB1 (reactions 1 and 6). These results suggest that RPA may both stimulate and suppress mismatch-provoked excision. Although HMGB1 and RPA independently facilitate MutSα-activated excision, evidence from this study and previous studies suggests that they play complementary roles in regulating excision during MMR (see below for details). The above results indicate that MutLα is required for excision endpoints beyond the mismatch (Figure 4C). To further elucidate the role of MutLα in mismatch-provoked excision, excision endpoint was determined as a function of the concentration of MutLα. As shown in Figure 4D, supplementation of MutLα to the reaction resulted in two prominent excision endpoints: one that is ∼25 nt (site I) and another that is 40–60 nt (site II) beyond the mismatch. As the concentration of MutLα was increased, more excision products at sites I and II were observed (Figures 4D and 4E). It is noted that efficient termination requires 260 fmol or more MutLα, indicating that, like the requirement for multiple MutSα complexes in repair of a single molecule of heteroduplex, multiple molecules of MutLα are required for terminating excision on a single molecule of heteroduplex. Additional minor termination sites (bracket in Figure 4D) were also observed in variable amounts in the presence of MutLα; these products were most abundant in the reaction wit"

At the atomic scale, carbon ion impacts induce downhill currents in the top layer of a growing film. At the continuum scale, these currents cause a rapid smoothing of initially rough substrates by erosion of hills into neighboring hollows. The predicted surface evolution is in excellent agreement with atomic force microscopy measurements. This mechanism is general, as shown by similar simulations for amorphous silicon. It explains the recently reported smoothing of multilayers and amorphous transition metal oxide films and underlines the general importance of impact-induced downhill currents for ion deposition, polishing, and nanopattering."

Here we report a mechanism of amplification regulation. We show that amplification is dependent on transcription from a noncoding bidirectional promoter (E-pro) within the rDNA spacer. E-pro transcription stimulates the dissociation of cohesin, a DNA binding protein complex that suppresses sister-chromatid-based changes in rDNA copy number. This transcription is regulated by the silencing gene, SIR2, and by copy number. Transcription-induced cohesin dissociation may be a general mechanism of recombination regulation."

The genomes of many double-stranded DNA bacteriophages and certain animal viruses, such as herpesvirus and adenovirus, are packaged into a preformed protein precursor capsid (prohead) to near-crystalline density (Jardine and Anderson, 2006Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. DNA packaging in the bacteriophages.in: Calendar R. The Bacteriophages. Second Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). This process is driven by a molecular motor that utilizes energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. The Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage ϕ29 is an excellent system to investigate the DNA packaging mechanism because both robust bulk (Grimes et al., 2002Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Bacteriophage ϕ29 DNA packaging.Adv. Virus Res. 2002; 58: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and single-viral-particle packaging assays (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B.

The advent of single-molecule manipulation techniques has allowed, for the first time, the direct investigation of the mechanochemical processes during packaging. In a previous study (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C.

The highly processive motor can package the 19.3 kbp genome against loads as high as 57 pN, its stall force, and, as the prohead is filled beyond 50% of its capacity, an internal force due to DNA confinement builds, reaching intracapsid pressures of 60 atm (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E.

The molecular motor of ϕ29 is comprised of three components: (1) the head-tail connector, a dodecamer of the gene 10 product (gp10), which is situated at the base of the prolate icosahedral prohead and has a channel through which DNA is translocated (Simpson et al., 2000Simpson A.A.

The gp16 ATPases are arranged in a ring-like structure oriented coaxially and in direct contact with the pRNA ring, and they likely operate as gp16-pRNA heterodimers (Grimes et al., 2002Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Bacteriophage ϕ29 DNA packaging.Adv. Virus Res. 2002; 58: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA packaging is still poorly understood. The ϕ29 motor is among the strongest motors known, generating ∼10 times more force than kinesin and ∼25 times more force than myosin. It is of considerable interest to understand the design principles that allow this motor to generate high mechanical forces with very high efficiencies and at high processivity. Moreover, it is of great interest to understand how the motor converts the chemical free energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. This understanding requires the study of the mechanochemistry of the molecular motor, involving the characterization of the chemical and mechanical work cycles (Bustamante et al., 2004Bustamante C. Chemla Y.R. Forde N.R. Izhaky D. Mechanical processes in biochemistry.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 705-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Single-molecule manipulation techniques such as optical tweezers that can measure and apply forces on individual molecules are especially well suited for such studies. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical assays to (1) characterize the kinetic parameters of the packaging motor, (2) investigate the mechanism of coordination among the motor subunits, (3) determine the dependence of the kinetic parameters on the external load to identify the force-generating steps in the mechanochemical cycle of the motor, and (4) arrive at a minimal mechanism consistent with motor operation. We begin our analysis with measurements of the packaging rate at various ATP concentrations, in order to better understand the ATP binding process. In our experiment, a single stalled packaging complex was attached between a microsphere in an optical trap and a microsphere placed on the end of a micropipette (Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures). Figure 1B shows typical traces of individual packaging events where DNA outside the prohead decreases in length over time as it is reeled into the capsid against a constant external force of ∼5 pN. ATP concentrations range from 5 to 1000 μM, with ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) fixed at 5 μM each (the latter added to ensure a defined free energy of hydrolysis, ΔG = ΔG0 + kBT ln([ATP]/[ADP][Pi])). The average packaging velocity calculated from such traces is plotted against ATP concentration in the black curve of Figure 1C and follows the Michaelis-Menten equation (solid curve):v=Vmax[ATP]KM+[ATP](1) yielding a maximum velocity Vmax = 103 ± 12 bp s−1, and KM = 31 ± 2 μM. (Strictly speaking, Equation 1 should be corrected to account for the reverse reaction: v = Vmax ([ATP] − [ADP][Pi]/Keq)/(KM + [ATP]), where Keq [>1011 μM] is the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis. For the range of product concentrations used in this paper ([ADP] = 5–1000 μM, [Pi] = 5–5000 μM), this correction is insignificant.) A fit to the more general Hill equation v = Vmax[ATP]n/(KMn + [ATP]n) (dashed curve, Figure 1C) yields a Hill coefficient close to unity (n = 1.2 ± 0.2). This result implies that either (1) each ATPase subunit can bind ATP and generate a step completely independently of each other, i.e., there is no binding cooperativity or coordination between the ATPases or (2) for every step, one or more ATPases can bind ATP successively and in coordination but not cooperatively (Schnitzer and Block, 1997Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Kinesin hydrolyses one ATP per 8-nm step.Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A Hill coefficient of 1 does not mean that the motor can only bind one ATP per mechanochemical cycle or that a single ATP is bound to the motor at any given time. Rather, it implies that the binding of one ATP neither facilitates nor hinders the binding of another ATP. Previous bulk measurements (Guo et al., 1987bGuo P.X. Peterson C. Anderson D.L. Prohead and DNA-gp3-dependent ATPase activity of the DNA packaging protein gp16 of bacteriophage ϕ29.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) confirmed presently (see Experimental Procedures) show that DNA is translocated by 2 base pairs (0.68 nm) per ATP hydrolyzed. Thus, if the motor were to bind n ATP molecules per step, it would translocate the DNA by n × 2 base pairs. Although our data cannot rule out a mechanism with n > 1 at this point, we favor the most parsimonious model, in which the motor binds one ATP and translocates the DNA by 2 base pairs per catalytic cycle. Next, to study the process of product release, we investigated the effect of ADP and Pi on the packaging velocity. As shown in Figure 1C, increasing the Pi concentration 1000-fold (to 5 mM) had no discernable effect on the packaging velocity at several ATP concentrations and at a constant force of ∼5 pN. This result indicates that the equilibrium constant for phosphate release is very large and that the release step may be considered irreversible. Figure 1C also shows substrate-saturation curves measured at ADP levels ranging from 5 μM to 1 mM. Fits to Equation 1 reveal that KM increases with ADP, whereas Vmax remains constant (Figure 1D). These curves were also fit to a Hill equation. The Hill coefficients did not significantly differ from unity (n = 1.2 ± 0.2 for [ADP] = 5 μM, n = 0.7 ± 0.5 at 100 μM, n = 1.0 ± 0.1 at 250 μM, n = 1.2 ± 0.2 at 500 μM, and n = 1.3 ± 0.3 at 1 mM; on average, n = 1.05 ± 0.25). This result is consistent with ADP acting as a competitive inhibitor to ATP. Since the inhibitor may always be outcompeted by the addition of more substrate, Vmax is independent of inhibitor concentration. On the other hand, KM increases with inhibitor concentration because a progressively larger amount of substrate is required to counter the inhibitory effects. The data (Figure 1D) are well described by a competitive-inhibition model (Segel, 1975Segel, I.H. (1975). Enzyme Kinetics (New York: Wiley & Sons), pp. 100–141.Google Scholar), with KM = KM0(1 + [ADP]/KD), where KM0 = 30 ± 9 μM is the Michaelis-Menten constant at [ADP] = 0 and the binding constant for ADP, KD = 44 ± 13 μM. The linear dependence on ADP concentration indicates that the inhibition involves binding of only one ADP molecule at the active site. As shown below, these results limit the classes of mechanisms consistent with motor operation. To investigate the coordination between motor subunits during packaging, we blocked the hydrolysis cycle by supplementing the ATP buffer with variable amounts of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, which reversibly stalls packaging in bulk (unpublished data). Figure 2A shows traces obtained for individual proheads packaging at a constant external load of ∼5 pN, at a fixed ATP concentration of 100 μM ([ADP] = [Pi] = 5 μM), and at AMP-PNP concentrations in the range of 0–5 μM. In the presence of AMP-PNP, packaging is interrupted by pauses (>>1 s), yet the velocity between pauses is not affected (Figure 2A). The motor also pauses in the absence of AMP-PNP (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. The bacteriophage ϕ29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), but inherent pauses are less frequent and of shorter duration than the pauses induced here and were excluded from this analysis. The frequency of induced pauses, i.e., the number of pauses per length of DNA packaged, increases linearly with the amount of AMP-PNP for a given concentration of ATP (Figure 2B). The pause duration is not affected by AMP-PNP concentration (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These results indicate that the binding of only one AMP-PNP to the motor is sufficient to cause a pause. If more than one AMP-PNP molecule (n > 1) had to bind to induce a pause, the frequency would vary with a power-law dependence (i.e., as [AMP-PNP]n). We also find that the pause frequency decreases inversely with ATP for a given concentration of AMP-PNP (Figure 2C). This dependence implies that AMP-PNP binds to the motor in competition with ATP. Also, the pause duration is not affected by the ATP concentration (Figure S1). These experiments were repeated with another ATP analog, γS-ATP, revealing the same qualitative behavior (Figure S2). Taken together, these observations show that binding of a single nonhydrolyzable ATP analog to the active site, in competition with ATP, is sufficient to stall the motor for a duration corresponding to the residence time of the analog on the motor. The above results allow us to better understand the coordination between subunits of the motor. Two possible conclusions may be derived. One is that the actions of the ATPases are coordinated and interdependent such that blocking the hydrolysis cycle of one ATPase brings the entire motor to a halt. The other possibility is that despite the motor being a multimer, only one subunit is continuously active, and the pauses are the result of blocking the chemical cycle of that subunit. However, previous studies using pRNA mutants demonstrate the involvement of all pRNAs during packaging (Trottier et al., 1996Trottier M. Zhang C. Guo P.X. Complete inhibition of virion assembly in vivo with mutant procapsid RNA essential for phage ϕ29 DNA packaging.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Chen and Guo, 1997Chen C. Guo P.X. Sequential action of six viral encoded DNA packaging RNAs during the phage ϕ29 genomic DNA translocation.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), favoring the former scenario. These results, combined with a Hill coefficient of 1, mean that the ATPases cannot be independent but must act in succession: that is, each ATPase must finish its mechanochemical cycle before the next can complete its own. This conclusion need not mean that the firing order is ordinal (i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3… around the ring of ATPases); it can even be random or nonordinal (e.g., 1 3 5 2 4 1 3…). Interestingly, competitive inhibition by ADP did not result in observable pauses in packaging. Presumably the release rates and binding rates of ADP to the motor are sufficiently fast that pauses are exceedingly short-lived and are not detected by our methods. Next we investigated the force dependence of the packaging velocity in order to decipher the coordination between the mechanical and chemical steps. The packaging rate v and the ATP turnover rate kATP of the motor are related by: v(F) = ϵd⋅kATP, where d is the step size and ϵ is the coupling coefficient, i.e., the probability that the motor steps per hydrolysis cycle. The dependence of the packaging velocity on applied load may be explained if the partitioning between productive and futile hydrolyses depends on force, leading to a load-dependent coupling coefficient ϵ(F). Alternatively, the force dependence may result from one or more load-dependent steps in the cycle, resulting in a force-dependent ATP turnover rate kATP(F). The force dependence of the Michaelis-Menten parameters Vmax and KM can be used to distinguish between these alternatives (Visscher et al., 1999Visscher L. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Single kinesin molecules studies with a molecular force clamp.Nature. 1999; 400: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) and, in the latter case, also identify the location of the force-dependent transitions within the hydrolysis cycle (Keller and Bustamante, 2000Keller D. Bustamante C. The mechanochemistry of molecular motors.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 541-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). DNA packaging rates were monitored as a function of force at ATP concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μM (Figure 3A ) and at high and low ADP and phosphate concentrations (Figure 3B). In these measurements, the load applied by the optical trap on the motor increases as the DNA is packaged, until the motor stalls (see Experimental Procedures). The data is well described by a single force-dependent transition with an Arrhenius-like dependence, exp(−FΔx/kBT), where Δx = 0.11 nm (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. The bacteriophage ϕ29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Here, Δx is a “characteristic distance” corresponding to the distance along the mechanical reaction coordinate to the transition state (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. The bacteriophage ϕ29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). At near-saturating ATP levels ([ATP] >> KM), the packaging rate, and thus the rate-limiting step, depends strongly on force. In this regime, v ≈ Vmax = ϵd⋅kcat, where kcat is an “effective” catalytic constant that depends on several microscopic rate constants. However, at low ATP concentrations ([ATP] < KM), where the rate-limiting step is ATP binding and its commitment to hydrolysis, the velocity becomes force independent. In this regime, the packaging velocity v ≈ Vmax[ATP]/KM = ϵd⋅kb[ATP], where kb = Vmax/(ϵd⋅KM) is an effective second-order binding constant (Visscher et al., 1999Visscher L. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Single kinesin molecules studies with a molecular force clamp.Nature. 1999; 400: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Fitting the data in Figure 3A to Equation 1 reveals that Vmax and KM decrease with load at the same rate (Figure 3C), so that their ratio Vmax/KM = ϵd⋅kb is indeed force independent (Figure 3D). Phosphate has no effect on the force-velocity behavior of the motor (Figure 3B) as would be expected if phosphate release were irreversible. The effect of ADP on the force-velocity behavior of the motor (Figure 3B) is consistent with ADP binding with a force-independent rate constant (see Supplemental Data). The force independence of Vmax/KM rules out models with a load-dependent coupling efficiency ϵ(F) (Visscher et al., 1999Visscher L. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Single kinesin molecules studies with a molecular force clamp.Nature. 1999; 400: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Those models predict that both Vmax = ϵ(F)d⋅kcat and Vmax/KM = ϵ(F)d⋅kb should be force dependent, whereas KM = kcat/kb should be force independent, contrary to our observations. “Mixed” coupling models, with one or more load-dependent steps in the hydrolysis cycle in addition to a load-dependent coupling coefficient ϵ(F), predict that Vmax, KM, and Vmax/KM will all depend on force, again inconsistent with our results. Instead, the data show that the force dependence of the packaging rate results from a load-dependent step in the hydrolysis cycle of the motor. Moreover, the data require not only that the catalytic rate kcat(F) be load dependent but that the effective binding rate kb not be, restricting which transitions in the cycle coincide with the force-dependent DNA translocation. The following scheme shows a generic cycle of a motor that binds one molecule of ATP:M1+T↔k±1M2↔k±2⋯Mj→kj︸kbMj+1↔k±j+1Mj+2↔k±j+2⋯Mn→kn︷kcat(F)M1(2) where M1… Mn are the states of the motor and k±1… kn are the kinetic rate constants (k1 is the rate constant of the forward transition from state 1 to 2, and k-1 is the rate constant of the reverse transition from state 2 to 1, etc.). In this scheme, ATP binding is modeled as a second-order “docking” step in which ATP comes into loose contact with the catalytic cleft, followed by a first-order step in which ATP becomes more tightly bound (Keller and Bustamante, 2000Keller D. Bustamante C. The mechanochemistry of molecular motors.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 541-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It can be shown (see Supplemental Data) that, for this scheme, kcat depends on the rate constants of all transitions except that of the ATP docking step (i.e., k±2, k±3… kn, in scheme 2). On the other hand, kb depends on the rate constants of all steps connected by a reversible path to the ATP docking step up to and including the first irreversible step to follow docking (i.e., k±1, k±2… kj). Therefore, the observed force independence of kb requires that the force-dependent step must follow the first irreversible step after ATP docking (step j), between steps j+1 and n (i.e., k±j+1, k±j+2… kn). The force independence of kb rules out a scheme where ATP docking powers translocation. A scheme in which force generation occurs during the tight binding of ATP, as suggested for F1-ATPase (Oster and Wang, 2000Oster G. Wang H. Reverse engineering a protein: the mechanochemistry of ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 482-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), is also inconsistent with our data. Since docking is likely reversible, the force independence of kb rules out a subsequent tight binding transition as a force-generating step. There is yet another method to rule out the tight binding of ATP as the translocation step. This method is based on the fact that the long duration of pauses induced by AMP-PNP requires that the binding of this analog involve not only a docking step but also the formation of a long-lived, tightly bound state similar to that of ATP. If ATP tight binding coincided with translocation and thus were force dependent, a force applied on DNA should promote the unbinding of ATP. Therefore, the effect of the tension on the DNA should be to decrease the ATP release time and hence the duration of the AMP-PNP-induced pauses as exp[F(d − Δx)/kBT]. While the docking rates for ATP and AMP-PNP differ by a factor of ∼14 (Figure 2B) (the docking rates for ATP and γS-ATP are almost identical; see Figure S2), we expect the force dependence of the binding event to be similar. Accordingly, the pause duration should decrease ∼40-fold with an increase in external force of 25 pN. Instead, we observed no decrease in pause duration in the force range 5–30 pN (Figure 2D). Since the motor generates high forces, it should be tightly engaged to DNA during translocation. It also follows that part of the motor must at some point disengage from the DNA in order to reposition itself for the next translocation cycle. Thus, determining the DNA affinity of the motor in its different nucleotide bound states can help understand the coordination between translocation and the hydrolysis cycle. The ϕ29 motor displays occasional slips in packaging (Figure 4A ), which result from temporary detachments of the motor from the DNA. We use these events as a direct probe for the DNA affinity of the motor. Figure 4B shows the slipping frequency, defined as the number of slips per time, as a function of nucleotide concentration and at a constant force of ∼5 pN. At low ADP (5–250 μM, black curve in Figure 4B), the slipping frequency increases from 0 as ATP is lowered below KM. At high ADP (500 and 1000 μM, red curve in Figure 4B), this increase in slipping frequency also occurs, but at higher ATP concentrations than at low ADP. These results establish that the nucleotide state of the motor affects its affinity to DNA. The observed dependence of the slip rate on [ATP] and [ADP] is well described by the probability that the active subunit is empty or ADP bound multiplied by the intrinsic slipping rates from those states (see Supplemental Data), indicating that the affinity of the active site for DNA is low in the empty or ADP bound states. Finally, since the slipping frequency is negligible at high [ATP] at both ADP levels, the ATP bound state must have a high affinity for DNA. To confirm this interpretation, we have also developed an assay for motor-DNA affinity based on zonal-rate sedimentation in sucrose density gradients (see Experimental Procedures). In this experiment, the affinity of the motor for various nucleotide bound states is determined from the leakage of prepackaged DNA from the capsid of packaging intermediates in different nucleotide conditions—the ATP analogs γS-ATP and AMP-PNP, the hydrolysis transition-state analog ADP vanadate, and ADP. Any DNA that leaks out of the capsid adds to its hydrodynamic drag, causing the particle to sediment more slowly; the greater the leakage, the larger the drag. Stalled complexes run into gradients containing 0.4 μM γS-ATP sediment to a position (peak at fraction #4 in Figure 5A ) corresponding to complexes that fully retain their DNA. Identical results are obtained in gradient buffers containing 5 μM AMP-PNP and 500 μM ADP vanadate. However, in gradients containing no nucleotides or containing ADP, complexes sediment into a long tail corresponding to extensive leakage of DNA (Figure 5A). Although the exact shape of the sedimentation profile depends upon the velocity of DNA exit, the rate of disengagement from the DNA, and the rate of exchange of nucleotides into the gradient buffer, these results indicate that the motor has a weak DNA affinity in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of ADP, in agreement with the slipping data (Figure 4B). Varying the gradient γS-ATP concentration, we observe two phases to the sedimentation profiles of stalled complexes (Figure 5B). At low [γS-ATP] (<0.4 μM), the number of filled capsids increases with γS-ATP concentration, as expected since the motor has a higher DNA affinity when bound to γS-ATP than in the absence of nucleotides. However, as γS-ATP is increased beyond 0.4 μM, the complexes sediment more slowly, indicative of partial DNA leakage (Figure 5B). This biphasic behavior suggests that the motor is capable of binding more than one γS-ATP and that the DNA affinity of the motor is affected not just by the nucleotide state of one subunit but by that of two or more subunits. The motor appears to have two types of binding sites for γS-ATP: one that bi"

However, understanding the survival time of grafted NSPCs and determining the extent of migration away from transplantation sites are essential for optimizing treatment regimens. Here, we used in vivo bioluminescence imaging to noninvasively assess the survival and residence time of transplanted NSPCs at the injury sites in living animals, and we used histologic analyses to assess cell integration and morphology. Third-generation lentiviral vectors enabled efficient transduction and stable expression of both luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein in primary cultured NSPCs. Signals from these cells were detectable for up to 10 months or more after transplantation into the injured spinal cords of C57BL/6J mice. Histological and functional data supported the imaging data and suggest that the timing of NSPC transplantation may be a key determinant of the fates and function of integrated cells since cell survival and migration depended on the time of transplantation relative to injury. Optimization of cell therapies can be greatly accelerated and refined by imaging, and the methods in the present study can be widely applied to various research fields of regeneration medicine, including transplantation study."

These lesions contain fibrillar deposits of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and the British dementia peptide (ABri), respectively. Both peptides are toxic to cells in culture, and there is increasing evidence that early “soluble oligomers” are the toxic entity rather than mature amyloid fibrils. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this toxicity are not clear, but in the case of Aβ, one prominent hypothesis is that the peptide can induce oxidative damage via the formation of hydrogen peroxide. We have developed a reliable method, employing electron spin resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with the spin-trapping technique, to detect any hydrogen peroxide generated during the incubation of Aβ and other amyloidogenic peptides. Here, we monitored levels of hydrogen peroxide accumulation during different stages of aggregation of Aβ-(1–40) and ABri and found that in both cases it was generated as a short “burst” early on in the aggregation process. Ultrastructural studies with both peptides revealed that structures resembling “soluble oligomers” or “protofibrils” were present during this early phase of hydrogen peroxide formation. Mature amyloid fibrils derived from Aβ-(1–40) did not generate hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrogen peroxide is readily converted into the aggressive hydroxyl radical by Fenton chemistry and these two ROS could be responsible for some of the oxidative damage seen in the brain in AD. Familial British dementia (FBD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is strikingly similar in neuropathology to AD, including the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. FBD is due to a stop codon mutation in the BRI gene, the protein product of which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release an abnormally long peptide fragment (ABri) that rapidly aggregates in vitro into toxic oligomers (11El-Agnaf O.M.A. Sheridan J.M.

Only ABri with an intact intramolecular disulfide bond can do this, whereas the corresponding wild-type peptide (WT) does not aggregate and is non-toxic (11El-Agnaf O.M.A. Sheridan J.M. Sidera C.

Because both AD and FBD share similar pathological features, we were interested, as one aspect of our research, in establishing whether or not ABri also has the ability to generate hydrogen peroxide. reactive oxygen species amyloid β-peptide Alzheimer disease familial British dementia the British dementia peptide wild-type form of the ABri peptide 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide the DMPO hydroxyl radical adduct atomic force microscopy diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay electron microscopy Our method to detect hydrogen peroxide formation employs ESR spectroscopy in conjunction with the spin-trapping technique. The full methodology has been published elsewhere (13Turnbull S. Tabner B.J. El-Agnaf O.M.A. Moore S. Davies Y. Allsop D. Free Radic. Biol.

These radicals are then trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to form the DMPO hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO-OH), which has a uniquely characteristic 4-line ESR spectrum. Using this technique, we have shown that various amyloidogenic peptides, including Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), Aβ-(25–35), as well as α-synuclein (implicated in Parkinson disease and related disorders) and certain toxic fragments of the prion protein (implicated in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) can all generate hydrogen peroxide (13Turnbull S.

Numerous controls, including reverse and scrambled peptides, nontoxic peptides, and the β- and γ-synucleins were shown to lack this ability when tested under the same experimental conditions, demonstrating the specificity of hydrogen peroxide formation. Furthermore, the ability of these various peptides to generate hydrogen peroxide shows a clear positive correlation with their cytotoxicity. We have noted in all of our experiments in which hydrogen peroxide is formed that the relative intensity of the DMPO-OH ESR spectrum with peptide incubation time always follows a characteristic profile. There is a delay time before the spectrum is first observed after which its intensity rapidly increases to a maximum before slowly decreasing back to zero. The exact time course of the profile varies from peptide to peptide and, to a lesser extent, from batch to batch of the same peptide, but nevertheless each phase of the profile is observed without exception. Here, we have examined how the generation of hydrogen peroxide relates to the extent of peptide aggregation by following the time dependence of hydrogen peroxide accumulation during incubation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to Aβ-(1–40). Peptide aggregation was determined by an immunoassay method for the detection of oligomeric forms of Aβ-(1–40) (19Moore S.A. Huckerby T.N. Gibson G.L. Fullwood N.J. Turnbull S. Tabner B.J.

Similar experiments were also carried out with the ABri and WT peptides. Peptides and Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy—The Aβ-(1–40) peptide was purchased from BIOSOURCE International. The ABri and WT peptides were synthesized using a Milligen 9050 peptide synthesizer (PE Applied Biosystems Ltd., Cheshire, UK) (11El-Agnaf O.M.A. Sheridan J.M. Sidera C. Siligardi G. Hussain R.

Solutions (100 μm) of Aβ-(1–40), ABri, and WT in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, were prepared as described previously (12El-Agnaf O.M.A. Nagala S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. J. Mol.

After the required incubation time, a 50-μl aliquot of PBS containing aggregating peptide was removed, and solutions of DMPO (12.5 μl, 50 mm), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) (12.5 μl, 125 μm), and then Fe(II) sulfate (12.5 μl, 0.10 mm) were added. Immediately after mixing, the resulting solution was transferred to an ESR sample tube for detection of the DMPO-OH spectrum. All spectrometer settings were as detailed previously (13Turnbull S.

Because DMPO, DETAPAC, and Fe(II) concentrations remain the same for the addition to each aliquot of preincubated peptide solution, the intensity of the ESR spectrum reflects the concentration of DMPO-OH formed at each time point. Calibration curves show that the intensity of the ESR spectrum increases with hydrogen peroxide concentration. Mature Aβ-(1–40) fibrils were prepared as described above with incubation for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the sample was centrifuged in a MSE HAWK 15/05 refrigerated microcentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 5 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed, and the fibril pellet was resuspended in fresh PBS and washed. This procedure was repeated before resuspension in the required final volume of fresh PBS solution. ELISA for Aβ Oligomers—Non-biotinylated 6E10 antibody (initial concentration, 1 mg/ml; Signet Pathology Systems Inc.) was diluted 1:1000 in 200 mm NaHCO3 (Sigma), pH 9.6, containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, and 100 μl of this solution was dispensed to each well of a 96-well microplate (Fisher Scientific). It was then covered with a plate sealer and stored at 4 °C overnight. (Antibody 6E10 recognizes amino acid residues 1–17 of human Aβ.) The plate was then washed four times with PBS (Sigma) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBST) on a microplate washer. Blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% gelatin (Sigma) and 0.05% Tween 20) was added (200μl/well), and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. It was then washed four times with PBST, 100-μl aliquots of the samples to be tested (Aβ solutions were diluted to 1 μm in PBS) were added to each well, and the plate was again incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing four times with PBST, 100 μl/well biotinylated 6E10 antibody (1 mg/ml), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, was added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for a further 2 h. The plate was then washed four times with PBST, incubated with 100 μl/well ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted 3:5000 in blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally the plate was washed four times with PBST before adding 100 μl/well p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma). Absorbance values at 405 nm were measured after allowing the color to develop for 30 min at room temperature. Results are the mean of triplicate samples. Thioflavin T Assay—Triplicate 10-μl samples of Aβ-(1–40) and ABri (100 μm in PBS) were removed after incubation for various times at 37 °C. These samples were diluted into 190 μl of PBS containing 20 μm thioflavin T. Fluorescence was measured in black 96-well plates using a Victor2 1420 multi-label microtiter plate reader with excitation at 440 nm and emission at 490 nm. To allow for background fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity of a blank PBS solution was subtracted from all readings. Results are the mean of triplicate samples. Atomic Force Microscopy—Representative samples were selected for AFM analysis at various time points as required. These samples were diluted in ultrapure (Milli-Q) water so as optimize the concentration of each sample prior to imaging. The best results were found with Aβ-(1–40) when the samples were diluted 300–600 times and with ABri when the samples were diluted 20 times; no dilution was required with the 0-h samples. Each sample was prepared for analysis by pipetting either 5 μl of the Aβ-(1–40) solution or 10 μl of the ABri solution onto a freshly cleaved mica-covered metal sample stub. This was placed into a Petri dish and allowed to dry in air prior to imaging. All of the AFM imaging was undertaken using a multimode AFM with a nanoscope IIIa controller in tapping mode in air with Si3N4 high spring constant cantilevers (TESP, Veeco, Cambridge, UK). A high resolution scanner (E-type scanner, Veeco) was used to allow the best possible resolution of deposits at early experiment times. Five randomly chosen areas were imaged on each sample, and the subsequent images then were carefully analyzed for ultrastructural differences. Curve-fitting Procedure—The best-fit curves to the sigmoidal experimental aggregation data were obtained from the kinetic equation for a seeded growth process. Integration of this rate equation yields the standard solution, [N]=[M]o+[N]o1+([M]o/[N]o)e−k1([M]o+[N]o)t(Eq. 1) where [M] and [N] represent the instantaneous concentrations of monomeric peptide and nucleated seeds, respectively, and [M]o and [N]o represent their initial at concentrations the commencement of incubation. The best-fit curves were obtained by optimizing these concentrations and the rate constant (k1) for the reaction process at different times (t). (For a more detailed description of the seeded process see, for example, Ref. 20Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 387-407Crossref Scopus (1417) Google Scholar.) The same kinetic equation was used to obtain the best-fit curves for the relative hydrogen peroxide concentration. Hydrogen peroxide decay was modeled assuming catalytic decomposition induced by redox-active transition metal ions present in the solutions. The curves showing the “burst” of hydrogen peroxide production were obtained by differentiation of the above relative concentration curves (assuming no decay). Correlation of Aggregation and Hydrogen Peroxide Formation for Aβ-(1–40)—Aβ-(1–40) was incubated (at 100 μm) in PBS for periods of up to 80 h. We focused most of our ESR measurements on the first few hours of incubation because preliminary experiments, together with our own previously published results (13Turnbull S. Tabner B.J. El-Agnaf O.M.A. Moore S. Davies Y. Allsop D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Tabner B.J. Turnbull S. El-Agnaf O.M.A. Allsop D. Free Radic.

Agents. 2003; 3: 299-308Crossref Google Scholar), indicated that the DMPO-OH spectrum was usually observable after ∼1h. Aggregation was monitored by immunoassay (Fig. 1, A and B, curve a) and thioflavin T methods (Fig. 1D) and showed the typical sigmoidal profile observed previously with Aβ and other amyloids (20Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 387-407Crossref Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 21Yoshiike Y. Tanemura K. Murayama O. Akagi T. Murayama M. Sato S. Sun X. Tanaka N. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32293-32299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), reaching a plateau after 48–72 h. The early time lag in these profiles reflects the kinetic nature of the nucleation process and the sensitivity of the assay techniques. Later the curve rises rapidly with the formation of elongating fibrils before eventually reaching a plateau as more mature fibrils are formed and as the supply of monomeric species becomes exhausted. The time course for hydrogen peroxide formation was monitored by ESR spectroscopy (Fig. 1, A and B, curve b) and, again, showed three characteristic phases in DMPO-OH spectral intensity, i.e. a brief time lag before a spectrum was observed, followed by a rapid growth in spectral intensity (which for our samples reached a maximum after 2–3 h) and then a subsequent decay. A comparison of the two profiles (compare curves a and b in Fig. 1, A and B) shows them to be in complete contrast and that the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, A and B, curve c) occurs very early during the aggregation process and precedes the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. Alongside our ESR measurements, samples of the incubated peptide were also examined at selected time points by AFM to obtain more detailed information on the nature of the fibrils present. Initially, Aβ-(1–40) (100 μm) was completely soluble in PBS, and no distinct AFM images were observed. However, further analysis at periods of significant hydrogen peroxide production (see Fig. 2B for appearance after 90 min) revealed the presence of small “protofibrils,” which were often slightly curved and measured 80–120 nm in length, similar to those described by Walsh et al. (22Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Samples examined after much longer incubation periods (see Fig. 2C for appearance after 80 h) clearly showed a change in morphology with thicker, intertwined, mature amyloid fibrils of varying lengths. To examine the ability of fully formed amyloid fibrils to generate hydrogen peroxide, the Aβ-(1–40) peptide was incubated under the same conditions as before for a period of 72 h. The characteristic DMPO-OH spectrum was again detected in samples removed after 1 and 2 h, and mature amyloid fibrils were observed by electron microscopy (EM) and AFM at the end of this incubation period (data not shown). The fibrils were washed by repeated centrifugation followed by re-suspension of the pellet, and a sample of fibrillar peptide was incubated for up to 72 h at 37 °C in PBS at 100 μm. No DMPO-OH spectrum was obtained from samples removed during this incubation period and tested using our standard ESR protocol. Correlation of Aggregation and Hydrogen Peroxide Formation for ABri—Both the oxidized and reduced forms of ABri and of the shorter WT peptide were incubated (at 100 μm) in PBS as described above. ESR spectra were only obtained from the oxidized form of ABri with an intact intramolecular disulfide bond (for typical spectra see Fig. 3). No spectra were observed with the other three related peptide treatments even after prolonged incubation over a 48-h period. As for Aβ (13Turnbull S. Tabner B.J. El-Agnaf O.M.A. Moore S. Davies Y. Allsop D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the formation of the DMPO-OH spectrum from the oxidized form of ABri was blocked by catalase or DETAPAC, showing that hydrogen peroxide is formed by a metal-dependent mechanism. With this peptide, detailed ESR measurements were undertaken over a 2-h period because preliminary experiments employing this peptide indicated that this was the period during which the DMPO-OH ESR spectrum was observable. The time course for hydrogen peroxide formation and decay again followed the characteristic three phases noted above. In this case, however, the production and decay of the DMPO-OH spectrum was far more rapid than that observed during the aggregation of Aβ-(1–40) (see Fig. 1C) with the ESR spectrum no longer observable after 2 h of incubation. AFM images were again obtained at selected time points to gain more detailed information on the nature of the aggregates present after various incubation periods (see Fig. 2, D–F). After 30 min, corresponding to relatively high hydrogen peroxide levels, only small, roughly spherical forms (some of which were aggregated into short chains (120–170 nm in length)) were present (Fig. 2E). After longer incubation periods (90 min, see Fig. 2F), when hydrogen peroxide levels declined, large amorphous “clumps” of aggregates were seen with no evidence of protein fibrils. The thioflavin T binding assay was used to investigate if these aggregates contain the characteristic β-pleated sheet structure of amyloid. As shown in Fig. 1D, the aggregates formed by ABri in PBS (pH 7.4) did not bind to thioflavin T. This was found to be the case even after a prolonged incubation period of up to 720 h (see Fig. 1D). The major objective of these investigations was to obtain information on how the self-generation of hydrogen peroxide during incubation of both Aβ-(1–40) and ABri relates to the extent of peptide aggregation. Fig. 1, A and B (curve c), clearly shows that for Aβ-(1–40) the time period over which the generation of hydrogen peroxide occurs corresponds to a period when the AFM images (Fig. 2B) indicate the presence of structures closely resembling previously described protofibrils (22Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The failure to detect a DMPO-OH spectrum during the incubation of mature Aβ-(1–40) amyloid fibrils and the reduced levels of hydrogen peroxide observed during the later stages of amyloid fibril growth both strongly support the concept that hydrogen peroxide generation is an early event. Our results, therefore, show that hydrogen peroxide is not generated continuously throughout the aggregation of Aβ-(1–40) but as a short “burst” comparatively early on during the peptide incubation period when mature amyloid fibrils are not present. Numerous previous studies have shown that Aβ that has been allowed to aggregate at concentrations similar to those employed here followed by addition to cultured cells at low micromolar concentrations is toxic. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear, but the addition of Aβ to cells causes calcium ion influx, oxidative free radical damage, and apoptosis, and it has been reported that toxicity can be inhibited by catalase, free radical scavengers, or antioxidants (see Ref. 23Atwood C.S. Obrenovicha M.E. Liua T. Chana H. Perry G. Smith M.A. Martins R.N. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 43: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar for review). This is consistent with exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide or other ROS. There is still no clear consensus on the precise nature of the toxic form of Aβ, but attention has focused recently on early protein assemblies (protofibrils, soluble oligomers, Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), or globular neurotoxins) as the potential culprit (22Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

In accord with this, our data suggest that Aβ toxicity could be because of the generation of hydrogen peroxide by an early form of protein aggregate. However, it is also possible that hydrogen peroxide is generated as a “by-product” of the early stages of the aggregation process itself. The latter would be compatible with a recent report closely relating Aβ toxicity to protein aggregation (29Wogulis M. Wright S. Cunningham D. Chilcote T. Powell K. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The formation of hydrogen peroxide during early aggregation could be due, at least in part, to the formation of dityrosine cross-links (30Barnham K.J. Haeffner F. Ciccotosto G.D. Curtain C.C. Tew D. Mavros C. Beyreuther K. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Cappai R. Bush A.I. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The relevance of the data on Aβ toxicity to neurodegeneration in vivo in AD is uncertain. However, there is now substantial evidence indicating that oxidative damage to the brain is one of the earliest pathological events in AD (23Atwood C.S. Obrenovicha M.E. Liua T. Chana H. Perry G. Smith M.A. Martins R.N. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 43: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our results raise the intriguing possibility that this could be because of the generation of hydrogen peroxide during the early stages of Aβ oligomerization before the formation of substantial numbers of “mature” senile plaques. In the presence of redox-active metal ions, hydrogen peroxide is readily converted via the Fenton reaction into the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, which could be responsible for much of this early oxidative damage. Because oxidative stress can increase the neuronal production of Aβ (23Atwood C.S. Obrenovicha M.E. Liua T. Chana H. Perry G. Smith M.A. Martins R.N. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 43: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), the presence of hydrogen peroxide (and the hydroxyl radical) could set up a potentially catastrophic positive feedback mechanism whereby Aβ oligomers stimulate their own production. The amount of hydrogen peroxide generated by Aβ can be considerably enhanced by co-incubation with a reducing substrate (31Opazo C. Huang X. Cherny R.A. Moir R.D. Roher A.E. White A.R. Cappai R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7377-7387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). If this substrate is cholesterol, the resulting oxidation product is 7β-hydroxycholesterol, which is neurotoxic at nanomolar concentrations and so could also contribute to oxidative brain damage (33Nelson T.J. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7377-7387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The average concentrations of “soluble” and “insoluble” Aβ in the brain in AD have been reported to be around 75 nm and 5 μm, respectively (34McLean C.A. Cherny R.A. Fraser F.W. Fuller S.J. Smith M.J. Beyreuther K. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The focal concentrations of Aβ in the vicinity of the “primitive” senile plaques would be expected to be considerably greater than this. Aβ is capable of generating equimolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (7Huang X.D. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Because submicromolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can kill cells over long exposure times (35Antunes F. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the quantities of ROS formed during Aβ aggregation could be sufficient to induce neurodegenerative changes in the brain over the extended time periods involved in the development and progression of AD. Recently, it has been reported that very low concentrations (1–2 nm) of cell-derived soluble oligomers of Aβ can inhibit long term potentiation and disrupt learned behavior in rats (36Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar, 37Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M. Hofmeister J.J. Shankar G.M. Kuskowski M.A. Selkoe D.J. Ashe K.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). However, these conditions have not been shown to lead, ultimately, to neuronal cell death, and so the relevance of our observations to these reports is not clear. However, we note that hydrogen peroxide can affect synaptic plasticity by acting as a diffusible signaling molecule (38Kamsler A. Segal M. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have also discovered that hydrogen peroxide is generated by the oxidized form of ABri but not by the reduced form of this peptide or by the corresponding WT peptide. This finding correlates well with the toxicity of these peptides to neuronal cells. Recent studies with the same batches of ABri and WT peptides as those used here have shown that only the oxidized form of ABri is toxic to cells with the WT peptide and the reduced form of ABri being non-toxic (11El-Agnaf O.M.A. Sheridan J.M.

Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our experiments with other amyloidogenic proteins and peptides, including Aβ, α-synuclein, and various forms of the prion protein (PrP), have also demonstrated a good correlation between the generation of hydrogen peroxide and cytotoxicity (13Turnbull S.

Agents. 2003; 3: 299-308Crossref Google Scholar). Previous studies on the oxidized form of ABri have indicated that it is more toxic during the early stages of aggregation when soluble oligomers are present than after prolonged incubation periods (11El-Agnaf O.M.A. Sheridan J.M. Sidera C. Siligardi G. Hussain R. Haris P.I. Austen B.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3449-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12El-Agnaf O.M.A. Nagala S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results showing that only small oligomers of ABri are present during the active phase of hydrogen peroxide formation are in accord with this. The ultrastructural appearance of the ABri oligomers detected by AFM (Fig. 2E) is very similar to that observed previously by EM (12El-Agnaf O.M.A. Nagala S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After prolonged incubation in PBS, we found that ABri formed large, irregularly shaped clumps (Fig. 2F) that did not bind to thioflavin T, indicating a lack of β-pleated sheet fibrillar structure. This agrees with previous reports that, at neutral pH, ABri does not aggregate into typical amyloid fibrils but instead forms amorphous aggregates with reduced thioflavin T binding properties (39Srinivasan R. Jones E.M. Liu K. Ghiso J. Marchant R.E. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1003-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and a lack of Congo red birefringence (12El-Agnaf O.M.A. Nagala S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Again, the AFM appearance of the aggregates seen here is very similar to that reported previously using EM (compare Fig. 2F with Fig. 8c in the paper by El-Agnaf et al. (12El-Agnaf O.M.A. Nagala S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). The fact that hydrogen peroxide was still formed from ABri oligomers under these conditions emphasizes the fact that hydrogen peroxide formation does not appear to be associated with the presence of mature amyloid fibrils. Finally, we stress that many of the features discussed above may not be unique to AD and FBD but could well have relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation. We thank Professor John Bevington for helpful discussions relating to the kinetics of the seeded aggregation process."

Fibrosis is a major and serious complication of Crohn's disease, an incurable, chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Fibrosis results from an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of collagen and other extracellular matrix components, ultimately leading to increased net matrix accumulation within the bowel wall. Fibrosis is thought to be an overactive, irreversible wound-healing response to chronic inflammation (1Zimmermann E. Lund P.K. Sartor R.B. Sandborn W.J. Kirsner's Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Sixth Ed. Elsevier Inc., New York2004: 219-229Google Scholar) and can lead to the serious complications of stricture, bowel narrowing and/or obstruction. In the normal intestine, subepithelial myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts in the submucosa, intermuscle connective tissue of the muscularis propria, and serosa are the primary sites of collagen mRNA and protein expression (2Pucilowska J.B.

The role of TNFα in inflammation-induced fibrosis appears complex because available evidence suggests that TNFα regulates collagen synthesis in a tissue-specific manner. In hepatic stellate cells during liver injury, several studies indicate anti-fibrogenic actions of TNFα via inhibition of collagen α1(I) gene expression (9Hernandez I. de la Torre P. Rey-Campos J.

Mice deficient in either the 55-(TNFR1) or 75-kDa (TNFR2) TNF receptor show reduced experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis (13Ortiz L.A. Lasky J. Gozal E. Ruiz V. Lungarella G. Cavarra E. Brody A.R. Friedman M. Pardo A. Selman M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or renal fibrosis (14Guo G. Morrissey J. McCracken R. Tolley T. Liapis H. Klahr S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F777-F785PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced pulmonary fibrosis in TNF receptor null mice occurred despite similar increases in type I collagen gene expression as wild-type mice, but was accompanied by attenuated induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA (13Ortiz L.A. Lasky J. Gozal E. Ruiz V. Lungarella G. Cavarra E. Brody A.R. Friedman M. Pardo A. Selman M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that cleave various components of the extracellular matrix and therefore reduces collagen degradation. These findings in TNFR null mice suggest that TNFα normally plays a role in up-regulation of TIMP-1 during lung injury and may promote fibrosis by inhibiting collagen degradation. However, one complication in these in vivo studies is that direct effects of TNF receptor knock-out on fibrosis could not be separated from effects on inflammation and the receptor mediating TNFα action on fibrosis was not defined. tumor necrosis factor α tumor necrosis factor receptor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases matrix metalloproteinase insulin-like growth factor signal transducers and activators of transcription extracellular signal-regulated kinase wild-type green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Little is known about the role of TNFα in inflammation-induced intestinal fibrosis. Given the key role of TNFα as a mediator of Crohn's disease as evidenced by the therapeutic benefits of TNFα inhibitors, and the fact that fibrosis is a common and serious problem in Crohn's disease, defining the role of TNFα in inflammation-induced intestinal fibrosis is of considerable clinical significance. Because it is difficult to distinguish direct effects of TNFα on intestinal fibrosis in vivo from those secondary to effects on inflammation, this study utilized cultured intestinal myofibroblasts, cells believed to be major cellular mediators of fibrosis, to determine TNFα action and its mechanism of action on collagen accumulation and proliferation. Although TNFR1 is regarded as the primary signaling receptor for systemic TNFα inflammatory responses (15Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lotscher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Kontgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R.

Grell M. Wajant H. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18107-18112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence for distinct roles of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in intestinal inflammation has recently started to emerge. In patients with Crohn's disease, lamina propria T cells show increased levels of TNFR2 and not TNFR1 (18Holtmann M.H. Douni E. Schutz M. Zeller G. Mudter J. Lehr H.A. Gerspach J. Scheurich P. Galle P.R. Kollias G. Neurath M.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3142-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). TNFR2 expression is increased in colonic epithelial cells in human inflammatory bowel disease and in mouse models of colitis (19Mizoguchi E. Mizoguchi A. Takedatsu H. Cario E. de Jong Y.P. Ooi C.J.

SCID mice reconstituted with T cells overexpressing TNFR2 show enhanced and accelerated development of colitis (18Holtmann M.H. Douni E. Schutz M. Zeller G. Mudter J. Lehr H.A. Gerspach J.

Although these data indicate a role of TNFR2 in intestinal inflammation, the roles of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in intestinal fibrosis are not well defined. This study utilized cultured intestinal myofibroblasts isolated from TNFR1–/–, TNFR2–/–, and TNFR1/2–/– mice to determine which TNF receptor mediates pro-fibrogenic actions of TNFα. Considerable evidence points to a role of IGF-I as a mediator of fibrosis in the intestine. Increased local expression of IGF-I mRNA occurs in all layers of inflamed or fibrotic intestine of Crohn's disease patients but not in healthy portions of intestine from the same patients (2Pucilowska J.B.

Together, these data indicate that locally expressed, mesenchymal cell-derived IGF-I contributes to inflammation-induced intestinal fibrosis. However, the possibility that IGF-I interacts with TNFα to regulate collagen synthesis or proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts has not been previously tested. This study utilized intestinal myofibroblasts isolated as a simple system to define whether TNFα affects collagen synthesis and proliferation and if there are interactions between TNFα and IGF-I. We provide novel evidence that TNFα increases collagen accumulation and has mitogenic effects in intestinal myofibroblasts and that these effects are mediated via the TNFR2. We also show that TNFα has additive effects with IGF-I on collagen accumulation and proliferation and that TNFR2 is essential for these responses. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of mitogenic and fibrogenic actions in TNFR2–/– cells are associated with altered ERK1/2 and STAT3 activation, respectively. Materials—Mouse recombinant TNFα was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and recombinant human IGF-I from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for procollagen α1(I) was purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA); rabbit polyclonal antibody to actin from Sigma; peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to an infrared dye (IR Dye 800 Conjugated Anti-rabbit IgG) from Rockland; [3H]thymidine and [32P]UTP from Amersham Biosciences; and STAT3 consensus gel shift oligonucleotides from Santa Cruz. Mice—Wild-type (WT), TNFR1–/– (TNFR1a), and TNFR2–/– (TNFR1b) mice on the inbred C57BL/6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). WT and mice deficient in both TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling (TNFR1/2–/–; TNFR1a/b) on the mixed C57BL/6/129S background were also purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. No differences were noted between wild-type cells of the pure C57BL/6 background and the mixed C57BL/6/129S backgrounds in any of the experiments, and therefore data from both wild-type strains were pooled. Mice on the inbred C57BL/6 background expressing a transgene comprising the basal promoter of the murine procollagen α1(I) collagen gene (–3122 to +111 relative to the transcription start site) and two upstream DNase-sensitive sites that appear to be important for maximal cell-specific expression linked to the GFP transgene were derived as previously described (30Krempen K. Grotkopp D. Hall K. Bache A. Gillan A. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Breindl M. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 151-163PubMed Google Scholar). Separate cell lines were isolated from three mice of each genotype for use in subsequent studies. Isolation of Intestinal Myofibroblasts—Intestinal myofibroblasts from adult (40–50-day-old) WT, TNFR1–/–, TNFR2–/–, TNFR1/2–/–, and collagen-GFP transgenic mice were isolated and cultured as described previously (31Fruchtman S. Simmons J.G. Michaylira C.Z. Miller M.E. Greenhalgh C.J. Ney D.M. Lund P.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2005; 289: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Myofibroblast phenotype was confirmed based on positive expression for vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin as evaluated by Western immunoblot (32Simmons J.G. Pucilowska J.B. Keku T.O. Lund P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G809-G818PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Tol E.A. Holt L. Li F.L. Kong F.M. Rippe R. Yamauchi M. Pucilowska J. Lund P.K. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G245-G255PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were studied at passages 3–8. Verification of TNF receptor knock-out was determined by Western immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-rabbit TNFR1 or TNFR2 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and compared with WT cells that express both TNF receptors (data not shown). Assays of Cell Proliferation—Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was used as a measure of cell proliferation by IGF-I (10 ng/ml) and TNFα (5 ng/ml) alone or in combination. Serum-deprived cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) and peptide for 18 h. After incubation, medium was aspirated, cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Total cell extracts were collected in 0.2 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity incorporated into DNA was quantified by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated in at least three separate experiments. Western Immunoblot for Procollagen α1(I)—Serum-deprived intestinal myofibroblasts were treated with 5 ng/ml TNFα or 10 ng/ml IGF-I alone or in combination for 48 h. Doses were determined as maximal in separate dose-response experiments (data not shown). Cells were solubilized in Laemmli's 2× SDS sample buffer and whole cell lysates were analyzed for procollagen α1(I) protein abundance and actin (loading control) as previously described (32Simmons J.G. Pucilowska J.B. Keku T.O. Lund P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G809-G818PubMed Google Scholar). In-cell Western for Collagen for Procollagen α1(I)—An in-cell Western method was also utilized in these studies to monitor for procollagen α1(I) accumulation in a subset of experiments. This method provides a highly sensitive and rapid system to assay collagen accumulation and was validated as providing comparable data to Western immunoblots in WT cells. Intestinal myofibroblasts isolated from ileum of WT, TNFR1–/–, TNFR2–/–, and TNFR1/2–/– mice were plated in an equal number in a 24-well culture plate. Serum-deprived cells were treated with IGF-I (10 ng/ml) and TNFα (5 ng/ml) alone or in combination for 48 h. Culture medium was removed by aspiration and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked in 0.1% casein and 0.2× PBS solution. Cells were incubated with a procollagen α1(I) primary antibody, washed with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to an infrared dye (IR dye 800 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG). Plates were scanned to visualize signal using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) in the 800-nm fluorescent channel. Signal was quantified using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System Application Software version 1.2 (Li-Cor Biosciences). Plates were reprobed for β-tubulin protein and signal was visualized in the 680-nm fluorescent channel to verify equal cell number across wells. Collagen Gene Transcription Monitored by Activation of a Procollagen α1(I) Promoter-GFP Reporter Gene—Myofibroblasts isolated from mice expressing the collagen-GFP transgene were treated with increasing doses of IGF-I and TNFα alone or in combination for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were collected in GFP protein buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). 500 μg of protein was assayed for GFP fluorescence using the SPEX Fluorolog-3 Research T-format Spectrofluorometer at excitation of 488 nm and emission of 510 nm. GFP fluorescent units were normalized to total protein assayed as a measure of procollagen α1(I) gene activation. Total RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Hybridization Assays—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot hybridization was performed as previously described (34Ohneda K. Ulshen M.H. Fuller C.R. D'Ercole A.J. Lund P.K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A TIMP-1 probe was generated by PCR using primers (sense: 5′-CCACGAATCAACGAGACC-3′ and antisense: 5′-CCAAGTGCACAAGCCTAG-3′) with the addition of a T7 RNA polymerase site 5′ to the antisense primer. The PCR product was used as a complementary DNA template to generate a [32P]UTP-labeled probe using T7 RNA polymerase. To account for minor variations in RNA loading across samples, blots were reprobed for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA using an antisense RNA probe prepared from a commercially available DNA template (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Blots were scanned on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences Storm 840) and abundance of specific RNAs was quantified using ImageQuant software for Macintosh. The abundance of TIMP-1 mRNA was normalized to the abundance of GAPDH mRNA in each sample. Assays of Collagen Synthesis and Degradation—Collagen synthesis and degradation using radioactive proline was performed as previously described with some modifications (35Peterkofsky B. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 33-38Google Scholar). Intestinal myofibroblasts were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1 mm β-aminopripionitrile and fresh 10 mm ascorbate to stimulate collagen expression. Cells were then pulsed with 100 μCi/ml [5-3H]proline for 24 h during which [5-3H]proline was incorporated into synthesized protein. The media containing the [5-3H]proline was removed, cells were rinsed with 1× PBS and incubated with serum-free media containing cold 10 mm proline for 24 h during which [5-3H]proline incorporated into protein was released as these proteins are degraded. Cells were treated with TNFα at the start of the pulse and the start of the chase and compared with no treatment control cells to determine TNFα effects on collagen synthesis and degradation. Collections were obtained at 3, 8, and 24 after the start of the pulse and 1, 3, and 24 h after the start of the chase. After the desired incubation period, the media was collected and cells were lysed in 0.11 m NaCl and 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was added to the media collected. Cell pellets were resuspended with 0.4 m NaCl and 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.2). Proteins in the cell lysates and media collections were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was dissolved in 0.2 m NaOH and aliquotted into two tubes. One tube was treated with 15 μg/ml purified Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (Advance Biofactures, Lynbrook, NY) at 37 °C for 2 h, whereas the other tube was untreated. The collagenase specifically degrades collagen protein, thereby releasing [3H]proline incorporated into collagen protein only. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. Radioactivity in the supernatant fraction was measured by scintillation counting. To determine radioactivity incorporated in collagen, the radioactivity in the untreated aliquot was subtracted from radioactivity in the aliquot treated with the collagenase. Assays were performed in duplicate. Gelatin Zymography—A gelatinase zymography that quantitates activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was used as an indirect measure of TIMP-1 activity because TIMP-1 is known to inhibit these enzymes in other systems. Conditioned media of myofibroblasts treated with or without TNFα for 16 h was collected, concentrated 4 times, and mixed with the same volume of Laemmli's 2× SDS sample buffer without reducing agent. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and subject to SDS-PAGE on 8.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Gels were soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm ZnCl2 (pH 7.5) for 16 h at 37 °C, and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250. Intensity of gelantinolytic bands was quantified using NIH Image software (version 1.61). ERK1/2 Activation and Role in TNFα-induced Intestinal Myofibroblast Proliferation—Western immunoblot assays were used to monitor activation of ERK1/2. Serum-deprived cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TNFα for 30, 60, and 180 min. Because maximal activation of ERK1/2 occurred after 30 min of treatment, subsequent experiments were performed at this time point. EGF treatment (10 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. An ERK1/2-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), was used to determine whether TNFα-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of WT and TNFR1–/– myofibroblasts was dependent on ERK1/2 signaling. Serum-deprived cells were treated with various concentrations of PD98059 for 30 min and subsequently treated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 18 h. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was assayed as described above. NFκB and AP-1 Activation—Adenovirus based NFκB-luciferase and AP-1-luciferase reporter constructs were used to monitor NFκB (Ad.NFκBLuc) and AP-1 (Ad.AP-1Luc) activation, two major pathways linked to TNFα action and potentially to fibrogenic actions of TNFα. Both Ad.NFκBLuc (constructed by John F. Engelhardt, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and Ad.AP-1Luc (constructed by Drs. Paul B. McCray and Hong Peng Jia, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) were generous gifts of Dr. Scott H. Randell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The Ad.NFκBLuc adenoviral construct contains the firefly luciferase gene driven by four tandem copies of the NFκB consensus sequence linked to a TATA-like promoter from the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene (36Wu Q.

https://openalex.org/W2082761467,"Human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond between a DNA 3′ end and a tyrosyl moiety. In eukaryotic cells, this type of linkage is found in stalled topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, and Tdp1 has been implicated in the repair of such complexes in vivo. We confirm here that the Tdp1 catalytic cycle involves a covalent reaction intermediate in which a histidine residue is connected to a DNA 3′-phosphate through a phosphoamide linkage. Most surprisingly, this linkage can be hydrolyzed by Tdp1, and unlike a topoisomerase I-DNA complex, which requires modification to be an efficient substrate for Tdp1, the native form of Tdp1 can be removed from the DNA. The spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy neurodegenerative disease is caused by the H493R mutant form of Tdp1, which shows reduced enzymatic activity and accumulates the Tdp1-DNA covalent intermediate. The ability of wild type Tdp1 to remove the stalled mutant protein from the DNA likely explains the recessive nature of spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy. In addition to its activity on phosphotyrosine and phosphohistidine substrates, Tdp1 also possesses a limited DNA and RNA 3′-exonuclease activity in which a single nucleoside is removed from the 3′-hydroxyl end of the substrate. Furthermore, Tdp1 also removes a 3′ abasic site and an artificial 3′-biotin adduct from the DNA. In combination with earlier data showing that Tdp1 can use 3′-phosphoglycolate as a substrate, these data suggest that Tdp1 may function to remove a variety of 3′ adducts from DNA during DNA repair.

Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This type of linkage is typical of the covalent reaction intermediate produced when a type IB topoisomerase cleaves one strand of DNA. Type IB topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that perform essential functions in key cellular processes such as replication, recombination, and transcription (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 4Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

Chromosoma. 2005; 114: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Following cleavage and DNA relaxation, the topoisomerase normally religates the DNA strand and dissociates from the DNA (4Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). After cleavage near certain DNA lesions or modified nucleotides, or in the presence of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin, religation is blocked, and the topoisomerase becomes covalently trapped on the 3′ end of the cleaved DNA strand (7Porter S.E. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv.

At the time of the discovery of Tdp1, Yang et al. (1Yang S.W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At present, extensive genetic, biochemical, and cell biological data support the view that Tdp1 is involved in the repair of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent lesions in eukaryotic cells (11Barthelmes H.U.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Tdp1 is a member of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, which is characterized by two “HKD” motifs that provide the conserved active site residues (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The diverse members of this family fulfill a variety of functions on vastly different substrates, such as phospholipids, DNA, or in the case of Tdp1, DNA-protein complexes (17Interthal H.

Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on structural and biochemical data, the conserved PLD superfamily reaction mechanism has been proposed to consist of two consecutive SN2 substitutions. In the first step of the Tdp1 reaction, a histidine residue in the N-terminal HKD motif (His-263) is proposed to carry out a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom in the phosphodiester bond between the tyrosine residue and the DNA 3′-oxygen (see Fig. 2B) to become covalently bound to the 3′ end of the DNA via a phosphoamide bond to the N-ϵ2 atom of the nucleophilic His-263 (15Interthal H.

Biol. 2004; 338: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2C). Hydrolysis of this reaction intermediate is believed to be carried out by a water molecule that is activated by His-493 from the C-terminal HKD motif acting as a general base. Tdp1 catalysis produces free tyrosine and a DNA with a 3′-phosphate end.Recently, a mutation in the human TDP1 gene, resulting in a change of His-493 to arginine, has been shown to cause the heritable neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) (25Takashima H. Boerkoel C.F. John J. Saifi G.M. Salih M.A. Armstrong D. Mao Y. Quiocho F.A. Roa B.B. Nakagawa M. Stockton D.W. Lupski J.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Affected individuals who carry the mutation in both TDP1 alleles generally develop symptoms during their teenage years, whereas the heterozygous carriers remain symptom free. Most interestingly, the SCAN1 condition does not seem to be associated with increased cancer susceptibility. Contrary to earlier predictions that the mutant enzyme is inactive (12El-Khamisy S.F. Saifi G.M. Weinfeld M. Johansson F. Helleday T. Lupski J.R. Caldecott K.W. Nature. 2005; 434: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Takashima H. Boerkoel C.F. John J. Saifi G.M.

Lupski J.R. Valerie K. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the overall enzymatic activity of H493R is reduced only about 25-fold (15Interthal H. Chen H.J. Kehl-Fie T.E. Zotzmann J. Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). More importantly, this mutation causes an accumulation of the covalent Tdp1-DNA reaction intermediate, which we have shown decays with a half-life of 13 min in vitro (15Interthal H. Chen H.J. Kehl-Fie T.E. Zotzmann J. Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Ironically, the covalent Tdp1 H493R-DNA complex replaces the covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complex that the mutant form of Tdp1 attempts to repair. Because SCAN1 cells contain substantial amounts of mutant Tdp1 (12El-Khamisy S.F. Saifi G.M. Weinfeld M. Johansson F. Helleday T. Lupski J.R. Caldecott K.W. Nature. 2005; 434: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Interthal H. Chen H.J. Kehl-Fie T.E. Zotzmann J. Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that the SCAN1 phenotype may not be caused by a mere reduction of enzymatic function alone but also by the accumulation of Tdp1-DNA complexes. These persistent long lived Tdp1-DNA and topoisomerase I-DNA complexes could significantly impact transcription in the terminally differentiated nondividing neuronal cells that are primarily affected in SCAN1.Based on our current understanding of the H493R mutant Tdp1, one would predict that the mutant Tdp1-DNA complexes must also occur in heterozygous carriers. The fact that the SCAN1 mutation is completely recessive suggests that heterozygous, but not homozygous, individuals possess an enzymatic activity that is able to remove Tdp1 from the DNA. The most likely source of this activity is wt Tdp1 itself, and this possibility prompted us to test whether Tdp1 is able to act on the phosphoamide linkage that connects Tdp1 with the DNA in the covalent intermediate.Previous work has established that Tdp1 can hydrolyze a variety of groups that are covalently linked to the 3′ end of DNA. In addition to a single tyrosine moiety, Tdp1 can also remove short peptides containing a tyrosine (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Debethune L. Kohlhagen G. Grandas A. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, an intact topoisomerase I-DNA complex has proven to be a very poor substrate for yeast Tdp1 in vitro (27Debethune L. Kohlhagen G. Grandas A. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the stalled topoisomerase is proteolytically degraded or otherwise modified before Tdp1 action in vivo (1Yang S.W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Davies D.R. Interthal H. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Chem.

Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition to its cleavage activity on a 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage, Tdp1 has been shown to cleave the phosphodiester bond linking glycolate to the 3′ end of DNA (30Inamdar K.V. Pouliot J.J. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Rasouli-Nia A. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27162-27168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Such a 3′-phosphoglycolate adduct is formed when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation or the drug bleomycin or as a result of naturally occurring endogenous reactive oxygen species (31Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition to these naturally occurring substrates, several synthetic Tdp1 substrates have been identified such as the phosphotyrosine analogs, 3′-(4-nitro-phenyl) phosphate, (4-methyl-phenyl)-phosphate, and 4-methylumbelliferone, which proved helpful in dissecting the catalytic mechanism of Tdp1 (24Raymond A.C. Rideout M.C. Staker B. Hjerrild K. Burgin Jr., A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Rideout M.C. Raymond A.C. Burgin Jr., A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4657-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this study, we confirm chemically that the covalent Tdp1-DNA intermediate is indeed a phosphoamide linkage as had been proposed based on both structural and biochemical data (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Davies D.R. Interthal H. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Chem.

Chem. 2004; 47: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, Tdp1 is not only able to cleave a phosphoamide bond efficiently but is also able to remove an intact Tdp1 molecule from the DNA in vitro. Furthermore, we used several additional Tdp1 substrates to demonstrate novel Tdp1 activities in vitro. These results support the possibility that Tdp1 might have additional cellular functions besides its role in the repair of topoisomerase I-DNA lesions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Tdp1 Proteins—The expression plasmid for the N-terminally truncated H493R mutant form of human Tdp1(Δ(1-148) H493R) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pHN1894S Δ(1-148) that contains the TDP1 gene lacking the first 444 bp (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The generation of the expression plasmids for the other mutant alleles has been described previously (15Interthal H. Chen H.J. Kehl-Fie T.E. Zotzmann J. Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The N-terminally His-tagged recombinant Tdp1 proteins (wt, Δ(1-148), H493R, Δ(1-148) H493R, and H263A) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Preparation of Tdp1 Substrates—Substrate 20-TOPOpep, a 20-mer DNA oligonucleotide (5′-GTAGAGGATCTAAAAGACTT-3′) with a small trypsin-resistant human topoisomerase I-derived peptide covalently bound to the 3′ end via the active site tyrosine, was prepared as described previously (17Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, a duplex 30-mer topoisomerase I suicide substrate consisting of the cleavage strand HEI-9 (5′-GTAGAGGATCTAAAAGACTT*TGAAAAATTT, where * indicates a5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkage at the topoisomerase cleavage site (34Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Nash H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) and the complementary strand HEI-10 (5′-AAATTTTTCAAAGTCTTTTAGATCCTCTAC) was incubated with topo70 (a 70-kDa form of human topoisomerase I that is missing the nonessential N-terminal 174 amino acids) for 15 min at 37 °C to allow suicide cleavage and covalent binding of topo70 to the remaining 20-mer oligonucleotide (20-Topo). Subsequent trypsin treatment and gel purification resulted in a 20-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide with a predicted 7-amino acid topoisomerase I-derived peptide.Substrate 20-TDPpep was generated by incubating 0.05 pmol of 20-TOPOpep with 0.2 μg of Tdp1 H493R in Assay Buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for 2 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped with 0.5% SDS. Under these conditions more than 50% of the labeled DNA was trapped in the covalent complex with Tdp1 (see Fig. 2A, lane 2). The reactions were diluted 10-fold with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA), and trypsin was added to a final concentration of 1.5 μg/μl. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 1 μg/μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting 20-TDPpep was predicted to consist of an 11-amino acid Tdp1-derived peptide linked to the 3′ end of the 20-mer DNA.The sequences of the 20-mer single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides 20-Y and HEI-23 were identical to the oligonucleotide portion of 20-TOPOpep, but they ended with a 3′-tyrosyl moiety or a hydroxyl, respectively, in place of the peptide. The 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide HEI-22 was complementary to 20-Y. The 19-mer DNA oligonucleotide HEI-24 (5′-GTAGAGGATCTAAAAGACT-3′) was 3′-phosphorylated. The 29-mer RNA oligonucleotide Md9 has the following sequence 5′-ACCCCACCUGUAGGUUUGGCAAGCUAGCU-3′ and was annealed to the 48-mer DNA oligonucleotide D49Δ8 (5′-CTAGCTTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCCCCCCTTTTCTGGAGACTAA-3′) after 5′ end-labeling (35Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 20-mer DNA oligonucleotide HE-I-22 (5′-AAGTCTTTTAGATCCTCTAC-3′) has a biotin moiety connected by a 15-atom spacer on the 3′ end (BioTEG). The 3′-phosphorylated 20-mer oligonucleotide HEI-27 is identical in sequence to HEI-22. The 20-mer DNA oligonucleotide HEI-28 is identical in sequence to HEI-23 but contains an additional abasic site mimic (tetrahydrofuran) at the 3′ end.All DNA oligonucleotides except HEI-9 (Macromolecular Resources) and 20-Y (Midland) were synthesized by OPERON. All substrates were 32P 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (New England Biolabs). In addition, 3′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were 32P5′-end-labeled using a 3′-phosphatase minus PNK (MBI Fermentas).Phosphoamino Acid Lability Analyses—To create a suitable substrate to study the nature of the phosphoamino acid linkage between Tdp1 and the 3′ end of the DNA, oligonucleotides CL12N (5′-GAAAAAAGAGTT-3′) and CP25N (5′-TAAAAATTTTTCTAACTCTTTTTTC-3′) were annealed, and Klenow (3′-5′ exo-) (New England Biolabs) was used to generate a 14-mer topoisomerase I suicide substrate by fill-in in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and ddGTP (see Fig. 1A). 50 pmol of this substrate was incubated with 19 μg of topo70 in 200 μl of reaction buffer (150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmFIGURE 1Chemical characterization of the phosphoamino acid bond in the Tdp1-DNA covalent intermediate.

Part of this reaction was stopped with SDS (final concentration 1%) and used for a parallel analysis of the topoisomerase I-DNA linkage. The other part was digested with trypsin; the trypsin was inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the product was gel-purified to generate 12-TOPOpep. In this complex the phosphate that was involved in the phosphotyrosyl linkage between the DNA and the topoisomerase I peptide is radioactively labeled. To accumulate the covalent Tdp1-DNA reaction intermediate (12-Tdp1), 0.05 pmol of 12-TOPOpep was incubated with 0.2 μg of Tdp1 H493R in 25 μl of Assay Buffer at 37 °C for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. Again, the phosphate involved in the phosphoamino acid DNA linkage between Tdp1 and the DNA was radioactively labeled.For the phosphoamino acid lability experiment (36Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Eur. J.

At that time a 5-μl control sample was taken and boiled in SDS sample buffer for gel analysis (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue). To a series of 10-μl aliquots of the treated 12-Tdp1 were then added 2.5 μl each of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m HCl, 1 m NaOH, or 1 m hydroxylamine in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 4 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer were added to each reaction. To neutralize the acid- and base-treated samples, 2.5 μl of 1 m NaOH or 1 m HCl were added, respectively. To the reactions that were incubated in buffer alone or with hydroxylamine, 2.5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were added, respectively. Samples were boiled for 3 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and image retrieval was carried out using a PhosphorImager and Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). As a control, 12-Topo in which the DNA was linked to the protein via a phosphotyrosyl bond was treated identically.Tdp1 Activity on Phosphoamide Bond—A sample containing >50% 20-TDPpep (see “Preparation of Tdp1 Substrates” and Fig. 2A, lane 2) was incubated with 50 ng of wt or H263A Tdp1 in Assay Buffer (final volume 10 μl). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped with an equal volume of formamide loading dye (96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.03% xylene cyanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) and analyzed on a 15% sequencing gel. Image retrieval and quantitation were carried out as described above.Tdp1 Activity on Intact Topo70 or Tdp1 Covalently Bound to DNA—To generate the topo70-DNA covalent complex, 2.5 pmol of suicide substrate HEI-9/HEI-10 was incubated with 1 μg of topo70 in 20 μl of Assay Buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. One-third of the reaction was subsequently incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. To the second third of the reaction, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.07%. The last third of the reaction mixture was left untreated. To 0.2 pmol of each of these three substrates, 400 ng of wt Tdp1 or the H263A mutant Tdp1 was added in a total volume of 60 μl in Assay Buffer and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points (Fig. 3A), 15-μl samples were taken, and the reactions were stopped with SDS (0.5% final concentration). Samples were precipitated in 10 mm MgCl2 with 5 volumes of ethanol in the cold. The dry pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of 2 μg/μl of trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were mixed with 12 μl of formamide loading dye, and the reactions were analyzed on a 15% sequencing gel. For purposes of quantitation, the amount of product at each time point was determined as a percentage of the total radioactivity in the lane of the gel.FIGURE 3Tdp1 activity on topoisomerase I-DNA and Tdp1-DNA covalent complexes. A, Tdp1 activity assays on topo70-DNA covalent complexes that were either untreated (lanes 3-6), incubated at 65 °C for 10 min (lanes 7-10), or SDS-denatured (lanes 11-13) before Tdp1 addition. At the indicated times samples were taken, the reactions stopped with SDS, and trypsin digested before sequencing gel analysis. In lane 1, 20-TOPOpep was loaded as a size marker for the 20-mer DNA with a tryptic topoisomerase I peptide. Lane 2 contains the product of the reaction of wt Tdp1 on 20-TOPOpep, a 20-mer with a 3′-phosphate group (20-P).

To visualize the covalent Tdp1-DNA intermediate, a portion of the reaction was digested with trypsin before loading (lane 4). Wt (lane 2) or H263A (lane 3) Tdp1 was added to the substrate mixture shown in lane 1, and the reactions were analyzed on a sequencing gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To generate the Tdp1 covalent reaction intermediate, 0.05 pmol of 20-TOPOpep was incubated with 0.2 μg of Tdp1 H493R in 25 μl of Assay Buffer at 37 °C for 2 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS. Part of the reaction mixture was digested with trypsin as described above to determine the amount of H493R Tdp1 covalent intermediate (20-Tdp1) as reflected by 20-TDPpep in a sequencing gel analysis. 0.5 μl of the untreated reaction mixture was incubated with 50 ng of wt or H263 Tdp1 in Assay Buffer (total volume 10 μl), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before stopping with an equal volume of formamide loading dye. Sequencing gel analysis, image retrieval, and quantitation were carried out as described above.Fate of H493R-DNA Intermediate in the Presence of Various Forms of Tdp1—A 50-fold molar excess of either full-length H493R or the N-terminally truncated Δ(1-148) H493R (0.1 μm) was incubated with 20-TOPOpep (2 nm) for 2 min at 37 °C in Assay Buffer (final volume 25 μl) to allow for the accumulation of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. An equal volume of Assay Buffer containing the indicated form of Tdp1 was added (final concentration 0.25 μm). Parallel control incubations were carried out without added enzyme. At the indicated time points, samples were stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS.

https://openalex.org/W2171612194,"Satellite-based measurements of decadal-scale temperature change in the lower troposphere have indicated cooling relative to Earth's surface in the tropics. Such measurements need a diurnal correction to prevent drifts in the satellites' measurement time from causing spurious trends. We have derived a diurnal correction that, in the tropics, is of the opposite sign from that previously applied. When we use this correction in the calculation of lower tropospheric temperature from satellite microwave measurements, we find tropical warming consistent with that found at the surface and in our satellite-derived version of middle/upper tropospheric temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2081015231,"We previously identified loci in the mouse genome that substantially influence the metastatic efficiency of mammary tumors. Here, we present data supporting the idea that the signal transduction molecule, Sipa1, is a candidate for underlying the metastasis efficiency modifier locus Mtes1. Analysis of candidate genes identified a nonsynonymous amino acid polymorphism in Sipa1 that affects the Sipa1 Rap-GAP function. Spontaneous metastasis assays using cells ectopically expressing Sipa1 or cells with knocked-down Sipa1 expression showed that metastatic capacity was correlated with cellular Sipa1 levels. We examined human expression data and found that they were consistent with the idea that Sipa1 concentration has a role in metastasis. Taken together, these data suggest that the Sipa1 polymorphism is one of the genetic polymorphisms underlying the Mtes1 locus. This report is also the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a constitutional genetic polymorphism affecting tumor metastasis."

Mucin-type oligosaccharides (O-glycans) are involved in several important biological events including cell-to-cell communication in higher eukaryotes, bacterial adhesion to host cells, and so on (1Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J.D. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar).

This immunogenic structure is normally masked by further glycosylation such as sialylation (sialyl T antigen) and N-acetylglucosaminylation (Core 2 structure). However, it has been shown that T antigen is frequently exposed on the cell surface of carcinoma and T-cell lymphoma, and this unmasked form is thought to be involved in tumor cell adhesion and tissue invasion (2Springer G.F.

In addition, incomplete synthesis of the Core 1 structure associates with several autoimmune diseases including IgA nephropathy (4Novak J. Julian B.A. Tomana M. Mesteck J. J. Clin.

This enzyme also serves as a powerful tool for elucidating the presence of O-glycans in glycoproteins (7Gross V. Andus T. Castell J. Vom Berg D. Heinrich P.C. Gerok W.

All of the enzymes are secretory and high-molecular mass proteins (>110 kDa), and are able to release Galβ1,3GalNAc disaccharide from glycoproteins. A similar enzyme was found in the culture medium of Streptomyces sp., which is capable of releasing longer sugar chains than the disaccharide from porcine mucin (18Ishii-Karakasa I. Iwase H. Hotta K.

Brassart D. Neeser J.R. Servin A.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found that bifidobacteria widely have an endo-α-GalNAcase specific for Core 1 mucin-type O-glycans. Despite its significance and usefulness for research on O-linked oligosaccharides and several related pathogens, no genetic information is available yet. Therefore, we performed molecular cloning of the endo-α-GalNAcase of Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217 and characterized the properties of the recombinant enzyme. This is the first report describing isolation of the gene for this enzyme from any organisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP and GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP were kindly provided by Drs. Murata and Usui, Shizuoka University, and Dr. Kitaoka, National Food Research Institute, respectively. Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα1pNP was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. GalNAcα1pNP, calf fetuin, and calf asialofetuin were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available from commercial sources.Bacterial Strains—The bifidobacterial strains used in this study were: B. longum JCM 1217 and JCM 7054, B. bifidum JCM 7004, JCM 1254, and ATCC 29521, B. breve JCM 1192, B. infantis JCM 1222, and B. pseudolongum JCM 1205.Partial Purification and Molecular Mass Determination of Endo-α-GalNAcase from B. longum JCM 1217—The bacterium was grown in 2 liters of GAM broth (Nissui Pharmaceutical) for 4 days at 37 °C under anaerobic and static conditions. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in a final volume of 15 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.0), and were sonicated subsequently using a Branson Sonifier 250 (Branson Ultrasonic Corp.). The extract was applied on a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (8 × 100 mm; Tosoh) equilibrated with 1 m ammonium sulfate in 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0), followed by elution with a linear gradient of 1–0 m ammonium sulfate in 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0). The enzyme was eluted at the concentration of 0.6 m ammonium sulfate. The active fractions were combined, desalted using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (Millipore), and then applied to a UNO-Q1 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), followed by elution with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The enzyme was eluted at the concentration of 0.2 m NaCl. The fractions were then desalted and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter.The molecular mass of the partially purified enzyme was determined by size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in advance with 0.15 m NaCl in 50 mm KPB (pH 7.0). Molecular mass standards used for calibration were: β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) from Sigma. All fractions were assayed, and the active fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE, according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—The putative endo-α-GalNAcase gene was amplified by high-fidelity PCR using the genomic DNA of B. longum JCM 1217 as a template and a primer pair (forward primer, 5′-TTAACCTCCATGGGCAGCGGGGGAGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AACCTGCGGCCGCCAGTTGCTCGCGATTGC-3′). The primers were designed based on nucleotide numbers 58–74 and 5882–5898 of BL0464 of B. longum NCC2705 for the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and contained NcoI and NotI sites (underlined) at the N and C termini, respectively, to facilitate plasmid construction. The amplified gene (hereafter referred to as engBF; encoding amino acid residues 20–1966 eliminating the signal peptide) was digested with NcoI and NotI, and was inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-23d(+) (Novagen) to generate a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. The resulting plasmid, pET23d-engBF, was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3), and the cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml) at 37 °C. After A600 reached 0.4, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at the final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce the protein expression. Following additional incubation for 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen), and the soluble fraction obtained was applied on a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Isolation and Sequencing of the Endo-α-GalNAcase Gene—The gene encoding amino acid residues 20–1966 of engBF was amplified as described above, and was directly used for sequencing. The flanking upstream DNA segment was isolated by a standard colony hybridization method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1983; Google Scholar). The downstream region was amplified by high-fidelity PCR using the genomic DNA of B. longum JCM 1217 as a template and a primer pair (5′-TCAACGGCGATTCCTGG-3′, 1686-bp upstream of the stop codon; and 5′-TGCGATTCATCGCCTAGCAG-3′, 150-bp downstream of the stop codon). The primers were designed based on the sequence of BL0464 of B. longum NCC2705. The DNA sequence was determined for both strands by the use of the ABI Prism 310 DNA sequencer with a BigDye terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems).Assay of Endo-α-GalNAcase Activity—The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme was assayed using Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as a substrate. The standard reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 40 μl, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.25 mm substrate, and the enzyme. After incubation for an appropriate time at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 60 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and the released p-nitrophenol (pNP) was measured by the absorbance at 400 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of pNP/min. The substrate specificity was determined using various pNP glycosides and natural glycoproteins.Transglycosylation of Endo-α-GalNAcase—The transglycosylation reactions were performed according to the procedures of Ashida et al. (36Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 330: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for 1-alkanols as acceptors and Ashida et al. (17Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Murata T. Usui T. Kumagai H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) for monoor disaccharides as acceptors.Other Assays—The pH dependence of enzyme activity was determined in pH range 2.0–9.0 using the following buffers (50 mm): glycine-HCl (2.0–4.0), sodium acetate (3.5–6.0), sodium phosphate (5.5–8.0), and Tris-HCl (7.0–9.0). Effect of temperature on the enzyme was examined using 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 20–80 °C.Analytical Methods—The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC and/or TLC. For TLC analysis, a Silica Gel 60 aluminum sheet (Merck) was developed in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water, 3/3/1 (v/v/v), and the sugars were visualized by spraying diphenylamine/aniline/phosphate reagent (23Bailey R.W. Bourne E.J. J. Chromatogr. 1960; 4: 206-213Crossref Google Scholar). HPLC was carried out using a Hitachi D-7500 chromatograph system equipped with a L-7420 UV-visual detector. Oligosaccharides were fractionated using the TSKgel Amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh) under a constant flow (1.0 ml/min) of 75% acetonitrile at 40 °C, and elution was monitored to the absorbance of the N-acetyl group at 214 nm.Stereochemistry of the Hydrolysis of pNP Substrate by Endo-α-GalNAcase—1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-AL300 spectrometer as described previously (24Katayama T. Sakuma A. Kimura T. Makimura Y. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Yamanoi T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture, in a total volume of 600 μl, contained 5.0 mm Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP in D2O. After recording the reference spectrum (t = 0 min), 100 milliunits (90 μlinD2O) of the purified enzyme (lyophilized twice from a buffer in D2O prior to use) was added to initiate the reaction. The spectra were recorded at different time intervals (4 min to 16 h).Mass Spectrometry—Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry was performed with a JEOL JMS-700 (MStation) using glycerol as the matrix. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed in the negative ion mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix (PerSeptive Biosystems).Site-directed Mutagenesis—QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce amino acid substitutions. pET23d-engBF was mutated using the mutagenic forward primers (as shown in TABLE ONE) and these complement primers. After confirmation of the desired mutations by DNA sequencing, the mutant EngBF enzymes were expressed and purified according to the same procedure as for the wild-type enzyme.TABLE ONEThe forward primers used for site-directed mutagenesisNameSequence of oligosaccharide primerD601N5′-GGCCATCGCCGGCAACGAGAACGAAGACGG-3′D605N5′-GGCGACGAGAACGAAAACGGTGCCGTCAAC-3′D612N5′-GCCGTCAACTGGCAGAATGGCGCAATCGCC-3′D655N5′-CACCACGCTTAACAACGTCAAGAAGGTGGC-3′D665N5′-GCCTTGAACACCAACGGCCTCGGCCAGTC-3′E679Q5′-GGGCTACGGCAATCAAGGCCACGACTCCG-3′D682N5′-TGAAGGCCACAACTCCGGCC-3′D682A5′-TGAAGGCCACGCCTCCGGCC-3′D700N5′-CTCGGCGGCGCCGACAACATGAACACCATG-3′E723Q5′-CGTCAACGCCTCCCAAATGTATCCGGAAGC-3′D762N5′-CGACGGCATCTACAATCTGGCATCCGGTTC-3′D762A5′-CGACGGCATCTACGCTCTGGCATCCGGTTC-3′D789N5′-ACCTCAATGTGTGGGGCAACCTG-3′D789A5′-ACCTCGCTGTGTGGGGCAACCTG-3′E822Q5′-GGCGTATGACCACCCAATGGGGTTCCGGC-3′E822A5′-GGCGTATGACCACCGCATGGGGTTCCGGC-3′E828Q5′-GGGGTTCCGGCAACCAGTACGACTCCACC-3′D839N5′-ACTGGGCAGCTAATCTGACCTAC-3′D864N5′-GCAACCACCAGAAGAACAGCTGGGTTGGCG-3′D898N5′-GCAGGGCCGCAACAACTATGCCGCCTAC-3′D1058N5′-ACCAGCTCACCAATCAGGGCAAG-3′D1106N5′-GCATGCATGTGGTAAACGCCGGCTTCAACG-3′D1248N5′-GCACACACCTACTTCAACGATGTGCGCATC-3′E1276Q5′-CCAACGGATTCCAAAACAACGCCCAGGGC-3′E1302Q5′-TCCACCTCTCCCAGCTGCATGC-3′E1350Q5′-CAGAACGTGAAGTTCCAGGCGGGTGCCAAG-3′ Open table in a new tab RESULTSDetection of Endo-α-GalNAcase Activity in Various Strains of Bifidobacteria and Search for the Gene of the Enzyme—During our studies on various glycosidases of bifidobacteria to analyze an assimilation mechanism of oligosaccharide specific for the growth of bifidobacteria, we found that the endo-α-GalNAcase activity was widely distributed among various bifidobacterial strains such as B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. breve (Fig. 1). The enzymatic activities were also detected in the culture supernatants and the cell extracts treated with cell wall lytic enzyme, mutanolysin (data not shown). These results suggested that the enzyme probably has a secretion signal, and is secreted and associated with the cell surface. To elucidate the function of this enzyme, we partially purified the enzyme from B. longum JCM 1217 and determined the molecular mass as about 200 kDa. Based on the structural information of the enzyme, i.e. an ORF with more than 1,800 amino acid residues carrying a secretion signal, we scrutinized the genomic sequence of B. longum NCC2705 (25Schell M.A. Karmirantzou M.

The molecular mass of endo-α-GalNAcase from S. pneumoniae was reported to be 190 kDa (15Brooks M.M. Savage A.V. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which corresponded to the predicted molecular mass of SPR0328. Also, the molecular size of endo-α-GalNA-case of S. coelicolor A3 (2Springer G.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) was in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of SCO6348. 3K. Fujita, F. Oura, N. Nagamine, T. Katayama, J. Hiratake, K. Sakata, H. Kumagai, and K. Yamamoto, unpublished results. These results suggested that BL0464, a “narrowly conserved hypothetical protein,” might encode endo-α-GalNAcase.Molecular Cloning and Expression of Endo-α-GalNAcase (EngBF) of B. longum JCM 1217—Based on the DNA sequence of BL0464 of B. longum NCC2705, oligonucleotide primers were designed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 6.0-kilobase pair DNA fragment amplified using a genomic DNA of B. longum JCM 1217 as a template was inserted into expression plasmid pET23d. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(λDE3), and the soluble cell lysate was examined for the endo-α-GalNAcase activity using Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP as a substrate. The liberation of the disaccharide and pNP were observed in time- and dose-dependent manners (data not shown), indicating that the endo-α-GalNAcase gene (engBF) was successfully isolated. The details of its enzymatic properties are given below. Furthermore, the upstream and downstream regions of the engBF gene were cloned by Southern hybridization and PCR, respectively. EngBF consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues exhibiting 99.1% identity with that of BL0464. The His-tagged EngBF was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the final preparation migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular size of 200 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), which is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 210,269 Da.FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant EngBF.

The sequences in amino acid residues 1703–1779, 1780–1857, and 1858–1935 are highly homologous to each other, and contain the so-called FIVAR domains that are presumably involved in cell wall binding (Pfam 07554). The primary structure of EngBF showed no similarity to those of any known glycoside hydrolase families, but exhibited significant similarity to hypothetical proteins of C. perfringens, S. pneumoniae, S. coelicolor, and E. faecalis (Fig. 3B), 32–54% identity being observed for amino acid residues 590–1381. From these results, a novel glycoside hydrolase family (GH family 101) was established.FIGURE 3Structural analysis of EngBF of B. longum. A, schematic representation of EngBF of B. longum JCM 1217. The numbering starts at a possible initiation codon. Three repetitive sequences are depicted as shaded boxes, and contain so-called FIVAR domains (Pfam 07554). B, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the ClustalW program using the neighbor-joining method. The gray boxes indicate highly conserved regions among the hypothetical ORFs, which result in the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family 101.

The enzyme was capable of liberating Core 1 disaccharide, but did not release Core 2 trisaccharide (Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAc), GalNAc monosaccharide, Core 3 disaccharide (GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAc), or Galβ1,3GlcNAc disaccharide from each pNP substrate, as revealed by colorimetric assay and TLC analysis (Fig. 4A). The enzyme did not act on any O-glycosidic linkages of fetuin, but released Galβ1,3GalNAc disaccharide from asialofetuin (Fig. 4A). The ability to liberate the disaccharide from asialofetuin was verified by fast atom bombardmentmass spectrometry analysis, in which the molecular ion peaks of m/z 384 [M + H]+ and m/z 406 [M + Na]+ appeared, but no molecular ion peaks of mono- and trisaccharides appeared (Fig. 4B). High resolution MS of the peak of m/z 384 exactly corresponded to the calculated mass of [M + H]+ (calculated for C14H26NO11 (M + H) 384.1506, found 384.1505). Furthermore, the 1H NMR spectrum of the liberated product from asialofetuin was identical to that of Galβ1,3GalNAc released from its pNP glycoside (data not shown). These results revealed that the enzyme exclusively acts on the unsubstituted Core 1 structure to release Galβ1,3GalNAc disaccharide.FIGURE 4Substrate specificity of the recombinant EngBF.

The optimal temperature and pH were determined as 60 °C and 5.0, respectively. The Km and kcat values for Galβ1,3GalNAcα1pNP were calculated as 21.8 μm and 17.8 s–1, respectively, which coincide with the values obtained for the Bacillus enzyme (17Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Murata T.

Prior to the experiment, we assigned the chemical shifts of two anomers of Galβ1,3GalNAc using the completely hydrolyzed and equilibrated product of the enzyme. After recording a reference spectrum (t = 0 min), the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture.

https://openalex.org/W2012079366,"A balance in the activities of the Ipl Aurora kinase and the Glc7 phosphatase is essential for normal chromosome segregation in yeast. We report here that this balance is modulated by the Set1 methyltransferase. Deletion of SET1 suppresses chromosome loss in ipl1-2 cells. Conversely, combination of SET1 and GLC7 mutations is lethal. Strikingly, these effects are independent of previously defined functions for Set1 in transcription initiation and histone H3 methylation. We find that Set1 is required for methylation of conserved lysines in a kinetochore protein, Dam1. Biochemical and genetic experiments indicate that Dam1 methylation inhibits Ipl1-mediated phosphorylation of flanking serines. Our studies demonstrate that Set1 has important, unexpected functions in mitosis. Moreover, our findings suggest that antagonism between lysine methylation and serine phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism for controlling protein function."

The moving part can be rotated by an electric field, resulting in large but fully elastic torsional deformations of the nanotube. As a result of the extremely small restoring force associated with the torsional deformation of a single molecule, unusually large oscillations are excited by the thermal energy of the pendulum. By diffraction analysis, we are able to determine the handedness of the molecule in our device. Mechanical devices with molecular-scale components are potential building blocks for nanoelectromechanical systems and may also serve as sensors or actuators."
https://openalex.org/W2030332733,"The susceptibility of humans to the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is greatly influenced by polymorphisms within the human prion protein gene (PRNP). Similar genetic differences exist in sheep, in which PRNP polymorphisms modify the susceptibility to scrapie. However, the known coding polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP gene have little or no effect on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) susceptibility in cattle. We have recently found a tentative association between PRNP promoter polymorphisms and BSE susceptibility in German cattle (Sander, P., Hamann, H., Pfeiffer, I., Wemheuer, W., Brenig, B., Groschup, M., Ziegler, U., Distl, O., and Leeb, T. (2004) Neurogenetics 5, 19–25). A plausible hypothesis explaining this observation could be that the bovine PRNP promoter polymorphisms cause changes in PRNP expression that might be responsible for differences in BSE incubation time and/or BSE susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we performed a functional promoter analysis of the different bovine PRNP promoter alleles by reporter gene assays in vitro and by measuring PRNP mRNA levels in calves with different PRNP genotypes in vivo. Two variable sites, a 23-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism containing a RP58-binding site and a 12-bp indel polymorphism containing an SP1-binding site, were investigated. Band shift assays indicated differences in transcription factor binding to the different alleles at the two polymorphisms. Reporter gene assays demonstrated an interaction between the two postulated transcription factors and lower expression levels of the ins/ins allele compared with the del/del allele. The in vivo data revealed substantial individual variation of PRNP expression in different tissues. In intestinal lymph nodes, expression levels differed between the different PRNP genotypes.

The causative agents of these transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are infectious proteins, the so-called prions according to the widely accepted hypothesis of Prusiner (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). Normal host cellular prion protein (PrPc) changes its conformation due to triggering by inoculated scrapie PrPSC. Ingestion of meat and bone meal from scrapie-infected sheep and BSE-infected cattle initiated the large BSE outbreak in the United Kingdom in the last decade of the 20th century (3Eddy R.G. Vet. Rec. 1995; 137: 648PubMed Google Scholar). Prions are transported eventually from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, in which spongiform degeneration of brain structure leads to neurodegenerative disorder. There is evidence that the immune system is involved in this process. Specifically, intestinal lymph nodes, B-lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and the spleen are essential for carrying PrPSc to the target organ brain (4Blattler T. Brandner S. Raeber A.J.

This phenomenon was initially discovered in sheep, in which several mutations within the coding sequence of the prion protein gene (PRNP) are known to lead to increased or decreased scrapie susceptibility (10Goldmann W. Hunter N. Foster J.D. Salbaum J.M. Beyreuther K. Hope J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Hunter N. Foster J.D. Hope J. Vet.

In humans, a polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP coding sequence is strongly correlated with susceptibility to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as all human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients share the homozygous Met129/Met129 genotype, whereas Val129/Val129 and heterozygous individuals have not been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease so far. However, in cattle, none of the known polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP coding sequence seem to have an influence on BSE susceptibility. Alternatively, it has been speculated that the promoter region of the PRNP gene might influence the expression level of the protein and thus the incubation period of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (15Bossers A. Schreuder B.E. Muileman I.H. Belt P.B. Smits M.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).We previously reported the first tentative association of BSE susceptibility with polymorphisms in the PRNP gene promoter (1Sander P. Hamann H. Pfeiffer I. Wemheuer W. Brenig B. Groschup M. Ziegler U. Distl O. Leeb T. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In our previous study, the allele frequencies at two linked insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP promoter differed significantly between the 48 healthy and 43 BSE-affected German cattle analyzed. The most common haplotypes at these two polymorphisms contained either both insertions (referred to as ins/ins) or both deletions (referred to as del/del). The frequency of the del/del haplotype was higher in the BSE-affected group. We therefore hypothesized that the observed differences in haplotype frequencies may reflect differences in PRNP promoter activity. According to this hypothesis, the del/del allele, which was over-represented in the affected group, should show stronger promoter activity than the ins/ins allele. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the functional properties of different allelic variants of the bovine PRNP promoter by performing reporter gene assays in vitro and by quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Silico Analysis of Transcription Factor-binding Sites—The computer software MatInspector was used to scan the bovine PRNP promoter region for possible transcription factor-binding sites (16Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). The region spanned from positions 46754 to 51993 according to the bovine PRNP genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AJ298878), including the putative promoter (17Inoue S. Tanaka M. Horiuchi M. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1997; 59: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Different allelic variants of the promoter sequence as determined previously (1Sander P. Hamann H. Pfeiffer I. Wemheuer W. Brenig B. Groschup M. Ziegler U. Distl O. Leeb T. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were analyzed for differences in transcription factor-binding site content (see Fig. 1A).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from bovine brain and PT cells transfected with the vector pRP58 (see below) following the protocol of Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). Approximately 50-bp oligonucleotides surrounding polymorphisms –1980T→C, –1594indel23bp, –85G→T, +300indel12bp, +571A→G, and +709A→G were designed with both alleles (see Fig. 1A). The oligonucleotides with the sequence surrounding the polymorphism +571A→ G were used for EMSA with the gel shift assay system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The other oligonucleotides were double-stranded and 32P-labeled and used at 25 fmol for DNA-protein binding reactions with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)], 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5× binding buffer (250 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm MgCl2, 750 mm to 1.5 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol), 2.25–8.75 μg of nuclear extract or 300 ng of recombinant human SP1 extract (Promega), and possibly 250 fmol or 2.5 pmol of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide as specific or nonspecific competitor. The binding reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice. Electrophoresis of the samples through a native 8% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer was followed by autoradiography.Promoter-Reporter Gene Constructs—All constructs prepared are shown in Fig. 1B. A PCR product including 2676 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1, intron 1, and the first part of exon 2 of the bovine PRNP gene was cloned as an MluI-BglII fragment into the promoterless reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). The following primers were used for this PCR: 5′-ATA ATT ACG CGT TCA CCA TTT CCG AAT ACA TCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAA TTA AGA TCT TGG ATT TGT GTC TCT GGG AAG-3′ (reverse). The template for generating this fragment was the bovine bacterial artificial chromosome clone CH240-120O1. The resulting construct represented the new vector pDelDel, with deletions at both –1594indel23bp and +300indel12bp.The mutant with a 12-bp insertion at +300indel12bp, termed pDelIns, was generated by a splice overlap extension reaction on the template pDelDel (19Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The mutant pInsDel with a 23-bp insertion at –1594indel23bp was made by primer extension ligation on the template pDelDel. The construct with both insertions (pInsIns) was derived by combining plasmids pInsDel and pDelIns using the restriction sites MluI and AatII.The constructs p12Ins and p12Del were created by elongase PCR amplification (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol by a touch-down protocol (20Hecker K.H. Roux K.H. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-CAA GAG ATC TAG AGA TGC TTC ACT GCC CCC AAT GTG CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATT TAG ATC TCT GGG AAG ACA GAT GCT TCG GGG CGG-3′ (reverse). Genomic DNA from an animal homozygous for the 12-bp insertion or DNA from an animal homozygous for the 12-bp deletion was used as a template. The PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector.The RP58-expressing vector pRP58 was generated by cloning a PCR product with the cDNA from the human RP58 gene into the pGL3-Control vector (Promega), replacing its luciferase box. PCR was carried out on the template clone IRAKp961E13474Q. The clone carries one discrepancy with respect to RP58 (GenBankTM accession number NM_006352), c.324C→ A. This potential cloning artifact was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis so that pRP58 conformed to accession number NM_006352. The restriction sites HindIII and XbaI were used for cloning this PCR product into the pGL3-Control vector. The expression vector pRSV/SP1 was a kind gift from M. Wegner (University of Erlangen-Nürnberg). The XbaI fragment from plasmid pSP1-778C (21Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) was cloned into the vector pRSV as described (22de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). All PCRs were carried out with proofreading polymerases, and all constructs were sequenced to verify successful cloning.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Experiments—The bovine cell lines KOP (esophageal tissue of a calf) and PT (kidney cells of a calf) were obtained from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (Isle of Riems, Germany). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with stable glutamine and 1 g/liter d-glucose (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG) at 38 °C and 5% CO2.For transient transfection assays, ∼6 × 104 PT cells or 3 × 104 KOP cells were seeded 24 h before transfection into 12-well plates (Biochrom AG). Cells reaching 60–80% confluency were transfected using 1.2 μlof Effectene reagent and 1.2 μl of Enhancer reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). If constructs were transfected without a transcription factor-building plasmid, 135 ng/well each test construct and 15 ng/well (10%) pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase reference control plasmid, Promega) were used. If cotransfection with pRSV/SP1 and/or pRP58 was performed, 75 ng/well each test construct, 15 ng/well pRL-TK, and 30 ng/well transcription factor plasmids were used. The pRP58 plasmid was also used alone in transfections (450 ng/25-cm2 flask) for nuclear extract preparation. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection using 200 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were frozen until all experiments had been performed. All samples were measured for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities with a Lucy 2 luminometer (Anthos Mikrosysteme GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent II were injected into 10 μl of each lysate; and after a 2-s delay time and a 10-s measurement of the firefly luminescence, 50 μl of Stop & Glo reagent were injected into each well, followed by a second luminescence measurement. Relative luciferase activities are defined as the ratio of the firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase mean value of each construct relative to the pGL3-Control vector, which contains the SV40 promoter. The constructs pDelDel, pDelIns, pInsDel, and pInsIns were transfected alone in three separate experiments. Cotransfection of these constructs in combination with the transcription factor expressing plasmid pRP58 or pRSV/SP1 was performed in two or three separate experiments, respectively. All assays were carried out in triplicates and in both cell lines (KOP and PT).RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR—Tissues from ∼6-month-old calves were isolated from the liver, spleen, brain stem, and intestinal lymph nodes directly after slaughtering in a commercial slaughterhouse. They were stored in RNAlater reagent (Qiagen GmbH), and the RNA was isolated using the RNeasy 96 universal tissue kit (Qiagen GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription into cDNA was performed using 4 units of Omniscript (Qiagen GmbH), an oligo(dT) primer ((T)24V), and 2 μl of the isolated RNA in a 20-μl reaction. The expression levels of bovine PRNP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; used as an endogenous control) were determined using the following primer pairs: PRNP, 5′-TCC CAG AGA CAC AAA TCC AAC TT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGT GGC TTT TCA CCA TGA TGA-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5′-GGC GTG AAC CAC GAG AAG TAT AA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCC TCC ACG ATG CCA AAG T-3′ (reverse). A specific TaqMan probe for each PCR (VIC ®-labeled PRNP probe, 5′-TGA ATC ACA GCA GAT ATA A-3′; and FAM™-labeled GAPDH probe, 5′-ATA CCC TCA AGA TTG TCA GCA ATG CCT CCT-3′) was also used. qRT-PCR was carried out with an ABI 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) in a 20-μl reaction containing TaqMan Universal MasterMix (Applied Biosystems), 50 μm forward primer, 50 μm reverse primer, and 10 μm TaqMan probe at an annealing and elongation temperature of 60 °C. A standard curve from linearized plasmids carrying the cloned target sequence from the PRNP and GAPDH genes was arranged over 5 log levels on each plate. The PRNP expression level was normalized by dividing it by the bovine GAPDH expression level. All assays were performed in duplicates.DNA Isolation and Genotyping—A second piece of each tissue sample used for RNA isolation was used for DNA isolation with the Nucleospin 96 tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). To determine the genotype with respect to the indel polymorphisms –1594indel23bp and +300indel12bp, PCRs flanking the polymorphisms were carried out as described above, and product sizes were evaluated on agarose gels (1Sander P. Hamann H. Pfeiffer I. Wemheuer W. Brenig B. Groschup M. Ziegler U. Distl O. Leeb T. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Differences between constructs were tested for significance using the procedure MIXED of the SAS software package (23SAS Version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc. 2003; Google Scholar). A linear model was applied, including the effects of the constructs and the repeated measurements. Contrasts between least-square means were calculated and tested for significance in both cell lines separately. All p values are provided in supplemetal Tables 1–3. The same model was used for the qRT-PCR data from the four different bovine tissues.RESULTSPutative Transcription Factor-binding Sites—The bovine PRNP promoter region from positions –2676 to +2564 was screened in silico for transcription factor-binding sites. This region comprises 5′-flanking sequence as well as intron 1 because it has been shown that both regions contribute to promoter activity (17Inoue S. Tanaka M. Horiuchi M. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1997; 59: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).All alleles for each polymorphic position were screened for transcription factor-binding sites. This led to the identification of 18 differences in putative transcription factor-binding sites between the different alleles. We excluded 12 of these differential sites based on the properties of the potentially binding transcription factors. For example, we did not follow up a differential transcription factor-binding site of hepatic nuclear factor-4, as this transcription factor is involved mainly in liverspecific gene regulation. Consequently, we selected six transcription factor-binding sites that seemed most likely to be functionally relevant for the regulation of PRNP transcription (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEPolymorphisms within the bovine PRNP promoter that affect transcription factor-binding sitesTranscription factorBinding site positionOrientationConsensus binding siteBinding alleleNon-binding allelePOZ (BCL6)-1980+gcTAGAaagcTAGAaagcCAGAaaRP58 (ZNF238)-1594-gaCATCtggaCATCtg (23-bp insert)23-bp deletionNEUROG1-85-CCAGctgCCAGctgCCAGcggSP1+300+gGGCGggGGCGg (12-bp insert)12-bp deletionAP2 (TFAP2A)+571-ggCCCAcggacgcggCCCAcggacgcggCCCAcggaggcEGR4+709+GCGTgcgGCGTgcgGCGTacg Open table in a new tab Binding of Putative Transcription Factors to Selected Sections of the PRNP Promoter—Oligonucleotides surrounding the six selected polymorphic transcription factor-binding sites were designed and used as probes in EMSAs. Every probe was designed with one or the other allele of the polymorphisms described in TABLE ONE.The most striking differences in transcription factor binding to different PRNP alleles were observed in the case of the 12-bp indel polymorphism at position +300 and the transcription factor SP1 (Fig. 2). The 12-bp insertion allele was able to bind SP1, whereas the 12-bp deletion allele did not bind SP1.FIGURE 2EMSA analysis of SP1 binding to the PRNP promoter sequence. 25 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (Oligo) corresponding to the two alleles at the 12-bp indel polymorphism in intron 1 were used as probes: +12, 5′-CTC GGA ATG TGG GCG GGG GCC GCG GCT GGC TGG TCC CCC TC-3′ (sense); and –12, 5′-CAT TTA CTC GGA ATG TGG GCT GGC TGG TCC CCC TCC CGA G-3′ (sense). Competitions were performed by the addition of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (250 fmol or 2.5 pmol) to the binding reaction. The binding buffer contained 0.75 m NaCl. Purified SP1 protein (300 ng/lane) was used as a positive control. Nuclear extract (NE; 5.25 μg/lane) was prepared from bovine brain. Negative controls (neg) lacked protein. The +12 oligonucleotide probe produced a shift with purified SP1 protein and with nuclear extract from bovine brain. The observed SP1 binding to the +12 oligonucleotide was specific, as it could be competed with the unlabeled +12 oligonucleotide, but not with the nonspecific unlabeled –12 oligonucleotide. The shifted band with nuclear extract was the same size as the shifted band with purified SP1, which also corroborates the identity of the bound protein. The labeled –12 oligonucleotide did not bind SP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EMSA was also performed with the potential RP58-binding site within the 23-bp indel polymorphisms at position –1594 in the 5′-flanking sequence. Using the same brain nuclear extract as used in the SP1 EMSAs, no band shifts were initially visible (data not shown). However, reproducible band shifts with nuclear extracts from pRP58-overexpressing cells were obtained (Fig. 3). The experiment showed that the 23-bp insertion allele produced strong and specific band shifts with transcription factor RP58. However, the deletion allele produced only a weak band shift that could be competed with the unlabeled insertion allele, indicating that RP58 has a higher affinity for the insertion allele than for the deletion allele.FIGURE 3EMSA analysis of RP58 binding to the PRNP promoter sequence. 25 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (Oligo) corresponding to the two alleles at the 23-bp indel polymorphism in the 5′-flanking sequence were used as probes: +23, 5′-TAG CTA TCA CGT CAA TCT CAG ATG TCT TCC CAA CAG CAG CCT CAG ACG TCA TG-3′ (sense); and –23, 5′-ATT CCA ACT CCT AGC TAT CAC GTC AAG CCT CAG ACG TCA TGG GGC AGA GTC A-3′ (sense). Competitions were performed by the addition of the unlabeled +23 or –23 oligonucleotide (250 fmol or 2.5 pmol) or the unlabeled AP_G oligonucleotide (2.5 pmol; sense, 5′-GCG GTG AGG AGT GCC GGA GCG TCC GTG GGC CCC CAG CCG C-3′) to the binding reaction. The binding buffer contained 1.125 m NaCl. Nuclear extract (NE; 3.33 μg/lane) was prepared from PT cells transfected with an expression construct for transcription factor RP58. Negative controls (neg) lacked protein. The +23 oligonucleotide produced a strong band shift that could be competed with an excess of the unlabeled +23 oligonucleotide. Competition with the –23 oligonucleotide reduced the intensity of the shifted bands; however, it did not completely abolish binding of RP58 to the +23 oligonucleotide. On the other hand, the –23 oligonucleotide produced a weak band shift with RP58 that could be competed with both the unlabeled –23 and +23 oligonucleotides. The completely unrelated AP_G oligonucleotide was not able to compete with either the +23 or –23 band shift.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The polymorphic transcription factor-binding sites for POZ (position –1980), neurogenin-1 (position –85), AP2 (position +571), and EGR4 (position +709) were also evaluated in similar EMSAs (supplemental Fig. 1). In these four instances, no conclusive differences in the binding properties of the different respective alleles were observed. Both allelic POZ probes produced identical band shift patterns with two shifted bands for each probe. In the case of the –85G→ T polymorphism, both allelic probes led to a shifted band of the same size. The shifted band with the G allele had a higher intensity; however, as this allele was predicted to be the non-binding allele for NEUROG1, the polymorphism was not further studied. Both allelic AP2 probes did not produce any band shift, whereas a control oligonucleotide with a perfect AP2 consensus site led to a shifted band of the expected size. In the case of EGR4, both allelic probes produced identical band shift patterns with two bands for each probe. This led to the conclusion that only the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms are involved in differential allelic PRNP promoter modulation and thus in PrPc expression. Therefore, our further experiments focused on these two polymorphisms.Promoter-Reporter Gene Assays—Plasmids pDelDel, pDelIns, pInsDel, pInsIns, p12Ins, and p12Del carrying the firefly luciferase open reading frame under the control of different PRNP promoter alleles were cotransfected into two different bovine cell lines, PT and KOP, with the pRL-TK normalization vector (Fig. 1). Each assay was carried out in triplicates at 6 (PT) or 5 (KOP) separate weeks (nPT = 18 and nKOP = 15). Every week, cells were also transfected with the pGL3-Control vector for standardization of these six or five passages. The activity of firefly luciferase compared with that of Renilla luciferase reflected the promoter activity. The mean values of each test construct are indicated in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4Reporter gene assays: effect of different polymorphisms of the bovine PRNP promoter on its activity in PT and KOP cells. The data show the expression levels of the firefly luciferase activity of each construct compared with the Renilla luciferase activity of the pRL-TK normalization vector. The pGL3-Control vector (with the standard SV40 promoter) was used for normalization between different experiments (relative light units (RLU) = (firefly luciferaseconstruct/Renilla luciferaseconstruct)/(firefly luciferasecontrol/Renilla luciferasecontrol)). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Error bars indicated S.E. The letters represent significantly different expression levels (p <0.05), e.g. if two columns do not share a common letter, then they are significantly different, with p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In both cell lines, the p12Ins vector yielded a significantly higher expression level than the p12Del vector (p < 0.0001). The order of expression levels of the longer reporter gene constructs in PT cells was as follows: pDelDel, pDelIns, pInsDel, pInsIns. In KOP cells, th"

Despite its biological significance, there is at present no available structure of this serpin in its native, inhibitory state. We present here the first fully refined structure of a murine antichymotrypsin orthologue to 2.1 Å, which we propose as a template for other antichymotrypsin-like serpins. A most unexpected feature of the structure of murine serpina3n is that it reveals the reactive center loop (RCL) to be partially inserted into the A β-sheet, a structural motif associated with ligand-dependent activation in other serpins. The RCL is, in addition, stabilized by salt bridges, and its plane is oriented at 90° to the RCL of antitrypsin. A biochemical and biophysical analysis of this serpin demonstrates that it is a fast and efficient inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase (ka: 4 ± 0.9 × 106 m-1 s-1) and cathepsin G (ka: 7.9 ± 0.9 × 105 m-1 s-1) giving a spectrum of activity intermediate between that of human antichymotrypsin and human antitrypsin. An evolutionary analysis reveals that residues subject to positive selection and that have contributed to the diversity of sequences in this sub-branch (A3) of the serpin superfamily are essentially restricted to the P4–P6′ region of the RCL, the distal hinge, and the loop between strands 4B and 5B.

Like its close orthologue α1-antitrypsin, it was first characterized as an acute phase plasma protease inhibitor (1Dickson I. Alper C.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 54: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is synthesized in a range of tissues, including hepatocytes (2Chandra T. Stackhouse R. Kidd V.J. Robson K.J. Woo S.L.

In the lung, α1-antichymotrypsin (referred to as huACT hereafter) plays an important role in the regulation of proteases released by leukocytes during an inflammatory response (5Travis J. Bowen J. Baugh R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), cathepsin G (Cat G) (5Travis J. Bowen J. Baugh R.

Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) and its overexpression plays a permissive role in the progression of Alzheimer disease (8Kamboh M.I. Sanghera D.K.

Current evidence suggests that its role in the brain, and consequently the basis of its association with amyloid plaques, is as a component of the inflammatory response (10Abraham C.R. Neurobiol.

Serpins are the largest family of protease inhibitors and extend to all branches of life (11Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 12Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J.M Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J.M Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C.W Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Members of this class of protein perform roles in diverse physiological processes such as the blood clotting cascade, apoptosis, and chromatin condensation (13Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). The serpin fold is highly conserved and consists of 3 β-sheets, 8–9 α-helices, and a solvent-exposed stretch of amino acids termed the reactive center loop (RCL) (14Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition has been demonstrated biophysically and structurally. Serpins “hijack” the proteolytic mechanism, during which a protease and substrate are transiently linked by an acyl ester bond. The cognate protease binds to, and cleaves within, specificity-determining residues of the RCL; following cleavage of the peptide bond, the RCL is thermodynamically driven to insert into the center of the A β-sheet, the tethered protease translocates ∼70 Å and becomes compressed against the base of the serpin. Distortion of the active site prevents the final hydrolysis event, and the result is an irreversible, covalent serpin-enzyme complex (15Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The ability of serpins to accommodate a nascent RCL confers an important vulnerability: the propensity to form long chain polymers in which the RCL of one molecule becomes embedded in the A β-sheet (or the C β-sheet) of the next (16Dunstone M.A. Dai W. Whisstock J.C. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Feil S.C. Le Bonniec B.F. Parker M.W. Bottomley S.P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Chang W.S. Whisstock J.C. Hopkins P.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This state can be brought about by point mutation. For example, the Pro229 → Ala mutation renders huACT susceptible to polymerization: the protein is deposited as inclusions in hepatocytes leading to liver damage, and the resulting deficiency in the lungs results in obstructive pulmonary disease (18Faber J.P. Poller W. Olek K. Baumann U. Carlson J. Lindmark B. Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1993; 18: 313-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Leu55 → Pro mutation destabilizes the serpin, leading to the formation of polymers and the inactive, monomeric “latent” form (19Poller W. Faber J.P. Weidinger S. Tief K. Scholz S. Fischer M. Olek K. Kirchgesser M. Heidtmann H.H. Genomics. 1993; 17: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In rats and mice the antichymotrypsin gene has undergone extensive duplication and diversification (20Forsyth S. Horvath A. Coughlin P. Genomics. 2003; 81: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), yielding a family of 13 closely related inhibitors within the murine serpina3 cluster with differing tissue distribution and protease specificity (21Horvath A.J. Forsyth S.L. Coughlin P.B. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 59: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Inglis J.D. Hill R.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A similar event has also occurred at some other serpin loci, including antitrypsin (23Barbour K.W. Wei F. Brannan C. Flotte T.R. Baumann H. Berger F.G. Genomics. 2002; 80: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MNEI, PI-6, and PI-9 (24Kaiserman D. Knaggs S. Scarff K.L. Gillard A. Mirza G. Cadman M. McKeone R. Denny P. Cooley J. Benarafa C. Remold-O'Donnell E. Ragoussis J. Bird P.I. Genomics. 2002; 79: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and has been observed for numerous genes throughout the mouse and rat genomes (25Cheung J. Wilson M.D. Zhang J. Khaja R. MacDonald J.R. Heng H.H. Koop B.F. Scherer S.W. Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: R47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene expression studies suggest that serpina3n (also known as EB22.4 and referred to here as muACT-n) is the closest murine orthologue of huACT. In particular, it is the only member of the serpina3 cluster that is expressed in the murine brain under resting conditions (21Horvath A.J. Forsyth S.L. Coughlin P.B. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 59: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), consistent with evidence that huACT plays a role in the inflammatory response in that organ. As with huACT, muACT-n demonstrates a wide tissue distribution: it is found in the liver, brain, testis, lung, thymus, spleen, and to a lesser extent bone marrow, skeletal muscle, and kidney (21Horvath A.J. Forsyth S.L. Coughlin P.B. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 59: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because muACT-n is a likely orthologue of huACT, we sought to characterize this protein both structurally and kinetically. We demonstrate that muACT-n is expressed as a functional, inhibitory serpin and possesses activity that bridges the specificities of both huACT and human antitrypsin (huAT). The structure of this serpin reveals that the RCL is partially inserted into the A β-sheet, is tilted almost 90° with respect to huAT and antithrombin, and is stabilized by two salt bridges tethering it to the body of the serpin. The positively charged residues involved in DNA binding in huACT were also found to be solvent-exposed muACT-n and contribute to one of two patches of positive charge (near the s3C–s4C loop and on the F-helix) on one face of the serpin. These data provide a framework for developing a further understanding of the role of the murine a3 serpins in the biology of their host. Reagents—Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Superscript II reverse transcriptase was obtained from Invitrogen. Bovine chymotrypsin and trypsin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and human leukocyte Cat G were obtained from Athens Research Technology (Athens, GA). Unless otherwise stated general chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and chromatographic equipment was purchased from Bio-Rad. Colorimetric assays were performed using a Thermomax microplate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Production of Recombinant muACT-n—Mouse brain was isolated from 7-week NMRI mice, and RNA was extracted using the acid-guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5 pmol/liter oligo(dT). For expression of muACT-n, the sense primer was designed to exclude the predicted N-terminal secretion peptide. Primers introducing BamHI restriction site tails for cloning into the pET-His(3a) expression vector were as follows: sense (5′-ATGGATCCTTCCCAGATGGCAC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGGATCCTCATTTGGGGTTGGCT-3′). The muACT-n was subcloned into the BamHI restriction site of the pET-His(3a) expression vector to produce an N-terminal His-tagged protein. Correct orientation and sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construct was then used to transform BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and recombinant protein production induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) during the mid-log growth phase for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) to which 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (1/1000), and 5 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol was added. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and 25 μg/ml DNase was added. The cells were freeze/thawed three times in liquid N2 and a 37 °C water bath, respectively. Soluble protein was bound to footnote as nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), eluted with a 0.125 m imidazole step gradient, and further purified using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) with a 0—0.5 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol. Digestion of muACT-n by Trypsin—To generate RCL-cleaved serpin, 1 mg of muACT-n was incubated with trypsin at 20:1 (w:w) at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and samples placed on ice. Cleaved proteins were purified on a Mono Q column to remove traces of protease. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism analysis was performed on a Jasco 820s spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD). Changes in protein secondary structure were monitored by measuring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm using a 0.05-cm path-length cuvette and a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by heating at a rate of 1 °C/min from 25 to 90 °C. Complex Formation Assays—The ability of muACT-n to inhibit the serine proteases bovine chymotrypsin and trypsin, Cat G, HLE, human plasma thrombin, and factor Xa was investigated by SDS-PAGE. 1 μm of each serine protease was incubated with either 1 μm or 5 μm muACT-n in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then immediately placed on ice, and SDS-PAGE reducing buffer was added. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on 10% reducing SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride by Western blotting. Membranes were probed with mouse-His-antibody (1/2000) and goat-anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (1/5000). Proteins were detected with ECL reagent and visualized by autoradiography. Stoichiometry of Inhibition—Stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) values were determined for the interaction between with chymotrypsin, Cat G, or HLE and muACT-n. muACT-n (0.5–4 nm) was incubated with a constant concentration of chymotrypsin (2 nm) at 37°C for 4 h, and residual activity was assayed with the substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (100 μm). Inhibition of Cat G (30 nm) was titrated with increasing concentrations of muACT-n (7.5–60 nm) at room temperature for 2 h, and the residual activity was assayed with the substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (500 μm) on bovine serum albumin-coated microtiter plates. HLE (2 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of muACT-n (0.5–4 nm) at 37 °C for 2 h and assayed with 200 μm N-methoxy-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA on bovine serum albumin-coated microtiter plates. Following linear regression analysis of the plot of residual enzyme activity against serpin concentration, the SI was determined by extrapolating to the protease:serpin ratio where protease activity is zero. The SI values represent the average of three separate experiments. Association Rate Constant (Continuous Method)—Rate constants were measured under pseudo-first order conditions using the progress-curve method (27Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12241-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for the interaction of muACT-n with HLE and Cat G. For HLE, assays were carried out using 0.4 nm HLE, 0.4–2.8 nm muACT-n, and 200 μm N-methoxy-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA at 37 °C in bovine serum albumin coated microtiter plates. For cat G, assays were performed with 20 nm Cat G, 4–40 nm muACT-n, and 1 mm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA at room temperature in bovine serum albumin-coated microtiter plates. A constant amount of protease was mixed with varying amounts of muACT-n and substrate, with the rate of product formation (measured at A405 nm) described by Equation 1,P=V0kobs×[1-e(-kobst)](Eq. 1) where P is the concentration of product at time t, kobs is the apparent first-order rate constant and vo is the initial velocity (28Rovelli G. Stone S.R. Guidolin A. Sommer J. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), for each inhibitor concentration [I], a kobs value was calculated by non-linear least-squares fitting of the data to Equation 1. The resulting kobs values were plotted against [I], and the uncorrected second-order rate constant (k′) determined from the slope of the line of best fit; k′ was corrected for substrate concentration [S], the Km of the protease and SI yielding the second-order rate constant, ka (Equation 2) as follows.ka=k'×(1+([S]/Km)×SI(Eq. 2) The ka values for the inhibition of Cat G and HLE represent the average of two and three separate experiments, respectively. Regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Association Rate Constant (Discontinuous Method)—A discontinuous method (29Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was used to determine the rate of inhibition (ka) of chymotrypsin by muACT-n. The pseudo-first order rate constant with chymotrypsin (2 nm) and muACT-n (10–100 nm) was determined by incubation for different periods of time (0–5 min) followed by measurement of residual chymotrypsin activity. The pseudo-first order constant, kobs, was determined from the slope of a semi-log plot of the residual protease activity against time. The kobs values were then plotted against serpin concentration and the slope of the line of best fit gave an estimate of the second-order rate constant, ka. The ka values represent the average of three separate experiments. Crystallization of muACT-n—Crystallization trials were undertaken using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique, employing a 1-μl: 1-μl drop ratio of muACT-n (at 15 mg/ml) to mother liquor, with a 0.5- to 1-ml reservoir volume at 22 °C. Single large crystals grew in 24% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m sodium tartrate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.6, after 2 weeks. The crystals were flash-cryocooled prior to data collection with 15% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. X-ray Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Out of several crystals screened, one diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution; integration and scaling using the HKL suite (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) revealed it belonged to space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 83.34 Å, b = 92.62 Å, and c = 118.26 Å. This is consistent with two monomers in the asymmetric unit and ∼52% solvent content as predicted using the CCP4 program Matthews (31CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The structure of human native huAT (pdb accession, 1QLP) proved to be superior as a search model to cleaved huACT (pdb accession, 1AS4), providing tentative evidence that the molecules within the crystal corresponded more closely with the native conformation. In both search models, the sequence differences had been mutated to alanine. A single peak in rotation and two strong peaks in the translation function revealed two molecules separated by an orthogonal pseudo-translation of (49.7, -2.5, and 2.9 Å). The molecules packed well within the unit cell and the resulting initial electron density map revealed strong unbiased features, particularly in the region of the RCL, suggesting the molecular replacement had been successful. The progress of refinement (using data between 2.1 and 30 Å) was monitored by the Rfree value without a sigma cut-off applied to the data. The structure was refined in CNS version 1.1 (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Bulk solvent corrections were applied throughout. Once the Rfree value dropped below ∼35%, the two molecules were treated separately with medium NCS positional (150/Å2) and B-factor (2.5σ) restraints on residues not involved in crystal or NCS contacts. Refinement proceeded with rounds of 1) maximum-likelihood minimization, 2) B-factor refinement, and 3) model building. Water molecules were manually built into the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chemically reasonable groups, if they appeared in Fo - Fc maps contoured at 3.0) σ, and subsequently generated 2Fo - Fc maps contoured at 1.0 σ. The two final rounds of refinement were undertaken with REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Although the sequence-specific transcription factors that regulate insulin expression have been well studied, the interrelationship between these factors, chromatin structure, and transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) has remained undefined. In this regard, recent studies have begun to establish a role for the methylation of histone H3 in the initiation or elongation of transcription by pol II. To determine a role for the transcriptional activator Pdx-1 in the maintenance of chromatin structure and pol II recruitment at the insulin gene, we performed small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Pdx-1 in βTC3 cells and subsequently studied histone modifications and pol II recruitment by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We demonstrated here that the 50% fall in insulin transcription following knockdown of Pdx-1 is accompanied by a 60% fall in dimethylated histone H3-Lys-4 at the insulin promoter. H3-Lys-4 methylation at the insulin promoter may be mediated, at least partially, by the methyltransferase Set9. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Set9 is expressed in an islet-enriched pattern in the pancreas, similar to the pattern of Pdx-1 expression. The recruitment of Set9 to the insulin gene appears to be a consequence of its direct interaction with Pdx-1, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Set9 attenuates insulin transcription. Pdx-1 knockdown was also associated with an overall shift in the recruitment of pol II isoforms to the insulin gene, from an elongation isoform (Ser(P)-2) to an initiation isoform (Ser(P)-5). Our findings therefore suggest a model whereby Pdx-1 plays a novel role in linking H3-Lys-4 dimethylation and pol II elongation to insulin transcription.

During pancreatic development, endocrine and exocrine cell types differentiate from a common endodermal precursor cell via a tightly coordinated sequence of transcriptional events (1Chakrabarti S.K.

Within the mature pancreas, Pdx-1 is necessary for the maintenance and function of endocrine cell types within the islets of Langerhans. In the islet β cell, Pdx-1 is believed to activate a number of critical genes involved in glucose sensing and insulin production, including glucokinase, glut2, and insulin (3Chakrabarti S.K.

In addition to A boxes, other defined regulatory elements within the promoter are believed to be bound by ubiquitous (e.g. E47) and cell-specific (e.g. NeuroD1 and MafA) transcription factors (9Ohneda K. Ee H. German M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); in sum, these factors are thought to act in concert to stabilize coactivators (e.g. cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300) and the basal transcriptional proteins at the promoter. Although the sequence-specific transcription factors that regulate insulin expression have been well studied, the interrelationships between these factors, histone/chromatin structure, and the transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) have remained undefined. In this regard, recent studies in yeast systems have begun to establish a role for the methylation of histone H3 in initiation and/or elongation of transcription by pol II (10Gerber M. Shilatifard A.

For example, Set1 (a histone H3-Lys-4 (H3-K4) methyltransferase) and Set2 (an H3-Lys-36 methyltransferase) are found in association with initiation-phosphorylated (Ser(P)-5) and elongation-phosphorylated (Ser(P)-2) isoforms of pol II, respectively (12Ng H.H.

Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) into the positioning vector pIC-2085S (21Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The array fragment was excised by digestion of the resulting plasmid (pIC-5FFPrl) with NdeI and ClaI and purified by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The array fragment containing 5X-Gal4-TATA-E4 was excised from vector pIC208G5E4 as described previously (22Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and GST Pulldown Assays—Pdx-1 and Set9 proteins were prepared as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS using the pET expression system (Novagen) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), as described previously (23Mirmira R.G. Watada H. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14743-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) assays were performed as described previously (20Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS overnight at 30 °C and purified by glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro translation, proteins (encoded within the T7 promoter-based vector, pBAT11) were radiolabeled with [35S]Met using the T7-TnT® in vitro transcription-translation kit (Promega). 5 μl of radio-labeled proteins were incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.12% Non-idet P-40) with GST-purified proteins for 12 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein complexes were washed 4-5 times with binding buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by fluorography. Cell Culture and Transfections—The mouse insulinoma cell line βTC3 and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as reported previously (3Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using 5 × 104 NIH3T3 or HEK293 cells or 5 × 105 βTC3 cells per well in a 6-well dish. For activation studies, 1 μg of reporter plasmid (pFoxLucPrl5FF or pFoxLucPrl5Gal4 (24Iype T. Taylor D.G. Ziesmann S.M. Garmey J.C. Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1363-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) was combined with 0.05 μg of CMV promoter-driven Pdx-1 expression plasmids (pBAT12 and pBAT12Pdx-1) and/or 0.5 μg of CMV-promoter driven Set9 expression plasmids (pcDNASet9 or pcDNASet9m (16Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar)). For repression studies, 1 μg of insulin promoter reporter plasmid pFoxLucSwt (23Mirmira R.G. Watada H. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14743-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or control reporter plasmid pFoxLuc was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of siRNA-encoding plasmids (pSuper-siPdx, pMIGHTY-siGFP (25Yoshida T. Sinha S. Dandre F. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Kremer B.E. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), or pSIREN-DNR-siSet9) and mixed with 3 μl of Transfast® reagent (Promega). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available luminometric kit (Promega). For adenoviral transduction of βTC3 cells, cells were cultured overnight at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates, followed by addition of recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of ∼2500 plaque-forming units/cell directly to the medium. After 5 h, virus-containing medium was removed, and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium. After 72 h, cells were processed for isolation of total RNA or whole cell extracts, as described previously (4Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C. Newgard C.B. Griffen S.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16798-16807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Pdx-1 were generated by cotransfecting a vector encoding HA-Pdx-1 downstream of the CMV promoter (pBAT12-HAPdx) with a vector encoding for a resistance gene against hygromycin (pcDNA3.1-hygro). 48 h after transfection, cells stably incorporating the vectors were selected by incubating in medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin. Approximately 3 weeks later, all hygromycin-resistant clones were pooled and replated. Expression was confirmed by immunoblot. Real Time RT-PCR—Real time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using forward and reverse primers to amplify insulin pre-mRNA (5′-GGGGAGCGTGGCTTCTTCTA-3′ and 5′-GGGGACAGAATTCAGTGGCA-3′) or β-actin (5′-AGGTCATCACTATTGGCAACGA-3′ and 5′-CACTTCATGATGGAATTGAATGTAGTT-3′) as described in detail previously (4Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C. Newgard C.B. Griffen S.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16798-16807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PCRs were cycled 40 times using the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 s, 64 °C for 1 min. Samples containing no reverse transcriptase were run in parallel reactions to assay for genomic contamination. In all instances, samples without reverse transcriptase exhibited threshold cycle numbers greater than 40, indicating negligible amounts of genomic DNA. Amplified products from initial PCRs were subcloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and three to four clones were sequenced to confirm the identity of the amplified product. The threshold cycle (CT) methodology (3Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was used to calculate relative quantities of mRNA products from each sample; all samples were corrected for total input RNA by normalizing CT values to the CT value of the β-actin message. These corrections were verified by quantitation of total RNA in each sample by fluorescence using RiboGreen® dye (Molecular Probes). Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assays, including quantitation of coimmunoprecipitated DNA fragments by real time PCR, were performed as described previously (3Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed on at least three independent occasions; for each ChIP assay, promoter samples were quantitated in triplicate. Forward and reverse primer sequences, respectively, used for PCR were as follows: distal insulin gene, 5′-CCTCCATACAGACAAAATACTCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCACATCCAAAGCAGAAGTTC-3′; insulin promoter, 5′-TACCTTGCTGCCTGAGTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCATTTTCCACATCATTCCCC-3′; insulin coding region, 5′-TGGCTTCTTCTACACACCCAAG-3′ and 5′-ACAATGCCACGCTTCTGCC-3′; myoD promoter, 5′-GCACTGCCACCGATTCATTTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAGGTTTGGAGAGAGACTCAAG-3′. Chromatin Reconstitution and in Vitro Transcription—Chromatin reconstitutions of the 5 S array fragments were performed using HeLa-purified histone octamers and a sequential salt dilution procedure (21Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Reconstituted (chromatinized) fragments were stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. In vitro transcription was performed using 2 ng of the chromatinized array fragment (or corresponding naked DNA fragments) and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng of Pdx-1, 100 ng of Set9, and/or 2 μm S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) for 30 min prior to the addition of 10 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar)) in a total volume of 25 μl. Reactions were started by addition of 0.4 mm rNTPs with or without 2 μm AdoMet. Reactions proceeded for 60 min at 30 °C, were subsequently digested with DNase I for 30 min, and then stopped by addition of 250 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 3 μg/ml tRNA). Reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol-precipitated. RT-PCR was performed at 37 °C for 50 min with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and 3 μg of random hexamers (both from Invitrogen) and a unique 5′-capping primer (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACGCGGG-3′). The Moloney murine leukemia virus was inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. Real time PCR using forward capping primer (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′) and reverse luciferase coding primer (for the E2/A3/A4 array) (5′-CCTCTAGAGGATAGAATGGC-3′) or reverse E4 coding primer (for the Gal4 array) (5′-AACATACAGCGCTTCCACAGCGGCAG-3′) was performed to quantitate transcription product. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SET9 and HA-tagged Pdx-1, nuclear lysates from HeLa cells stably expressing HA-Pdx-1 were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation (using anti-Set9 antibody or normal rabbit serum) as described previously (27Okada Y. Feng Q. Lin Y. Jiang Q. Li Y. Coffield V.M. Su L. Xu G. Zhang Y. Cell. 2005; 121: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Immunoblot Analysis—Aliquots of 5 μg of whole cell or nuclear extract (prepared as described) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Pdx-1, -Set9, and -dimethyl H3-K4 antisera. Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL-Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—Pancreata from 6- to 8-week-old C57/BL6 mice were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. 5-μm tissue sections were immunostained as described (28Yang Z. Chen M. Fialkow L.B. Ellett J.D. Wu R. Nadler J.L. Pancreas. 2003; 26: 99-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. For immunofluorescence, the excitation wavelengths were selected using narrow bandpass filters 450-515 and 546-590 nm for Cy2 and Cy3, respectively. Images were obtained with a SPOT® CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and analyzed using Advanced SPOT® software. H3-K4 Methylation Correlates with pol II Recruitment at the Insulin Gene Loci in Pancreatic β Cells—Several studies have demonstrated the enrichment of H3-K4 methylation within the promoter and coding regions of active genes in both yeast and higher eukaryotes, and have demonstrated that it may serve as an important mark for recruitment of basal transcriptional machinery (10Gerber M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26303-26306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 2003; 113: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because mono-, di-, and trimethylated forms of H3-K4 demonstrate different patterns of enrichment across a given locus (14Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and may be catalyzed by different methyltransferases, we first sought to determine the correlation between different methylated forms of H3-K4 and pol II recruitment at the insulin I and II loci. 3The primers used in these studies equally and efficiently amplify both the mouse insulin I and insulin II genes. Hence, the reference to the insulin gene throughout the text refers to both mouse genes. For these studies, we utilized a mouse β cell-derived cell line, βTC3, which we and others (4Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C. Newgard C.B. Griffen S.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11141-11143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously to exhibit insulin gene regulatory characteristics similar to pancreatic islets. Fig. 1A demonstrates that mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3-K4 species are enriched at the proximal insulin promoter and coding region relative to a distal region of the insulin locus located 4500 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. The data in Fig. 1 were normalized to methylation observed at the distal region of insulin primarily to highlight changes in methylation patterns across the gene. Notably, there is strikingly greater enrichment (25-fold) of dimethylated H3-K4 at the proximal promoter compared with the other methylated species. To confirm that methylation of H3-K4 correlates with active transcription, we also analyzed methylation at the inactive myoD1 gene. As shown in Fig. 1B, substantially less enrichment of all methylated H3-K4 species is observed at the regulatory region of the myoD1 promoter in βTC3 cells. Recruitment of pol II is observed coordinately with the H3-K4 methylation patterns across the insulin locus (Fig. 1C), with no pol II recruitment at the inactive myoD1 promoter (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data support a strong correlation between H3-K4 methylation and active transcription in βTC3 cells. Pdx-1 Is Required for the Maintenance of Dimethylated H3-K4 at the Insulin Gene—To determine a potential role for Pdx-1 in the maintenance of H3-K4 methylation and pol II recruitment, we treated βTC3 cells with an adenovirus encoding siRNA against Pdx-1 (Ad-siPdx), and we subsequently monitored histone modifications by ChIP and insulin transcription by quantitative real time RT-PCR. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, Pdx-1 associates preferentially with the proximal insulin promoter. We do note, however, that significant Pdx-1 occupancy was observed within the coding region, suggesting either incomplete chromatin shearing (and hence primer overlap) or that Pdx-1 occupancy within this region is real and reflective of the overall “accessible” (euchromatic) state of the insulin promoter (3Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Notably, however, no Pdx-1 occupancy was observed at the myoD1 promoter (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of βTC3 cells for 72 h with Ad-siPdx results in a decrease in Pdx-1 protein levels to only 20% compared with untreated cells or cells treated with an adenovirus encoding an siRNA against luciferase (Ad-siLuc). Coordinately, we observed a decline in Pdx-1 occupancy at the insulin promoter by ChIP and a decline in insulin transcription to only 45% compared with Ad-siLuc-treated cells by quantitative RT-PCR of insulin pre-mRNA levels (data not shown but demonstrated previously in Ref. 4Iype T.

The results of Pdx-1 knockdown on insulin transcription reported here are identical to what we observed in a prior study (4Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C.

Both synthesis and degradation of dicarboxylic acids occur mainly in kidney and liver, and the chain-shortened dicarboxylic acids are excreted in the urine as the free acids, implying that acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs), which hydrolyze CoA esters to the free acid and CoASH, are needed for the release of the free acids. Recent studies show that peroxisomes contain several acyl-CoA thioesterases with different functions. We have now expressed a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase with a previously unknown function, ACOT4, which we show is active on dicarboxylyl-CoA esters. We also expressed ACOT8, another peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase that was previously shown to hydrolyze a large variety of CoA esters. Acot4 and Acot8 are both strongly expressed in kidney and liver and are also target genes for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Enzyme activity measurements with expressed ACOT4 and ACOT8 show that both enzymes hydrolyze CoA esters of dicarboxylic acids with high activity but with strikingly different specificities. Whereas ACOT4 mainly hydrolyzes succinyl-CoA, ACOT8 preferentially hydrolyzes longer dicarboxylyl-CoA esters (glutaryl-CoA, adipyl-CoA, suberyl-CoA, sebacyl-CoA, and dodecanedioyl-CoA). The identification of a highly specific succinyl-CoA thioesterase in peroxisomes strongly suggests that peroxisomal β-oxidation of dicarboxylic acids leads to formation of succinate, at least under certain conditions, and that ACOT4 and ACOT8 are responsible for the termination of β-oxidation of dicarboxylic acids of medium-chain length with the concomitant release of the corresponding free acids.

Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 99-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The thioesterase activity with fatty acyl-CoAs was found in several cellular compartments, including peroxisomes (2.Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Osmundsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3.Alexson S.E.H. Osmundsen H. Berge R.K. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4.Wilcke M.

At that time, the broad acyl-CoA chain length specificity in isolated peroxisomes suggested that peroxisomes contain several distinct acyl-CoA thioesterases. With the advent of gene cloning, we have now identified several genes encoding acyl-CoA thioesterases that are apparently localized in peroxisomes. Four of these genes belong to a conserved family that is tentatively named the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family (5.Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T.

This gene family contains two further acyl-CoA thioesterase genes, all located in a cluster on mouse chromosome 12 D3. The genes of this family are named Acot1 to Acot6 and encode acyl-CoA thioesterases with localization in cytosol (7.Yamada J. Matsumoto I. Furihata T. Sakuma M. Suga T. Arch. Biochem.

These enzymes were formerly known as CTE-I (ACOT1), MTE-I (ACOT2), PTE-Ia (ACOT3), PTE-Ib (ACOT4), PTE-Ic (ACOT5), and PTE-Id (ACOT6). However, a new nomenclature system for acyl-CoA thioesterases/hydrolases has been agreed on by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Genome Nomenclature Committee and Mouse Genomic Nomenclature Committee, and from now on we suggest the use of the ACOT nomenclature system (10.Hunt M.C.

Later, this enzyme was characterized in rat as a branched chain acyl-CoA thioesterase (18.Ofman R. el Mrabet L. Dacremont G. Spijer D. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mouse Acot8 was shown to be widely expressed in various tissues, and the enzyme hydrolyzed all tested CoA esters including bile acid-CoAs, branched-chain acyl-CoAs, and short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoAs. We therefore hypothesized that the multiplicity of peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterases may reflect the diverse functions that peroxisomes play in lipid metabolism and that identification of specific acyl-CoA thioesterases may give new insights into metabolic pathways in peroxisomes. Fatty acid oxidation is an important source of energy, especially during fasting and diabetes. Although mitochondria are considered the primary site for β-oxidation of fatty acids for energy utilization, it is now well established that peroxisomes play a key role in the metabolism of a variety of lipids such as very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acid intermediates, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic carboxylic acids (for reviews, see Refs. 19.Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 20.Wanders R.J.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21.Suga T. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 2003; 18: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The functional importance of peroxisomes is underscored by the severity of peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Refsum disease (for review, see (22.Wanders R.J.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2004; 126: 355-375Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar)). Most lipids that undergo β-oxidation in peroxisomes are apparently only chain-shortened, and recent data suggest that octanoate and longer chain fatty acids undergo 1–3 cycles of β-oxidation in peroxisomes (23.Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24.Bian F. Kasumov T. Thomas K.R. Jobbins K.A. David F. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. J.

Brunengraber H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of correlation between acyl chain length and the number of cycles of β-oxidation in peroxisomes suggests that the incomplete oxidation of fatty acids is due to the presence of acyl-CoA thioesterases that “terminate” β-oxidation, which would release free fatty acids that can exit the peroxisome. These free fatty acids may subsequently be transported to the mitochondria for further oxidation, be subject to ω-oxidation, or be excreted as free carboxylic acids in the urine. One example is the peroxisomal metabolism of dicarboxylic acids, which results in the production of the medium-chain dicarboxylic acids adipic acid, suberic acid, and sebacic acid, which are excreted in the urine. Dicarboxylic acids are formed by an initial hydroxylation of the ω-carbon by microsomal CYP4A enzymes, followed by further oxidations by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the ω-oxo-fatty acid and by aldehyde dehydrogenase that finally converts the ω-oxo-fatty acid into a dicarboxylic acid (26.Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that medium-chain fatty acids are the substrates for the initial ω-hydroxylation (27.Mortensen P.B. Gregersen N. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 103: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28.Mortensen P.B. Gregersen N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29.Gregersen N. Kolvraa S. Mortensen P.B. Rasmussen K. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. Suppl. 1982; 161: 15-27PubMed Google Scholar) and that medium-chain dicarboxylic acids are chain-shortened in peroxisomes to adipic acid (C6). In this study we have cloned, expressed, and characterized ACOT4 and show it to be a peroxisomal succinyl-CoA thioesterase. Succinate is excreted in urine, but the origin of urinary succinate is poorly understood. Therefore, these data suggest that succinyl-CoA may be an end product of peroxisomal β-oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids and that urinary succinate may at least in part originate from peroxisomes. As discussed above, ACOT8 is a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase that apparently acts as a “nonspecific” acyl-CoA thioesterase hydrolyzing all acyl-CoAs (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We also expressed ACOT8 and investigated the activity of ACOT8 with dicarboxylyl-CoA esters. We show that ACOT8 also hydrolyzes CoA esters of dicarboxylic acids but with a different specificity than ACOT4. These data suggest that peroxisomes contain acyl-CoA thioesterases that function in the release of free dicarboxylic acids for excretion in urine. Subcellular Localization of ACOT4—The open reading frame encoding Acot4 was amplified by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) as described below, cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP expression vector (Invitrogen), and fully sequenced. Cloning of Acot4 into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector results in the expression of ACOT4 in fusion with N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cell culture, transfection, and fluorescence microscopy were performed as described earlier (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Animals and Treatments—Adult male wild-type (+/+) mice or PPARα-null (–/–) mice on a pure Sv/129 genetic background (kindly provided by Dr. Frank Gonzalez and Dr. Jeffrey Peters or purchased from the Jackson Laboratory) were used in this study. The mice were fed either a standard chow diet or a diet containing 0.1% Wy-14,643 (Cal-biochem-Novabiochem International) for 1 week or were fasted for 24 h before sacrifice. Following sacrifice by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation, tissues were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Isolation of Total RNA—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) or QuickPrep® total RNA extraction reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and DNase-treated. Cloning and Expression—The open reading frame for Acot4 was amplified by RT-PCR using the primers 5′-CATATGGCAGCGACACTGAGC-3′ and 5′-CATATGTCTGTTACAGGCAAACC-3′ (CyberGene AB, Huddinge, Sweden) with the addition of an NdeI site (indicated in boldface). These primers were designed based on the genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession No. NM_134247). Acot4 was cloned into the pET-16b vector (Novagen Inc.), sequenced, and transformed into BL21(DES3)pLysS cells (Novagen Inc.). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyr-anoside for 3 h at 37°C. Recombinant protein was affinity purified on a HiTrap™ column (Amersham Biosciences) as described (6.Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The full-length open reading frame for Acot8 was amplified and cloned into the pET-16b vector, and protein was expressed and purified as described previously (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis of Medium-chain Dicarboxylyl-CoAs—Adipyl-CoA (C6), suberyl-CoA (C8), sebacyl-CoA (C10), and dodecanedioyl-CoA (C12) were synthesized chemically from the free acid by first forming the anhydride followed by the CoA ester as described (30.Chase, J. F. A. (1967) Biochem. J. 510–518Google Scholar). Instead of adding equal amounts of dicarboxylic acid anhydride and CoASH to the reaction, a molar ratio of 4:1 was used. The products formed were purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm (4.6 × 250 mm) column (Beckman) with the mobile phase containing 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 5.4, and a gradient of increasing acetonitrile starting with 5% acetonitrile for 5 min followed by 35 min of a linear increase to 50% acetonitrile and then down to 5% again after 5 min. The dicarboxylyl-CoAs purified were identified by electrospray mass spectrometry in a Quattro micro™ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshawe, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode over a mass scan range of m/z 200–1200 for 1 min at a scan rate of 5 s per scan. This shows both the whole molecule and a diffracted molecule with a neutral loss of 507, confirming the identification of the correct CoA ester as described previously (31.Magnes C. Sinner F.M. Regittnig W. Pieber T.R. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2889-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA Thioesterase Activity Measurements—Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described earlier (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recombinant ACOT4 was analyzed for activity with commercially available acyl-CoAs (Sigma), synthesized dicarboxylyl-CoAs (as described above), 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, 2-trans-decenoyl-CoA and clofibroyl-CoA. The activity of recombinant ACOT8 protein was measured with the different dicarboxylyl-CoAs. Protein was determined using the Bradford assay (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The effect of CoASH on the enzyme activity was measured at 232 nm in phosphate-buffered saline. Enzyme kinetics were calculated using the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics program. Tissue Expression of Acot4 mRNA Using Quantitative PCR—The tissue expression of Acot4 mRNA was examined by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) in various tissues from male Sv/129 mice. Pooled samples of total RNA from three individual animals were used for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of total RNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Q-PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). An Acot4 amplicon spanning over the exon 2/exon 3 boundary was amplified using the primers 5′-TTGAAGAAGCAGTGCGGTACA-3′ and 5′-AAAGACCCAGAAGCCCAATGT-3′ and a probe with 5′-carboxyfluorescein (5′-FAM) and 4-(4-dimethylaminophenyl-azo)benzoic acid (3′-Dabcyl), 5′-CTTCGACATCCAAAGGTAAAAGGCCCA-3′ (CyberGene AB). The primers were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and the PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced. As an endogenous control, an amplicon of 18 S was used, using the predeveloped TaqMan Assay Reagent for 18 S rRNA (Applied Biosystems). The Q-PCR was run in single-plex in triplicate for each tissue with cDNA from pooled tissue samples. Thermal cycling was performed at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were analyzed using the ABI Prism 7000 SDS software, and the average cycle threshold (CT) value per triplicate was used to calculate the relative amounts of Acot4 mRNA using the 2–ΔΔCT method. Tissue Expression of Cyp4A10 Using RT-PCR—Tissue expression was examined by RT-PCR in various mouse tissues. A fragment of Cyp4A10 was amplified using the primers 5′-CTGGAGAAAGCTAAGTTGTTG-3′ and 5′-TATGCAGGGTAGATTTAGATGA-3′ and is located from 1589–1990 bp of the cDNA sequence (accession number BC051049). Thermal cycling was performed for 27 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and the PCR product was sequenced. A fragment of β-actin was amplified as an endogenous control as described (6.Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but using 25 cycles. Regulation of mRNA Expression Using Q-PCR or RT-PCR—The regulation of Acot4 mRNA levels by treatment with 0.1% Wy-14,643 was investigated in livers from control and Wy-14,643-treated wild-type and PPARα-null mice, and regulation by fasting for 24 h was examined in liver and kidney from wild-type mice. The mRNA expression was investigated by Q-PCR as described above, and each sample was run in triplicate from three individual animals for each treatment. Regulation of expression of Cyp4A10 mRNA levels by fasting was investigated in kidney from wild-type mice by RT-PCR as described above, with the exception that the PCR was run for 24 cycles. Western Blot Analysis—The regulation of ACOT4 protein expression by Wy-14,643 treatment was examined in liver from wild-type and PPARα-null mice, and regulation by fasting was investigated in kidney from wild-type mice. Western blotting was performed as described in (33.Hunt M.C. Lindquist P.J.G. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 814-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit ACOT4 antisera (Sigma Genosys) were raised in rabbits immunized with a peptide with the amino acid sequence CNPSMIPIEKAKGPI, with an N-terminal cysteine added for coupling of the peptide to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The peptide used corresponds to amino acids 305–318 of the ACOT4 protein (5.Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity purified as described (6.Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Acot4—The gene for Acot4 was identified in 1999 as a member of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family (5.Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To characterize Acot4 further, we have now amplified the open reading frame from mouse kidney and verified the sequence to the published sequence with GenBank™ Accession Number NM_134247. Subcellular Localization Experiments Show That Acot4 Is Localized in Peroxisomes—ACOT4 contains a putative consensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) of Cys-Arg-Leu (-CRL) at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, which may target the protein to peroxisomes (34.Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). To establish the cellular localization of ACOT4, we expressed the open reading frame in-frame with an N-terminal GFP in both control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from a Zellweger patient. The Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by defects in peroxisome assembly most commonly due to PEX5 deficiency (35.Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Watkins P.A. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The ACOT4-GFP fusion protein showed a punctate pattern of expression in control fibroblasts, indicating a peroxisomal localization (Fig. 1A). However, in fibroblasts from the Zellweger patient, ACOT4 expression resulted in a diffuse labeling throughout the cells with no punctate labeling, indicating that ACOT4 remained in the cytosol (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that ACOT4 is indeed a peroxisomal protein. Characterization of Recombinant Acot4 Shows That It Is a Specific Succinyl-CoA/Glutaryl-CoA Thioesterase—Both ACOT4 and ACOT8 (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins and purified. The purified proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE as single bands of ∼50 and ∼35 kDa stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2). The recombinant ACOT4 protein was analyzed for thioesterase activity with acetyl-CoA (C2:0), propionyl-CoA (C3:0), butyryl-CoA (C4:0), heptanoyl-CoA (C5:0), hexanoyl-CoA (C6:0), octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), decanoyl-CoA (C10:0), lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), myristoyl-CoA (C14:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), oleoyl-CoA (18:1), elaidoyl-CoA (C18:1 trans), linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2), arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0), arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4), acetoacetyl-CoA, dl-β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, dl-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and glutaryl-CoA. We also tested the activity with some noncommercially available substrates including adipyl-CoA, suberyl-CoA, sebacyl-CoA, dodecanedioyl-CoA, behenoyl-CoA (C22:0-CoA), 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, 2-trans-decenoyl-CoA, clofibroyl-CoA, choloyl-CoA, and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA. However, ACOT4 was only active with succinyl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA. The activity with these substrates conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with calculated Vmax values of 3.98 ± 0.16 and 1.14 ± 0.16 μmol/min/mg protein for succinyl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA, respectively (TABLE ONE). The corresponding calculated Km values were 13.3 ± 1.32 and 37.1 ± 9.05 μm, respectively, suggesting that succinyl-CoA is the preferred substrate for ACOT4.TABLE ONEKinetic characterization of ACOT4 and ACOT8 with dicarboxylyl-CoA estersACOT4ACOT8VmaxKmVmaxKmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgμmMalonyl-CoAN.D.N.D.0.7838.7Succinyl-CoA3.98 ± 0.1613.3 ± 1.320.8234.7Glutaryl-CoA1.14 ± 0.1637.1 ± 9.052.3515.9Adipyl-CoAN.D.N.D.3.4021.8Suberyl-CoAN.D.N.D.4.1319.8Sebacyl-CoAN.D.N.D.3.8210.5Dodecanedioyl-CoAN.D.N.D.5.0314.1 Open table in a new tab Acot4 and Acot8 Both Hydrolyze Dicarboxylyl-CoAs but with Different Specificities—ACOT8 was recently characterized as a broad range acyl-CoA thioesterase showing activity with all acyl-CoAs tested (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, acyl-CoA thioesterase activity for dicarboxylyl-CoAs other than malonyl-CoA was not tested at that time, and we therefore expressed ACOT8 to reinvestigate the activity with dicarboxylyl-CoAs ranging from malonyl-CoA to dodecanedioyl-CoA. ACOT8 was active on all the dicarboxylyl-CoAs tested but preferentially hydrolyzed the longer-chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs. Enzyme kinetics were calculated (TABLE ONE) and show that whereas ACOT8 readily hydrolyzes CoA esters from glutaryl-CoA to dodecanedioyl-CoA, ACOT4 only hydrolyzes succinyl-CoA efficiently (with high Vmax and low Km). The differences in substrate specificity are highlighted when compared at a fixed concentration of 25 μm, as shown in Fig. 3. We showed previously that ACOT8 activity is strongly regulated by free CoASH (14.Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and, therefore, we also tested the effect of adding CoASH on the succinyl-CoA thioesterase activity of ACOT4. However, the addition of CoASH at concentrations up to 500 μm had no effect on ACOT4 activity (data not shown). Acot4 Is Mainly Expressed in Kidney and Liver—Tissue expression of Acot4 at the mRNA level was examined using Q-PCR with RNA isolated from several tissues. The Q-PCR data showed that Acot4 is most strongly expressed in kidney, followed by liver and proximal and distal intestines (Fig. 4). The expression was 20% or less in all other tissues tested, compared with kidney. Acot4 Expression Is Regulated via PPARα—Previous Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of Acot4 is up-regulated in mouse liver following clofibrate treatment (33.Hunt M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2120734076,"This study presents the first three-dimensional structures of human cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase (hBCATc) isozyme complexed with the neuroactive drug gabapentin, the hBCATc Michaelis complex with the substrate analog, 4-methylvalerate, and the mitochondrial isozyme (hBCATm) complexed with gabapentin. The branched-chain aminotransferases (BCAT) reversibly catalyze transamination of the essential branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) to α-ketoglutarate to form the respective branched-chain α-keto acids and glutamate. The cytosolic isozyme is the predominant BCAT found in the nervous system, and only hBCATc is inhibited by gabapentin. Pre-steady state kinetics show that 1.3 mm gabapentin can completely inhibit the binding of leucine to reduced hBCATc, whereas 65.4 mm gabapentin is required to inhibit leucine binding to hBCATm. Structural analysis shows that the bulky gabapentin is enclosed in the active-site cavity by the shift of a flexible loop that enlarges the active-site cavity. The specificity of gabapentin for the cytosolic isozyme is ascribed at least in part to the location of the interdomain loop and the relative orientation between the small and large domain which is different from these relationships in the mitochondrial isozyme. Both isozymes contain a CXXC center and form a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions. The structure of reduced hBCATc was obtained by soaking the oxidized hBCATc crystals with dithiothreitol. The close similarity in active-site structures between cytosolic enzyme complexes in the oxidized and reduced states is consistent with the small effect of oxidation on pre-steady state kinetics of the hBCATc first half-reaction. However, these kinetic data do not explain the inactivation of hBCATm by oxidation of the CXXC center.

Human mitochondrial BCATm (hBCATm) is expressed ubiquitously in body tissues, whereas human cytosolic BCATc (hBCATc) is found primarily in the nervous system (5Hutson S.M. J.

In fact, hBCATc is the predominant isozyme in brain, accounting for 60-70% of total brain BCAT activity (8Hall T.R. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol.

Enzymes belonging to fold-type I-III classes shuttle protons on the si-face of the planar π-system of the substrate-cofactor complex. The mammalian BCATs are homodimers with subunit molecular masses ranging from ∼41,000 to 46,000 Da. The molecular mass of the hBCATc subunit is 42,800 Da; each monomer consists of 385 amino acid residues and requires one PLP as cofactor (19Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D.

The overall structures of these enzymes as homodimers (the dimeric unit of the hexamer in eBCAT) are similar.Steady state kinetic analysis of the BCAT isozymes shows they have the same substrate specificity; nevertheless, there are subtle differences in catalytic efficiency with individual substrates (8Hall T.R. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3092-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, the steady state kcat values for hBCATc are higher than for hBCATm (19Davoodi J. Drown P.M.

A more striking difference between hBCATc and hBCATm is the sensitivity of the different isozymes to inhibition by the neuroactive drug gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid) (Scheme 1) (15Hutson S.M. Berkich D. Drown P. Xu B. Aschner M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Gabapentin is used widely for seizure control (28Andrews J. Chadwick D.

Med. 2004; 10: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). One theory of gabapentin action, the metabolic hypothesis, suggests that gabapentin interferes with neurotransmitter glutamate synthesis via inhibition of branched-chain amino acid transamination (15Hutson S.M. Berkich D. Drown P. Xu B. Aschner M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32Welty D.F. Schielke G.P. Rothstein J.D. Ann. Pharmacother. 1995; 29: 1164-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was shown by Hutson and coworkers (15Hutson S.M. Berkich D. Drown P. Xu B. Aschner M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that gabapentin is a competitive inhibitor of hBCATc with a Ki similar to the Km for leucine. The drug is not an effective inhibitor of hBCATm. Understanding the structural basis for the specificity of gabapentin for hBCATc and kinetic differences in the two isozymes has been hindered by the lack of structural information for both hBCATs.Another feature of the BCATs is a consensus sequence, a CXXC motif, which is conserved in the mammalian proteins but not in lower eukaryotes or prokaryotes or in other fold-type IV PLP enzymes (25Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9070-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In hBCATm, the CXXC motif is in the vicinity of the phosphate group of the cofactor PLP (25Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structures of the PLP form of hBCATm and reaction intermediates show that the cysteine residues in the CXXC center, Cys-315 and Cys-318, share a hydrogen bond (25Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that these residues can form an intrasubunit disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions and that Cys-315 is the peroxide-reactive thiol(ate) functioning as the redox sensor in the regulation of hBCATm (34Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second cysteine, Cys-318, subsequently reacts with the nascent sulfenic acid form of Cys-315, forming a disulfide bond and permitting reversible regulation by preventing over-oxidation of hBCATm and irreversible loss of enzyme activity (34Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Less is known about the role of this center in hBCATc.The crystal structures of native hBCATm and hBCATm complexed with substrates have shed light on the “cofactor-substrate-protein” interaction, the behavior of the CXXC motif, and the reaction pathway of the catalytic reaction (25Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Yennawar N. Dunbar J. Conway M. Hutson S. Farber G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we report the first three-dimensional structures of hBCATc complexed with gabapentin in the oxidized (hBCATc-ox·gabapentin) and reduced states (hBCATc·gabapentin) at 1.9 and 2.4 Å of resolution, respectively, the structure of the hBCATm complexed with gabapentin in the reduced state (hBCATm·gabapentin) at 1.8 Å resolution, and hBCATc complexed with the substrate analogue, 4-methylvalerate (4MeVA) at 2.1 Å of resolution. These are the first structures of the gabapentin complexes of the mammalian BCATs. A structural comparison of these complexes provided insight into the molecular basis for the specificity of BCATc for gabapentin, which is bulkier than 4MeVA, and the differential sensitivity of the catalytic activity of the hBCAT isozymes to the redox state of the CXXC center.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization and Data Collection—The expression of hBCATc and the purification of the expressed enzyme have been reported (19Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All crystallization trials were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 277 K. Drops were prepared by mixing 3 μl of the protein solution (9 mg/ml, 10 mm 3-phenylpropionate (3PP)) with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 and 200 mm MgCl2. Two weeks after the drop was set up for crystallization at 277 K, minute crystals of hBCATc complexed with 3PP appeared and within another month grew to chunky yellow colored crystals with the space group P212121, cell dimensions of a = 66.8 Å, b = 106.4 Å, and c = 109.9 Å and with one dimer in the asymmetric unit. Approximately 37% of the crystal volume was occupied by the solvent (35Matthews B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar). Because many trials for crystallization were unsuccessful without 3PP, the addition of 3PP to the protein solution was a critical factor in producing crystals. After the initial structure of hBCATc·3PP was determined, two cysteine residues, Cys-335 and Cys-338, were found to form a disulfide bond, indicating that the purified enzyme was in the oxidized state of the CXXC motif (hBCATc-ox·3PP). Crystals of hBCATc-ox·gabapentin and hBCATc-ox·4MeVA were obtained at 293 K by soaking hBCATc-ox·3PP crystals in solutions containing 10 mm gabapentin or 4MeVA, respectively, for a day before data collection. Crystals of hBCATc·gabapentin in the reduced form were obtained at 293 K by soaking hBCATc-ox·3PP crystals in solutions containing 10 mm gabapentin and 2 mm DTT. Similarly, hBCATc-ox·3PP crystals were soaked in solution containing 4MeVA and DTT. However, 4MeVA complex crystals were not in the reduced form but in the oxidized form.The expression of mature hBCATm in E. coli, removal of the histidine tag by thrombin cleavage, and purification of the expressed enzyme have been reported (19Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Conway M. Hutson S.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of hBCATm were obtained using the vapor diffusion method of hanging drops at 298 K. The drop consisted of 5 μl of hBCATm solution in the PLP form and 5 μl of the reservoir. The drop was equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir. The protein solution contained 2.5 mg/ml hBCATm in a solution of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20 mm DTT, and 50 mm EDTA. Yellow crystals grew readily in about 1-2 week in several conditions using the Hampton crystallization reagent kit. They were optimized in grids set up with 22-30% polyethylene glycol 1500, 100 mm HEPES (pH 6.9-7.2), and 20 mm DTT. Crystals of hBCATm·gabapentin in the reduced form were obtained at 293 K by soaking hBCATm crystals in their crystallization solutions with 70 mm gabapentin.The x-ray diffraction data sets for hBCATc-ox·3PP, hBCATc-ox·gabapentin, hBCATc·gabapentin, and hBCATc-ox·4MeVA were collected to 1.8, 1.9, 2.4, and 2.1 Å of resolution at 100 K on the BL6A, BL18B, NW12, and BL44B2 stations, respectively, at the Photon Factory, KEK (Tsukuba, Japan) or at the SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) using an x-ray beam with a wavelength of 1.0 Å and an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD camera or MarCCD165 camera. All the data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (35Matthews B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar).

DENZO (37Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK were used to reduce the data.Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of hBCATc-ox·3PP was determined with the program AmoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using the previously determined structure of unliganded hBCATm (PDB code 1EKF) in the PLP form (26Yennawar N. Dunbar J. Conway M. Hutson S. Farber G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as a search model. The modeling of the polypeptide chain was performed using the program O (39Jones T. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The structure was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization with the program CNS (40Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). The initial structure for hBCATc-ox·gabapentin was determined with AmoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using the structure of hBCATc-ox·3PP as the search model. When the Rfactor value decreased below 30%, gabapentin was introduced into a peak on a simulated annealing 2Fo - Fc map. Water molecules were picked up on the basis of the peak heights (3.0 σ) and distance criteria (4.0 Å from protein and solvent) from the σ-weighted Fo - Fc map. The water molecules whose thermal factors were above the maximum thermal factor of the main chain after refinement were removed from the list. Further model building and refinement cycles resulted in an Rfactor of 22.1% and an Rfree of 26.8%, calculated for 63,764 reflections (TABLE ONE). During the last step of the refinement, unambiguous water molecules were added including those with a temperature factor higher than 56 Å2. The maximum temperature factor of the water molecules was 62 Å2.The initial structures for hBCATc·gabapentin and hBCATc-ox·4MeVA were determined with AmoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using the structure of hBCATc-ox·3PP as the search model. The same refinement procedure as that used for hBCATc-ox·gabapentin was applied to hBCATc·gabapentin and hBCATc-ox·4MeVA. When the Rfactor value decreased below 30%, gabapentin or 4MeVA (leucine analogue) was introduced into a peak on a simulated annealing 2Fo - Fc map. Further model building and refinement cycles for hBCATc·gabapentin resulted in an Rfactor of 21.3% and an Rfree of 27.2%, calculated for 28,933 reflections. Further model building and refinement cycles for hBCATc-ox·4MeVA resulted in an Rfactor of 22.8% and an Rfree of 29.0%, calculated for 44,715 reflections. The maximum thermal factors (B-factors) of the assigned water molecules in hBCATc·gabapentin and hBCATc-ox·4MeVA were 79 and 68 Å2, respectively.The molecular replacement method was used to solve the hBCATm-gabapentin structure with the earlier solved PLP form as the search probe in the program AMoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), which is part of CCP4 program suite (CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 (1994)). The program CNS (40Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) was then used for all further refinements. The slow cool protocol was used to minimize model bias, and O (41Jones T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 42Kleywegt G. Jones T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) was used for examination and manual adjustment of the structure during the refinement. Several cycles of positional refinement and isotropic B-factor refinement were performed after every model building cycle. The PLP was removed from the initial refinement cycles to get an unbiased view of the active site. Toward the end of the refinement (Rfree 26.8%), σ-weighted difference Fourier maps and 2Fo - Fc maps clearly showed the electron density for gabapentin bound to the active site. The cofactor is seen to be covalently linked to the active-site lysine, Lys-202, and gabapentin was bound as a Michaelis complex. Water molecules were automatically located using CNS and manually checked in O. A total of 341 water molecules and an acetate molecule were modeled into the σ-weighted (2Fo - Fc) maps. Further model building and refinement cycles for hBCATm·gabapentin resulted in an Rfactor of 20.8% and an Rfree of 23.2%, calculated for 68,169 reflections. The refinement parameters with the average B-factors are listed in TABLE ONE.Quality of the Structure—The final model of the hBCATc-ox·gabapentin comprises 358 residues (22-45, 47-193, and 199-385) for subunit 1, 356 residues (24-44, 46-193, and 199-385) for subunit 2, 2 PLPs, 2 gabapentins, and 582 water molecules.

Although the feedback from metabolic consequence is believed to be important, much less is understood. This work demonstrates that the gluconeogenic genes in Escherichia coli, ppsA, sfcA, and maeB, provide a feedback loop to the global regulator, cAMP receptor protein (CRP), in carbon source transition. Disruption of one of the gluconeogenic pathways has no phenotype in balanced growth, but causes a significant delay in the diauxic transition from glucose to acetate. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we measured the transcriptome profiles during the transition using DNA microarray, and network component analysis was employed to obtain the transcription factor activities. Results showed that one of the global regulators, CRP, was insufficiently activated during the transition in the ppsA deletion mutant. Indeed, addition of cAMP partially rescued the delay in transition. These results suggest that the gluconeogenic flux to phosphoenolpyruvate is important for full activation of adenylate cyclase through the phosphorylated enzyme IIAglu of the phosphotransferase system. Reduction of this flux causes insufficient activation of CRP and a global metabolic deficiency, which exemplifies a significant feedback interaction from metabolism to the a global regulatory system.

Bacteria adapt to environmental changes through various signaling pathways and alter the expression of metabolic genes to meet the growth requirements in the new conditions. In this paradigm, regulatory genes, particularly global regulatory genes, are the decision makers that provide unidirectional regulation to the metabolic genes. The feedback from metabolic consequence is much less understood, despite its presumed significance. This work demonstrates an example of such a feedback loop from metabolism to global regulation. When Escherichia coli is grown on excess glucose, acetate is produced and excreted as excess carbon (1Holms H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 85-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the excreted acetate can be consumed as carbon source when glucose level drops (2Shin S. Song S.G. Lee D.S. Pan J.G. Park C. FEMS Microbiol.

During the metabolic switch from glucose to acetate, E. coli induces genes involved in acetate uptake, the glyoxylate shunt, the TCA cycle, as well as the gluconeogenic genes pckA and ppsA in different time scales (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).

In the absence of glucose, CRP is activated by cAMP, which is produced by adenylate cyclase. The activated cAMP-CRP adduct positively regulates a large number of uptake and metabolic genes to prepare for less favorable carbon sources. The induction of the glyoxylate shunt genes in acetate is mediated directly by IclR and IHF (5Resnik E. Pan B. Ramani N. Freundlich M. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2715-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand for IclR activation has not been confirmed. Although phosphoenolpyruvate has been suggested as a ligand for the deactivation of IclR (6Cortay J.C. Negre D. Galinier A. Duclos B. Perriere G. Cozzone A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), another group was not able to show the same result (7Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study originated from an interesting microarray result comparing E. coli transcript levels in acetate versus glucose minimal media during balanced growth (8Oh M.K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gluconeogenic gene, ppsA, which is known to be non-essential for growth in acetate, is one of the most up-regulated genes in acetate compared with glucose growth. Indeed, disruption of ppsA has no observable phenotype in acetate or glucose minimal media under balanced growth. Then, why does E. coli need to induce a non-essential gene to such a high level? In this work, we first found that ppsA is important during the transition state between glucose and acetate, although not essential in balanced growths in either carbon source. The ppsA mutant caused a significant lag during the diauxic transition. Through whole genome transcriptome profiling and network component analysis (NCA) (9Liao J.C. Boscolo R. Yang Y.L. Tran L.M. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 10Tran L.M. Brynildsen M.P. Kao K.C. Suen J.K. Liao J.C. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we identified that CRP is insufficiently activated without ppsA during glucose to acetate transition. Disruption of other pathway genes to PEP also showed the same phenotype, suggesting that the PEP supply during the transition state is the regulatory return loop from metabolism to modulate cAMP production. Insufficient supply of PEP reduces the phosphorylated crr gene product, EIIAglu, which is the activator of adenylate cyclase. This result demonstrates that the metabolic feedback of the gluconeogenic genes is important in determining transition time regulation, which is closely linked to bacterial survival in a dynamic environment. Strains and Culture Conditions—E. coli BW25113 (F-(araD-araB) lacZ4787 lacIp-4000 LAM-rph-1 (rhaD-rhaB) hsdR514) was obtained from the Yale E. coli stock center and is used for all physiological studies and for monitoring transcript levels unless specified otherwise. Cells were grown in M9 minimum media (11Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing either 0.5% glucose or 0.25% acetate. In the abrupt carbon source transition experiments, cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.5–0.6), chilled quickly in ethanol/dry ice bath, harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g at 4 °C, then rinsed once with 4 °C 0.25% M9 acetate. The cells were reinocuated into 0.25% M9 acetate media pre-warmed to 37 °C with starting A600 of ∼0.2. For gene expression studies, a portion of the cells was harvested as reference samples immersed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the remaining cells were reinoculated into 0.25% M9 acetate media pre-warmed to 37 °C with starting A600 of ∼0.2. Time course samples were collected at specified times by quickly chilling in a ethanol/dry ice bath and harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g at 4 °C. All samples for time-dependent gene expression studies were kept in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at –80 °C for RNA purification at a later time. For cAMP addition experiments, 10 mm cAMP (Sigma) was added to the pre-warmed 0.25% M9 acetate cultures. Deletion Mutation and Plasmid Construction—Each gene was disrupted using the PCR-based method developed by Datsenko and Wanner (12Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, the chloramphenicol resistance gene was PCR amplified from pKD3 using primers containing sequences homologous to the target gene locus. The linear PCR product was transformed into BW25113 containing the λ helper plasmid pKD46 to disrupt the target gene. The chloramphenicol cassette was removed by transforming pCP20 into the resulting deletion mutant strain and selected for transformants with loss of chloramphenicol resistance. Multiple deletion mutants were constructed sequentially. The plasmid pTB108 was constructed from pJF118EH (14Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) by replacing part of the lactose repressor gene, lacI, and the Ptac promoter with the arabinose repressor (araC) coding sequence including its promoter and the arabinose promoter (ParaBAD) from pBAD (Invitrogen) and fusing the ParaBAD to gfpmut3.1, which was amplified from pGFPmut3.1 (15Andersen J.B. Sternberg C. Poulsen L.K. Bjorn S.P. Givskov M. Molin S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2240-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR. The gfpmut3.1 open reading frame is flanked by the unique restriction sites, XbaI on the 5′ end and HindIII on the 3′ end. Each gene was amplified by PCR using the primers listed in TABLE ONE and inserted into pTB108 between XbaI and HindIII to generate pTB108::ppsA, pTB108::pckA, and pTB108::maeB.TABLE ONEPrimers used for cloningPrimerSequence (5′ to 3′)ppsA-for-XbaIaaaaaaatctagaatgtccaacaatggctcgtcppsA-rev-HindIIIaaaaaaaaagcttttatttcttcagttcagccapckA-for-XbaIaaaaaaaaagcttttatttcttcagttcagccapckA-rev-HindIIIaaaaaaaaagcttttacagtttcggaccagccgmaeB-for-NcoIaaaaaaaccatggattaaagaggagaaatctagaatggatgaccagttaaaacaamaeB-rev-HindIIIaaaaaaaaagcttttacagcggttgggtttgcg Open table in a new tab DNA Microarray Design, Procedures, and Data Analysis—The array design, RNA purification, and hybridization procedures were described previously (13Oh M.K.

Each slide contained two spots of the same probe, each sample was hybridized to two slides, and each time course experiment was replicated up to three times. The resulting images were scanned using a VersArray ChipReader High Resolution (5 um) (Bio-Rad) scanner at two excitation wavelengths (532 nm for Cy3 and 635 nm for Cy5). The two scanned images were analyzed using the image analysis software, Imagene (Biodiscovery, Marina Del Rey, CA). The median intensities for signal and background were obtained from the software and used for downstream analysis. The software package, lcDNA (16Hyduke D.R. Rohlin L. Kao K.C. Liao J.C. Omics. 2003; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), developed by our laboratory based on methods described in Tseng et al. (17Tseng G.C. Oh M.K. Rohlin L. Liao J.C. Wong W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), was used to normalize the data and calculate the 97.5 and 2.5 quantiles of gene expression, and to assess the significance of expression for each gene. The resulting averaged value of the 97.5 and 2.5 quantiles for each normalized log ratio was used for subsequent analysis. Transcription Factor Activity Analysis—NCA was used to reconstruct the transcription factor activities (TFA) and control strengths (CS) from DNA microarray data (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R.

Genome Informatics. 2003; 14: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar, 19Savageau M.A. Biochemical Systems Analysis: A Study of Function and Design in Molecular Biology. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA1976Google Scholar), [E]=[CS]·[TFA](Eq. 1) where [E] is the matrix of log (base 10) gene expression ratio, [TFA]is the log ratio of transcription factor activities, and [CS] is the matrix of control strengths. The NCA decomposition of [E] into [CS] and [TFA] is based on the topology of [CS], which is the existence of connection between transcription factors and their regulated genes. These connectivity relationships in E. coli were obtained from RegulonDB (20Salgado H. Santos-Zavaleta A. Gama-Castro S. Millan-Zarate D. Diaz-Peredo E. Sanchez-Solano F. Perez-Rueda E. Bonavides-Martinez C. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with additional modifications obtained from literature and experiments (the connectivity information used can be found at www.seas.ucla.edu/∼liaoj/), which includes 834 genes regulated by 124 transcription factors. However, not all the genes showed differential transcript abundance, and thus the transcription factors whose regulons were deemed unperturbed were eliminated from the analysis. The final NCA network that satisfied the first 2 criteria was composed of 302 genes regulated by 34 transcription factors. The network was analyzed independently for different datasets. Because we scaled the solution sets such that absolute averages of the control strengths were equal to 1 (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Liao J.C. Boscolo R. Yang Y.L. Tran L.M. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the TFAs of the same transcription factor were in the same scale and comparable. NCA software are available from the web site (www.seas.ucla.edu/∼liaoj/). A ppsA deletion mutant in BW25113 was generated using a PCR-based method developed by Datsenko et al. (12Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). We first compared the growth kinetics of the ppsA mutant strain with its otherwise isogenic parent in glucose and acetate minimum media. No growth rate difference was detected between the two strains (Fig. 2, a and b). However, if both glucose and acetate were present simultaneously, we observed a significantly longer diauxic lag in the ppsA strain than the parent (Fig. 2c). Thus, ppsA may be involved in the transition time regulation. To focus on the carbon source transition, we designed an abrupt carbon source transition experiment as described under “Materials and Methods.” Such experiments yield better reproducible transition time (Fig. 2d). To eliminate the possibility that this is a strain-dependent phenomenon, we also deleted the ppsA gene in another E. coli K-12 strain, MC4100, and found that the ppsA mutant strain in MC4100 also exhibited a longer growth lag during the transient state between glucose and acetate (data not shown). Note that the ppsA mutant was constructed by removing the whole open reading frame of the ppsA gene, thus the possibility of a revertant is practically eliminated. Another explanation for why the ppsA mutant strain was able to resume growth after a long lag is the possibility that it acquired a second-site suppressor mutation that allowed it to exhibit the wild-type phenotype. Therefore, we took samples of the ppsA mutant strain after the glucose to acetate transition experiment and conducted a second round of carbon source transition. Again, the ppsA mutant strain exhibits the same phenotype after a second passage, suggesting the phenomenon is not a result of a second-site mutation. To confirm that the decreased ability of the ppsA mutant strain to adapt to acetate is because of lack of a functional ppsA gene and not an artifact of the strain construction, a vector was constructed to express a functional copy the ppsA gene in trans from a plasmid (pTB108::ppsA). The presence of pTB108::ppsA in the ppsA mutant strain was able to complement the longer growth lag exhibited by the ppsA mutant strain (data not shown). Because pckA and ppsA form parallel pathways from the TCA cycle to PEP, we tested whether the pckA deletion mutation caused a similar phenotype as the ppsA mutant during the glucose to acetate transition. The pckA deletion mutant exhibited no growth phenotype during balanced growth in either glucose or acetate. However, unlike ppsA, the pckA deletion mutant exhibited no significant growth phenotype from wild-type during the glucose to acetate transition (Fig. 3). The dependence of pckA appears to be strain dependent as a prolonged growth lag was observed in a pckA deletion mutant in an MC4100 strain during the carbon source transition (Fig. 3d). Note that it has been suggested that pckA is the main gluconeogenic gene for growth in acetate metabolism (1Holms H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 85-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the relative importance of the pckA and ppsA pathways are strain-dependent. Similarity between the Wild-type and the ppsA Mutant—To probe the transcriptional regulations involved in the ppsA mutant phenotype during the transition from glucose to acetate, the time course expression profiles of BW25113 wild-type and pps strains were monitored using cDNA microarrays spotted with ∼96% of open reading frames in the E. coli genome. The microarray chip design and experimental procedures are described under “Materials and Methods.” Time course experiments were performed for each strain where samples were harvested at times 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after transition. Each time course sample was cohybridized with a reference sample, which was harvested immediately prior to transition into acetate media (designated 0th time sample). Each sample was hybridized to duplicate slides. Each experiment was repeated up to three times. The expression ratio, as well as confidence intervals of expression of the time course sample over reference sample, for each gene was determined using the software package lcDNA (16Hyduke D.R. Rohlin L. Kao K.C. Liao J.C. Omics. 2003; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Tseng G.C. Oh M.K. Rohlin L. Liao J.C. Wong W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We previously reported the transcriptional gene expression dynamics for the same wild-type strain (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the wild-type strain, a growth lag of ∼2–3 h is observed during the transient state between glucose and acetate. During this growth lag, transcriptional regulation was highly active with 331 genes induced and 437 genes repressed by at least 2-fold in at least 2 of the 4 time points within the first hour. Even though the ppsA strain exhibited a much longer growth lag, highly active transcriptional regulation was observed in the ppsA strain with a total of 362 gene transcripts increased at least 2-fold and 392 gene transcript decreased at least 2-fold in at least 2 of the 4 time points within the first hour. Several genes known to be involved in acetate metabolism, such as the glyoxylate shunt enzymes (aceBAK) (21Cozzone A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 127-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), acs (2Shin S. Song S.G. Lee D.S. Pan J.G. Park C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pckA (8Oh M.K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and glcB (24Peellicer M.T. Fernandez C. Badia J. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. Baldoma L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1745-1752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed increased transcript levels within 1–2 h of transition for both strains. In fact, acs and pckA were highly induced (>10-fold) within the first 5 min into the transient state in both strains. We reported earlier (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that several of the TCA cycle genes were initially down-regulated in the wild-type strain within the first hour of transition. The same trend in gene expression were also observed in the ppsA strain. As a control, we performed a similar transition experiment from glucose to glucose instead of glucose to acetate. Time points were taken at 5, 15, and 30 min after the glucose to glucose transition and gene expression profiles were measured using DNA microarrays. These TCA cycle genes were not affected in the sham transition experiment, verifying that the down-regulation of these genes were not a result of the transition treatment. Roughly 110 genes were perturbed total in the sham transition experiment. Surprisingly, several genes involved in the translational machinery (e.g. rplKA and rplCDW) showed increased expression, and the stress-related genes dps showed decreased transcript levels during the sham experiment, suggesting the transitional treatment did not cause significant stress to the cell. Comparison between the post-transition (t > 0) and pre-transition samples (t = 0) revealed an overall down-regulation of the translational machinery (e.g. rplNXFRO, rpsE, rpmOJ, and rplKA). Both the wild-type and the ppsA strains showed reduced transcript levels in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway genes (e.g. thrAC, hisIHDC), as well as the nucleotide biosynthesis genes (e.g. purA, purB, purF, guaBA), during the initial stages of transition from glucose to acetate. Exceptions include the cysteine biosynthesis genes (e.g. cysE, cysM, cysK). On the contrary, several carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes (e.g. rbsABD, malGF) were induced in both strains, likely as a means to scavenge other carbon sources in the absence of glucose. Among the genes that were up-regulated in both strains within the initial hour of transition, roughly 45% code for hypothetical proteins or proteins of putative functions. Transition from glucose to acetate resulted in the induction of several genes known to be involved in acid resistance, such as xasA, yhiE, and hdeAB. The recently identified acetate permease, yjcG, which is cotranscribed with the acetyl-coA synthase gene (acs) (25Gimenez R. Nunez M.F. Badia J. Aguilar J. Baldoma L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6448-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is induced in both strains during the carbon source transition. Two proteins, CobB and Pat, were recently identified in Salmonella enterica to regulate acs activity post-translationally (26Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 27Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The CobB protein is the deacetylase that activates Acs activity, whereas Pat deactivates the ATP-dependent adenylation of acetate by acetylating Acs. In the E. coli glucose to acetate transition, the transcript level of the Pat homolog, b2584, was increased, whereas the transcript of CobB was not differentially regulated during the glucose to acetate transition. Difference between the Wild-type and the ppsA Mutant—From our wild-type gene expression data (4Kao K.C. Yang Y.L. Boscolo R. Sabatti C. Roychowdhury V. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) 3The gene expression data has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE3250. , we found that the ppsA gene was not induced until ∼2–3 h after the cells were shifted to acetate. Thus, we would expect the effect of the ppsA mutation on overall gene expression to be minimal within the first hour after transition and increase as the cells respond to the lack of this gluconeogenic pathway. Indeed, in the first hour within the transient state, the expression profiles of ppsA and wild-type strains were very similar, with the Pearson correlation coefficients around 0.9. Between 2 and 6 h during the carbon source switch, the Pearson correlation coefficient between wild-type and ppsA strains decreases from 0.7 to 0.5. This decrease in correlation coefficient between the two strains is partly because of the growth related differences between them. For example, the transcript levels of genes involved in the translational machinery (e.g. rplNXFRO, rpsE, rpmDJ, rplKA), which were initially reduced in both strains, stayed reduced longer in the ppsA mutant strain. The same trend is observed in some genes involved in biosynthesis such as the threonine biosynthesis genes (e.g. thrABC). Most TCA cycle genes were up-regulated with in 2 h of transition for both strains (Fig. 4). However, one notable exception, the malate dehydrogenase gene, mdh, whose induction is observed with in 4 h of transition in the wild-type strain but not until within 10 h of transition in the ppsA mutant strain. In addition, the gene expression of the NADP-linked malic enzyme (maeB) was significantly differentially regulated between the wild-type and ppsA strains (Fig. 4a). The DNA-binding protein from starved cells, Dps, is a nucleoid protein involved in the survival of E. coli under various environmental conditions including long term stationary phase survival, oxidative stress, acidic and alkaline pH conditions (28Nair S. Finkel S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4192-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The gene expression of dps is regulated by the stationary σ factor, OxyR, and IHF (29Altuvia S. Almiron M. Huisman G. Kolter R. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). During the glucose to acetate transition, the dps transcript level is increased in both wild-type and ppsA mutant strains. However, the induction of dps transcription in the wild-type strain decreased as the cells resumed growth by time = 4 h after the carbon source transition, whereas it remained induced in the ppsA strain. This prolonged induction of the dps transcript level may be indicative of a prolonged stress in the ppsA mutant strain during the glucose to acetate transition. The genes involved in acetate metabolism are under the control of various transcriptional regulators, such as CRP, FruR (Cra), IclR, FIS, IHF, RpoS, FNR, and ArcA. Because these regulators respond to different signals, it is difficult to decipher which ones malfunctioned because of ppsA deletion. Thus, NCA (9Liao J.C. Boscolo R. Yang Y.L. Tran L.M. Sabatti C.

NCA combines microarray data with regulator-promoter binding data from RegulonDB (20Salgado H. Santos-Zavaleta A. Gama-Castro S. Millan-Zarate D. Diaz-Peredo E. Sanchez-Solano F. Perez-Rueda E.

PMT also activates RhoA and RhoA-dependent pathways. Using YM-254890, a specific inhibitor of Gq/11, we studied whether activation of RhoA involves G proteins other than Gq/11. YM-254890 inhibited PMT or muscarinic M3-receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase Cβ at similar concentrations in HEK293m3 cells. In these cells, PMT-induced RhoA activation and enhancement of RhoA-dependent luciferase activity were partially inhibited by YM-254890. In Gαq/11-deficient fibroblasts, PMT induced activation of RhoA, increase in RhoA-dependent luciferase activity, and increase in ERK phosphorylation. None of these effects were influenced by YM-254890. However, RhoA activation by PMT was inhibited by RGS2, RGS16, lscRGS, and dominant negative G13GA, indicating involvement of Gα12/13 in the PMT effect on RhoA. In Gα12/13 gene-deficient cells, PMT-induced stimulation of RhoA, luciferase activity, and ERK phosphorylation were blocked by YM-254890, indicating the involvement of Gq. Infection with a virus harboring the gene of Gα13 reconstituted the increase in RhoA-dependent luciferase activity by PMT even in the presence of YM-254890.

An important biochemical effect of the toxin is the activation of PLCβ (2Staddon J.M. Barker C.J. Murphy A.C. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Michell R.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This action is most likely caused by activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq (3Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Besides studies with antibodies, gene deletion studies demonstrated that the Gαq subunit is crucially involved in PMT action (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the action of PMT is characterized by the ability to differentiate between Gαq and Gα11, although both GTPases are ∼89% identical (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that this specificity is harbored in the helical domain of the Gα subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins (5Orth J.H. Lang S. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34150-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, so far, the precise mechanism of the action of this toxin is not clear. P. multocida toxin activates RhoA signaling pathways. The toxin induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of stress fibers (6Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Dudet L.I. Chailler P. Dubreuil D. Martineau-Doize B. J. Cell.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 5640-5646PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the direct activation of RhoA induced by PMT has been demonstrated using pull-down assays with Rho-binding effectors, which exclusively interact with the GTP-bound form of the GTPase (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have reported that RhoA is activated via signal pathways involving various types of G proteins, including G12/13 and Gq/11. First, Buhl et al. (9Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) have reported that Gα12/13 is involved in RhoA-mediated stress fiber formation. Subsequently it was shown that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF directly interacts with Gα13 to activate RhoA (10Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Also, the RhoA GEFs LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF have been shown to activate RhoA mediated by G12/13 (13Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant active (GTPase-deficient) Gα12 and Gα13 induces RhoA activation in various cell types (15Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of membrane receptors, which couple to G12/13 and Gq/11 proteins by agonists such as thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid, has been shown to induce RhoA-dependent stress fiber formation even in Gαq/11-deficient cells (17Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Other findings indicate that RhoA is also activated via Gq/11. This has been most convincingly demonstrated in Gα12/13-deficient cells. Agonists that couple to both the Gq/11 and G12/13 families of G proteins are able to activate RhoA even in the absence of Gα12 and Gα13 (18Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, the GEF LARG has been shown to interact not only with G12/13 but also with Gq/11 (19Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF has been described that activates RhoA via Gq/11 (20Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Yang Y. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. Schmidt M. Wieland T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11134-11139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this GEF protein appears to be specific for Gq/11 and does not interact with G12/13. Here we studied whether the PMT-induced activation of RhoA is mediated via Gq/11 and/or via G12/13. This is an important question, because PMT is frequently used as a tool to specifically activate Gq signal pathways (21Sleight S. Wilson B.A. Heimark D.B. Larner J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Wilson B.A. Ho M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our findings show that PMT acts on RhoA via both Gq and G12/13 signal pathways and indicate that PMT not only activates Gq but also G12/13. Materials—3H-labeled inositol was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PCR primers were from Hermann GbR Synthetische Biomoleküle (Freiburg, Germany). Inositol-free modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Cell-concepts (Umkirch, Germany). The QuikChange kit was from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Plasmids and Retroviral Vector Construction—The plasmid containing the construct of Gα13GA was a kind gift of Dr. S. Offermanns (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). The plasmids pMD-G and pMD-g/p (24Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Mulligan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The plasmid pLNCX2 was purchased from Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). The retroviral transfer vector Gα13wt-pLNCX2 was generated using standard cloning techniques and site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA constructs of RGS2, RGS16, and lscRGS were a kind gift of Dr. T. Wieland (Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Fakultät für Klinische Medizin Mannheim, Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). The cDNA was cloned into the pCMV-HA mammalian expression vector, which expresses an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. Cell Culture, Virus Production, and Transduction—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13 gene-deficient or wild-type (wt) mice were cultured as described previously (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The retroviral vector was produced as described previously (26Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.-X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pMD-G, pMD-g/p, and the retroviral transfer vector. The calcium phosphate method was used. The supernatant was collected after 4 days and centrifuged to spin down cellular debris. The virus-containing medium was filtered and ultracentrifuged to concentrate the retrovirus. Cells were infected in the presence of Polybrene. The expression was monitored by Western blot analysis. Additional transfection of the pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL.TK control reporter vector was done with the Nucleofection system (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the general protocol for nucleofection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. HEK293m3 cells, which stably express the muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor (27Schmidt M. Fasselt B. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Wieland T. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), were transfected using the jetPEI-transfection kit from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Assay of SRF Activation—HEK293m3 cells seeded on 96-well plates were co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmid together with the pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL.TK control reporter vector. pSRE.L encodes for firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase; the expression is induced by the activation of SRF. pRL.TK encodes for Renilla (Renilla reniformis) luciferase, which is expressed constitutively. This control reporter provides an internal control that serves as the base-line response. The plasmids pSRE.L and pRL.TK were a kind gift of Dr. R. Treisman (Transcription Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London, England). Gαq/11- or Gα12/13-deficient MEFs were seeded after transfection on 12-well plates. Cultures were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation with PMT or carbachol for an additional 20 h and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). Luciferase activities were determined with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of the experimental reporter was normalized against the activity of the control vector. Pull-down Experiments—The Rho-binding region, encoding the N-terminal 90 amino acids of rhotekin (rhotekin pull-down) was expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:40 and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration) was added. 2 h after induction, cells were collected and lysed by sonication in rhotekin lysis buffer (20% sucrose, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite, and 2 mm MgCl2) and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Loaded beads were washed three times with rhotekin lysis buffer and once with buffer A (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2). Toxin-treated cells were lysed in buffer A. For analysis of the total amount of Rho in the lysates, an aliquot of the volume was taken for Western blot analysis. The lysate was incubated with protein-loaded beads for 1 h at 4°C by head-over-head rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed once with buffer A. Thereafter, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE. RhoA was analyzed by immunoblotting with a specific antibody. Analysis of Total Inositol Phosphates—HEK293m3 cells, Gα12/13-deficient or wt-MEFs, were grown in 24-well plates for 2–3 days. Thereafter, the cultures were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [2-3H]inositol in inositol- and serum-free medium overnight. Subsequently, PMT or carbachol at the indicated concentrations were added at the given time points and incubated for the indicated times. LiCl (20 mm) was added 60 min before the assay was stopped to allow accumulation of inositol phosphates. Thereafter, the medium was replaced by 750 μl of ice-cold formic acid (10 mm, pH 3). After 30 min, the extract was neutralized with 3 ml of NH3 (5 mm, pH 8–9). Analysis of total inositol phosphates was done by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (28Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Determination of ERK Phosphorylation—MEFs were seeded in 12-well plates and serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were incubated with PMT proteins (70 pm) and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 30 μl/well Laemmli sample buffer. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was determined by subsequent immunoblotting with a phosphospecific anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To confirm equal loading of ERK1/2, membranes were stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot Analysis—For Western blotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Gα13 was detected with an anti-Gα13 antibody (Gramsch, Schwabhausen, Germany), and HA-tagged RGS proteins were detected with anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Binding of the second horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody was detected with enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagent (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm luminol (Fluka, St. Gallen, Switzerland), 0.2 mmp-coumaric acid, and 3 mm H2O2). Recently, the novel compound YM-254890, a cyclic peptide, was shown to inhibit specifically the activation of Gq/11 induced by stimulation of Gq/11-coupled heptahelical receptors (29Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We wanted to know whether YM-254890 is also able to inhibit PMT-induced activation of Gq. For this purpose, HEK293m3 cells, which harbor a muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor, were treated with PMT (700 pm) for 4 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of YM-254890. Thereafter, inositol phosphate formation was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, YM-254890 inhibited the PMT effect on inositol phosphate accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. A half-maximal and maximal effect of YM-254890 occurred at ∼30 and 300 nm, respectively. At maximally effective concentrations of YM-254890, the PMT-induced inositol phosphate accumulation was completely blocked, suggesting that Gq activation was completely inhibited by the compound. We compared the effect of YM-254890 on PMT-induced inositol phosphate accumulation with the effect of carbachol, which activates PLCβ via M3 receptors in these cells (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of carbachol- and PMT-activated PLCβ occurred at similar concentrations (IC50, 10–100 nm) of YM-254890. Next we used YM-254890 to analyze the signaling pathways of PMT involving RhoA. RhoA is known to be involved in regulation of the gene transcription factor SRF (30Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Although SRF is regulated by various factors, Rho plays a central role. Using a luciferase reporter gene, we exploited the RhoA dependence of stimulation of the serum response element (SRE) by SRF to determine RhoA activation. At first, we studied the activation of luciferase expression in HEK239m3 cells. PMT increased luciferase activity by ∼8–10-fold (Fig. 2A). Also, carbachol, which probably acts on Gαq/11 and on Gα12/13, caused a large stimulation of luciferase activity by ∼20-fold (Fig. 2B). Similarly, as found for inhibition of the PMT-induced inositol phosphate accumulation, we observed inhibition of PMT-increased luciferase activity by YM-254890 in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the involvement of Gq. However, even at high concentrations of YM-254890, which were sufficient for complete inhibition of PLCβ stimulation by PMT or carbachol, a residual luciferase activity remained. This suggested involvement of PMT-stimulated pathways, which could not be blocked by YM-254890. To get further hints for the types of G proteins involved, we studied the effects of various regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) on PMT-induced increase in luciferase activity. Therefore, RGS2 and RGS16 (which interact with Gq/11 and Gi) and lscRGS (which is suggested to exclusively interact with Gα12/13) were overexpressed in HEK293m3 cells (31Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). RGS2 and RGS16 expression blocked the PMT effect by ∼40–60%, respectively (Fig. 3). Also, expression of lscRGS, which specifically interacts with Gα12/13, reduced PMT-stimulated luciferase activity by 50%. These findings suggest that G12/13 is involved in SRF-induced luciferase activation by PMT. Overexpression of dominant negative Gα proteins is another approach to interference with G protein-mediated signaling. We expressed dominant negative Gα13GA, which is not able to release βγ-subunits (33Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in HEK293m3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, Gα13GA reduced PMT-induced increase in luciferase activity by ∼70%. Interestingly, the addition of the Gq/11 inhibitor YM-254890 further decreased inhibition.FIGURE 4Expression of dominant negative Gα13GA protein decreases PMT-induced SRF activation and abolishes it in combination with YM-254890.A, luciferase production was measured in HEK293m3 cells transfected with pSRE.L, pRL.TK, and control vectors alone (con) or Gα13GA (50 ng of DNA/well each). Before the assay, the cells were treated with or without YM-254860 (1 μm) for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were stimulated for 24 h with PMT (700 pm). Shown is the fold stimulation of luciferase as compared with controls. Data are given as mean ± S.E.

At first, we studied the activation of RhoA by PMT, using the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin in pull-down assays with Gα12/13- and Gαq/11-deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, in Gαq/11-deficient cells, PMT increased pull-down of the RhoA-rhotekin-Rho-binding domain complex, indicating activation of the GTPase. As a positive control, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, which activates RhoA by deamidation of glutamine 63 (34Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), was tested. Notably, PMT and cytotoxic necrotizing factor stimulated Rho to the same extent. Also, in Gα12/13-deficient cells, PMT induced a significant activation of RhoA. However, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 was much more potent than PMT in RhoA activation in Gα12/13-deficient cells. By contrast, the activity of PMT on wild-type and Gα12/13-deficient cells was similar in respect to inositol phosphate accumulation, indicating that both cell types did not differ in toxin binding and/or uptake. Next, we studied the influence of YM-254890 on RhoA activation in Gαq/11- and Gα12/13-deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 6, in Gαq/11-deficient cells, increasing the concentration of YM-254890 did not affect the pull-down of active RhoA. In line with the hypothesis that YM-254890 acts only on Gq/11, this finding showed directly that G12/13 is not a target for YM-254890. By contrast, in Gα12/13-deficient cells, stimulation of RhoA by PMT was clearly inhibited by YM-254890, indicating that, in these cells, activation of RhoA by the toxin depends on Gq.FIGURE 6YM-254890 inhibits PMT-induced activation of Rho in Gα12/13-deficient MEF but not in Gαq/11-deficient MEF. The level of activated RhoA and total RhoA were determined in Gαq/11-deficient MEF (A) and Gα12/13-deficient MEF (B). YM-254890 was added at the indicated concentrations to the medium. After 30 min of incubation, PMT (70 pm) was added for a further 3 h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed and pull-down experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.

Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2239-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of YM-254890 on PMT-induced ERK phosphorylation in Gαq/11- and Gα12/13-deficient cells. In Gα12/13-deficient cells, PMT caused a strong activation of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 7). YM-254890 blocked the ERK activation in a concentration-dependent manner. At 1 μm, YM-254890 ERK activation was strongly blocked. When the ERK activation was studied in Gαq/11-deficient cells, stimulation by PMT was also observed. However, YM-254890 did not elicit any inhibition on phosphorylation of ERK in Gαq/11-deficient cells. Next, we studied the effects of YM-254890 on PMT-induced luciferase expression and activation in Gαq/11- and Gα12/13-deficient cells. Unfortunately, in Gαq/11-deficient cells, PMT-stimulated luciferase activation was only 2-fold (Fig. 8). The addition of YM-254890 did not reduce the luciferase activation by PMT, indicating the specific action of YM-254890 on Gq/11. By contrast, when the stimulation of luciferase expression was studied in Gα12/13-deficient cells, YM-254890 completely blocked PMT-induced increase in luciferase activity, which was up to 20-fold in these cells, indicating signaling via Gq (Fig. 8B). Finally, we studied whether the introduction of G13wt into Gα12/13-deficient cells was able to specifically reconstitute PMT-induced stimulation of luciferase expression. For this purpose, cells were infected with virus harboring the gene of wild-type Gα13wt. Thereafter, the cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter gene and subsequently treated with PMT in the presence of YM-254890 to block activation of Gq/11. As shown in Fig. 9A, infection of Gα12/13-deficient cells with virus containing the Gα13wt gene reconstituted PMT-induced stimulation of luciferase activity even in the presence of YM-254890, indicating that PMT activates G13.FIGURE 9Gα13 reconstitutes PMT-induced SRF activation in YM-254890-treated Gα12/13-deficient MEF. Gα12/13-deficient MEFs were infected with Gα wt13 encoding retrovirus and subsequently transfected with pSRE.L and pRL.TK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, luciferase production was measured after pretreatment with 1 μm YM-254890 for 30 min and the addition of PMT (700 pm) overnight. Shown is the fold stimulation of luciferase as compared with controls. Data are given as mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Experiments were performed at least three times with similar results.

At least the latter effect is clearly attributed to toxin-caused activation of Gq (3Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Notably, PMT acts on Gαq but not on Gα11, although both proteins are ∼89% identical (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly surprising is the recent finding that the helical domain of Gαq is essential for the PMT effect (5Orth J.H. Lang S. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34150-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies suggest that PMT not only acts on Gαq but also on other heterotrimeric G proteins. For example, it was observed that, in Gαq gene-deficient cells, PMT activates mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK and stimulates RhoA (4Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that PMT also causes activation of G12/13-mediated signal pathways. To differentiate between Gq- and G12/13-mediated signaling, we made use of the cyclic peptide YM-254890, which is a highly specific inhibitor of receptor-mediated activation of Gq/11 (29Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). YM-254890 blocked completely the activation of PLCβ by PMT, which is in line with the view that inositol phosphate accumulation induced by PMT is exclusively dependent on Gq (5Orth J.H. Lang S. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34150-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that YM-254890 acts on the activation step of Gαq. In the model by Takasaki et al. (29Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), binding of GTP to Gαq is inhibited by YM-254890. Our finding that YM-254890 inhibits the effect of PMT on inositol phosphate accumulation suggests that nucleotide binding to Gαq is also crucial for the effect of PMT and indicates that the action of the protein toxin on the G protein does not block the interaction of Gαq with YM-254890. In line with this hypothesis is the finding that even pretreatment of cells with PMT did not prevent YM-254890-induced inhibition of inositol phosphate accumulation (data not shown). Moreover, the studies indicate that YM-254890 is a powerful tool in studying signal transduction pathways induced by PMT, because the compound allows inhibition of Gq/11-mediated effects. It has been reported by many groups that RhoA is involved in SRF-regulated gene transcription (30Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 36Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Using luciferase expression as a reporter system, we studied SRF activation in HEK293m3 cells. We observed that PMT caused a strong increase in luciferase activity in these cells. This effect may be due to activation of RhoA by the toxin. The increase in SRF activity was inhibited by YM-254890, suggesting an effect involving Gq. Although RhoA is important for SRF activation, one has to consider that SRF is likely to be regulated by other factors including calcium (40Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PMT-induced PLC activation via Gq and subsequent calcium mobilization may participate in this effect. In addition to YM-254890, we observed the inhibition of PMT-stimulated luciferase activity by overexpression of RGS2, RGS16, and lscRGS. RGS2 acts on Gi and Gq/11 but preferentially on Gq/11 (41Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RGS16 acts on Gi and Gq/11 (31Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). lscRGS, the RGS domain of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange protein lsc, appears to be specific for Gα12/13. Thus, studies with RGS proteins indicated that Gα12/13 is involved in PMT-induced increase in luciferase activity. To further study this topic in more detail, we used cells deficient in the genes of Gα12/13 and Gαq/11, respectively. In Gαq/11-deficient cells, Rho protein was strongly activated by PMT, which was shown by a rhotekin pull-down assay. In line with the proposed specificity of YM-254890 (29Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), this activation of RhoA was not affected by compound YM-254890. Similarly, the stimulation of RhoA-dependent luciferase activity by PMT was not affected by YM-254890 in cells, which did not possess Gαq/11, the targets of YM-254890. By contrast, expression of dominant negative Gα13GA reduced Rho-dependent luciferase activation by PMT in these cells. This dominant negative construct is suggested to block activation of G13GA by its inability to release the β/γ-subunits (33Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that G13GA binds tightly to respective G12/13-coupled heptahelical receptors thereby preventing activation of RhoA through G12 and G13 proteins (17Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 44Gohla A. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Again, this shows that Gα12/13 is crucial for PMT-induced RhoA-dependent luciferase activation. ERK activation by PMT was suggested to occur via Gq/11-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (35Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley W.E. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2239-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Also, in Gαq/11-deficient cells, PMT caused activation of ERK, indicating that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway occurs independent of Gq/11. The finding that YM-254890 had no effect on PMT-induced ERK activation in Gαq/11-deficient cells is in line with this hypothesis and strongly supports the view that this compound is highly specific for Gq/11. Of special interest were studies on the effect of PMT on Gα12/13-deficient cells. In these cells, PMT-induced Rho activation was determined by the rhotekin pull-down assay and by activation of luciferase. YM-254890 completely blocked both effects of PMT. This indicates that the effects were mediated by Gαq. It was shown that Gαq- and Gq-coupled receptors effectively activate RhoA (45Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This activation appears not to be mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which were shown to couple G12/13 to RhoA activation similar to p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG (45Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, recently a novel GEF (p63RhoGEF) has been identified, which selectively interacts with Gq (20Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Yang Y. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. Schmidt M. Wieland T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11134-11139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This is a strong candidate for the PMT-induced activation of RhoA via Gq. As expected, in Gα12/13-deficient cells, PMT caused activation of ERK. This activation by PMT was completely blocked by YM-254890. Thus, all of these findings with Gα12/13-deficient cells suggest that no other G proteins than Gq and G12/13 are targets of PMT to induce ERK and/or RhoA activation. Most importantly, when the Gq pathway was blocked by YM-254890, we were able to reconstitute the RhoA-dependent luciferase activation by PMT in Gα12/13-deficient cells after introducing Gα13wt into the cells with virus harboring the gene for the G protein. This finding is another strong indication for the hypothesis that G12/13 is a target of PMT. Taken together, using the novel compound YM-254890, which specifically blocks Gq/11 activation, and by applying cells deficient in the genes for Gαq/11 or Gα12/13, we were able to dissect signaling pathways induced by PMT involving both subgroups of G proteins. We showed that PMT activates RhoA and RhoA-dependent pathways by stimulation of Gαq and by stimulation of Gα12/13. Our findings indicate that the effect of PMT is not specific for Gαq but also involves Gα12/13. We thank Dr. D. Blöcker for help in analysis of activated RhoA."

The group I-like ribozyme, GIR1, liberates the 5′ end of a homing endonuclease messenger RNA in the slime mold Didymium iridis . We demonstrate that this cleavage occurs by a transesterification reaction with the joining of the first and the third nucleotide of the messenger by a 2′,5′-phosphodiester linkage. Thus, a group I-like ribozyme catalyzes an RNA branching reaction similar to the first step of splicing in group II introns and spliceosomal introns. The resulting short lariat, by forming a protective 5′ cap, might have been useful in a primitive RNA world."

Much of the GroPIns produced is excreted into the medium, and external GroPIns can be transported into the yeast cell in times of nutritional stress (phosphate or inositol limitation) via the permease encoded by GIT1 (see Fig. 1) (6Patton-Vogt J.L.

Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was originally isolated based upon its ability to confer growth to an inositol auxotroph supplied with GroPIns as its inositol source (6Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that although inositol limitation up-regulates Git1p transport activity, phosphate limitation does so to a much greater extent and GroPIns can be used as the sole source of phosphate for the cell (7Almaguer C. Cheng W. Nolder C. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31937-31942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The enzyme(s) required for GroPIns catabolism remain uncharacterized.Phosphatidylcholine (PC) deacylation also occurs in S. cerevisiae, resulting in the formation of intracellular and extracellular glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) (Fig. 1). In general, S. cerevisiae produces more internal than external GroPCho (9Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, external GroPCho production increases as the pH of the medium is raised above 5 (11Merkel O. Oskolkova O.V. Raab F. El-Toukhy R. Paltauf F. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, internal GroPCho production increases upon increased flux through the CDP-choline pathway for PC synthesis as a consequence of temperature elevation or choline supplementation (9Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Nte1p, a phospholipase B and homolog of human neuropathy target esterase, is responsible for the production of intracellular GroPCho via PC deacylation (10Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D.

Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is thought to be primarily responsible for the formation of extracellular GroPCho (Fig. 1).As is true for S. cerevisiae, various mammalian cells respond to an increase in PC synthesis by increasing PC deacylation (12Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a conserved role for this degradative pathway in maintaining PC homeostasis. The build-up of GroPCho in the cell has been associated with a number of disease processes, including cancer (15Glunde K. Jie C. Bhujwalla Z.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4270-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer disease (16Walter A. Korth U. Hilgert M. Hartmann J. Weichel O. Fassbender K. Schmitt A. Klein J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, GroPCho has been implicated in diverse cellular functions such as maintenance of renal osmolarity (17Bauernschmitt H.G. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1150: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), inhibition of lysophospholipase activity (18Fallbrook A. Turenne S.D. Mamalias N. Kish S.J. Ross B.M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1635: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Clearly, cell physiology impacts, and is impacted by, GroPCho levels. In turn, the level of GroPCho in the cell is a function of both its formation via PC deacylation and its degradation via glycerophosphodiesterases. Glycerophosphodiesterase encoding genes and glycerophosphodiesterase activities acting upon GroPCho have been reported for several cell types, including Escherichia coli (20Tommassen J. Eiglmeier K.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An understudied aspect of this metabolism is that of the glycerophosphodiesters, such as GroPCho, produced through phospholipid deacylation. Thus, these studies were undertaken to further our knowledge of glycerophosphodiester metabolism in this important model organism. We demonstrate that the protein encoded by YPL110c (here named GDE1) affects glycerophosphocholine levels in the cell, most probably by acting as a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. Furthermore, we report that GroPCho is transported intact into the cell in a manner dependent upon the GroPIns permease, Git1p.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Media—Strains were maintained on YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% glucose). The base medium for experiments was chemically defined synthetic media (4Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lacking inositol (I–). Where indicated, I– medium was supplemented with 75 μm inositol to make I+ medium. For experiments involving the overexpression of GDE1 from the GAL1 promoter (see Fig. 4), the strains were grown in I– medium lacking dextrose but containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose. For experiments involving the addition of exogenous GroPIns or GroPCho (Sigma; catalog number G4007), the base medium was altered by substituting 1g of KCl for 1g of KH2PO4/liter and adding KH2PO4 to a final concentration of 0.2 mm (low Pi) or 10 mm (high Pi) (7Almaguer C. Cheng W. Nolder C. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31937-31942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Strains obtained from Research Genetics (JPV125 and JPV126) were checked by PCR to confirm the expected gene deletion. Strain JPV131 was isolated following tetrad dissection of diploid JPV126. To make the gde1Δ ypl206cΔ (JPV431) double mutant, the KanMX marker of strain JPV125 was exchanged with HIS3 using the marker swap plasmid M4754 (28Voth W.P. Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmid M4754 was digested with NotI, and the released fragment containing HIS3 flanked by regions of the KanMX gene was used to transform JPV125. His+ colonies were checked by PCR to verify integration at the correct location, and the resulting strain was named JPV433. Strain JPV431 was isolated following tetrad dissection of the diploid formed by crossing JPV433 with JPV131 (TABLE ONE).FIGURE 4Overexpression of GDE1 results in reduced intracellular GroPCho upon labeling with [14C]choline. Wild type (wt) and a wild type strain bearing pGAL-GST-GDEl (pGAL-GDEl) were grown to logarithmic phase on 2% raffinose, 2% galactose medium containing 18 μm [14C]choline. Wild type containing multicopy GDE1 (Wt-M) or empty vector (Wt-E) were grown to logarithmic phase in I– medium containing 18 μm [14C]choline.

The 5′ ends of the forward and reverse primers bore 40 nucleotides homologous to the target gene sequences, followed by 20 nucleotides homologous to the plasmid. The underlined sequences are homologous to the target genes: forward primer, 5′-TAA TTG CGA CTT CCA CGT GTT CGC AGG TGG AGC AAT GTT ACA GAA TTC GAG CTC GTT TAA AC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTC TGG AAT GCG ATG ATT GGC AAA GGT TTT TCC GAA CTT CAT ACG CGG AAC CAG ATC CGA TT-3′. The PCR product was transformed (30Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar) into JPV203, and G418-resistant colonies were selected (31Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). To verify integration at the correct location, genomic DNA was isolated and used as template in PCR using forward primer, 5′-TTC TTT CTT TTT ATG CAT CTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CAA CGA CTT GTA GCC AAC ATA-3′. Integration of the PCR module resulted in the following changes in the genomic DNA: (i) deletion of ∼500 bp immediately upstream of the native GDE1 start codon and replacement with the GAL1 promoter and (ii) fusion of the GST gene to the 5′ end of GDE1. The resulting strain was named pGAL-GST-GDE1 (JPV436).Construction of Plasmid B94 Containing Multicopy GDE1—Cosmid 70990 (ATCC) was digested with XbaI and HindIII to release a 5617-bp fragment containing open reading frame YPL110c and a neighboring open reading frame (CAR1). This fragment was ligated into vector YCplac33 (32Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) that had been digested with XbaI and HindIII, creating plasmid B88. Plasmid B88 was digested with XbaI and BglIII to release only open reading frame YPL110c and flanking sequences (900 bp upstream and 488 bp downstream). The released fragment was ligated into the XbaI and BamHI sites of YEplac195 (32Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) to create plasmid B94.[14C]Choline Labeling and Metabolite Analysis—Strains were uniformly labeled by growing in I– medium containing 1 μCi/ml [14C]choline at a concentration of 18 μm. For some experiments, a chase was performed by washing the cells free of label and reinoculating them into I– medium containing 1 mm nonradiolabeled choline. Prior to HPLC analysis of the [14C]choline-labeled metabolites (27Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), water-soluble fractions were processed by extracting three times with water-saturated ether to remove trichloroacetic acid, drying down, and resuspending in solvent A (27Zheng B.

The counts associated with the membranous and water-soluble fractions were determined through trichloroacetic acid extraction as described previously (9Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ion exchange chromatography was employed for the separation of [3H]choline-containing metabolites (33Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Analysis of GroPIns Metabolism—Strains were grown for several generations in I– medium containing either low Pi or no Pi (7Almaguer C. Cheng W. Nolder C. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31937-31942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 5–25 μm [3H]GroPIns. Counts associated with the membranous and water-soluble fractions were determined through trichloroacetic acid extraction as described previously (9Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol.

Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Phospholipid Composition—Wild type and gde1Δ mutant strains were grown to logarithmic phase in I– or I+ media containing 10 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Labeled lipids were extracted (34Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and individual phospholipid species were resolved (35Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The strains were grown in medium in which both inositol and phosphate concentrations were varied (I+ low Pi,I– low Pi,I+ high Pi, and I– high Pi). Disruptions were performed using either glass bead breakage (36Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), detergent lysis using celLytic Y reagent (Sigma), or enzymatic lysis using a celLytic Y plus reagent kit (Sigma) in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or yeast protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma; catalog number P8215). Following disruption, the lysates were centrifuged for either 90,000 × g or 20,000 × g for 1 h. In each experiment, lysates, resuspended pellets, and supernatants were assayed for activity. The basic assay mix contained 55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [3H]GroPCho, and 40–100 μg of protein in a total volume of 100 μl, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30°C. Variations on this assay included substitution of ZnCl or CaCl for MgCl, the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol, the addition of various concentrations of detergents (Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, and SDS), changing the pH of the buffer to 8.5 or 6.0 (50 mm MES), and allowing the reaction to proceed for several hours. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 300μl of cold methanol, followed by the addition of 300 μl of chloroform to produce two phases. The upper layer was removed, dried down, and suspended in solvent A for subsequent HPLC analysis. In some cases, the reaction products were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography (33Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Production of Radiolabeled GroPIns and GroPCho—Tritium-labeled GroPIns ([3H]GroPIns) and GroPCho ([3H]GroPCho) were produced through the deacylation of phosphatidyl-myo-[2-3H]inositol and phosphatidylcholine-methyl-[3H], respectively (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), as described (37Hama H.

The cells were radiolabeled to steady state with [14C]choline and the distribution of radiolabel upon chasing with nonradiolabeled choline for four h was analyzed. In wild type yeast, exogenous [14C]choline becomes incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. Label that appears later in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction of the cell is mostly in the form of GroPCho (9Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol.

Deletion of GDE1 resulted in an increase in water-soluble associated [14C]choline-labeled compounds at the expense of membrane-associated counts (Fig. 3A). The distribution of [14C]choline counts in the YPL206cΔ strain, in contrast, was very similar to that of the wild type strain (Fig. 3A). All of the membrane-associated [14C]choline counts were found to reside in PC (data not shown). HPLC analysis of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble metabolites indicated that in both strains, the majority of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts (Fig. 3B) were [14C]choline-GroPCho, with the remaining counts being [14C]choline.FIGURE 3A gde1Δ mutant accumulates [14C]choline-GroPCho upon labeling with [14C]choline.

In cells grown to uniform [14C]choline labeling on galactose, there was roughly 2-fold fewer counts associated with the trichloroacetic acid-soluble portion of the cell in the GDE1 overexpressing strain as compared with the wild type (Fig. 4A) and roughly 4-fold fewer [14C]choline-GroPCho counts (Fig. 4B). Western analysis employing antibodies against the GST tag confirmed that the fusion protein was expressed under inducing conditions (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained when GDE1 was overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid, B94, under the control of its own promoter. The wild type strain containing GDE1 on a multicopy plasmid contained fewer trichloroacetic acid-soluble [14C]choline-associated counts as compared with a wild type strain containing an empty vector (Fig. 4A), which translated into roughly 2-fold less internal GroPCho (Fig. 4B).Because our [14C]choline labeling studies with GDE1 delete and GDE1 overexpressing strains were consistent with the assignment of GDE1 as a GroPC phosphodiesterase encoding gene, we attempted to detect in vitro enzymatic activity.

Here we demonstrate that JSAP1 serves as a cooperative scaffold for activation of JNK and regulation of cell migration in response to fibronectin (FN) stimulation. JSAP1 mediated an association between FAK and JNK, which was induced by either co-expression of Src or attachment of cells to FN. Complex formation of FAK with JSAP1 and p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) resulted in augmentation of FAK activity and phosphorylation of both JSAP1 and p130Cas, which required p130Cas hyperphosphorylation and was abolished by inhibition of Src. JNK activation by FN was enhanced by JSAP1, which was suppressed by disrupting the FAK/p130Cas pathway by expression of a dominant-negative form of p130Cas or by inhibiting Src. We also documented the co-localization of JSAP1 with JNK and phosphorylated FAK at the leading edge and stimulation of cell migration by JSAP1 expression, which depended on its JNK binding domain and was suppressed by inhibition of JNK. The level of JSAP1 mRNA correlated with advanced malignancy in brain tumors, unlike other JIPs. We propose that the JSAP1·FAK complex functions cooperatively as a scaffold for the JNK signaling pathway and regulator of cell migration on FN, and we suggest that JSAP1 is also associated with malignancy in brain tumors. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (also termed JNK-interacting protein 3; JIP3) is a member of a family of scaffold factors for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, and it also forms a complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

This signaling is highly conserved across species and seems to be important for promoting cell migration. Mutations in CrkII, DOCK180, ELMO, Rac1, and JNK homologues in Drosophila all result in phenotypes with defects in cell migration (3Xia Y. Karin M.

Recent studies have demonstrated that JNK regulates cell migration by phosphorylating paxillin and regulating microtubule assembly by phosphorylating microtubule-associated protein 2 (14Wittmann T.

However, the mechanism by which JNK is recruited and activated in association with focal adhesions is largely unknown. fibronectin extracellular signal-regulated kinase embryonic stem focal adhesion kinase green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase JNK interacting protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase Cas Src homology wild type JIP family members (JIP1, -2, and -3) were originally identified as JNK-binding proteins and are thought to serve as scaffold factors for MAPK signaling cascades (17Ito M.

JSAP1 binds not only to MAPK pathway constituents, including all JNK isoforms, MAPK kinases (MKK) 1, 4, and 7, MEKK1, mixed-lineage protein kinase 3, and c-Raf-1, but also to the motor protein kinesin (17Ito M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6488-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This association was enhanced by c-Src, and it promoted cell spreading on FN. FAK is known to be essential for cell migration and for transmitting integrin-stimulated signals to MAPK (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 6Larsen M. Tremblay M.L. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). FAK activated by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 and thereby associates with Src family kinases, leading to enhancement of its tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Binding of FAK to c-Src also induces the formation of a multimolecular signaling complex in which FAK functions as a scaffold (21Westhoff M.A. Serrels B. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Carragher N.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8113-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Notably, JNK activation and FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 are both attenuated in JSAP1 knock-out mice (22Ha H.Y. Cho I.H. Lee K.W. Song J.Y. Kim K.S. Yu Y.M. Lee J.K. Song J.S. Yang S.D. Shin H.S. Han P.L. Dev. Biol. 2005; 277: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that JSAP1 might be involved in FAK-mediated JNK activation. Although many studies have suggested critical roles for JNK signaling in tumor cell migration and invasion, the role of JNK scaffold proteins in tumor malignancy is not well examined. Here, we provide evidence that the JSAP1·FAK complex functions as an effective scaffold for the JNK pathway and particularly for stimulating cell migration, and that JSAP1 mRNA is elevated in brain tumors. These results suggest that JSAP1 may also participate in the acquisition of malignancy in brain tumors. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human astrocytoma cell line U87MG (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate method or by using Trans IT (PanVera). Reagents used were FN (Asahi Techno Glass), SP600125 (Alexis Biochemicals), poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Immunological reagents used were anti-myc, anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-paxillin, anti-FAK, and anti-p130Cas antibodies (BD Biosciences); anti-FAK[pY397] antibody (BIOSOURCE); anti-myc antibody (Cell Signaling); anti-active JNK antibody (Promega); anti-FAK, anti-His, anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST), and anti-JNK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-α-tubulin, anti-VSV, anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma); an anti-Src antibody (Upstate); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences); and AlexaFluor 488, 546, and 633 anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes); and an anti-JSAP1 rabbit antiserum (from Dr. M. Ito, Kitasato University, Japan). Expression Plasmids—pcDNA-myc-JSAP1, pcDNA-FLAG-JSAP1, pcDNA-His-S-JSAP1, pcDNA-His-S-JSAP1-ΔJBD (deletion mutant of amino acid residues 210-226 of JSAP1), pcDNA-His-S-JSAP1-Δ2 (double deletion mutant of amino acid residues 1-342 and 1054-1305 of JSAP1), pcDNA-FLAG-JNK1, pRK-green fluorescent protein (GFP), pRK-FLAG-FAK, pRK-VSV-FAK, and pSG-c-Src were constructed as described previously (20Takino T.

A cDNA encoding JIP1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005456) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with human placenta cDNA and was cloned into the pEAK-FLAG expression vector (pEAK-FLAG-JIP1). The expression plasmids for p130Cas (pSSRα-p130Cas) and its deletion mutants (deleted SH3 domain, ΔSH3; substrate domain, ΔSD; Src binding domain, ΔSB) (25Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. H. Hirai (Tokyo University, Japan), and the FLAG-epitope was inserted at their N terminus by site-directed mutagenesis. The pHA246pur puromycin-resistance plasmid was kindly provided by Hein te Riele (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Immunoprecipitation Analyses—At 36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, and 1% Nonidet P-40. In experiments to analyze the association between JNK and FAK, the lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were used for precipitation with the indicated antibodies or S-protein-agarose (Novagen) for 2 h at 4 °C,and antibody complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in a further 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Measurement of FAK Activity—As described previously (20Takino T. Yoshioka K. Miyamori H. Yamada K.M. Sato H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6488-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated FAK was washed twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and was incubated with 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the 32P-labeled materials were detected by a Typhoon 9200 Image Analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—Glass coverslips were incubated with 10 μg/ml FN in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were allowed to spread onto the FN-coated coverslips for the indicated periods, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then stained with the indicated antibodies and examined by confocal laser microscopy (Carl Zeiss). Measurement of Cell Motility—U87MG cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pHA262pur, pRK-GFP, FLAG-JNK1, and 1 μg of His-S-JSAP1-WT, -ΔJBD, or control plasmids. Transfectants were selected with 1.25 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. This selection for transient transfectants routinely resulted in 90% positive cells expressing GFP. Puromycin-selected cells were replated on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes coated with 10 μg/ml FN; the cells were cultured overnight in complete medium. Cell movements were monitored using Olympus inverted microscopes. Video images were collected at 10-min intervals for 4 h. Image stacks were converted to QuickTime movies, and the positions of nuclei were tracked to quantify cell motility using Move-tr/2D software (Library, Tokyo, Japan). Measurement of JNK Activity—JNK activity was measured using the SAPK/JNK assay kit from Cell Signaling. Briefly, the cell lysates were incubated with GST-c-Jun (amino acid residues 1-89), and precipitates were incubated in the presence of ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63 by JNK bound to GST-c-Jun was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser 63) antibody. Embryonic Stem Cell Culture—The murine ES cell line E14K (gift of Dr. Hiroshi Nishina, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) was maintained as described previously (26Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) with the minor modification that KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen) was used instead of fetal calf serum. The generation of Jsap1(-/-) ES cell lines will be described elsewhere. Clinical Samples and Histology—Under an institutional review board-approved protocol, fresh human brain tumor tissues were obtained from 26 patients with astrocytic tumors who underwent therapeutic removal of brain tumors. Normal brain tissues were obtained from three patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for epilepsy. Histological diagnosis was made by standard light-microscopic evaluation. The classification of human brain tumors used in this study was based on the revised WHO criteria for tumors of the central nervous system (27Kleihues P. Burger P.C. Scheithauer B.W. Histological Typing of Tumours of Central Nervous System.Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 1993; Google Scholar). The 26 astrocytic tumors consisted of 7 low-grade astrocytomas, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 11 glioblastomas. All of the tumor tissues were obtained at primary resection, and none of the patients had been subjected to chemotherapy or radiation therapy before resection. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR—Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) with SYBR green fluorescence signal detection after each cycle of amplification as described previously (28Mariani L. McDonough W.S. Hoelzinger D.B. Beaudry C. Kaczmarek E. Coons S.W. Giese A. Moghaddam M. Seiler R.W. Berens M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4190-4196PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from human brain or brain tumor tissues. PCR was performed using the following primers: JIP1, sense (5′-TTTCCTGCCTATTACGCCATC-3′) and antisense (5′-CACCCCGCACGCTGAT-3′) (amplicon size, 238 bp); JIP2, sense (5′-CCCCACGGAGGACATCTACC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGGGACCGAGGACGAGAGTTC-3′) (amplicon size, 188 bp); JSAP1, sense (5′-TGAGAGACCACGGGAACCCAC-3′) and antisense (5′-GACTAATGCGGAATGCGAAAC-3′) (amplicon size, 245 bp); and histone H3.3, sense (5′-CCACTGAACTTCTGATTCGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCGTGCTAGCTGGATGTCTT-3′) (amplicon size, 215 bp) (GenBank™ accession numbers AF074091, AF136382, NM_033392, and NM_002107 for JIP1, JIP2, JIP3, and histone H3.3, respectively). The PCR data were analyzed with LightCycler analysis software as previously described (28Mariani L. McDonough W.S. Hoelzinger D.B. Beaudry C. Kaczmarek E. Coons S.W. Giese A. Moghaddam M. Seiler R.W. Berens M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4190-4196PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification was based on the number of cycles necessary to produce a detectable amount of product above background. The difference in the cycle number (d) was normalized to the housekeeping gene histone H3.3 and then used to calculate the -fold difference in copy number according to the formula f = 2(d), where f = -fold difference in specific gene expression and d = cycle number difference between compared sources of mRNA (corrected for differences in histone H3.3). JSAP1 Forms a Scaffold for JNK with FAK—JSAP1 has been identified as a scaffold factor for JNK and we previously reported that JSAP1 also associates with FAK (17Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Takino T. Yoshioka K. Miyamori H. Yamada K.M. Sato H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6488-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine whether formation of the JSAP1 and FAK complex affects JNK signaling, e.g. as a scaffold factor, JSAP1-WT or a mutant lacking the JNK-binding domain of JSAP1 (ΔJBD) was co-expressed with FAK, c-Src, and JNK1 in 293T cells, and their interaction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Co-expression of FAK/c-Src significantly stimulated complex formation between JSAP1 and JNK1, and the JNK1 in the complex was phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). Although both JSAP1-WT and JSAP1-ΔJBD were tyrosine-phosphorylated and co-precipitated with FAK, only JSAP1-WT but not JSAP1-ΔJBD was co-precipitated with JNK1. To confirm that both FAK and JNK1 reside on the same JSAP1 scaffold, immunoprecipitation with an antibody against FAK was performed. JNK1 was co-precipitated with FAK only in cells co-expressing JSAP1-WT but not JSAP1-ΔJBD, whereas both JSAP1-WT and JSAP1-ΔJBD were co-precipitated with FAK (Fig. 1C). FAK was co-precipitated with JNK1 only in the cells co-expressing JSAP1-WT but not JSAP1-ΔJBD. The tyrosine phosphorylation of JSAP1-WT and JSAP1-ΔJBD was equally augmented by adhesion of cells to FN in place of FAK·Src expression, and only JSAP1-WT but not JSAP1-ΔJBD associated with JNK1 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, immunoprecipitation analysis using lysates from mouse brain tissue demonstrated the existence of endogenous JSAP1·FAK·JNK complex (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that JSAP1 forms a scaffold for the JNK pathway with FAK following formation of a FAK·Src complex, and thus the association of JSAP1 with JNK is facilitated under conditions that induce FAK·Src complex formation such as FN stimulation. JSAP1 Elevates FAK Activity and p130Cas Phosphorylation—FAK is a critical regulator of FN-induced JNK activation and cell migration. FAK activity is negatively regulated by its N-terminal FERM domain (29Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 30Dunty J.M. Gabarra-Niecko V. King M.L. Ceccarelli D.F. Eck M.J. Schaller M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5353-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which binds to JSAP1. We next investigated whether JSAP1 affects FAK activity. In vitro kinase assays showed that expression of JSAP1-WT or JSAP1-ΔJBD increased FAK activity by 3-fold (Fig. 2A). In contrast, JSAP1-Δ2, which fails to bind to FAK, had no effect. FAK activity was elevated 10-fold by co-expression of c-Src under the same conditions, indicating that activation by JSAP1 is substantial but not maximal. p130Cas is phosphorylated by a FAK·Src complex and mediates FAK-induced JNK activation by forming a complex with CrkII (5Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The effects of JSAP1 expression on p130Cas phosphorylation and FAK activity were studied using deletion mutants of p130Cas (Fig. 2, B and C). p130Cas expressed by transfection of the gene was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, and co-expression of FAK slightly induced its phosphorylation. Although expression of JSAP1 alone did not affect p130Cas phosphorylation, co-expression of JSAP1 with FAK strongly stimulated it. This JSAP1·FAK-enhanced phosphorylation of p130Cas was not observed with the mutants p130Cas-ΔSH3 or -ΔSB, but p130Cas-ΔSD was slightly phosphorylated under the same conditions. Because FAK is known to interact with the SH3 domain of p130Cas through its C-terminal proline-rich region and to phosphorylate the Src-binding domain of p130Cas, these results suggest that JSAP1 stimulates phosphorylation of p130Cas by Src at the substrate domain followed by phosphorylation of its Src-binding domain by FAK. In vitro kinase assays showed that FAK activity was slightly elevated by p130Cas expression, which was stimulated by co-expression of JSAP1. In contrast, p130Cas mutants had no effect. JSAP1 phosphorylation was also induced by co-expression of FAK with p130Cas. This is supported by the results presented in Fig. 2D showing that phosphorylation of both p130Cas and JSAP1 induced by co-expression with FAK was reduced by Src inhibitor PP2 treatment. These results suggest that complex formation of FAK with JSAP1 and p130Cas promotes p130Cas phosphorylation and FAK activation through Src. JSAP1 but Not JIP1 Enhances JNK Activation—Although JSAP1 is a member of the JIP family, the primary structure of JSAP1 is different from the others (18Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To compare JSAP1 with JIP1 in terms of association with FAK, JSAP1 or JIP1 tagged with FLAG epitope was co-expressed with FAK and c-Src, and immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3A, only JSAP1 but not JIP1 co-precipitated FAK. JNK activation was faintly induced by cultivation of cells on FN or by JSAP1 expression when cultured on PLL (Fig. 3B). In contrast, consistent with its binding to FAK, the expression of JSAP1 but not JIP1 significantly enhanced the JNK activating signal from FN (Fig. 3B). To confirm the role of JSAP1 in JNK activation, U87MG cells co-transfected with either JSAP1-WT or JSAP1-ΔJBD and JNK1 were cultured on FN, and JNK phosphorylation was examined (Fig. 3C). JSAP1-WT expression augmented JNK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas JSAP1-ΔJBD expression did not affect it. As shown in Fig. 3D, the JNK phosphorylation enhanced by JSAP1 was suppressed by the Src inhibitor and a dominant negative form of p130Cas (ΔSD). These results suggest that JSAP1 expression promotes FN-induced JNK activation by facilitating the FAK/p130Cas pathway. Because FAK, p130Cas, CrkII, and Rac1 are known to accumulate at the leading edge in migrating cells (31Hsia D.A. Mitra S.K. Hauck C.R. Streblow D.N. Nelson J.A. Ilic D. Huang S. Li E. Nemerow G.R. Leng J. Spencer K.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 32Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), we next examined the localization of JSAP1 in U87MG cells cultured on FN. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the extension of tubulin-containing microtubules toward the cell periphery (Fig. 3E) and the well organized distribution of paxillin (Fig. 3F) and autophosphorylated FAK (Fig. 3G) at the leading front of migrating U87MG cells. It has been reported that JSAP1 is transported to the tips of neurites through its interaction with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of kinesin light chains (24Sato S. Ito M. Ito T. Yoshioka K. Gene. 2004; 329: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Kelkar N. Delmotte M.H. Weston C.R. Barrett T. Sheppard B.J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9843-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We observed that JSAP1 is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm but is also concentrated at the cell periphery where paxillin is well organized and microtubules have elongated. These results indicate that JSAP1 functions together with FAK scaffold at the leading edge. JSAP1-deficient ES Cells Are Impaired in Lamellipodial Protrusion— ES cells provide a highly informative in vitro cell system to study the phenotypic effects of gene disruption at the cellular level. Jsap1-/- murine ES cell lines have been described elsewhere (Fig. 4A). Attachment of wild-type Jsap1+/+ ES cells to FN induced lamellipodial protrusion and membrane ruffling (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, Jsap1-null (Jsap1-/-) ES cells displayed a substantial decrease of the rate of lamellipodial protrusion and membrane ruffling (Fig. 4, B and D). Rac1 and p130Cas/Crk has been shown to induce lamellipodial protrusion and membrane ruffle formation associated with cell migration (5Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Palazzo A.F. Eng C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Marcantonio E.E. Gundersen G.G. Science. 2004; 303: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that JSAP1 is required for FN-induced lamellipodial protrusion and membrane ruffling through the p130Cas/Crk/Rac1 pathway, which led us to test the hypothesis that JSAP1 contributes to cell motility. JSAP1 Expression Promotes Cell Migration—To explore whether JSAP1 is involved in cell migration, the distribution of JSAP1 and JNK1 in wound-edge cells was monitored. As shown in Fig. 5A, JNK1 was barely localized"
https://openalex.org/W2090092599,"The H subunit of the yeast V-ATPase is an extended structure with two relatively independent domains, an N-terminal domain consisting of amino acids 1-348 and a C-terminal domain consisting of amino acids 352-478 (Sagermann, M., Stevens, T. H., and Matthews, B. W. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 7134-7139). We have expressed these two domains independently and together in a yeast strain lacking the H subunit (vma13Δ mutant). The N-terminal domain partially complements the growth defects of the mutant and supports ∼25% of the wild-type Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity in isolated vacuolar vesicles, but surprisingly, this activity is both largely concanamycin-insensitive and uncoupled from proton transport. The C-terminal domain does not complement the growth defects, and supports no ATP hydrolysis or proton transport, even though it is recruited to the vacuolar membrane. Expression of both domains in a vma13Δ strain gives better complementation than either fragment alone and results in higher concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-driven proton pumping than the N-terminal domain alone. Thus, the two domains make complementary contributions to structural and functional coupling of the peripheral V1 and membrane Vo sectors of the V-ATPase, but this coupling does not require that they be joined covalently. The N-terminal domain alone is sufficient for activation of ATP hydrolysis in V1, but the C-terminal domain is essential for proper communication between the V1 and Vo sectors. The H subunit of the yeast V-ATPase is an extended structure with two relatively independent domains, an N-terminal domain consisting of amino acids 1-348 and a C-terminal domain consisting of amino acids 352-478 (Sagermann, M., Stevens, T. H., and Matthews, B. W. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 7134-7139). We have expressed these two domains independently and together in a yeast strain lacking the H subunit (vma13Δ mutant). The N-terminal domain partially complements the growth defects of the mutant and supports ∼25% of the wild-type Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity in isolated vacuolar vesicles, but surprisingly, this activity is both largely concanamycin-insensitive and uncoupled from proton transport.

The N-terminal domain alone is sufficient for activation of ATP hydrolysis in V1, but the C-terminal domain is essential for proper communication between the V1 and Vo sectors. V-ATPases 2The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; SD-uracil, fully supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine; VMA13-NT, N-terminal fragment of the yeast H subunit, consisting of amino acids 1-348; VMA13-CT, C-terminal fragment of the yeast H subunit, consisting of amino acids 352-478; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; aa, amino acid. are ATP-driven proton pumps responsible for acidification of intracellular organelles in all eukaryotic cells and for proton transport across the plasma membrane in certain cells (1Wieczorek H.

Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are comprised of a peripheral complex containing the sites for ATP hydrolysis, the V1 sector, attached to a membrane complex containing the proton pore, the Vo sector (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase has proved to be an excellent model system for eukaryotic V-ATPases. In yeast, eight subunits, designated A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, make up the V1 sector, and at least six subunits designated a, c, c′,c″, d, and e subunits make up the Vo sector (3Kane P.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17361-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All of these subunits have homologues in higher eukaryotes, and in many cases, these homologues have been found to functionally substitute for each other. V-ATPases share a common evolutionary ancestor with F1Fo-ATP synthases (5Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The core of the catalytic machinery, specifically the ATP hydrolyzing A subunit, the B subunit, and proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″), show significant homology with ATP synthase subunits. However, V-ATPases are dedicated proton pumps, while ATP synthases operate primarily in the direction of ATP synthesis in vivo. The catalytic mechanism is fundamentally similar between these two types of enzymes and involves subunit rotation (6Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23714-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In ATP synthases, two stalk structures connect the peripheral headgroup containing the ATP binding subunits and the integral membrane complex containing the proton pore. These two structures act as a “rotor,” which is driven to move sequentially between the catalytic sites by proton movement through the pore, and as a “stator,” which fixes part of the pore to the catalytic headgroup, allowing for relative rotation of the rotor with respect to the catalytic sites (8Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although there must be a stator and rotor for V-ATPases to accomplish rotational catalysis, there is surprisingly little homology between the stalk subunits of the F- and V-type ATPases. This has made assignment of structural and functional roles to the 6-8 V-ATPase stalk subunits difficult. Some consensus is emerging for placement of the d, D, and F subunits in the central, rotor stalk (9Iwata M. Imamura H. Stambouli E. Ikeda C. Tamakoshi M. Nagata K. Makyio H. Hankamer B. Barber J.

Boekema E.J. Gruber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47866-47870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Portions of the V1 A and Vo a subunits have also been implicated as part of the stator stalk (17Shao E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48663-48670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Regulation of V-ATPases and the F1Fo-ATP synthase also appears to be very different, consistent with their distinct cellular localizations and functions. One unique feature of V-ATPases is reversible disassembly in response to changes in growth conditions (19Wieczorek H. Gruber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact V-ATPases exist in dynamic equilibrium with cytosolic V1 sectors and membrane-bound Vo sectors in the cell. In yeast, this equilibrium can be perturbed by changes in extracellular carbon source; assembled V-ATPase complexes are rapidly and reversibly disassembled into free V1 and Vo sectors in response to a brief glucose deprivation (21Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disassembly both inactivates the physiologically relevant MgATPase activity in V1 sectors and prevents proton transport through Vo. This mode of regulation, which has been observed only in eukaryotes, imposes additional constraints on the stator of V-ATPases, which must balance the stability needed for productive rotational catalysis with the regulated instability implied by reversible disassembly. V-ATPase subunit H, which is found in all eukaryotic V-ATPases but not in the archaebacterial V-ATPases, has a number of distinctive features. It is the only subunit that is not necessary for assembly of the full V-ATPase (22Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a yeast vma13Δ strain, which lacks the H subunit, V1-Vo complexes are assembled and transported to the vacuole (22Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes are not active, however, leading to the conclusion that the H subunit is an activator of the fully assembled V-ATPase complex. The H subunit remains with the V1 sector upon disassembly from Vo, and in contrast to its role in the intact complex, acts as an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis in the free V1 sectors (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest the H subunit has a critical function both in sensing attachment between the V1 and Vo sectors and allowing ATP-driven proton transport and in silencing ATP hydrolysis in V1 that has detached from Vo. These contrasting functions indicate that the H subunit is central to establishment of structural and functional coupling of V1 with Vo. The yeast H subunit was the first V-ATPase subunit to be crystallized (25Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that the H subunit was a rather elongated protein that consists of two structurally independent domains joined by a four amino acid linker. In this work, we have expressed those two domains independently and together to assess their roles in establishing a functional connection between the V1 and Vo sectors and in communicating conformational information between the two sectors. Surprisingly, we find that one of the two domains, consisting of the N-terminal 348 amino acids of the H subunit, is partially functional in vivo. Closer characterization reveals a number of enzymatic defects, however, and the implications of these characteristics for H subunit function are discussed. Materials and Media—Concanamycin A was purchased from Wako Biochemicals, and Zymolyase-100T was purchased from MP Biomedicals, Inc. G418 was obtained from Sigma. Yeast genomic DNA was obtained using the Masterpure yeast DNA preparation kit (Epicenter). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, and LA-Taq (Panvera) was used for PCR unless otherwise indicated. Yeast medium were prepared as described previously (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1982; Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 9E10, against the Myc epitope, was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Strains and Plasmids—Wild-type yeast strain SF838-5A and SF838-5A vma13Δ::LEU2 have been described previously (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To construct a congenic strain containing a vma13Δ::kanMX deletion, the vma13Δ::kanMX allele was PCR-amplified from strain BY4741 vma13Δ::kanMX from the yeast deletion mutant array purchased from Research Genetics. This strain contains a precise deletion of the VMA13 open reading frame with the kanMX marker flanked by a set of marker sequences (27Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from this strain, and the vma13Δ mutant allele was amplified with oligonucleotides VMA13 + 600 (5′-GGTTACAGGTATCATGTGTGTTTCGTTTG and VMA13-200 (5′-GCATTACCAATCACGCACGCACGCAGTCGG) to obtain a product containing ∼600 bp of VMA13 upstream sequence and 200 bp of VMA13 downstream sequence. The PCR product was used directly to transform wild-type strain SF838-5A, and transformants were selected by growth on YEPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium) containing 200 μg/ml G418. Replacement of the wild-type VMA13 with the mutant allele was confirmed by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from transformants. The resulting strain, SF838-5A vma13Δ::kanMX, showed the full range of Vma- growth phenotypes, as did the BY4741 vma13Δ::kanMX strain. The BY4741 vma13Δ::kanMX strain was also transformed with the wild-type and mutant plasmids and gave comparable results. Construction and characterization of the wild-type VMA13 plasmid containing an N-terminal Myc tag was described previously (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as template for construction of the VMA13-NT and VMA13-CT mutant plasmids using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The VMA13-NT plasmid (which contains a deletion of amino acids 349-478 of Vma13p) was constructed using the following primers: GGAAATCCTAGAAAACTAAAGATATAGAAGACCG (Δ349-478aa) and CGGTCTTCTATATCTTTAGTTTTCTAGGATTTCC (Δ349-478aa rc). The VMA13-CT plasmid (which contains a deletion of amino acids 2-352, but includes the N-terminal Myc-tag) was constructed using the following primers: CTGAAGAAGACTTGTTGACCTCCTTCGATG (Δ2-352aa) and CATCGAAGGAGGTCAACAAGTCTTCTTCAG (Δ2-352aa rc). Following mutagenesis, the remaining VMA13 open reading frame was sequenced to confirm incorporation of the deletion mutations and absence of any additional mutations. To allow co-transformation of the NT- and CT-containing plasmids, the VMA13-NT insert was subcloned into pRS315 by removing the insert with SacI, and cloning into pRS316 cut with the same enzyme. All plasmids were introduced into the SF838-5A vma13Δ::kanMX strain using an overnight lithium acetate transformation protocol (28Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil (SD-uracil) for pRS316-based plasmids, lacking leucine (SD-leucine) for pRS315-based plasmids, or lacking both uracil and leucine (for co-transformants containing both NT and CT plasmids). Biochemical Methods—Vacuoles were obtained as described previously, except that strains containing plasmids were grown in supplemented minimal medium to maintain the plasmid prior to lysis, and the cells were grown to an A600 of ∼1.0 before harvesting. Yeast whole cell lysates and vacuolar vesicles were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (29Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis rates were assessed using a coupled enzyme assay at 37 °C, and concanamycin inhibition was measured by adding concanamycin A directly to the assay mixture to a final concentration of 100 nm. (Concanamycin A was prepared as a 100 μm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. Addition of a comparable concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide to the assay mix did not affect activity.) Inhibition by N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) was determined by mixing ∼5 μg of vacuolar vesicles with 50 μmN-ethyl maleimide and incubating for 10 min on ice. This mixture was then added to the ATPase assay mixture and hydrolysis rates were determined. Proton pumping was measured on a SPEX Fluorolog-3-21 fluorometer by the ACMA quenching assay as described by Shao and Forgac (17Shao E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48663-48670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Vacuolar vesicles (10 μg) were added to 3 ml of transport buffer containing 1 μm ACMA and stirred. Pumping was initiated by addition of a solution containing ATP and MgSO4 to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm ATP and 1.0 mm MgSO4 in the assay cuvette. Fluorescence intensity was monitored continuously at an excitation wavelength of 410 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm. Where indicated, concanamycin A was added to a final concentration of 100 nm. Coupling efficiencies are measured by dividing the ATP hydrolysis rate (in the absence of concanamycin A, expressed at μmol/min/mg protein), by the change in fluorescence intensity during the first 20 s following addition of MgATP. The fluorescence intensity was corrected for changes in fluorescence arising solely from MgATP addition by subtracting the values obtained when concanamycin A was present throughout the assay. Quinacrine Staining of Whole Cells—Quinacrine labeling was performed as described (30Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and labeled cells were observed within 10 min of labeling. Concanamycin A was included to a 500 nm final concentration after the quinacrine labeling step where indicated. Quinacrine fluorescence was observed on a Zeiss Axioskop II fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD camera. The x-ray crystal structure of isolated yeast subunit H (25Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) indicates that this subunit has an elongated structure consisting of two major domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain is composed of amino acids 1-348, and consists of a series of five HEAT repeats. The C-terminal domain consists of amino acids 353-478. In the crystal structure, these two domains are joined by a four-amino acid linker (amino acids 349-352) but appear to be structurally rather independent. We engineered constructs to express the N-terminal domain (VMA13-NT) and C-terminal domain (VMA13-CT) independently by deleting amino acids 349-478 or amino acids 2-352, respectively. The deletions were introduced into a low copy plasmid that places a Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of the H subunit (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), so that both deletion constructs are also N-terminally Myc-tagged. To determine whether the two domains would be stably expressed in yeast, the VMA13-NT and VMA13-CT constructs were transformed individually into a vma13Δ strain, which lacks any other copy of subunit H, and then whole cell lysates were prepared from the transformants. The Myc-tagged wild-type H subunit has a relative molecular mass of ∼54 kDa, and the NT and CT domains have the expected relative molecular masses of ∼40 and 14 kDa (data not shown). We also inserted the deletion constructs into low copy plasmids with different nutritional markers and co-transformed the vma13Δ strain with both plasmids. The VMA13-NT + CT-containing strain contains Myc-tagged proteins of both 40 and 14 kDa. The relative level of the two proteins in the VMA13-NT + CT strain was somewhat variable because they are coexpressed from different plasmids and there may be some variation in the relative copy numbers of the plasmids. We next asked whether the individual domains were able to support function of the V-ATPase. Loss of V-ATPase activity gives an easily measurable growth phenotype. Mutants lacking all V-ATPase activity, like the vma13Δ mutant, are able to grow at pH 5, but show little or no growth at an extracellular pH >7 or high extracellular calcium concentrations (31Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the Myc-tagged wild-type VMA13 plasmid restores growth to the vma13Δ strain at both pH 7.5 and in pH 7.5 medium containing 60 mm CaCl2, as demonstrated by growth as a patch at the highest density of cells (left) on all three plates and as well defined colonies at the lowest density (right). The vma13Δ strain containing the VMA13-NT plasmid showed some growth at pH 7.5, but very little growth on pH 7.5 +CaCl2 plates. (Higher levels of V-ATPase activity are required for growth at pH 7.5 when extra calcium is added (32Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).) The strain containing VMA13-CT did not grow under either of these conditions, suggesting there was little or no complementation of the Vma- growth phenotype. Interestingly, the strain containing both VMA13-NT and VMA13-CT grew better at pH 7.5 than either strain containing the individual fragments. (Note that the two spots of lower cell density for the VMA13-NT+ CT strain have much better growth than the VMA13-NT strain at pH 7.5. Neither the NT nor the NT + CT strain formed well-defined colonies at even the highest density plating on the pH 7.5 + CaCl2 plate.) This suggests that the NT and CT fragments of the H subunit are able to functionally complement each other, at least to some extent, under conditions where they are not joined covalently. To examine the properties of V-ATPases containing the various fragments of subunit H in more detail, we isolated vacuolar vesicles from all of the strains. As shown by an immunoblot probed with the anti-Myc antibody in Fig. 3A, all of the Myc-tagged H subunit fragments were isolated with the vacuolar vesicles, suggesting that they retained enough binding to other V-ATPase subunits to keep them with the membranes during isolation. The levels of several other V-ATPase subunits in the isolated vacuoles were also determined by immunoblot. Both the membrane-bound Vo subunit a and the peripheral V1 subunits A, B, C, and E were present in vacuoles isolated from the all of the strains (Fig. 3B). There was a considerable loss of all of the V1 subunits from the VMA13-CT. There is somewhat less of the V1 subunits, particularly the C subunit, in the VMA13-NT-containing strain. There was better retention of all of the V1 subunits on the vacuolar membrane when both the VMA13-NT and VMA13-CT fragments were present. TABLE ONE shows the total ATPase activity measured in each of the vacuolar vesicle preparations. The VMA13-CT construct supports very little ATPase activity, even though there was some catalytic subunit A present, but the VMA13-NT vacuolar vesicles contained 25.4% of the total ATPase activity found in vesicles with the full-length VMA13. The VMA13-NT + CT vesicles had almost twice as much ATPase activity as the VMA13-NT vesicles. The ATPase activity in the VMA13-NT vesicles was also notably less stable than that of wild-type vesicles. Vesicles from cells containing the wild-type VMA13 retain most of the ATPase activity after an overnight incubation on ice or through extended freezing. The VMA13-NT vesicles rapidly lost activity under these conditions, and the VMA13-NT+ CT vesicles showed an intermediate level of stability. We generally assess V-ATPase specific activity by measuring the proportion of the total ATPase activity that is sensitive to 100 nm concanamycin A, and as shown in TABLE ONE, 86.4% of the ATPase activity in the wild-type vacuolar vesicles was inhibited by concanamycin A. However, we found that vacuolar vesicles from both the VMA13-NT and VMA13-NT + CT cells had a much higher level of concanamycin A-insensitive ATPase activity than the wild-type vesicles, with only 34% inhibition in VMA13-NT and 49% inhibition in VMA13-NT + CT (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEATPase activity in vacuolar vesiclesStrainTotal ATPase specific activityWild-type activityAverage inhibition by concanamycin AAverage inhibition by NEMμmol/min/mg%%%vma13Δ/VMA131.14 ± 0.13 (n = 8)10086.4 ± 4.3 (n = 8)80.3 ± 4.8 (n = 3)vma13Δ/VMA13-NT0.29 ± 0.04 (n = 9)25.433.5 ± 4.6 (n = 9)66.8 ± 4.5 (n = 4)vma13Δ/VMA13-CT0.02 ± 0.01 (n = 3)1.59.8 ± 3.5 (n = 3)N/AaNot applicable.vma13Δ/VMA13-NT + VMA13-CT0.54 ± 0.09 (n = 6)47.348.7 ± 11.3 (n = 6)72.3 ± 2.1 (n = 3)a Not applicable. Open table in a new tab The concanamycin A-insensitive ATPase activity in wild-type vacuolar vesicles is generally attributed to enzymes other than V-ATPases, in part because it is also insensitive to other specific inhibitors of V-ATPase activity. (The percentage of the ATPase activity in wild-type vesicles that is insensitive to concanamycin A ranges from 80-95%, and its source is unknown.) Contamination of the vacuolar vesicles from the VMA13-NT mutant with other membranes might result in a lower V-ATPase specific activity and account for concanamycin insensitivity, but loss of concanamycin sensitivity in the V-ATPase itself could also account for these results. Therefore, we compared the inhibition by 50 μm NEM with that by 100 nm concanamycin A. At this concentration, NEM is also a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase, but it acts by a completely different mechanism from concanamycin A. Whereas concanamycin A inhibits by binding to the proteolipid subunits in the Vo sector of the V-ATPase (33Huss M. Ingenhorst G. Konig S. Gassel M. Drose S. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Wieczorek H. J.

Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in TABLE ONE, the ATPase activity in vacuoles from cells containing wild-type VMA13 is inhibited to nearly same extent by concanamycin A and NEM, with slightly less inhibition by NEM on average. In contrast, ATPase activity in the VMA13-NT and VMA13-NT + CT vesicles was much more sensitive to NEM than to concanamycin A. These results indicate that the V-ATPase has ATPase activity in the VMA13-NT containing vesicles, but has lost much of its sensitivity to concanamycin A. We also assayed the proton-pumping capability of the V-ATPase in the wild-type and mutant vacuoles by ACMA fluorescence quenching. As shown in Fig. 4A, vesicles containing the full-length H subunit show quenching of ACMA fluorescence upon addition of MgATP. This quenching is reversed upon addition of 100 nm concanamycin A, and addition of 100 nm concanamycin A before MgATP prevented almost all of the quenching, other than the drop that occurs immediately upon MgATP addition. There is a small but detectable quenching of ACMA fluorescence in the VMA13-NT + CT vesicles as well, and this quenching is both reversible by addition of concanamycin A and prevented by addition of concanamycin A before MgATP (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2047409139,"Lipoic acid is the covalently attached cofactor of several multi-component enzyme complexes that catalyze key metabolic reactions. Attachment of lipoic acid to the lipoyl-dependent enzymes is catalyzed by lipoate-protein ligases (LPLs). In Escherichia coli, two distinct enzymes lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA) and lipB-encoded lipoyltransferase (LipB) catalyze independent pathways for lipoylation of the target proteins. The reaction catalyzed by LplA occurs in two steps. First, LplA activates exogenously supplied lipoic acid at the expense of ATP to lipoyl-AMP. Next, it transfers the enzyme-bound lipoyl-AMP to the ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domain to give an amide linkage. To gain insight into the mechanism of action by LplA, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermoplasma acidophilum LplA in three forms: (i) the apo form; (ii) the ATP complex; and (iii) the lipoyl-AMP complex. The overall fold of LplA bears some resemblance to that of the biotinyl protein ligase module of the E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor (BirA). Lipoyl-AMP is bound deeply in the bifurcated pocket of LplA and adopts a U-shaped conformation. Only the phosphate group and part of the ribose sugar of lipoyl-AMP are accessible from the bulk solvent through a tunnel-like passage, whereas the rest of the activated intermediate is completely buried inside the active site pocket. This first view of the activated intermediate bound to LplA allowed us to propose a model of the complexes between Ta LplA and lipoyl domains, thus shedding light on the target protein/lysine residue specificity of LplA.

Lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid or 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid), a covalently bound cofactor, is essential for function of several key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Jordan S.W. Cronan J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279 (Jr.): 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lipoylated proteins include pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system (2Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In the reaction catalyzed by the lipoylating enzymes, i.e. lipoate-protein ligases (LPLs) 3The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoate-protein ligase (both LplA and LipB); BirA, biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor; BPL, biotinyl protein ligase; biotinyl-AMP, biotinyl-5′-adenylate; LplA, lipoate-protein ligase A (lplA gene product); LipB, lipoyltransferase (lipB gene product); lipoyl-AMP, lipoyl-5′-adenylate; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; r.m.s., root mean square; SeMet, selenomethionine; Ta, Thermoplasma acidophilum. 3The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoate-protein ligase (both LplA and LipB); BirA, biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor; BPL, biotinyl protein ligase; biotinyl-AMP, biotinyl-5′-adenylate; LplA, lipoate-protein ligase A (lplA gene product); LipB, lipoyltransferase (lipB gene product); lipoyl-AMP, lipoyl-5′-adenylate; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; r.m.s., root mean square; SeMet, selenomethionine; Ta, Thermoplasma acidophilum., the free carboxyl group of lipoic acid is attachedviaanamidelinkagetotheϵ-aminogroupofaspecificlysineresidueof the lipoate-accepting protein domains (termed the lipoyl domains) of these multienzyme complexes (3Reche P.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lipoamide arm protruding from a tight β-turn of the structure of the lipoyl domains shuttles reaction intermediates among different active sites of the multienzyme complexes (2Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Although the general role of lipoic acid as the covalently attached coenzyme has been known for decades, the mechanisms by which lipoic acid is synthesized and becomes linked to its cognate proteins continue to be elucidated. In Escherichia coli two independent LPL enzymes modify lipoyl domains (4Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 (Jr.): 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The best characterized lipoylating enzyme is E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA). LplA utilizes exogenously supplied free lipoic acid to modify the specific lysine of the lipoyl domain. In the first step, LplA catalyzes synthesis of the activated intermediate lipoyl-5′-adenylate (lipoyl-AMP) from lipoic acid and ATP. In the next step, it catalyzes the attack of enzyme-bound lipoyl-AMP by the ϵ-amino group of the lysine of the lipoyl domain to give an amide linkage. The lipoylation reaction catalyzed by LplA is analogous to that of the biotinylation reaction mediated by biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) (2Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 3Reche P.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The second lipoylation pathway is dependent on the lipB and the lipA gene products (5Zhao X. Miller J.R. Jiang Y. Marletta M.A. Cronan J.E. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10 (Jr.): 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). LipB, octanoyl-[acyl carrier protein]-protein N-octanoyltransferase, uses the octanoyl thioester of the acyl carrier protein of fatty acid synthesis as the acyl donor in vivo. After LipB transfers the octanoyl group to its target protein, the sulfur insertion into the octanoyl moiety is carried out by LipA, the sulfur insertion protein. It was shown that the transfer of lipoic acid and octanoic acid from their acyl carrier protein thioesters to lipoyl domains can also be catalyzed, albeit very poorly, by LplA (6Jordan S.W. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185 (Jr.): 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Despite poor sequence conservation, an evolutionary relationship among LplA, LipB, and BPL has been detected (2Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). LplA and LipB counterparts of the E. coli enzymes are present in many organisms, but little is known about their three-dimensional structures. Lipoyltransferases showing a 31-35% sequence identity with E. coli LplA have been purified from human and bovine mitochondria (7Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31974-31978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Fujiwara K. Suzuki M. Okumachi Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermoplasma acidophilum (Ta) LplA, a 262-residue protein, by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method of x-ray crystallography to provide the missing structural information. The amino acid sequence of Ta LplA shares 28%, 27%, and 25% identity with those of E. coli LplA, and the human and bovine mitochondrial lipoyltransferases, respectively. We report here the structure of Ta LplA in three different forms: (i) the apo form; (ii) the ATP complex; and (iii) the lipoyl-AMP complex. This study provides essential structural data on the ligand binding site of LplA and useful insights into binding mode of the activated intermediate. It also allowed us to propose a model of the complexes between LplA and lipoyl domains. Protein Expression and Purification—The lplA gene from T. acidophilum (TA0514) encoding LplA was cloned into the expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen). The recombinant protein fused with a hexahistidine-containing tag at its amino terminus was overexpressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells using Terrific broth culture medium. Protein expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h at 37 °C following growth to mid-log phase at 37 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 50 mm imidazole. The crude lysate was centrifuged at ∼36,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was applied to an affinity chromatography column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole, and the eluted sample was diluted 5-fold with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The diluted sample was applied to a Source 15Q ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), which was previously equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. The next step was gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences), employing an elution buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 and 100 mm NaCl. For overexpressing the selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells, we used the M9 cell culture medium that contained extra amino acids, including SeMet. When the cell culture reached an A600 of 0.6, SeMet was added at 50 mg/liter, and at the same time the synthesis of Met was repressed by the addition of Phe, Thr, and Lys at 100 mg/liter, and Leu, Ile, Val, and Pro at 50 mg/liter (9Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). After 15 min, expression of the SeMet-substituted protein was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for an additional 20 h at 20 °C. The procedure for purifying the SeMet-substituted protein was the same except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps besides buffer A. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24 °C by mixing equal volumes (2 μl each) of the protein solution (at 18 mg ml-1 concentration in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 and 100 mm NaCl) and the reservoir solution. To grow crystal of the native protein in the apo form, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 100 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.5, 20% (v/v) iso-propanol, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and 100 mm NaCl. Rod-shaped crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm within a few days. When we added ATP, lipoic acid, or octanoic acid to the protein solution, the enzyme aggregated rapidly and co-crystallization was not possible. Therefore, we used the soaking method to obtain crystals of the native protein bound with the ligands. To obtain crystals of the ATP complex, we soaked the apo crystals of the native protein in the reservoir solution containing ATP in 50-fold molar excess for 1 day. To obtain crystals of the lipoyl-AMP complex, we transferred the ATP-soaked crystals into the reservoir solution containing lipoic acid in 50-fold molar excess and soaked them for 1 day. Apparently the reaction took place in the crystal, as evidenced by the clear electron density for the activated intermediate, lipoyl-AMP (Fig. 1A, left). When we transferred the ATP-soaked crystals into the biotin-containing reservoir solution, the reaction did not occur in the crystal, as evidenced by the lack of electron density for biotinyl-AMP. The difference Fourier map showed only the electron density of ATP. When we soaked the native crystals in the reservoir solution containing lipoic acid or octanoic acid alone in 50-fold molar excess for 1 day, the crystal quality deteriorated and we could not collect x-ray diffraction data to sufficiently high resolution. The SeMet-substituted protein in the apo form was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the apo crystals of the native protein except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in the protein solution. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for a few seconds and was frozen in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. The cryoprotectant solution consisted of 20% (v/v) glycerol added to the reservoir solution. X-ray diffraction data was collected at 100 K on a Quantum 4R charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA) at the BL-6A experimental station of Photon Factory, Japan. For each image, the crystal was rotated by 1°, and the crystal-to-detector distance was set to 210 mm. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000 (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38250) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted crystal belongs to the space group C2, with unit cell parameters of a = 109.35 Å, b = 62.95 Å, c = 46.86 Å, and β = 111.57°. There is one monomeric LplA molecule per asymmetric unit, giving a solvent fraction of 47.4%. TABLE ONE summarizes the statistics of MAD data collection. Thirteen of the fourteen expected selenium atoms in each monomer of the recombinant enzyme, except the SeMet at the amino terminus of the polypeptide chain, were located with the program SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), and the selenium sites were used to calculate the phases with RESOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C.

D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), giving an initial model that accounted for ∼80% of the backbone of the polypeptide chain with much of the sequence assigned. Subsequent manual model building was done using the program O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Model Quality and Overall Structure—We have determined the crystal structure of Ta LplA using SeMet MAD data at 2.04-Å resolution (TABLE ONE). The structure of the SeMet-substituted LplA in the ligand-free state was refined against 20-2.04 Å data to crystallographic Rwork and Rfree values of 21.6% and 23.7%, respectively. The refined model (PDB code 2ARS) accounts for 245 residues (1-178 and 191-257). The twenty-residue amino-terminal fusion tag and the carboxyl-terminal five residues as well as a loop region (residues 179-190) have no electron density. We have confirmed by SDS-PAGE that the polypeptide chains in the crystal are not cleaved. This indicates that the invisible loop is probably flexible and disordered in the crystal. We have additionally determined the crystal structures of the native protein bound with either lipoyl-AMP or ATP. The structure of the lipoyl-AMP complex was refined against 20-2.4 Å data to Rwork and Rfree values of 19.3% and 24.9%, respectively. The refined model (PDB code 2ART) accounts for 247 amino acid residues (1-180 and 191-257). The electron density of the bound lipoyl-AMP group clearly indicates a covalent linkage between lipoic acid and 5′-AMP (Fig. 1A, left). We could obtain the lipoyl-AMP intermediate complex simply by soaking the crystals serially in solutions containing each of ATP and lipoic acid, indicating that the enzyme molecules in the crystal catalyzed the activation step. The structure of the ATP complex was refined against 20-2.5 Å data to Rwork and Rfree values of 20.4% and 25.9%, respectively. The refined model (PDB code 2ARU) accounts for 247 amino acid residues (1-180 and 191-257). The electron density of the bound ATP was a little weaker than that of lipoyl-AMP (Fig. 1A, right), and we arbitrarily fixed the occupancy of ATP at 0.5. We suspect that the binding affinity of Ta LplA for ATP is weaker than that for lipoyl-AMP, and incomplete occupation of the ATP binding site resulted from a partial loss of the bound ATP during quick soaking of the crystals in the cryoprotectant solution. Ta LplA exists as a monomer in solution according to our dynamic light scattering analysis. The LplA monomer is oblate-shaped, with approximate dimensions of 40 Å × 40 Å × 32 Å (Fig. 1B). The central core of Ta LplA comprises two β-sheets: a larger eight-stranded β-sheet and a smaller three-stranded β-sheet. The larger sheet consists of the strands β1 (residues 2-6), β2 (35-39), β6 (85-94), β7 (122-123), β8 (139-141), β9 (144-154), β10 (156-165), and β11 (225-229) with topology ↑β11↑β1↑β2↓β6↑β10↓β9↑β8↓β7. The smaller sheet consists of the strands β3 (residues 44-47), β4 (68-71), and β5 (79-81) with topology ↓β4↓β3↑β5 (Fig. 1C). The two sheets are nearly orthogonal, diverging from each other at the lipoyl-AMP binding site (Fig. 1B). Eight α-helices (α1 (residues 14-27), α2 (53-56), α3 (59-64), α4 (99-116), α5 (170-176), α6 (207-222), α7 (233-245), and α8 (250-254)) surround the central β-sheets. The residues 192-195 form a 310 helix in the apo and the ATP complex structures, but not in the lipoyl-AMP complex structure. Structural Comparison—DALI structural similarity searches (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) with the apo structure of Ta LplA revealed two close relatives. The highest Z-score is obtained with a putative LplA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a 329-residue protein (unpublished deposition; PDB code 1VQZ; a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 2.5 Å for 218 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 25.6, and a sequence identity of 29%). This structure was solved without any bound ligand in the active site. S. pneumoniae LplA is longer than Ta LplA in its C terminus by 67 residues. A search of the protein sequence data base indicates that LplAs fall into two size categories; the shorter ones have ∼260-270 residues and the longer ones ∼330-340 residues. Ta LplA in the crystal catalyzed the formation of the activated intermediate (lipoyl-AMP) from ATP and lipoic acid. This suggests that the extra C-terminal region of the longer LplAs may not be required for catalyzing the activation step. The next highest Z-score is obtained with the E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor (BirA) (PDB code 1BIA; an r.m.s. deviation of 2.7 Å for 134 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 9.7, and a sequence identity of 13%) (18Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The structure of BirA consists of three domains. The central domain II represents the BPL module, and houses both the biotin and the ATP binding sites. In E. coli BirA, the binding site of biotin was located using biotinyl-lysine, but there was no direct crystallographic data for the ATP binding site. A region of sequence homology to the BPL module of E. coli BirA can be identified in all biotinylating enzymes, whereas other domains are retained only in some bacterial counterparts of the E. coli enzyme (3Reche P.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The equivalent of the smaller β-sheet of Ta LplA is missing from the domain II of E. coli BirA. Thus the β-sheet of the domain II of E. coli BirA is largely solvent-exposed on one side, where biotin was observed to bind (18Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In comparison, in Ta LplA, the additional smaller β-sheet covers the lipoyl portion of the bound lipoyl-AMP (Fig. 1B). A careful sequence analysis showed that LplA enzymes as well as LipB enzymes bear very low but detectable homology to the BPL module of biotinylating enzymes (3Reche P.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting an evolutionary relationship among them. Binding of Lipoyl-AMP and ATP at the Active Site—After submission of this report, the crystal structure of LplA from E. coli was reported (19Fujiwara K. Toma S. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. Nakagawa A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33645-33651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (PDB codes 1X2G for the apo enzyme and 1X2H for the lipoic acid-complexed enzyme). This structure as well as those of E. coli BirA (18Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and S. pneumoniae LplA does not provide detailed information about the binding modes of either the activated intermediate or ATP within the active site. To gain further insight into the ligand binding by LplA, we have determined the structures of Ta LplA in complex with either ATP or lipoyl-AMP, in addition to the apo structure. The apo, the ATP-bound, and the lipoyl-AMP-bound structures of Ta LplA are highly similar to each other. The r.m.s. deviation between the apo and the ATP-bound structures is 0.23 Å for 245 Cα atoms (residues 1-178 and 191-257), whereas that between the apo and the lipoyl-AMP-bound structures is 0.39 Å for 245 Cα atoms (residues 1-178 and 191-257). Between the ATP-bound and the lipoyl-AMP-bound structures, the r.m.s. deviation is 0.30 Å for 247 C"
https://openalex.org/W2131360457,"The multifunctional oncoprotein β-catenin interacts with the activation function-2 domain of androgen receptor (AR) to stimulate androgen receptor transcriptional activity, increase sensitivity, and broaden specificity of ligand interactions. β-Catenin interacts with androgen receptor in close proximity to the binding groove for P160 coactivators such as transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (TIF2)/glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1 (GRIP1). β-Catenin can also bind directly to TIF2/GRIP1. Both N- and C-terminal regions of β-catenin are needed for optimal interaction with TIF2/GRIP1. We show that distinct residues of β-catenin are responsible for both binding and functional interactions with androgen receptor and with TCF4, thus allowing the introduction of missense mutations that selectively affect these interactions. β-Catenin and TIF2/GRIP1 are each able to mediate binding between the other and androgen receptor in functional interactions that enhance ligand-dependent transcription. The data strongly imply that AR, β-catenin, and TIF2/GRIP1 bind in a three-way interaction that mediates transcription. Lastly, we observed that a β-catenin C-terminal peptide containing 229 amino acids can bind TIF2/GRIP1 and AR but has a profound dominant inhibitory effect on ligand-dependent transcription. We propose that β-catenin may play an integral role in formation of the androgen-receptor transcriptional complex.

A member of the steroid hormone receptor family, AR binds androgen and drives the transcription of androgen-responsive genes in a variety of tissues and cell types. Like the prostatic epithelium from which it is derived, prostate cancer cells are dependent on the presence of androgen when it first presents. Androgen ablation therapy is the first line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (1Tyrrell C.J. Kaisary A.V. Iversen P. Anderson J.B. Baert L. Tammela T. Chamberlain M. Webster A. Blackledge G. Eur. Urol. 1998; 33: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The vast majority of cases show a clinical response to androgen ablation therapy (2Sadi M.V. Walsh P.C. Barrack E.R. Cancer. 1991; 67: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, this clinical response is transient, and when the cancer recurs, it does so in the presence of castrate levels of androgen. Androgen-independent prostate cancer paradoxically still depends on AR. For example 30–40% of patients with advanced prostate cancer show amplification of the AR gene following androgen ablation therapy (3Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E. Koivisto P. Tanner M. Keinanen R. Palmberg C. Palotie A. Tammela T. Isola J. Kallioniemi O.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Other specimens have shown point mutations within the AR ligand-binding domain that broaden ligand specificity to include anti-androgens and other steroid hormones (4Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Ko Y.J. Small E.J. Upton M. Rajeshkumar B. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2511-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in the N terminus may affect AR interaction with other proteins of the transcription complex (5Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Tilley W.D. Buchanan G. Hickey T.E. Bentel J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar).Another mechanism that affects AR signaling in advanced prostate cancer was suggested when our laboratory found that 5% of primary specimens had mutations in the β-catenin gene (7Voeller H.J. Truica C.I. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2520-2523PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigation into the interaction between AR and β-catenin showed β-catenin coimmunoprecipitates with AR, activates AR signaling in the presence of androgens, increases its affinity for other steroid hormones, and diminishes the effects of anti-androgens (8Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). AR affects β-catenin translocation to the nucleus (9Mulholland D.J. Cheng H. Reid K. Rennie P.S. Nelson C.C. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Oncogenic activation of β-catenin involves disruption of phosphorylation sites at the N terminus of the protein that interrupt signals for recognition by ubiquitin ligases and protein degradation. Recently, it was shown that activation of the protease calpain is common in advanced prostate cancer and results in cleavage of β-catenin near the N terminus to remove the phosphorylation sites and produce a 75-kDa protein. This finding further supports the notion that β-catenin plays an important role in activation of AR signaling in advanced, androgen-independent prostate cancer.Several studies have suggested interaction of components of the TCF4 transcription factors and androgen receptor transcription complex. A number of reports have described functional and physical interaction between androgen receptor and β-catenin (9Mulholland D.J. Cheng H. Reid K. Rennie P.S. Nelson C.C. J. Biol.

Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-catenin can also complex with TIF2/GRIP1 itself, suggesting a three-way interaction with AR and possible regulatory role for β-catenin in androgen action (13Li H. Kim J.H. Koh S.S. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4212-4220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Here we explore the structural elements of β-catenin that determine interactions with TCF4 and AR and find that missense mutations of critical amino acids affect these two interactions differently. We proceed to show that either TIF2/GRIP1 or β-catenin can each mediate binding of the other to AR and that together they enhance AR-dependent transcriptional activation. The data have implications for regulation of AR action and suggest strategies for intervention of AR signaling in androgen-independent prostate cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Plasmid Construction—pCMVhAR, pCMVhAR507–919, and GAL4/AR LBD were provided by Elizabeth Wilson, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.

Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TCF4 plasmid and OT/OF reporter vectors were provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD).Cell Culture and Transfection—Unless otherwise stated in the figure legends, all transfections were performed in CV-1 cells. Briefly, 24 h before transfection, cells were plated in 24-well microtiter plates (Falcon) at a cell density of 2–4 × 104 cells per well. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 10 ng of receptor-containing plasmid, 100 ng of reporter, 10 ng of Renilla null luciferase, and the indicated amounts of coregulators. Unless otherwise stated, transfection was routinely done with the total transfected DNA brought up to 300 ng/well with pBSK+ DNA. In experiments with different coregulator cDNA plasmids in different vectors, equimolar amounts of the corresponding plasmid vectors were cotransfected to control for artifacts of the vector DNA. After incubation for 16 h, the cells were washed and phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% dextran charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum containing hormones or vehicle was added. The final concentration of vehicle ethanol was 0.1%. After a further 24 h, cells were lysed in 100 μl/well 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 30 μl of the cell lysates was used to assay for luciferase activity with the dual-luciferase assay system from Promega. The data were then normalized for the cotransfected Renilla activity. All samples were in triplicate, and each experiment described was repeated at least two times.GST Pull-down Assays—293T cells were transfected with pCMVhAR, wild-type β-catenin, and TCF4, or TIF2 alone with Lipofectamine. Cells were treated with or without 1 nm R1881 24 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C). The total protein concentration of the extracts was measured with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). GST fusion proteins harboring wild-type β-catenin, β-catenin with point mutations (K312A, R386A, K435A, R469A, and H470A), or double mutation K312A/R386A were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) following induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1.5 h at 30 °C. Cells were sonicated, and proteins were clarified following the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. For binding assays, GST/β-catenin protein, or GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 500 μg of the 293T cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the retained proteins were eluted with sample buffer and resolved on a precast 4 to 20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed using antibodies against AR (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-catenin (BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories), TCF4 (clone 6H5–3, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), TIF2 (BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories), and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Western Blotting—For detection of the expression of pcDNA3β-catenin and VP-16/β-catenin mutants, SKBR3 cells were plated overnight in six-well plates. Cells were transiently cotransfected with 1 μg each of wild-type pcDNA3-β-catenin, VP-16/β-catenin, or different mutants, together with 1 μg of GFP vector with a Lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared as described in the previous paragraph. Aliquots of 30 μg of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with β-catenin antibody (BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories, 1:2000) and anti-GFP antibody (Clontech, 1:5000), followed by a secondary anti-mouse (β-catenin) or anti-rabbit (GFP) immunoglobulinhorseradish peroxidase antibody (1:5000). Signal detection was performed with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).Coimmunoprecipitation—LNCaP cells were cultured in modified Iscove's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoalstripped serum for 48 h. Cells were then treated with 10 nm R1881 or ethanol. Cells were harvested at 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by resuspension in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Nutley, NJ). Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 2 volumes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocker and collected for 30 min at 4 °C by microcentrifuge. Coimmunoprecipitation was done using Catch and Release version 2.0 reversible immunoprecipitation system (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, 500 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of antibodies and 10 μl of affinity ligand at room temperature for 30 min in spin columns. Antibodies used for coimmunoprecipitation were rabbit immunoaffinity-purified anti-AR (PG-21, Upstate), monoclonal anti-TIF2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and monoclonal anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Columns were washed three times with wash buffer, and proteins bound to the columns were eluted with 70 μl of denaturing elution buffer. Samples were separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described with either monoclonal antibodies against AR (441, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TIF2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories) or AR antiserum (PG-21), GRIP1 (M-343, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-catenin (H-102, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The AR PG-21 antiserum or monoclonal antibody 441 were used at 1:5000 dilution and all other the antibodies at 1:1000 dilution.To perform coimmunoprecipitation with wild-type AR, mutant β-catenin, and GRIP1, 293 cells were plated onto 100-mm2 dishes and transfected with 3 μg each of wild-type AR, VP16/β-catenin, or VP16/β-catenin(K312A), together with or without wild-type GRIP1 or truncated GRIP1-(5–1121). Cells were treated with R1881 for 24 h prior to coimmunoprecipitation. Polyclonal anti-AR (PG-21) was used for coimmunoprecipitation and monoclonal antibodies against AR, TIF2, and VP16 (14–5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Western blot analysis.Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise noted, values shown represent mean ± S.D. The differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student's t test using the program GraphPad Prism software version 4.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered significant. In figures the following symbols are used to represent p values: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and ****, p < 0.0001.RESULTSβ-Catenin Interactions with AR and TCF4—We showed previously that ligand-bound AR inhibited the transcriptional interaction between β-catenin and a TCF-responsive promoter (11Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the interaction of β-catenin with both AR and TCF4 was blocked by inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF (17Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar, 18Graham T.A. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Xu W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we predicted that both AR and TCF4 would interact with the same region of β-catenin (11Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we generated missense mutations in β-catenin to determine their effect on interactions with AR and TCF4. The location of these mutations is shown in the map in Fig. 1A. K312A and K435A disrupt each of the two lysine residue “charge buttons” that anchor the interaction with TCF proteins (19Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and E-cadherin (20Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The R386A mutation was chosen because Arg-386 is involved in binding to APC (21von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the association with the Phe-21 residue of TCF4 (20Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Arginine 469 and histidine 470 resides are required for the binding of TCF4/LEF1 by the formation of charge buttons with residues Lys-435, Asn-426, Lys-508, and Lys-312 (19Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 20Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar).In a mammalian two-hybrid assay, the AR ligand R1881 induced an interaction between wild-type VP-16/β-catenin and GAL4/AR LBD as we previously showed (11Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Missense mutant proteins VP-16/β-catenin(K312A), VP-16/β-catenin(R386A), and the double mutant VP-16/β-catenin(K312A/K386A) did not interact with GAL4/AR LBD in the presence of R1881. However, three other missense mutations, K435A, R469A, and H470A did not affect the interaction with GAL4/AR LBD to as great a degree (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that Lys-312 and Arg-386 are required for the interaction between β-catenin and ligand-bound bound AR. To make sure that the variation of the binding activity of different VP-16/β-catenin mutants was not due to the changes in protein expression levels, we did a parallel Western blot assay and showed that the expression levels of different constructs were not substantially different (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Interaction of β-catenin with AR and TCF4.A, activation of a GAL4-responsive promoter in a mammalian two-hybrid interaction of GAL4/AR LBD and VP16/β-catenin missense mutant constructs.

D, MMTV-Luc reporter assay of exogenous wild-type full-length AR transfected into 293T cells with control plasmid, β-catenin, or the β-catenin mutant indicated. DHT concentrations are shown on the horizontal axis. For all data points at DHT concentrations ≥1 pm the activities for β-catenin and β-catenin(435A) were statistically different from the pcDNA3 vector control and β-catenin(K312A) was not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mammalian two-hybrid binding data correlated with transcriptional activation of an AR-responsive reporter construct. In a transient transactivation assay we examined the effect of different β-catenin mutant constructs on the ligand-dependent activation of an N-terminal truncated AR-(507–919). We used the truncated AR-(507–919) instead of a full-length construct, because the truncated receptor is essentially inactive in the absence of coactivators such as TIF2/GRIP1 or β-catenin, and therefore provides a qualitative read-out of the transcriptional interaction between AR and β-catenin constructs. As shown in Fig. 2B, wild-type β-catenin can effectively activate the truncated AR in the presence of R1881. In contrast, β-catenin point mutants K312A, R386A, and the double mutant K312A/R386A could not activate the receptor. The other three β-catenin point mutants, K435A, R469A, and H470A, could activate the receptor to the wild-type level. Western blot showed that the expression of different VP-16/β-catenin mutants were at the comparable levels. These results are consistent with the notion binding of β-catenin to AR is required for coactivation as we have previously suggested.The β-catenin missense mutations affecting the “charge buttons” had different effects on TCF4-mediated transactivation of the OT-luciferase reporter than they had on AR transactivation. The mutations that produced the greatest disruption of the interaction with AR affected TCF4-mediated transcription to lesser degrees. β-Catenin point mutants K312A and R386A reduced OT-luciferase activities to 45 and 75% of wild-type activity, respectively. The K312A/R386A double mutant induced 32% of wild-type activity (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the mutant β-catenin constructs K435A, R469A, and H470A that retained the ability to interact with AR induced <20% of wild-type TCF4 transcriptional activity. These results with the TCF4-responsive reporter assays are similar to those reported by others in LEF-1-mediated transactivation assays (21von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).AR and TCF4 can compete for binding of β-catenin, and each has an inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of the other in transfection experiments (11Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). β-Catenin(K435A) had lost nearly all interaction with TCF4 and retained interaction with AR, whereas β-catenin(K312A) had the opposite effect. We therefore compared the effects of K312A and K435A with wild-type β-catenin on the ligand dose dependence of AR-mediated transcription. We observed that at 10 pm DHT, which did not activate AR alone, there was activation in the presence of either wild-type or K435A mutant β-catenin. This result underscores the finding that β-catenin can support AR transcriptional activity at castrate levels of DHT. β-Catenin(K435A) had a more potent effect on AR activation than wild type β-catenin, consistent with the notion that the absence of competitive binding to TCF family proteins decreased competition for β-catenin (Fig. 2D). β-Catenin(K312A) had very little activity in the same experiment and was not differentiable from the control plasmid at DHT concentrations <100 pm and not significantly different at all concentrations.We also examined the competition for β-catenin between AR and TCF4 by a physical association assay. 293T cells were cotransfected with both AR and TCF4 expression vectors, and cells were cultured with or without R1881 before isolation of lysates (Fig. 3). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with agarose beads bound with either GST or GST/β-catenin fusion protein. AR and TCF4 retained on glutathione beads were assayed by Western blotting. In agreement with the mammalian two-hybrid data in Fig. 2A, we observed ligand-dependent binding of AR to GST/β-catenin and GST/β-catenin(K435A), GST/β-catenin(R469A), and GST/β-catenin(H470A) (Fig. 3). In contrast much less binding was observed with GST, GST/β-catenin(K312A), GST/β-catenin(R386A), and GST/β-catenin(K312A/R386A) (Fig. 3). In contrast, binding of TCF4 to the β-catenin fusion constructs was seen best in the absence of R1881. TCF4 bound strongly to GST/β-catenin and less well to GST/β-catenin(K312A), GST/β-catenin(R386A), and GST/β-catenin(R469A). We observed essentially no binding of TCF4 to GST/β-catenin(K435A), GST/β-catenin(H470A), and the double mutant GST/β-catenin(K312A/R386A). The absence of binding to the double mutant in the GST-pull-down assay was in contrast to the result of the transactivation assay where OT-Luc transcriptional activity was 32% of wild type, which may have been due to interaction with endogenous wild type β-catenin expressed in CV-1 cells (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 3Competitive binding of AR and TCF4 for β-catenin. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for AR, TCF4. Cell lysates were isolated after 24-h treatment with 10 nm R1881. GST-β-catenin constructs shown at the top were produced in bacteria as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein complexes formed in the presence or absence of 10 nm R1881 were isolated on glutathione-complexed beads and analyzed by Western blotting with the antibodies indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure Vi"
https://openalex.org/W1995666546,"To find new principles for inhibiting serine proteases, we screened phage-displayed random peptide repertoires with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) as the target. The most frequent of the isolated phage clones contained the disulfide bridge-constrained sequence CSWRGLENHRMC, which we designated upain-1. When expressed recombinantly with a protein fusion partner, upain-1 inhibited the enzymatic activity of uPA competitively with a temperature and pH-dependent K(i), which at 25 degrees C and pH 7.4 was approximately 500 nm. At the same conditions, the equilibrium dissociation constant K(D), monitored by displacement of p-aminobenzamidine from the specificity pocket of uPA, was approximately 400 nm. By an inhibitory screen against other serine proteases, including trypsin, upain-1 was found to be highly selective for uPA. The cyclical structure of upain-1 was indispensable for uPA binding. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified Arg(4) of upain-1 as the P(1) residue and indicated an extended binding interaction including the specificity pocket and the 37-, 60-, and 97-loops of uPA and the P(1), P(2), P(3)', P(4)', and the P(5)' residues of upain-1. Substitution with alanine of the P(2) residue, Trp(3), converted upain-1 into a distinct, although poor, uPA substrate. Upain-1 represents a new type of uPA inhibitor that achieves selectivity by targeting uPA-specific surface loops. Most likely, the inhibitory activity depends on its cyclical structure and the unusual P(2) residue preventing the scissile bond from assuming a tetrahedral geometry and thus from undergoing hydrolysis. Peptide-derived inhibitors such as upain-1 may provide novel mechanistic information about enzyme-inhibitor interactions and alternative methodologies for designing effective protease inhibitors."

In yeast, LCBPs are known to be involved in several cellular responses such as heat shock resistance and Ca2+ mobilization, although their target molecules and signaling pathways remain unclear. To identify genes involved in LCBP signaling and in regulation of LCBP synthesis, we performed transposon mutagenesis in cells lacking the LCBP lyase DPL1 and LCBP phosphatase LCB3 genes and screened for phytosphingosine-resistant clones. Further isolation and identification revealed eight genes (PBP1, HEM14, UFD4, HMG1, TPS1, KES1, WHI2, and ERG5), in addition to the previously characterized LCB4 and PDR5 genes, that are involved in phytosphingosine resistance. Of these eight, four are ergosterol-related genes (HEM14, HMG1, KES1, and ERG5). We also demonstrated that protein expression of the long-chain base kinase Lcb4p was reduced in Δhem14 and Δhmg1 cells, likely as a consequence of decreased activity of the heme-dependent transcription factor Hap1p. In addition, phosphorylation of Lcb4p was decreased in all the ergosterol-related mutants isolated and other ergosterol mutants constructed (Δerg2, Δerg3, and Δerg6). Finally, plasma membrane localization of Lcb4p was found to be reduced in Δerg6 cells. These results suggest that changes in sterol composition affect the phosphorylation of Lcb4p because of the altered localization.

Ceramide, the backbone of sphingolipids, is formed by the amide linkage of a sphingoid long-chain base (LCB) 2The abbreviations used are:LCBlong-chain baseDHSdihydrosphingosinePHSphytosphingosineLCBPlong-chain base 1-phosphateS1Psphingosine 1-phosphatePHS1Pphytosphingosine 1-phosphateERendoplasmic reticulum. with a fatty acid. The major mammalian LCB is sphingosine, whereas in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS) serve as LCBs. LCBs are bioactive lipid molecules involved in apoptosis, endocytosis, and G1 cell cycle arrest (1Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H.

The phosphorylation of LCBs at C-1 results in the production of long-chain base 1-phosphates (LCBPs), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in mammals and PHS 1-phosphate (PHS1P) and DHS 1-phosphate in yeast.

In mammalian cells, S1P is known to elicit various cellular responses via the cell-surface SIP/Edg (endothelial differentiation gene) receptors, such as proliferation, motility, differentiation, and immunity (4Igarashi Y.

In addition to its role as an extracellular signal mediator, S1P also functions intracellularly. Intracellular S1P has been proposed to be involved in Ca2+ mobilization, cell proliferation, G1/S cell cycle transition, and inhibition of apoptosis (4Igarashi Y. J. Biochem.

Because yeast cells do not possess a cell-surface receptor for LCBP/S1P, their LCBPs function only intracellularly (8Birchwood C.J. Saba J.D. Dickson R.C. Cunningham K.W. J. Biol.

Yeast LCBPs and mammalian intracellular S1P share some effects. For instance, both influence Ca2+ mobilization. Similarly, LCBPs confer protection from environmental stresses, as in the inhibition of apoptosis in mammalian cells and heat resistance in yeast. Such shared functions imply evolutionarily conserved target molecules and signaling pathways for LCBPs. The enzymes responsible for both the production and degradation of LCBPs are, in fact, completely conserved from yeast to mammals. In mammalian cells, two known sphingosine kinases, SPHK1 and SPHK2, produce S1P; in yeast cells, two LCB kinases, Lcb4p and Lcb5p, which share significant homology with SPHK1 and SPHK2, synthesize LCBPs. In turn, LCBPs are degraded either back to LCBs by the mammalian SPP1 and SPP2 or yeast Lcb3p and Ysr3p phosphatases or to fatty aldehyde and phosphoethanolamine by mammalian SPL or yeast Dpl1p lyase. Because LCBPs are signaling molecules, their intracellular levels must be strictly regulated. However, knowledge about the regulatory mechanism(s) of their synthesis and degradation is still limited. The activity and/or localization of mammalian SPHK1 is known to be regulated by its association with other proteins (12Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J.

Likewise, we recently found that the stability of yeast Lcb4p is regulated through its phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pho85p via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway (17Iwaki S.

In this study, we investigated the LCBP signaling pathways as well as the regulatory mechanism(s) of LCBP synthesis by screening transposon-inserted mutants of a PHS-resistant yeast cell. Identification of the sites of transposon insertion revealed that, in addition to the previously described genes LCB4 and PDR5, eight other genes are involved in PHS resistance. In mutants of four ergosterol-related genes (HEM14, HMG1, KES1, and ERG5), the amount and/or phosphorylation of Lcb4p was reduced. Additional analyses suggested that dysfunction of heme synthesis and altered composition of ergosterol are related to the decreased amount and phosphorylation of Lcb4p, respectively.

Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using a yeast genomic library kindly provided by Dr. Michael Snyder (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The library was digested with NotI, and the resulting DNA fragments were transformed into the KHY389 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3) cells. Pooled transposon-inserted mutants were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/plate on YPD medium containing 7.5 μm PHS and 0.015% Nonidet P-40 as a dispersant. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. PHS-resistant yeast mutants were obtained at a frequency of ∼1/600 mutants. We randomly selected 36 PHS-resistant mutants and subjected these to additional analyses. The sites of transposon insertion in the isolated mutants were identified according to the recommendations of the Yale Genome Analysis Center (available at http://ygac.med.yale.edu/). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, converted to spheroplasts, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin as described previously (20Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, mounted on glass slides using a SlowFade antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2 plus, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Biochemical and Immunochemical Studies—Cellular uptake of [4,5-3H]DHS (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was assessed by TLC as described previously (19Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Radioactivity associated with DHS was quantified using NIH Image Version 1.62 software. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and labeling was detected with ECL™ Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity-purified anti-Lcb4p antibodies (1:1000 dilution) (17Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), anti-Pgk1p antibodies (0.0625 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.), anti-Dpm1p antibodies (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.), and anti-Pma1p antibodies (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used as primary antibodies. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (1:7500 dilution; Amersham Biosciences), sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (1:7500 dilution; Amersham Biosciences), and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (0.08 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies. Pulse-chase labeling using [35S]methionine/cysteine and subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (17Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (19Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), except that the cells were converted to spheroplasts in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, which stabilizes spheroplasts. LCB Kinase Assays—LCB kinase assays were performed using [γ-32P]ATP and d-erythro-sphingosine (Matreya LLC, Pleasant Gap, PA) as substrates. Details were as described previously (17Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioactivity associated with S1P was quantified using a Fuji Photo Film BAS-2500 bioimaging analyzer. Quantification of LCBs and LCBPs—Lipid extraction and LCB/LCBP separation were performed by a method previously applied to sphingosine/S1P (21Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that the unlabeled LCBs and LCBPs were effectively extracted and separated by this method. Cells (1 A600 nm unit) grown in YPD medium at 30 °C were suspended in 100 μl of water, and lipids were extracted by adding 600 μl of 1:2 (v/v) chloroform/methanol, 16 μlof7 n NH4OH, 400 μl of chloroform, and 400 μlof1 m KCl. After vigorous mixing, the phases were separated by centrifugation, and both the organic phase containing LCBs and the aqueous phase containing LCBPs were collected. To quantify the amount of LCBs, the dried organic phase was first suspended in 2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and then 187 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.25% Triton X-100 was added. The samples were subjected to the LCB kinase assay described above using purified Lcb4p (10 ng) as the enzyme. For quantification, LCBPs were first converted to LCBs by alkaline phosphatase and processed as described above. The aqueous phase was mixed with 95 μl of buffer containing 500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2 and with 10 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 32 μl of HCl and 600 μl of chloroform. After vigorous mixing, the phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was collected and dried. Isolation of PHS-resistant Yeast Mutants—Exogenous PHS is known to cause growth arrest in yeast (22Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because PHS induces down-regulation of amino-acid permeases, auxotrophic cells are more sensitive to PHS compared with autotrophic cells (22Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SEY6210 cells, which carry the leu2 trp1 mutation and so are tryptophan and leucine auxotrophs, were found to be sensitive to 12.5 μm PHS. In contrast, SEY6210 cells harboring the pRS314 (TRP1+) and pRS315 (LEU2+) plasmids were resistant to as much as 15 μm PHS (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOAccumulation of LCBPs inhibits cell growthPHSStrain0 μm5 μm7.5 μm10 μm12.5 μm15 μm20 μmSEY6210+++++++++/----SEY6210/pRS314/pRS315+++++++++++++/--KHY13/pRS315++++++++++/----KHY22++++++++++++++++++++KHY388+aCells exhibited heterogeneous growth.+/-aCells exhibited heterogeneous growth.-----KHY389++/------a Cells exhibited heterogeneous growth. Open table in a new tab Exogenous PHS is readily imported into yeast cells and converted to PHS1P by Lcb4p. In turn, PHS1P is degraded by Dpl1p to a long-chain fatty aldehyde and phosphoethanolamine or by Lcb3p to PHS. Because overaccumulated PHS1P has toxic effects (23Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J.

Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the toxicity of exogenously added PHS is determined not only by the PHS itself, but also by PHS1P. In growth studies, the Δdpl1 cells (KHY13/pRS315) were more sensitive to PHS compared with the wild-type cells (SEY6210/pRS314/pRS315), whereas the Δdpl1 Δlcb4 double mutant cells (KHY22) were highly resistant (TABLE TWO). These results indicate that the effect of PHS1P is more prominent than that of PHS in cells autotrophic for tryptophan and leucine. A Δlcb3 or Δdpl1 single mutation does not affect cell growth, but a double deletion mutation is lethal or impairs growth severely depending on the yeast background (9Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang X. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the yeast background used here (SEY6210), the Δdpl1 Δlcb3 cells (KHY388) were able to grow, but did so poorly (TABLE TWO). Moreover, when grown on YPD plates, their colony sizes were highly heterogeneous. When KHY388 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3) cells were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining under an immunofluorescence microscope, most cells contained nuclei with aberrant morphology (Fig. 1, right panels). Some had fragmented or multiple nuclei, and even cells with no nucleus were observed. This morphology was quite different from that observed in the wild-type cells, which each possessed a single round nucleus (Fig. 1, left panels). The heterogeneous growth of the cells might be the result of differences in the extent of the chromosomal integrity. We isolated KHY389 cells from KHY388 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3) cells as clones exhibiting homologous growth. Although KHY389 cells still grew more slowly than the wild-type cells (TABLE TWO), the morphology of their nuclei was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type cells (data not shown). The introduction of plasmids encoding LCB3 or DPL1 into KHY389 cells only slightly suppressed their slow growth (data not shown). These results suggest that KHY389 cells carry a suppressor mutation that is a disadvantage for growth but that confers tolerance to overaccumulated LCBPs. However, KHY389 cells still retained high sensitivity to exogenous PHS because they could not grow on YPD plates containing 7.5 μm PHS (TABLE TWO). These results indicate that KHY389 cells are less responsive to LCBPs compared with the original KHY388 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3) cells, but are still more sensitive compared with the wild-type or Δdpl1 cells. In our previous study (19Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we introduced transposon insertion mutations into KHY13 (Δdpl1) cells and screened for mutants that were resistant to 15 μm PHS. In addition to the expected LCB4 gene, we identified PDR5 and DHH1 as genes conferring PHS resistance (19Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To discover additional genes, we repeated the screening using transposon-inserted KHY389 cells and a lower concentration of PHS (7.5 μm). We expected low concentrations of PHS to provide an advantage in isolating genes involved in LCBP signaling and in regulation of LCBP synthesis rather than those involved in LCB signaling. We obtained transposon-inserted mutants that exhibited PHS resistance at a frequency of ∼1/600 mutants. Of these, 36 mutants were randomly selected, and their sites of transposon insertion were determined. We identified eight genes (PBP1, HEM14, UFD4, HMG1, TPS1, KES1, WHI2, and ERG5) that were involved in PHS resistance, in addition to the previously obtained LCB4 and PDR5 genes (TABLE THREE). Interestingly, of these eight genes, four (HMG1, ERG5, HEM14, and KES1) are known to be involved in ergosterol synthesis or distribution, either directly or indirectly.TABLE THREEGenes identified in this study and their known functionsGeneNo.aNumber of transposon-inserted mutants isolated this study.FunctionLCB411LCB kinasePBP15Poly(A)-binding protein-binding proteinHEM144Heme biosynthesis (protoporphyrinogen oxidase)UFD44Ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseHMG13Ergosterol biosynthesis (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase)TPS13α,α-Trehalose-phosphate synthasePDR52Xenobiotic-transporting ATPaseKES12Oxysterol-binding protein homologWHI21Regulator of stress response element-mediated gene expressionERG51Ergosterol biosynthesis (C22 sterol desaturase)Total36a Number of transposon-inserted mutants isolated this study. Open table in a new tab PHS Sensitivity in the Mutants of Identified Genes—We next investigated the PHS sensitivity of each isolated yeast mutant. Because all the transposon-inserted mutants contain the LEU2+ marker within the transposon, we created control KHY406 cells by introducing the LEU2+ gene into KHY389 cells, thereby providing uniform auxotrophic conditions. As shown in TABLE FOUR, all the isolated PHS-resistant yeast mutants were able to grow in the presence of 7.5 μm PHS, in contrast to control KHY406 cells, although the degree of PHS sensitivity varied. The lcb4 mutants exhibited the strongest PHS resistance, although the hmg1, pdr5, and ufd4 mutants were also quite resistant. In contrast, the whi2 and hem14 mutants exhibited only modest PHS resistance. The growth of the hem14 mutants was slower than that of control KHY406 cells in the absence of PHS and was inhibited slightly further by 7.5 μm PHS. The PHS sensitivity of the tps1 mutants differed completely from that of the other mutants. Their growth in the absence of PHS was extremely slow, yet PHS did not inhibit growth further, but rather promoted it, so that in the presence of 10 μm PHS, the tps1 mutants grew as slowly as the whi2 mutants. The pbp1, kes1, and erg5 mutants displayed the weakest resistance to PHS. Additionally, the PHS sensitivities of all these transposon-inserted mutants were identical to those of their respective deletion mutants, which we constructed using KHY406 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3 sup) cells as the parental strain (data not shown). These results confirm that the genes identified here by transposon mutagenesis are indeed responsible for PHS resistance.TABLE FOURPHS sensitivity in PHS-resistant yeast mutantsPHSStrain0 μm7.5 μm10 μmControl (KHY406)+++++--lcb4::mTn-lacZ/LEU2+++++++++++++++pbp1::mTn-lacZ/LEU2++++++++/-hem14::mTn-lacZ/LEU2++++++ufd4::mTn-lacZ/LEU2+++++++++++hmg1::mTn-lacZ/LEU2++++++++++++tps1::mTn-lacZ/LEU2+++++pdr5::mTn-lacZ/LEU2++++++++++++kes1::mTn-lacZ/LEU2+++++++-whi2::mTn-lacZ/LEU2++++++++++erg5::mTn-lacZ/LEU2+++++++- Open table in a new tab The parental strain used for transposon mutagenesis (KHY389) may carry an unidentified suppressor mutation as described above. To exclude any indirect effects of such a suppressor, we introduced the deletion mutation of each PHS-resistant gene into the suppressor-less Δdpl1 single mutation-containing KHY360 cells and examined their PHS sensitivities. The growth of KHY360 (Δdpl1) cells was inhibited by PHS in a dose-dependent manner, so that at 12.5 μm PHS, the cells grew only weakly (TABLE FIVE). Most of the mutations introduced here conferred apparent PHS resistance, and the order of the strength of this resistance was similar to that observed in the transposon-inserted mutants presented in TABLE FOUR. However, the PHS resistance of the Δhem14 and Δerg5 cells was rather unclear (TABLE FIVE). The growth rate of the Δhem14 cells was similar to that of control KHY360 cells at 10 μm PHS and even weaker at 12.5 μm PHS. However, considering that the growth of the Δhem14 cells was slow in the absence of PHS and that 10 μm PHS did not inhibit this already slow growth further, we concluded that the Δhem14 mutation did confer PHS resistance. On the other hand, the Δerg5 cells exhibited PHS sensitivity similar to that of control KHY360 cells at all concentrations of PHS tested. The erg5 mutation also exhibited the weakest PHS resistance in the KHY389 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3 sup) background (TABLE FOUR), suggesting that the effect of this mutation was not detectable in the KHY360 (Δdpl1) background.TABLE FIVEPHS sensitivity in the constructed deletion mutantsStrainPHS0 μm10 μm12.5 μmControl (KHY360)+++++/-Δlcb4+++++++++Δpbp1++++++/-Δhem14++-Δufd4++++++++Δhmg1++++++Δtps1+/-++Δpdr5+++++++++Δkes1++++++/-Δwhi2++++++Δerg5+++++/- Open table in a new tab Accumulation of LCBs in PHS-resistant Yeast Mutants—Reduced accumulation of exogenous PHS caused by a decrease in its uptake or an increase in its efflux is considered to be one mechanism by which mutants acquire PHS resistance. To investigate this possible mechanism in the transposon-inserted mutants, the cells were incubated with [3H]DHS for 1 h at 30°C, and the amounts of accumulated [3H]DHS were measured. [3H]DHS accumulation in the pdr5 mutants was reduced by ∼25% compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 2). This was similar to our previous results for pdr5 deletion mutants, which exhibit an enhanced efflux of LCBs attributable to an increase in the LCB-specific translocase/transporter Rsb1p (19Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the accumulation of [3H]DHS was markedly increased in the hem14 and hmg1 mutants.

In this study, we have identified APS as a novel substrate for protein kinase B/Akt using an antibody that exhibits insulin-dependent immunoreactivity with a phosphospecific antibody raised against the protein kinase B substrate consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT) and a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes serine 21/9 of glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β. This phosphorylation of APS is observed in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and transfected cells. The insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS was inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY290004, a specific protein kinase B (PKB) inhibitor, deguelin, and knockdown of Akt. Serine 588 of APS is contained in a protein kinase B consensus sequence for phosphorylation conserved in APS across multiple species but not found in other members of this family, including SH2-B and Lnk. Mutation of serine 588 to alanine abolished the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS and prevented the localization of APS to membrane ruffles. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 534-621 of APS was phosphorylated by purified PKB in vitro, and mutation of serine 588 abolished the PKB-mediated phosphorylation of APS in vitro. Taken together, this study identifies APS as a novel physiological substrate for PKB and the first serine phosphorylation site on APS.

In the context of insulinstimulated glucose transport, PI3-kinase is known to be critical but not sufficient to facilitate this pathway, suggesting that other PI3-kinase independent inputs are required for the full activation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). There are thought to be two pathways required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport: an IRS-PI3-kinase pathway and a PI3-kinase-independent pathway involving APS, CAP, and c-Cbl (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These two pathways diverge at the level of the insulin receptor. The PI3-kinase-independent pathway is initiated by the binding of APS to the phosphorylated activation loop of the insulin receptor (3Ahn M.Y. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol.

The activation of PKB and the subsequent stimulation of glucose transport appear to be unique to insulin, even though a number of other ligands and receptors activate PKB (12Welsh G.I. Hers I.

In this study we have identified the APS adapter protein as a novel substrate for PKB, thus indicating the co-dependence of the PI3-kinase-independent pathway on PI3-kinase activation. Materials—All biochemicals were purchased from Sigma except where stated. Purified, activated PKBα/Akt1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The CHO.T-APS and CHO.T-APS-CAP cell lines were as previously described. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured as previously described (3Ahn M.Y. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol.

The rabbit anti-PKBsubstrate and anti-phospho-GSK3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (14Wilcox A. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38881-38888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Serine 588 of the rat APS cDNA was mutated to alanine using recombinant circle PCR with the following oligonucleotides (rat APS sequence): sense, 5′-tgcgcgcagtagatctaacgccacagagcacctg-3′, and antisense, 5′-caggtgctctgtggcgttagatctactgcgcgca-3′, to introduce an alanine in place of serine 588 and a unique BglII site. The integrity of the construct was verified by automated dideoxy sequencing. The mutant insert as a SmaI-NotI fragment was cloned into the vector prk5 containing the wild type rat APS cDNA, and both wild type and mutant cDNAs were transiently transfected into CHO.T-Hygro cells (15Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cells were serum starved for 12 h prior to experimental manipulation. Plasmid DNA was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using FuGENE as previously described (14Wilcox A. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38881-38888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stable Expression of S588A—Mutant APS was subcloned into the plasmid pIRES Hygro and tranfected into CHO.T cells. Hygromycin-resistance clones were isolated by limiting dilution as previously described (14Wilcox A. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38881-38888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GST Fusion Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins expressing the C terminus of rat APS were expressed and purified as previously described (14Wilcox A. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38881-38888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Studies—CHO.T-APS cells were cultured on 19-mm coverslips and after appropriate culture conditions were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Immediately 4% paraformaldehyde was added for 20 min of incubation at room temperature. The paraformaldehyde was aspirated, TBS was added for 10 min, and the cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Following a brief wash with TBS, the samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin,TBS (blocking buffer) at room temperature for 15 min. After blocking, goat anti-APS (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-PKBsubstrate (9611; Cell Signaling Technology) primary antibodies were added (1:200 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After the primary antibody incubation, the samples were washed three times over 5 min with TBS at room temperature, and anti-goat and anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies (1:200) were added in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After the secondary antibody incubation, the cells were washed three times over 5 min with TBS at room temperature and then mounted onto glass slides using 50% glycerol. The samples were stored at -20 °C and processed for viewing using an inverted Zeiss axiophot microscope attached to a laser illumination unit as previously described (14Wilcox A. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38881-38888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of APS by PKB in Vitro—Soluble wt GST-APS (amino acids 534-621) and S588A GST-APS were purified from bacteria as previously described, eluted from the agarose beads, and resuspended in 50% glycerol prior to storage at -20 °C (16Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation conditions are based on that described by Berwick et al. (17Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For the kinase reaction, 3 μl of GST fusion protein, either wild type or S588A mutant fusion protein, were incubated with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 100 μm ATP to a final volume of 20 μl. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min, and the kinase assay was terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 4 min. Western Blotting—The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis using 10% NuPage Novex gels (Invitrogen), transferred onto 2-μm Invitrogen polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and Western blotted with anti-PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all instances, immunoreactive bands were detected with the use of horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibodies as appropriate and enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal; Pierce Chemical Company). siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Akt—The Signalsilence Akt siRNA kit was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used to knock down Akt1 and Akt2 in CHO cells. Cells were transfected with 50 nm Akt siRNA or control siRNA 48 h prior to cell lysis. The cells were stimulated with insulin, and APS was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc 9E10 as described above and blotted with anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. Insulin Stimulates APS Phosphorylation on a Site Recognized by the Anti-PKBsubstrate Antibody in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and CHO Cells—Initially, we determined whether there was evidence for PKB-mediated phosphorylation of APS in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A), a widely used model for studies of insulin action and glucose transport. Cells were cultured under standard conditions and then serum starved and stimulated with insulin for 30 min. The lysates were incubated with immobilized anti-PKBsubstrate to capture PKB substrates. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed with anti-APS antibody. The results demonstrate that APS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is captured by the immobilized anti-PKBsubstrate, indicating that APS is a physiological substrate for PKB in native untransfected cells such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A). Because the interaction of the anti-PKBsubstrate may be indirect, we determined whether the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody interacted directly with APS. APS was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with insulin, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-PKBsubstrate antibody (Fig. 1B). APS was detected with the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody following insulin stimulation but not when cells were preincubated with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. To analyze this phosphorylation further, we used transfected cells overexpressing insulin receptor and Myc epitope-tagged APS (3Ahn M.Y. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21526-21532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In CHO.T-APS cells, insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of APS on a PKB consensus site. Cells were stimulated with insulin or fetal calf serum, and Myc epitope-tagged APS was precipitated with anti-Myc antibody and analyzed by blotting with anti-PKBsubstrate. As shown in the figure, the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody detected APS in the Myc immunoprecipitates, indicating that the results obtained in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were due to phosphorylation of endogenous APS on a PKB consensus site. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS on an PKB consensus site was found to be dose dependent (Fig. 1D). Stimulation of cells with varying concentrations of insulin demonstrated that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS was detectable at 10 ng/ml insulin. We also used phosphospecific antibodies to phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 to determine whether the site phosphorylated in response to insulin cross-reacted (Fig. 2). The phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody recognizes GSK3α or -β when these are phosphorylated by PKB at serines 21 and 9, respectively. These are contained in a PKB consensus site. Cells expressing wild type APS or mutant APS containing the S533A mutation were starved and stimulated with insulin. Myc-tagged APS was then immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-phospho-GSK3. The results show that following insulin stimulation, the antibody detects serine phosphorylation of APS, possibly by reacting with a phosphorylated consensus sequence, but not when serine 588 is mutated to alanine. Effects of Inhibitors on Insulin-stimulated Serine Phosphorylation of APS—We next wanted to confirm that the phosphorylation of APS was dependent on PI3-kinase-dependent pathways and/or PKB-dependent pathways using chemical inhibitors (Fig. 3). Both LY294002 (Fig. 3A) and deguelin (Fig. 3B), a PKB inhibitor (18Chun K.H. Kosmeder II, J.W. Sun S. Pezzuto J.M. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Lee H.Y. J Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Bortul R. Tazzari P.L. Billi A.M. Tabellini G. Mantovani I. Cappellini A. Grafone T. Martinelli G. Conte R. Martelli A.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS. Cells were treated with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase or deguelin, and then Myc-tagged APS was immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-PKBsubstrate. Both LY294002 and deguelin inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS to basal levels. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Akt1 and Akt2 Abolishes the Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of APS on a PKB Consensus Site—We used commercially available siRNA targeting Akt1 and 2 to confirm the role of Akt in mediating this phosphorylation event in intact cells (Fig. 3C). CHO cells were transfected with SiRNA, and the cells were stimulated with insulin. Akt expression as detected by immunoblotting was decreased by 80%, and this abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS and activation of GSK3. Identification of Serine 588 as a Phosphorylation Site for PKB—Scanning of the APS sequence revealed that serine 588 of APS is contained in a consensus sequence that would be recognized by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody and would be regarded as a consensus sequence for PKB. Serine 588 is contained in the sequence 583RSRSNS588, which conforms to the PKB consensus site RXRXXS (20Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Serine 588 was mutated to alanine, and the mutant construct was transiently transfected into CHO.T cells along with the wild type construct. As seen in Fig. 4A, mutation of Ser-588 abolished the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of APS as detected by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. In a separate experiment, we also analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of APS to demonstrate that the overall function of APS as a substrate was preserved. Mutation of serine 588 to alanine abolished the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation but did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of APS. Phosphorylation of Wild Type APS but Not Mutant S588A APS by Purified PKB—We next tested whether PKB would phosphorylate APS directly in vitro to exclude the possibility that an intermediate kinase may be mediating this phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Amino acids 534-621 of APS were expressed as a GST fusion protein and then used as a substrate in a kinase reaction in vitro using purified constitutively activated PKB. As shown in the figure, PKB phosphorylated the wild type GST fusion protein but not the mutant GST fusion protein containing a serine to alanine substitution at 588, as detected by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. Inhibition of PI3-Kinase-dependent Pathways Prevents the Localization of APS to Membrane Ruffles—We used immunofluorescence to determine whether inhibition of PI3-kinase would affect the localization of APS (Fig. 6). CHO.T-APS cells were serum starved and stimulated with insulin, and the cells were immunostained with anti-APS antibody and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Insulin stimulation led to the localization of APS to membrane ruffles (indicated by arrows), whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase with LY294002 resulted in the loss of APS localization to membrane ruffles (Fig. 6A). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes the absence of membrane ruffling is well known, and it is not therefore possible to analyze the formation of ruffles. Following insulin stimulation in adipocytes, there is co-localization of APS and PKB substrate staining that is abolished in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 6B). Mutation of serine 588 to alanine markedly reduced the localization of APS to membrane ruffles when compared with the wild type (Fig. 6C). In this study we have identified a substrate for protein kinase B/Akt, the APS adapter protein. This not only defines the APS adapter protein as a novel in vivo substrate for PKB but also provides the first identification of a serine phosphorylation site in APS and adds to the increasing amount of information on the phosphorylation consensus recognition sequences that can be tolerated by PKB in an intact substrate. Our evidence is based on a number of correlates. (i) the APS adapter protein is phosphorylated in intact cells, both transfected CHO cells and untransfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes, on a site recognized by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. (ii) A second phosphospecific antibody that recognizes a known PKB phosphorylation site in GSK3 cross-reacts with APS following insulin stimulation. (iii) Inhibition of PI3-kinase-dependent pathways in intact cells by chemical inhibitors or by using small inhibitory RNA block the recognition of APS by the antibody. (iv) Mutation of Ser-588 to alanine in full-length APS abolishes the phosphorylation in intact cells. (v) PKB phosphorylates APS directly in vitro on a site recognized by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. (vi) Mutation of serine 588 to alanine abolishes the phosphorylation in vitro. The utility of the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody has now been demonstrated in numerous studies and has been used to identify substrates for protein kinase B/Akt (7Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The antibody recognizes the serinephosphorylated consensus sequence RXRXXS; in the rat APS cDNA, this is contained in a single site at 583RSRSNS588 with serine 588 corresponding to the phosphorylated residue. This serine residue, located in the C terminus of APS, is also conserved across a wide range of species including mammal (human, mouse, rat) and non-mammalian sequences (chicken, blowfish, pufferfish, and frog) (Fig. 7), implying evolutionary and functional importance. Interestingly, this phosphorylation site is not conserved in other members of this protein family, such as the SH2-B isoforms and Lnk. We have previously shown that APS and SH2-B differ in their functional capacity in relation to tyrosine phosphorylation (15Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); this has been confirmed by detailed structural analysis (23Hu J. Liu J. Ghirlando R. Saltiel A.R. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1379-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Hu J. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18943-18949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, APS and SH2-B differ in the ability to couple to downstream signaling pathways. The lack of a similar PKB consensus site in SH2-B and Lnk would create conditions for directing these molecules to distinct subcellular compartments. This is supported by the effects of a PI3-kinase inhibitor on the localization of APS analyzed by immunofluorescence. Inhibition of PI3-kinase leads to the loss of APS from membrane ruffles. Thus, the function of this insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation may be to direct APS to a specific subcellular compartment. The derivation of the consensus PKB phosphorylation site, RXRXX(S/T) has emerged from studies that have utilized synthetic peptide libraries. The short peptide sequence ARKRERAYSFGHHA was found to be the optimal substrate for phosphorylation (20Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The arginine at -5 does not appear to be critical for phosphorylation by PKB, although this decreases the Vmax/Km for phosphorylation by PKB. Interestingly, the mouse sequence contains a histidine at position -5. The arginine residue at -3 was found to be critical for phosphorylation of this peptide substrate in vitro. Unsurprisingly, the critical arginine at -3 is conserved between all of the species shown. Many known PKB substrates contain a serine in the -2 position, and this is observed in the sequences for APS. In addition, the online motif identification program Scansite (25Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) gives serine 588 a score of 0.5750, which is greater than several known substrates of PKB, including BAD and FKHRL1. It is not known whether APS contains a PKB docking site (16Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or whether this is required for PKB substrates in the same way as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. However, it appears that only amino acids 534-621 are required for phosphorylation by PKB, at least in vitro, which may imply that the putative docking site, if present, lies within this region. This is certainly a hypothesis that can be tested in future experiments. In summary, our study has shown that serine 588 of APS is a newly identified target for protein kinase B in intact cells and in vitro and is the first serine phosphorylation site identified on APS to date. Furthermore, our data imply that the neoclassical PI3-kinase “independent” pathway receives an input from the classical PI3-kinase pathway, indicating a degree of molecular cross-talk. Therefore, these pathways are not mutually exclusive as previously thought but may in fact converge at the level of PKB, a critical component in the pathway leading to insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Furthermore, the interaction of PKB with APS adds to the list of previously identified interactions for this activation loop-binding protein that include CAP, c-Cbl, and Asb6 (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S.

The precise function of this PKB-mediated phosphorylation event is not entirely clear but may be responsible for regulating cellular localization and will be the subject of future investigation.
