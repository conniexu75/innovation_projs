https://openalex.org/W2901854350,"Antibiotic dispensing without a prescription poses a threat to public health as it leads to excessive antibiotic consumption. Inappropriate antibiotic availability to the community has been documented to be amongst drivers of antimicrobial resistance emergence. Community pharmacies are a source of antibiotics in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed at assessing antibiotic dispensing practices by community pharmacy retailers in Moshi urban, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and recommend interventions to improve practice. Using a Simulated Client (SC) Method, an observational cross-sectional survey of antibiotic dispensing practices was conducted from 10th June to 10th July 2017. Data analysis was done using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A total of 82 pharmacies were visited. Part I pharmacies were 26 (31.71%) and 56 (68.29%) were part II. Overall 92.3% (95% CI 77.8–97.6) of retailers dispensed antibiotics without prescriptions. The antibiotics most commonly dispensed without a prescription were ampiclox for cough (3 encounters) and azithromycin for painful urination (3 encounters). An oral third generation cephalosporin (cefixime) was dispensed once for painful urination without prescription by a part I pharmacy retailer. Out of 21, 15(71.43%) prescriptions with incomplete doses were accepted and had antibiotics dispensed. Out of 68, 4(5.9%) retailers gave instructions for medicine use voluntarily. None of the retailers voluntarily explained drug side-effects. In Moshi pharmacies, a high proportion of antibiotics are sold and dispensed without prescriptions. Instructions for medicine use are rarely given and none of the retailers explain side effects. These findings support the need for a legislative enforcement of prescription-only antibiotic dispensing rules and regulations. Initiation of clinician and community antibiotic stewardship and educational programs on proper antibiotic use to both pharmacists and public by the regulatory bodies are highly needed."
https://openalex.org/W2901321875,"Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers’ professional knowledge for successful students’ learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers’ motivational orientations for students’ performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students’ learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains’ relations to students’ performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students’ performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers’ motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students’ performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers’ motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers’ subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students’ performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2900939611,"The objective of this study is to establish a framework for analyzing infrastructure dynamics affecting the long-term steady state, and hence resilience in civil infrastructure systems. To this end, a multi-agent simulation model was created to capture important phenomena affecting the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems and model the long-term performance regimes of infrastructure. The proposed framework captures the following three factors that shape the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems: (i) engineered physical infrastructure; (ii) human actors; and (iii) chronic and acute stressors. A complex system approach was adopted to examine the long-term resilience of infrastructure based on the understanding of performance regimes, as well as tipping points at which shifts in the performance regime of infrastructure occur under the impact of external stressors and/or change in internal dynamics. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a case of urban water distribution infrastructure using the data from a numerical case study network. The developed multi-agent simulation model was then used in examining the system resilience over a 100-year horizon under stressors such as population change and funding constraints. The results identified the effects of internal dynamics and external stressors on the resilience landscape of infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the results also showed the capability of the framework in capturing and simulating the underlying mechanisms affecting human-infrastructure dynamics, as well as long-term regime shifts and tipping point behaviors. Therefore, the integrated framework proposed in this paper enables building complex system-based theories for a more advanced understanding of civil infrastructure resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2900803580,"The primary goal of precision medicine is to minimize side effects and optimize efficacy of treatments. Recent advances in medical imaging technology allow the use of more advanced image analysis methods beyond simple measurements of tumor size or radiotracer uptake metrics. The extraction of quantitative features from medical images to characterize tumor pathology or heterogeneity is an interesting process to investigate, in order to provide information that may be useful to guide the therapies and predict survival. This paper discusses the rationale supporting the concept of radiomics and the feasibility of its application to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the field of radiation oncology research. We studied 91 stage III patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation and adaptive approach in case of tumor reduction during treatment. We considered 12 statistics features and 230 textural features extracted from the CT images. In our study, we used an ensemble learning method to classify patients’ data into either the adaptive or non-adaptive group during chemoradiation on the basis of the starting CT simulation. Our data supports the hypothesis that a specific signature can be identified (AUC 0.82). In our experience, a radiomic signature mixing semantic and image-based features has shown promising results for personalized adaptive radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2900837891,"Although social participation (SP) is valid in active aging, it is vague which types and the frequency of SP are effective in maintaining instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study and investigated the association of the types and frequency for SP with IADL decline in community-dwelling older adults.The target population were all individuals aged ≥65 living in a commuter town in Nara, Japan. A total of 6,013 participants with independent IADL at baseline were analyzed. IADL was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Six SP types were assessed: volunteer groups, sports groups, hobby clubs, senior citizens' clubs, neighborhood community associations, and cultural clubs. The frequency of SP was categorized into frequent (i.e., weekly or more), moderate (i.e., monthly or yearly), and non-participation. Using multiple logistic regression models, the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for IADL decline were calculated. Covariates included age, marital status, education, subjective economic status, work status, body mass index, chronic medical conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease), lifestyle factors (i.e., alcohol, smoking, and exercise), self-rated health, depression, and cognitive functioning. To examine gender differences, stratified analyses by gender were performed.During the 33-month follow-up, 16.4% of men and 8.7% of women exhibited IADL decline. After adjustment for all covariates, compared to those who never participated, women with moderate participation had significantly lower odds of IADL decline in volunteer groups (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.31-0.88), hobby clubs (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.79), neighborhood community associations (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42-0.81), and cultural clubs (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.31-0.82), and women with frequent participation had lower odds of IADL decline in hobby clubs (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43-0.93). In contrast, among men, the significant association between SP and less risk of IADL decline was limited to moderate participation in neighborhood community associations (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63-0.99), and there were no differences between frequent participation and non-participation in all types of SP. Regarding volunteer groups, compared to women with frequent participation, women with moderate participation had a significantly lower risk of IADL decline (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18-0.77). The results of additional stratified analyses by self-rated health, depression, and cognitive functioning showed that the associations of the type and frequency of SP with IADL decline varied according to physical and mental functioning.Several types of SP have a favorable effect on IADL through moderate participation rather than frequent participation, and women with moderate participation in volunteer groups have a more beneficial effect on IADL than women with frequent participation. When advising community-dwelling older adults on SP for IADL maintenance, health professionals may need to take into account plateau effects, gender differences, and physical and mental functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2900621070,"Peppers (Capsicum spp.) are one of the most important vegetables and their double use (vegetable or spice) and two commercial stages (unripe and fully ripe) contributed to their use in many recipes and fast diffusion from America. Nowadays, Spain is a center of diversity for C. annuum, with many landraces, offering a great opportunity for adaptation to organic cultivation. Furthermore, Capsicum peppers contain many bioactive compounds, essential to provide high added-value to these cultivars, especially for organic markets, although knowledge about the effect of organic cultivation on Capsicum fruit quality is still scarce. Here, 37 accessions of Spanish landraces and foreign materials from C. annuum and other species were grown under organic and conventional conditions and evaluated for ascorbic acid (AAC), total phenolics (TP) and total red and yellow/orange carotenoids, considering both ripening stages. A large genotypic variation was found within each ripening stage and growing condition for the studied traits. Also, both stages showed high levels, although fully ripe fruits were the richest. Organic conditions enabled higher levels in fully ripe fruits of AAC and TP on average (135 vs 117 mg·100 g-1 and 232 vs 206 mg·100 g-1) and in most accessions, although the genotype×growing conditions interaction also contributed, but at lower extent, to the observed variation. Significant genotype×ripening stage and growing conditions×ripening stage interactions were also found, suggesting that the magnitude of the increase with ripening depends on the accession and growing conditions. By contrast, there were no differences between growing conditions for carotenoids and differences were mainly due to the genotype factor. Finally, the large genotypic variation and favourable organic conditions allowed identifying several materials from different types and uses with very high levels of bioactive compounds for organic cultivation, in both ripening stages but particularly at fully ripe stage (>500 mg·100 g-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2900469717,"Illness perceptions, which are likely influenced by patients’ cultural contexts, are associated with disease self-management and adherence. African American patients perceptions of type 2 diabetes is not well understood and no known studies has used a comprehensive evidence-based theoretical framework to explore what AAs with type 2 diabetes know, believe, and think about type 2 diabetes. Understanding perceptions of an illness shared by a group of people will be useful in developing culturally-appropriate interventions targeted to the needs of the community. The purpose of this study is to explore African Americans’ perceptions of type 2 diabetes based on the common sense model of illness and self-regulation. Using a phenomenology qualitative approach and purposive sampling, 40 African American men and women, age 45–60 years old with diagnosed type 2 diabetes at least one year prior, and who took at least one prescription diabetes medication, participated in six semi-structured 90-minute focus groups conducted in a private space. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to explore African Americans beliefs about type 2 diabetes. Participants expressed that historical issues, e.g., slavery, healthcare providers, the government, and God influenced how they developed diabetes. Participants reported a loss of autonomy, a change of their identity as an employee, a social individual and sexual person, as well as anger and frustration due to having diabetes. Diabetes made the African American family bonding experience of eating difficult, and the disease diminished their cultural experiences. Concerns about diabetes ranged from fear of death and amputations to the inability to prevent the disease among their children/grandchildren. Participants perceived that medications, faith in God, and positive thinking about survival helped control diabetes. Conclusions: Improved diabetes self-management and medication adherence may depend on the meaning African Americans attach to diabetes, available psychosocial support for managing diabetes, and African Americans experience with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2900866658,"Haloxylon salicornicum moq. Bunge ex Boiss (Rimth) is one of the native plants of Kuwait, extensively depleting through the anthropogenic activities. It is important to conserve Haloxylon community in Kuwait as it can tolerate extreme adverse conditions of drought and salinity to be potentially used in the desert and urban revegetation and greenery national programs. Therefore, a set of 16 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to assess genetic diversity and population structure of 108 genotypes from six locations in Kuwait. The ISSR primers produced 195 unambiguous and reproducible bands out of which 167 bands were polymorphic (86.5%) with a mean PIC value of 0.31. The overall average values of Nei’s gene diversity (h') and Shannon’s diversity index (I) were 0.254 and 0.375, respectively. Results of AMOVA revealed high genetic variations within populations (77.8%) and low among populations (22%). The values of Fixation index (FST = 0.22; P = 0.0), Genetic differentiation (GST = 0.262; G’ST = 0.327; D = 0.335 and Gene flow (NM = 0.880) were indicative of heterozygous populations. The results of STRUCTURE and split decomposition analysis suggested that the Rimth accessions of Kuwait can be grouped into five and six subpopulations, respectively. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) grouped them into three clusters. The pairwise Nei’s genetic distances (DS) among populations demonstrated a narrow range from 0.047 to 0.187 (Scale-0.0 to 1.0). The Mantel’s test revealed a weak correlation (r2- 0.188; P-0.013) between the genetic distance and geographic distances. Our results suggest that the narrowly distributed Haloxylon community in Kuwait demonstrated a high genetic diversity within the populations however the overall population structure was weak."
https://openalex.org/W2901028403,"Although water is a critical resource for organisms, microbially-mediated processes such as decomposition and nitrogen (N) transformations can endure within ecosystems even when water is scarce. To identify underlying mechanisms, we examined the genetic potential for fungi to contribute to specific aspects of carbon (C) and N cycling in a drought manipulation in Southern California grassland. In particular, we measured the frequency of fungal functional genes encoding enzymes that break down cellulose and chitin, and take up ammonium and amino acids, in decomposing litter. Furthermore, we used ""microbial cages"" to reciprocally transplant litter and microbes between control and drought plots. This approach allowed us to distinguish direct effects of drought in the plot environment versus indirect effects via shifts in the microbial community or changes in litter chemistry. For every fungal functional gene we examined, the frequency of that gene within the microbial community increased significantly in drought plots compared to control plots. In contrast, when plot environment was held constant, frequencies of these fungal functional genes did not differ significantly between control-derived microbes versus drought-derived microbes, or between control-derived litter versus drought-derived litter. It appears that drought directly selects for fungi with the genetic capacity to acquire these specific C- and N-containing compounds. This genetic trait may allow fungi to take advantage of ephemeral water supplies. Altogether, proliferation of fungi with the genetic capacity for C and N acquisition may contribute to the maintenance of biogeochemical cycling under drought."
https://openalex.org/W2901428199,"Background Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cancer aggressiveness, but studies focused on specific tumors are lacking. In this pilot study we investigated whether SDB is associated with breast cancer (BC) aggressiveness. Methods 83 consecutive women <65 years diagnosed with primary BC underwent a home respiratory polygraphy. Markers of SDB severity included the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI4). The Ki67 proliferation index, lack of hormone receptors (HR-), Nottingham Histological Grade (NHG), and tumor stage were used as markers of BC aggressiveness. The association between SDB and molecular subtypes of BC was also assessed. Results The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (8.8) years and body mass index was 27.4 (5.4) Kg/m2. 42 women (50.6%) were post-menopausal. The median (IQR) AHI was 5.1 (2–9.4), and ODI4 was 1.5 (0.5–5.8). The median (IQR) AHI did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% [5.1 (2.6–8.3) vs 5.0 (1.5–10), p = 0.89)], HR- and HR+ [5.7 (1.6–12.4) vs 4.9 (2–9.4), p = 0.68], NHG (Grade3, Grade2, and Grade1; p = 0.86), tumor stage (stage III-IV, stage II, and stage I; p = 0.62), or molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and triple negative; p = 0.90). The prevalence of an AHI≥5 did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% (51.2% vs 52.3%, p = 0.90), HR- and HR+ (58.3% vs 49.1%, p = 0.47), NHG categories (p = 0.89), different tumor stages (p = 0.71), or molecular subtypes (p = 0.73). These results did not change when the ODI4 was used instead of the AHI. Conclusion Our results do not support an association between the presence or severity of SDB and BC aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2901558826,"Background The goal is to determine the delays and reduced rates of kidney transplant (KTx) for the Indigenous Americans and variables predictive of these outcomes at a large single transplant center. Methods 300 Indigenous Americans and 300 non-Hispanic white American patients presenting for KTx evaluation from 2012–2016 were studied. Results Compared to whites, the Indigenous Americans had the following: more diabetes, dialysis, physical limitation and worse socioeconomic characteristics(p<0.01); median difference of 20 day delay from referral to KTx evaluation, 17 day delay from approval to UNOS listing and 126.5 longer delay on the waitlist compared to whites(p<0.001). Of the Indigenous Americans listed, more died, were removed, or were still waiting than transplanted compared to whites (p<0.001). Variables predictive of delay from referral to transplant evaluation included: Indigenous race, distance from transplant center, coronary artery disease, and time on dialysis (p<0.05). Cumulative incidence of waitlisting and KTx was lower for Indigenous Americans (p<0.0001). Independent predictors of decreased likelihood of waitlisting included age, peripheral vascular disease, no caregiver, physical limitation, and illegal drug use history (p<0.05). Variables predictive of lower likelihood of KTx included Indigenous race, percentage of time inactive on the waitlist, no caregiver, and O blood type. Conclusions Among patients referred and evaluated for KTx, the Indigenous American race was independently associated with significant delays in the KTx process after accounting for co-morbid and socioeconomic factors. Cardiovascular morbidity and physical limitation were identified as important determinants of delay and decreased likelihood of waitlisting. Further quantitative and qualitative work is needed to identify and intervene on modifiable barriers to improve access to KTx for the Indigenous Americans."
https://openalex.org/W2901842190,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between expertise, performance, and gaze behavior in a complex error-detection cockpit task. Twenty-four pilots and 26 non-pilots viewed video-clips from a pilot’s viewpoint and were asked to detect malfunctions in the cockpit instrument panel. Compared to non-pilots, pilots detected more malfunctioning instruments, had shorter dwell times on the instruments, made more transitions, visited task-relevant areas more often, and dwelled longer on the areas between the instruments. These results provide evidence for three theories that explain underlying processes for expert performance: The long-term working memory theory, the information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception. In addition, the results for generic attentional skills indicated a higher capability to switch between global and local information processing in pilots compared to non-pilots. Taken together, the results suggest that gaze behavior as well as other generic skills may provide important information concerning underlying processes that can explain successful performance during flight in expert pilots."
https://openalex.org/W2901314953,"Purpose Fibrin clot is essential for post-operative abdominal adhesion formation. Fucoidans, sulfated polysaccharides, inhibit fibrin clot formation. In addition, they inhibit inflammation and fibrosis, which also play important roles in adhesion formation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fucoidans’ potential for inhibiting post-operative abdominal adhesions and measure their effects on systemic coagulation parameters when administered intraperitoneally (IP). Methods and materials Female Sprague Dawley rats were studied. A 2.5x2.5cm full thickness segment of abdominal wall was excised. The skin edges were approximated. This model induces extensive adhesions and allows objective quantitation. Three fucoidans were evaluated- Sigma Fucoidan Crude (SFC), Fucus vesiculosis 95% (Sigma) and, Peridan. One protocol involved continuous infusion into the abdomen from a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Alternatively, boluses of the solutions were injected IP at the end of the operation. Rats were sacrificed a week later. Adhesion extent was scored. Systemic coagulation effects of fucoidans were also evaluated. INR and aPTT were measured following IP injection of the fucoidan solutions and after 7 days of continuous infusion. Results Animals given a continuous infusion of either SFC or Peridan yielded adhesion reduction of 80 to 90% from control. Bolus Peridan had no discernable influence on adhesion formation, but a single bolus of SFC caused significant adhesion reductions. Peridan resulted in prompt aPTT elevations which fell to nearly normal by 5 hours. The maximum peak value after SFC injection was seen in 15 hours. The maximal INR elevations were around 2. Measurement of INR and aPTT after a week of continuous infusion of either Peridan or SFC, were always in the normal control range. The third agent, Sigma, frequently yielded intraperitoneal infection found at autopsy. Conclusions These findings indicate that selected fucoidans infused intraperitoneally for a week after abdominal operations reduce adhesion extent by up to 90%."
https://openalex.org/W2900881204,"Necroptosis is a programmed necrosis, regulated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1(RIP1) and receptor interacting protein kinase 3(RIP3), and could be inhibited by necrostatin-1(Nec-1) specifically. This study aims to evaluate the effect of Nec-1 on LPS-treated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). In the research, three groups were established: normal cultured PDLSCs, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)-LPS stimulated PDLSCs and Pg-LPS+Nec-1 treated PDLSCs. The expression of RIP1 and RIP3 and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs in three groups were analyzed. Then, we constructed cell aggregates (CA) using PDLSCs, then PDLSCs-CA were combined with Bio-Oss in three groups were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice to assess their potentials of periodontal tissue regeneration. The results showed that RIP1 and RIP3 were fully expressed in Pg-LPS stimulated PDLSCs and the level increased significantly. Nec-1 inhibited RIP1-RIP3 interaction, and further inhibited necroptosis of PDLSCs in inflammatory state. Moreover, Nec-1 pretreatment ameliorates the osteogenic differentiation of LPS-treated PDLSCs and can effectively promote the cementum like structure ectopic regenerative ability of PDLSCs in nude mice. These findings show RIP1/RIP3-mediated necroptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in PDLSCs. Nec-1 has a protective effect in reducing cell death and promotes ectopic periodontal tissue like structure regeneration by inhibiting necroptosis. Nec-1 is a hopeful therapeutic agent which protects cells from necroptosis and ameliorates functional outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2901056968,"When facing environmental change and intensified anthropogenic impact on marine ecosystems, extensive knowledge of how these systems are functioning is required in order to manage them properly. However, in high-latitude ecosystems, where climate change is expected to have substantial ecological impact, the ecosystem functions of biological species have received little attention, partly due to the limited biological knowledge of Arctic species. Functional traits address the ecosystem functions of member species, allowing the functionality of communities to be characterised and the degree of functional redundancy to be assessed. Ecosystems with higher functional redundancy are expected to be less affected by species loss, and therefore less sensitive to disturbance. Here we highlight and compare typical functional characteristics of Arctic and boreal fish in the Barents Sea and address the consequences of a community-wide reorganization driven by climate warming on functional redundancy and characterization. Based on trait and fish community composition data, we assessed functional redundancy of the Barents Sea fish community for the period 2004-2012, a period during which this northern region was characterized by rapidly warming water masses and declining sea ice coverage. We identified six functional groups, with distinct spatial distributions, that collectively provide a functional characterization of Barents Sea fish. The functional groups displayed different prevalence in boreal and Arctic water masses. Some functional groups displayed a spatial expansion towards the northeast during the study period, whereas other groups showed a general decline in functional redundancy. Presently, the observed patterns of functional redundancy would seem to provide sufficient scope for buffering against local loss in functional diversity only for the more speciose functional groups. Furthermore, the observed functional reconfiguration may affect future ecosystem functioning in the area. In a period of rapid environmental change, monitoring programs integrating functional traits will help inform management on ecosystem functioning and vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2901467602,"Probiotics improve consumers' health and additionally may positively influence the microbiological and organoleptic quality of food. In the study, legume sprouts were inoculated with Lactobacilllus plantarum 299V to produce a new functional product ensuring the growth and survival of the probiotic and high microbiological quality of the final product. Legume sprouts, which are an excellent source of nutrients, were proposed as alternative carriers for the probiotic. The key factors influencing the production of probiotic-rich sprouts include the temperature (25°C) of sprouting and methods of inoculation (soaking seeds in a suspension of probiotics). Compared to the control sprouts, the sprouts enriched with the probiotic were characterized by lower mesophilic bacterial counts. In the case of fresh and stored probiotic-rich sprouts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) accounted for a majority of total microorganisms. The Lb. plantarum population was also stable during the cold storage. The high count of LAB observed in the digest confirmed the fact that the studied sprouts are effective carriers for probiotics and ensure their survival in the harmful conditions of the digestive tract in an in vitro model. Enrichment of legume sprouts with probiotics is a successful attempt and yields products for a new branch of functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W2900740290,"This study aimed to explore societal determinants of HIV vulnerability among the clients of female commercial sex workers (FCSWs) in Belu and Malaka districts, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry using in-depth interviews was employed to collect data from participants (n = 42) recruited using a purposive and snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. The study results revealed several societal determinants that supported vulnerability to HIV infection among the participants. They included low education level and sexual health literacy including the lack of knowledge and information about HIV transmission and prevention. Additional determinants identified were limited source of HIV/AIDS-related information, availability of and ease of accessibility of brothels and FCSWs, peer influence, and high mobility of the study participants. Findings of this study indicate the needs and call for interventions that aim to protect both FCSWs and their clients, through provision of HIV/AIDS and sexual health education and information and improvement in the availability and accessibility of condoms."
https://openalex.org/W2901607598,"The fecal virome comprises a complex diversity of eukaryotic viruses, phages and viruses that infect the host. However, little is known about the intestinal community of viruses that is present in wild waterfowl, and the structure of this community in wild ducks has not yet been studied. The fecal virome compositions of six species of wild dabbling ducks and one species of wild diving duck were thus analyzed. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectums of 60 ducks donated by hunters. DNA and RNA virus particles were purified and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform. The reads obtained from the sequencing were analyzed and compared with sequences in the GenBank database. Viral-related sequences from the Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae and Myoviridae viral families showed the highest overall abundances in the samples. The virome analysis identified viruses that had not been found in wild duck feces and revealed distinct virome profiles between different species and between samples of the same species. This study increases our understanding of viruses in wild ducks as possible viral reservoirs and provides a basis for further studying and monitoring the transmission of viruses from wild animals to humans and disease outbreaks in domestic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2900564208,"Pulse wave analysis (PWA) is a useful tool for non-invasive assessment of central cardiac measures as subendocardial perfusion (Subendocardial Viability Ratio, SEVR) or contractility (dP/dtmax). The immediate influence of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on these indices has not been investigated yet.We prospectively enrolled 40 patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis receiving TAVR. Central pressure curves were derived from radial and carotid sites using PWA up to 2 days before and 7 days after TAVR. Parameters were compared between peripheral measurement sites. Changes in SEVR, dP/dtmax and in indices of vascular stiffness were assessed. Additionally, association of these variables with clinical outcome was evaluated during a 12-month follow-up.Central waveform parameters were comparable between measurement sites. SEVR, but not dP/dtmax, augmentation Index (AIx) or augmentation pressure height (AGPH) correlated significantly with disease severity reflected by peak transvalvular velocity and mean transvalvular pressure gradient over the aortic valve (Vmax, ΔPm) [r = -0.372,p = 0.029 for Vmax and r = -0.371,p = 0.021 for ΔPm]. Vmax decreased from 4.5m/s (IQR:4.1-5.0) to 2.2m/s (IQR:1.9-2.7), (p<0.001). This resulted in a significant increase in SEVR [135.3%(IQR:115.5-150.8) vs. 140.3%(IQR:123.0-172.5),p = 0.039] and dP/dtmax [666mmHg(IQR:489-891) vs. 927mmHg(IQR:693-1092),p<0.001], and a reduction in AIx [154.8%(IQR:138.3-171.0) vs. 133.5%(IQR:128.3-151.8),p<0.001] and AGPH [34.1%(IQR:26.8-39.0) vs. 25.0%(IQR 21.8-33.7),p = 0.002], confirming the beneficial effects of replacing the stenotic valve. No association of these parameters could be revealed with outcome.PWA is suitable for assessing coronary microcirculation and contractility mirrored by SEVR and maxdP/dt in the setting of aortic stenosis. PWA parameters attributed to vascular properties should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2901681410,"Most coal mines in China are currently mining close coal seams. Roadways in close coal seams, especially ultra-close coal seams, confronted difficulties in maintaining, including large deformation of the roadway, roof caving, rib spalling and floor heaving. This is mainly caused by the complicated stress and geological conditions, shattered roof, improper layout and support. To explore the issues mentioned above, the theoretical analysis was used to build a mechanical model and study the stress distribution under coal pillars, and FLAC3D modelling was adopted to build numerical models with different staggered distances. The optimal roadway layout was brought forward combining the result of numerical simulation and coal recovery rate. The field practice was carried out in the tailgate of panel 25301 to investigate the effect of the layout scheme. The results of field monitoring show that the roadway’s stability is well maintained in the mining process."

It is essential that inguinal hernia repair be performed in a safe, efficient manner to justify its widespread use. Local anesthesia has many favorable properties and has been shown to be superior, compared to regional or general anesthesia, in terms of pain control, safety profile, cost-effectiveness, resources required, and time to discharge. Local anesthesia is recommended for open repair of reducible hernias, provided clinician experience, by multiple international guidelines. Regional anesthesia is associated with myocardial infarction and other complications, and its use is discouraged by multiple guidelines, especially in older patients. This study aims to assess the current state of anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in the northern and transitional zone of Ghana. In addition we will assess the perceptions of different types of anesthesia along with understanding of evidence-based guidelines among clinicians participating in inguinal hernia repair. Methods We performed a retrospective review of all inguinal hernia repairs for male patients, 18 and older, in over 90% of hospitals in northern Ghana. All 41 hospitals were visited and caselogs and patient charts were manually reviewed to extract data. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of local anesthesia use. We designed a survey instrument to assess the perceptions of physicians and anesthetists regarding different types of anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. The survey was designed by a Ghanaian surgeon, reviewed by all co-authors, and tested prior to implementation using a sample (n = 8) of clinicians having similar practices to those of the survey population. Of 70 clinicians, 66 responded, yielding a response rate of 94%. Results 8080 patients underwent hernia repair of which 37% were performed under local anesthesia, while the majority, 60%, were performed under regional anesthesia. Negative predictors of local anesthesia were emergent repair (OR = 0.258, p < 0.001), surgery performed at a teaching hospital (OR = 0.105, p < 0.001), and bilateral hernia repair (OR = 0.374, p < 0.001). 1,839 (22.8%) of IH repairs were done on patients age 65 or older and RA was most frequently used among the elderly population (57.8%), while local anesthesia was used 39.5% of the time. Sixty-six clinicians participated in the survey with the majority reporting that local anesthesia requires fewer staff, less equipment, has a shorter recovery, is more cost-effective, and might be safer for patients. However 66% were unfamiliar with or incorrectly perceived international guidelines. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the largest assessment of anesthesia use for inguinal hernia repair in an LMIC. Although the selection of anesthetic technique should be guided by a patient’s general health, the anatomy of the hernia, and clinician judgment, local anesthesia appears to be underutilized in northern Ghana. Survey responses demonstrate high rates of unfamiliarity or incorrectly perceived evidence-based guidelines. Future research should assess how education on the benefits and technique of local anesthesia administration may further increase rates for inguinal hernia repair, especially for older patients."
https://openalex.org/W2900622447,"Maternal smoking during pregnancy has repeatedly been associated with decreased sperm counts in sons. Nevertheless, our team recently detected a lower total sperm count in the sons of smoking fathers as compared to sons of non-smoking fathers. Since paternal and maternal tobacco smoking often coincide, it is difficult to discriminate whether effects are mediated paternally or maternally when using questionnaire- or register-based studies. Therefore, getting an objective measure of the maternal nicotine exposure level during pregnancy might help disentangling the impact of paternally and maternally derived exposure.Our aim was to study how paternal smoking at the time of the pregnancy was associated with semen quality in the sons after adjusting for the maternal levels of nicotine exposure during pregnancy.We recruited 104 men (17-20 years old) from the general Swedish population. The participants answered a questionnaire about paternal smoking. Associations between smoking and semen volume, total sperm count, sperm concentration, morphology and motility were adjusted for levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine in stored maternal serum samples obtained from rubella screening between the 6th and 35th week of pregnancy. We additionally adjusted for the estimated socioeconomic status.After adjusting for the maternal cotinine, the men of smoking fathers had 41% lower sperm concentration and 51% lower total sperm count than the men of non-smoking fathers (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). This was robust to the additional adjustment.Our results suggest a negative association between paternal smoking and sperm counts in the sons, independent of the level maternal nicotine exposure during the pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2900696186,"While the importance of social networks for health behaviors is well-recognized, relatively little is known regarding the accuracy of anonymous online communication and its impact on health behavior. In 2012, we conducted a laboratory experiment in Boston, Massachusetts with 679 individuals to understand how anonymous online communication affects individual prevention decisions. Participants had to opt for or against investing in prevention over three sessions, each consisting of 15 experimental rounds. In the third session only, participants could share their experiences with a group of 1-3 other anonymous participants after each round. Groups exchanged an average of 16 messages over the 15 rounds of the third session. 70% of messages contained information about the subject's prevention decision and the resulting health outcome. Participants were more likely to communicate when they prevented than when they did not, with prevention failures resulting in the highest probability of sending a message. Nonetheless, receiving an additional message reporting prevention increased the odds a subject would prevent by 32 percent. We find that participants tend to adopt the prevention behavior reported by others, with less weight given to the reported outcomes of prevention, suggesting that social networks may influence behaviors through more than just information provision."
https://openalex.org/W2901162260,"Bumble bees (Bombus Latrielle) are significant pollinators of flowering plants due to their large body size, abundant setae, and generalist foraging strategies. However, shared setal coloration patterns among closely and distantly related bumble bee species makes identification notoriously difficult. The advent of molecular genetic techniques has increased our understanding of bumble bee evolution and taxonomy, and enables effective conservation policy and management. Individuals belonging to the North American Bombus fervidus species-complex (SC) are homogenous in body structure but exhibit significant body color phenotype variation across their geographic distribution. Given the uncertainty of the genealogical boundaries within the SC, some authors have synonymized all members of the B. fervidus SC within a single taxon, while others propose an alternative two taxa hypothesis. Operating under the phylogenetic species concept, our analysis supports the hypothesis that there are two independent lineages of bumble bees within the B. fervidus SC. With the current evidence, however, it is not possible to assign valid names to either of them, because both lineages include the color phenotypes found in the original species descriptions of B. fervidus and B. californicus. Cryptic speciation does not seem to be the product of Müllerian mimicry between the clades, because diverging coloration patterns are observed when the distribution of the clades overlaps. Furthermore, within each lineage there is evidence for strong population differentiation that is correlated with geographic distribution rather than color phenotype. In our study, we demonstrate the importance of obtaining a broad sample of multiple populations when conducting lower-level phylogenetic analyses. In addition to improving our knowledge of bumble bee diversification patterns, characterizing the evolutionary history of these pollinators provides the foundation needed to guide contemporary conservation assessments and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2901455503,"The logistic mixed model (LMM) is well-suited for the genome-wide association study (GWAS) of binary agronomic traits because it can include fixed and random effects that account for spurious associations. The recent implementation of a computationally efficient model fitting and testing approach now makes it practical to use the LMM to search for markers associated with such binary traits on a genome-wide scale. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to assess the applicability of the LMM for GWAS in crop diversity panels. We dichotomized three publicly available quantitative traits in a maize diversity panel and two quantitative traits in a sorghum diversity panel, and them performed a GWAS using both the LMM and the unified mixed linear model (MLM) on these dichotomized traits. Our results suggest that the LMM is capable of identifying statistically significant marker-trait associations in the same genomic regions highlighted in previous studies, and this ability is consistent across both diversity panels. We also show how subpopulation structure in the maize diversity panel can underscore the LMM’s superior control for spurious associations compared to the unified MLM. These results suggest that the LMM is a viable model to use for the GWAS of binary traits in crop diversity panels and we therefore encourage its broader implementation in the agronomic research community."
https://openalex.org/W2901747894,"The abundance of skeletal remains of cave bears in Pleistocene deposits can offer crucial information on the biology and life history of this megafaunal element. The histological study of 62 femora from 23 different European localities and comparisons with specimens of five extant ursid species revealed novel data on tissue types and growth patterns. Cave bear’s femoral bone microstructure is characterized by a fibrolamellar complex with increasing amounts of parallel-fibered and lamellar bone towards the outer cortex. Remodelling of the primary bone tissue initially occurs close to the perimedullary margin of the bone cortex around the linea aspera. Although similar histological traits can be observed in many extant bear species, the composition of the fibrolamellar complex can vary greatly. Cave bears reached skeletal maturity between the ages of 10 and 14, which is late compared to other bear species. There is a significant correlation between altitude and growth, which reflects the different body sizes of cave bears from different altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2901238093,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to use standard automated perimetry to compare fixation variability among the dominant eye fixation, non-dominant eye fixation, and binocular fixation conditions. Thirty-five eyes of 35 healthy young participants underwent standard automated perimetry (Humphrey 24-2 SITA-Standard) in dominant eye fixation, non-dominant eye fixation, and binocular fixation conditions. Fixation variability during foveal threshold and visual field measurement, which was recorded using a wearable eye-tracking glass and calculated using the bivariate contour ellipse area (deg2), was compared among the three fixation conditions. Further, the association of bivariate contour ellipse area with ocular position and fusional amplitude during binocular fixation was analysed. There were no significant differences in bivariate contour ellipse area during foveal threshold measurement among the dominant eye fixation (1.75 deg2), non-dominant eye fixation (1.45 deg2), and binocular fixation (1.62 deg2) conditions. In contrast, the bivariate contour ellipse area during visual field measurement in binocular fixation (2.85 deg2) was significantly lower than the bivariate contour ellipse area in dominant eye fixation (4.62 deg2; p = 0.0227) and non-dominant eye fixation (5.24 deg2; p = 0.0006) conditions. There was no significant difference in bivariate contour ellipse area during visual field measurement between dominant eye fixation and non-dominant eye fixation conditions. There was no significant correlation between bivariate contour ellipse area and either ocular position or fusional amplitude during both foveal threshold and visual field measurements. Thus, fixation variability might be improved in binocular fixation conditions during a long-duration test, such as visual field measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2901823663,"Accurate spatial co-registration of EEG electrode positions with individual head models is an important component for EEG source localization and imaging. Due to variations in head shape between individuals, this requires measurements of electrode locations in each individual. Existing hardware for digitization can be accurate, but also relatively expensive. With the goal of making digitization more accessible for a range of research laboratories, we have developed an open-source software tool that can make use of less expensive consumer virtual reality hardware for EEG electrode digitization. Here we describe our developed VRDigitizer system and compare it to existing digitization solutions. Experimental evaluations were performed in a phantom head model and in 12 human subjects. In our comparison experiments, VRDigitizer was able to measure electrode positions with a mean error of 3.74 mm, compared to 1.73 mm and 2.98 mm for the commercial systems tested."
https://openalex.org/W2900751438,"Incremental refinements were made to a generic Nordmøre-grid to minimise bycatches of blue swimmer crabs Portunus armatus and giant cuttlefish Sepia apama, while maintaining catches of western king prawns Melicertus latisulcatus in the Spencer Gulf penaeid-trawl fishery. These refinements involved varying bar spaces, escape-exit areas and guiding-panel lengths, and were compared against a conventional trawl. Catches of teleosts and M. latisulcatus largely remained unaffected by the changes. Maximum reductions in P. armatus and S. apama bycatches (both ~90%) were achieved with a Nordmøre-grid comprising 38-mm bar spaces, 0.81- or 1.05-m2 escape exits and a 2.7-m guiding panel. Catching fewer P. armatus should reduce abrasion and crushing of M. latisulcatus in the codend and so increase the value of this targeted species. While noting some unresolved operational concerns, these results demonstrate the potential improvements in selectivity in this fishery using a Nordmøre-grid, primarily by mechanical separation."
https://openalex.org/W2900768569,"Objectives To estimate the burden of tuberculosis (TB) in reported AIDS cases, to compare the characteristics of TB/HIV subjects with those without TB and to evaluate survival with or without TB in Brazil. Methods The data source was the linked database between AIDS (2011–2014) and TB (2011–2014) databases from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). The sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory results and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) data were compared by TB occurrence or not. Survival probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and associated factors were sought using Cox regression. Results The proportion of TB diagnosed from 2011 to 2014 among AIDS cases reported between 2006 and 2014 was 6.3%. Subjects coinfected with TB were predominantly male, older, with lower schooling, with lower CD4 count, higher viral load, and higher proportion of ART initiation than those without TB. 57.5% were diagnosed with HIV before TB, 38.2% as concurrent TB/HIV and 4.3% with TB before HIV. 16,466 reported TB cases were not found in the AIDS database, although registered as HIV-infected in the SINAN TB database between 2011 and 2014. Median survival for PLHIV was 581 days, with 582 for those without TB, significantly higher than 547 for those with TB (log-rank teste, p = 0,001). In the Cox multivariate analysis, male gender [aHR = 1.27 (CI 95% 1.22–1.33)], older age [aHR = 1.020 (CI 95% 1.019–1.022)] and TB coinfection [aHR = 1.97 (CI 95% 1.88–2.07)] were positively associated with adjusted hazard of death, whereas CD4 count 200–499 cells [aHR = 0.21 (CI 95% 0.20–0.22)] and receiving ART [aHR = 0.2 2(CI 95% 0.21–0.23)] reduced the risk of death. Conclusions HIV-infected subjects should be screened for TB at care entry, to minimize diagnosis and treatment delays when active TB is present or to increase the odds of being offered latent TB infection therapy to prevent TB. On the other hand, TB cases should be promptly tested for HIV. All those will contribute to reduce mortality among people living with AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2901764698,"MiR-451a is best known for its role in erythropoiesis and for its tumour suppressor features. Here we show a role for miR-451a in neuronal differentiation through analysis of endogenous and ectopically expressed or silenced miR-451a in Ntera2/D1 cells during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we compared neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus of miR-451a-/- and wild type mice. MiR-451a overexpression in lentiviral transduced Ntera2/D1 cells was associated with a significant shifting of mRNA expression of the developmental markers Nestin, βIII Tubulin, NF200, DCX and MAP2 to earlier developmental time points, compared to control vector transduced cells. In line with this, accelerated neuronal network formation in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells, as well as an increase in neurite outgrowth both in number and length was observed. MiR-451a targets genes MIF, AKT1, CAB39, YWHAZ, RAB14, TSC1, OSR1, POU3F2, TNS4, PSMB8, CXCL16, CDKN2D and IL6R were, moreover, either constantly downregulated or exhibited shifted expression profiles in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells. Lentiviral knockdown of endogenous miR-451a expression in Ntera2/D1 cells resulted in decelerated differentiation. Endogenous miR-451a expression was upregulated during development in the hippocampus of wildtype mice. In situ hybridization revealed intensively stained single cells in the subgranular zone and the hilus of the dentate gyrus of wild type mice, while genetic ablation of miR-451a was observed to promote an imbalance between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in neurogenic brain regions, suggested by Ki67 and DCX staining. Taken together, these results provide strong support for a role of miR-451a in neuronal maturation processes in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2900788215,"Objective To evaluate the association between cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection at the time of admission and the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) and intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI) in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and to determine the association between cervical HPV infection and short-term neonatal morbidity. Methods One hundred women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM between the gestational ages of 24+0 and 36+6 weeks were included in the study. The presence of HPV DNA was evaluated in scraped cervical cells using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amniotic fluid samples were obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis. Results The rate of cervical HPV infection in women with PPROM was 24%. The rates of MIAC and IAI were not different between women with cervical HPV infection and those without cervical HPV infection [MIAC: with HPV: 21% (5/24) vs. without HPV: 22% (17/76), p = 1.00; IAI: with HPV: 21% (5/24) vs. without HPV: 18% (14/76), p = 0.77]. There were no differences in the selected aspects of short-term neonatal morbidity between women with and without cervical HPV infection. Conclusions In women with PPROM, the presence of cervical HPV infection at the time of admission is not related to a higher risk of intra-amniotic infection-related and inflammatory complications or worse short-term neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2900923368,"Previous studies have identified multiple loci for inherited susceptibility to glioma development, including the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1). However, the association between RTEL1 variants and risk of glioma has not been well understood. Therefore, we sought to comprehensively examine the genetic interaction between RTEL1 variants and risk of glioma with respect to defined histological and molecular subtypes. We employed a case-control study involving 250 adult glioma patients with previous molecular alterations and 375 population–based controls within Korean populations. Statistical analyses on the association between RTEL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and glioma risk were conducted using unconditional logistic regression. Additional conditional and stepwise analyses were performed on significant RTEL1 SNPs. We detected significant associations (Bonferroni P < .05) between six SNPs (rs6089953, rs3848669, rs6010620, rs3787089, rs6062302, and rs115303435) and risk of glioma in the Korean subjects. The two coding variants, rs6062302 (D664D) and rs115303435 (A1059T), were plausibly causal variants and were independent among the significantly associated RTEL1 variants. The glioma subgroup analyses showed that the causal variants (rs6062302 and rs115303435) may be associated with increased risk of glioma regardless of histological grades and molecular alterations. This study provides a deeper understanding of relationships between RTEL1 variants and risk of glioma. Further studies are required to ascertain the impact of those variants on glioma susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2900996126,"Estimating animal abundance is essential for research, management and conservation purposes. Although reliable methods exist to estimate absolute density for populations with individually marked animals, robust relative abundance indices (RAIs) may allow to track changes in population size when individual identification is not possible. Their performance, however, needs be thoroughly evaluated. We investigated the relative performance of several common faeces-based and camera-based RAIs for estimating small-scale variation in red fox abundance, a mesopredator of high relevance for management, in two different study areas. We compared precision, cost and performance of the methods in capturing relationships with covariates of local abundance. Random transect-based RAIs had a low mean, a comparatively high coefficient of variation and a high proportion of zeros, prohibiting or impeding analysis in relation to environmental predictors. Rectangular scat plots and transects along linear landscape features had an intermediate amount of zeros while retaining a high precision, but were less sensitive to local variation in abundance related to environmental predictors and required a large field effort. Camera trap-based RAIs yielded low to intermediate precision, but were more sensitive to small-scale variation in relative abundance than faeces-based methods. Camera traps were the most expensive methods for an initial monitoring session, but required the lowest field effort, were cheapest in the long run and were the least susceptible to observer bias and detection error under a robust sampling protocol. Generally, faeces count-based RAIs appear more suitable for studies that aim to compare local abundance between several study sites of equal landscape composition under constant detection probability. Camera traps provide more flexible data for studies that require accounting for influences of landscape composition on local abundance and are more cost-effective for long-term or continuous monitoring and more suitable to achieve high replication. Accordingly, the choice of the most suitable method and plot design is context-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2953380662,"RNA SHAPE experiments have become important and successful sources of information for RNA structure prediction. In such experiments, chemical reagents are used to probe RNA backbone flexibility at the nucleotide level, which in turn provides information on base pairing and therefore secondary structure. Little is known, however, about the statistics of such SHAPE data. In this work, we explore different representations of noise in SHAPE data and propose a statistically sound framework for extracting reliable reactivity information from multiple SHAPE replicates. Our analyses of RNA SHAPE experiments underscore that a normal noise model is not adequate to represent their data. We propose instead a log-normal representation of noise and discuss its relevance. Under this assumption, we observe that processing simulated SHAPE data by directly averaging different replicates leads to bias. Such bias can be reduced by analyzing the data following a log transformation, either by log-averaging or Kalman filtering. Application of Kalman filtering has the additional advantage that a prior on the nucleotide reactivities can be introduced. We show that the performance of Kalman filtering is then directly dependent on the quality of that prior. We conclude the paper with guidelines on signal processing of RNA SHAPE data."
https://openalex.org/W2901243938,"The liver’s regenerative capacity is unique, but too small a segment can overwhelm its ability to simultaneously regenerate and support the host, resulting in liver dysfunction and death. Here we tested a temporary Xenogeneic Heterotopic Auxiliary Liver Transplant (XHALT) from Gal-KO miniature swine in a baboon model of Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF) by 90%- hepatectomy. Immunosuppression consisted of CVF, ATG, FK 506 and steroids. 90%-hepatectomized animals died within 4–5 days with the clinical picture of PHLF, (high LFTs and bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy and coagulopathy). The 10% remnants had macroscopic and histological evidence of severe steatosis and absence of hepatocyte replication. In contrast, the addition of XHALT prolonged survival up to 11 days, with the cause of death being sepsis, rather than liver failure. The remnant liver appeared grossly normal, and on histology, there was no evidence of fatty infiltration, but there was pronounced Ki-67 staining. In conclusion, temporary auxiliary xenografts have the potential to support a small for size liver graft while it grows to adequate size or provide an opportunity for organ recovery in acute liver failure."
https://openalex.org/W2901322987,"Though lubricant emulsions have been widely used in many industrial processes, various human health hazards have been reported. Conducting a systematic toxicity study on emulsions is difficult since emulsions contain multiple chemical compounds, and hydrophobic compounds form complex emulsion particles via surfactants. For a quantitative toxicity study, we developed a high-throughput imaging system using zebrafish and conducted a large scale in vivo toxicity assay of lubricant emulsion and their common ingredients. By computing the locomotion activity of zebrafish from captured time-lapse images, we could quantify the degree of relative toxicity of 29 chemicals. The changes in the locomotion activity over time were observed to vary significantly depending on emulsions, indicating that the degree of toxicity of the commercial products was very diverse. We found that primary ethanolamines were more toxic than secondary or tertiary ethanolamines, and several factors, such as alkyl chain length, EO mole, test concentration, and emulsion particle size, affected toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2901347887,"Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and a prototype of the glycoprotein hormone receptors subfamily of GPCRs. Structural data of the FSHR ectodomain in complex with follicle-stimulating hormone suggests a “pull and lift” activation mechanism that triggers a conformational change on the seven α-helix transmembrane domain (TMD). To analyze the conformational changes of the FSHR TMD resulting from sequence variants associated with reproductive impairment in humans, we set up a computational approach combining helix modeling and molecular simulation methods to generate conformational ensembles of the receptor at room (300 K) and physiological (310 K) temperatures. We examined the receptor dynamics in an explicit membrane environment of polyunsaturated phospholipids and solvent water molecules. The analysis of the conformational dynamics of the functional (N680 and S680) and dysfunctional (mutations at D408) variants of the FSHR allowed us to validate the FSHR-TMD model. Functional variants display a concerted motion of flexible intracellular regions at TMD helices 5 and 6. Disruption of side chain interactions and conformational dynamics were detected upon mutation at D408 when replaced with alanine, arginine, or tyrosine. Dynamical network analysis confirmed that TMD helices 2 and 5 may share communication pathways in the functional FSHR variants, whereas no connectivity was detected in the dysfunctional mutants, indicating that the global dynamics of the FSHR was sensitive to mutations at amino acid residue 408, a key position apparently linked to misfolding and variable cell surface plasma membrane expression of FSHRs with distinct mutations at this position."
https://openalex.org/W2901696064,"Do professional musicians learn a fine sequential hand motor skill more efficiently than non-musicians? Is this also the case when they perform motor imagery, which implies that they only mentally simulate these movements? Musicians and non-musicians performed a Go/NoGo discrete sequence production (DSP) task, which allows to separate sequence-specific from a-specific learning effects. In this task five stimuli, to be memorized during a preparation interval, signaled a response sequence. In a practice phase, different response sequences had to be either executed, imagined, or inhibited, which was indicated by different response cues. In a test phase, responses were required to familiar (previously executed, imagined, or inhibited) and unfamiliar sequences. In both phases, response times and response accuracy were measured while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was only registered during the practice phase to compare activity between motor imagery, motor execution, and motor inhibition for both groups. Results in the practice phase revealed that musicians learned the response sequences faster and more accurately than non-musicians although no difference in initiation time was found. EEG analyses revealed similar lateralized activity during learning a motor skill for both groups. Our results from the test phase showed better sequence-a-specific learning effects (i.e., faster response times and increased accuracy) for musicians than for non-musicians. Moreover, we revealed that non-musicians benefit more from physical execution while learning a required motor sequence, whereas sequence-specific learning effects due to learning with motor imagery were very similar for musicians and non-musicians."

Our previous case report suggested that a new transnasal ileus tube insertion method, the anterior balloon method (ABM), could achieve decompression for adhesive SBO.The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new method for inserting transnasal ileus tubes in patients with SBO.Altogether, 134 patients with small bowel obstruction treated from January 2011 to December 2017 were reviewed. The patients were categorized into two groups: those with the new method that inserts an anterior balloon (ABM group: 52 patients, 2014-2017) versus those with the ordinary insertion method (OIM group: 82 patients, 2011-2014).The patients' characteristics and symptoms on admission were similar in the ABM and OIM groups. Adhesions were the main cause of ileus in the two groups. The insertion time duration was significantly shorter in the ABM group than in OIM group (28.4 ± 9.1 vs. 33.5 ± 13.0 min; p = 0.01). The ABM group also had significantly longer tubes than OIM group (222.4 ± 32.2 vs. 157.4 ± 31.7 cm; p < 0.001), which resulted in a significantly shorter time until clinical symptoms were relieved in ABM group. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups.The ABM group had shorter insertion duration and longer tubes than those of OIM group. The ABM might become a preferred therapeutic choice to achieve decompression in patients with SBO."
https://openalex.org/W2900577994,"The Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP), a polycationic, amphiphilic and helical neuropeptide, is well known for its neuroprotective actions and cell penetrating properties. In the present study, we evaluated the potent antibacterial property of PACAP38 and related analogs against various bacterial strains. Interestingly, PACAP38 and related analogs can inhibit the growth of various bacteria including Escherichia coli (JM109), Bacillus subtilis (PY79), and the pathogenic Burkholderia cenocepacia (J2315). Investigation of the mechanism of action suggested that a PACAP metabolite, identified as PACAP(9–38), might indeed be responsible for the observed PACAP38 antibacterial action. Surprisingly, PACAP(9–38), which does not induce haemolysis, exhibits an increased specificity toward Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 compared to other tested bacteria. Finally, the predisposition of PACAP(9–38) to adopt a π-helix conformation rather than an α-helical conformation like PACAP38 could explain this gain in specificity. Overall, this study has revealed a new function for PACAP38 and related derivatives that can be added to its pleiotropic biological activities. This innovative study could therefore pave the way toward the development of new therapeutic agents against multiresistant bacteria, and more specifically the Burkholderia cenocepacia complex."
https://openalex.org/W2900914430,"Visual masking occurs when the perception of a brief target stimulus is affected by a preceding or succeeding mask. The uncoupling of the target and its perception allows an opportunity to investigate the neuronal mechanisms involved in sensory representation and visual perception. To determine whether rats are a suitable model for subsequent studies of the neuronal basis of visual masking, we first demonstrated that decoding of neuronal responses recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anaesthetized rats predicted that orientation discrimination performance should decline when masking stimuli are presented immediately before or after oriented target stimuli. We then trained Long-Evans rats (n = 7) to discriminate between horizontal and vertical target Gabors or gratings. In some trials, a plaid mask was presented at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) relative to the target. Spatially, the masks were presented either overlapping or surrounding the target location. In the absence of a mask, all animals could reliably discriminate orientation when stimulus durations were 16 ms or longer. In the presence of a mask, discrimination performance was impaired, but did not systematically vary with SOA as is typical of visual masking. In humans performing a similar task, we found visual masking impaired perception of the target at short SOAs regardless of the spatial or temporal configuration of stimuli. Our findings indicate that visual masking may be difficult to observe in rats as the stimulus parameters necessary to quantify masking will make the task so difficult that it prevents robust measurement of psychophysical performance. Thus, our results suggest that rats may not be an ideal model to investigate the effects of visual masking on perception."
https://openalex.org/W2901626990,"In this paper, the accelerated failure time (AFT) model is modified to analyze post-work grocery shopping activity duration. Much previous shopping duration analysis was conducted using the proportional hazard (PH) modeling approach. Once the proportionality assumption was violated, the traditional accelerated failure time (TAFT) model was usually selected as an alternative modeling approach. However, a TAFT model only has covariates with non-proportional and time-dependent effects on the hazard overtime while a PH model only accommodates covariates with proportional and time-independent effects. Neither of them considers the possibility that some of covariates may have proportional and time-independent effects and some may have non-proportional and time-dependent effects on the hazard value in one model. To address this issue, the paper generalizes the TAFT model and develops a modified accelerated failure time (MAFT) model to accommodate both time-dependent and time-independent covariates for activity duration analysis. Checking on the proportionality assumption indicates that the assumption is not valid in the post-work grocery shopping activity data extracted from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT). Both TAFT and MAFT models are developed for comparisons and analysis. The empirical and statistical results show that there do exist two different types of covariates affecting shopping activity duration, including covariates only with proportional and time-independent effects (i.e. working duration, commute travel time) and those with non-proportional and time-dependent effects. The MAFT model can capture the subtleties in various types of covariate effects and help better understand how those covariates affect activity duration overtime. This paper also shows the importance to develop a flexible duration model with both time-dependent and time-independent covariates for accurately evaluating travel demand management (TDM) policies, like flexible work hours."
https://openalex.org/W2899463965,"PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) important for cellular function and mutations in them lead to human disorders. We examined how functional heteromers form between subunits of PIEZO1 using the mutants E2117K, E2117D, and E2117A. Homomers of E2117K do not conduct. E2117A homomers have low conductance with rapid inactivation, and those of E2117D have high conductance with slow inactivation. Pairing E2117K with E2117D or E2117A with E2117D gave rise to new channel species representing heteromers with distinct conductances. Whole-cell currents from co-expression of E2117A and E2117D fit well with a linear-combination model of homomeric channel currents suggesting that functional channels do not form from freely-diffusing, randomly-mixed monomers in-vitro. Whole-cell current from coexpressed PIEZO1/PIEZO2 also fit as a linear combination of homomer currents. High-resolution optical images of fluorescently-tagged channels support this interpretation because coexpressed subunits segregate into discrete domains."
https://openalex.org/W2901341468,"Scientific evidence on the long-term impact of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on offspring's myocardial relaxation is scarce. Studies have linked GDM with transient ventricular hypertrophy in newborns resulting in diastolic dysfunction, but long-term assessment is lacking. The main objective of this study was to evaluate myocardial relaxation in 3-year-old children in relation to the degree of insulin resistance of their mother during pregnancy.We prospectively assessed myocardial relaxation by echocardiography imaging on 106 children at 3 years of age. Subjects were divided into 3 groups [GDM, insulin resistance (IR) and normoglycemic (CTRL)], based on their mother's 75g-OGTT and HOMA-IR results at second trimester screening. We collected information on children adiposity and body size, maternal characteristics and maternal and cord blood measurement of C-peptide and insulin.The study population comprised 29 children from GDM mothers, 36 children from IR mothers and 41 CTRL children. Compared to the CTRL group, we found that a higher proportion of children in the IR group and the GDM group met the criteria for impaired myocardial relaxation, but this did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio adjusted for heart rate and body surface area of 1.4 [0.2-9.5] and 3.5 [0.6-20.6], respectively).We did not detect an increased risk of impaired myocardial relaxation at three years of age in children exposed in-utero to IR and GDM, compared to children from normoglycemic mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2886183287,"Examples of tool-use behaviors by birds outside foraging contexts are scarce and limited to a handful of species. We report a field experiment aimed to test whether an observed suite of odd behaviors by European Honey-buzzards (Pernis apivorus) represents use of green twigs cut from trees and woody shrubs as a tool to attract ants for anting. Specifically, we tested whether buzzards are selective in their choice of twigs, under the assumption that birds would prefer easy-to-collect twigs from plants that effectively attract ants. Experimental results lend support to our hypothesis that European Honey-buzzards cut green twigs of Montpellier maple trees (Acer monspessulanum) and, to a lesser extent, of Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica) for their immediate use as ant attractors. Fresh twigs of both tree species attracted large numbers of ants, suggesting that their preferential use in the reported behavior of Honey-buzzards is not a random selection of the available plant material. Maple twigs, however, were the easiest to break and oak twigs the hardest compared to other plants in the community. This suggests that the relative ease of cracking of maple twigs may account for the preference Honey-buzzards have for this plant species as compared with Pyrenean oak, whose twigs demand considerable more effort from the birds to break. Our results lend support to the inclusion of the reported behavioral sequence by this raptor species as a potential example of tool use in birds outside the usual foraging context."
https://openalex.org/W2901019225,"To develop a method to quantify, based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT), the 3D structure of the laminar pores in patients with glaucoma.This retrospective study examined 160 laminar pores from 8 eyes of 8 cases: 4 normal subjects and 4 open-angle glaucoma (OAG) patients. We reconstructed 3D volume data for a 3 x 3 mm disc, using a method similar to OCT angiography, and segmented the structure of the lamina cribrosa. Then, we manually segmented each laminar pore in sequential C-scan images (>90 slices at 2.6-micron intervals) with VCAT5 (RIKEN, Japan). We compared the control and OAG subjects with the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.We found that the laminar pores of the OAG patients had a significantly smaller average cross-sectional area, smaller 3D volume (adjusted to the average thickness of the lamina cribrosa), and higher true sphericity, and lower principal value (P1, 2, 3) of the 3D structure data (all: p < 0.0001). The topographic distribution of damaged laminar pores was consistent with the damaged area of the macular map.We successfully developed a method to quantify the 3D structure of the laminar pores; providing a useful tool to assess lamina cribrosa-associated risk factors for glaucoma. These findings promise to benefit future investigations into the pathomechanisms of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2900777399,"The paper explores the benefits of global financial reporting models for developing countries, discussing the case of Romania, which, at the recommendations of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, exceeded the minimum requirements of the European Union, by imposing the full adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in individual financial statements of listed companies. Using regression analysis and decomposition techniques, the paper explores the evolution in value relevance of financial variables based on pre-(2009-2012) and post-(2014-2016) adoption samples, showing that after IFRS adoption financial information becomes significantly more relevant for equity valuations. We also provide empirical evidence showing that the degree of relevance for stock valuation, as well as the IFRS impact varies across types of firms. Overall, our findings tend to indicate the success of the financial reporting reform, which could be relevant for other jurisdictions facing similar decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2901002345,"In view of the fact that the current online virtual network embedding algorithms do not consider the fragment resources generated in the embedding process deeply enough, resulting in the problem that the acceptance ratio and the revenue to cost ratio are both low, a mathematical model for virtual network reconfiguration is constructed and a heuristic algorithm for fragment-aware virtual network reconfiguration (FA-VNR) is proposed. The FA-VNR algorithm selects the set of virtual nodes to be migrated according to the fragment degrees of the physical nodes, and selects the best virtual node migration scheme according to the reduction of the fragment degrees of the physical nodes as well as the reduction of the embedding cost of the embedded virtual networks. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed FA-VNR algorithm not only can obviously improve the acceptance ratio and the revenue to cost ratio of the current online virtual network embedding algorithm, but also has better optimization effect than the existing virtual network reconfiguration algorithm."
