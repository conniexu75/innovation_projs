https://openalex.org/W2067708969,"The 70-kilodalton family of heat shock proteins (Hsp 70) has been implicated in posttranslational protein assembly and translocation. Binding of cytosolic forms of Hsp 70 (Hsp 72,73) with nascent proteins in the normal cell was investigated and found to be transient and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent. Interaction of Hsp 72,73 with newly synthesized proteins appeared to occur cotranslationally, because nascent polypeptides released prematurely from polysomes in vivo can be isolated in a complex with Hsp 72,73. Moreover, isolation of polysomes from short-term [35S]Met-labeled cells (pulsed) revealed that Hsp 72,73 associated with nascent polypeptide chains. In cells experiencing stress, newly synthesized proteins coimmunoprecipitated with Hsp 72,73; however, in contrast to normal cells, interaction with Hsp 72,73 was not transient. A model consistent with these data suggests that under normal growth conditions, cytosolic Hsp 72,73 interact transiently with nascent polypeptides to facilitate proper folding, and that metabolic stress interferes with these events."

https://openalex.org/W2032625890,"A heat shock protein gene, HSP104, was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a deletion mutation was introduced into yeast cells. Mutant cells grew at the same rate as wild-type cells and died at the same rate when exposed directly to high temperatures. However, when given a mild pre-heat treatment, the mutant cells did not acquire tolerance to heat, as did wild-type cells. Transformation with the wild-type gene rescued the defect of mutant cells. The results demonstrate that a particular heat shock protein plays a critical role in cell survival at extreme temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2065634301,"The nuclear lamina is an intermediate filament-type network underlying the inner nuclear membrane. Phosphorylation of lamin proteins is believed to cause lamina disassembly during meiotic and mitotic M phase, but the M phase-specific lamin kinase has not been identified. Here we show that the cdc2 kinase, a major element implicated in controlling the eukaryotic cell cycle, phosphorylates chicken B-type lamins in vitro on sites that are specifically phosphorylated during M phase in vivo. Concomitantly, cdc2 kinase is capable of inducing lamina depolymerization upon incubation with isolated nuclei. One of the target sites of cdc2 kinase is identified as a motif (SPTR) conserved in the N-terminal domain of all lamin proteins. These results lead us to propose that mitotic disassembly of the nuclear lamina results from direct phosphorylation of lamins by cdc2 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2133993902,"The RAD50 gene of S. cerevisiae is required during meiosis for both recombination and chromosome synapsis and is also required for repair of double strand breaks during vegetative growth. We present below the isolation and analysis of several types of rad50 mutants. We show that null mutations block both meiotic recombination and formation of synaptonemal complex (SC) at early stages, while nonnull mutations block both processes at intermediate stages. These observations suggest that recombination and SC formation involve a series of intimately related events. Furthermore, all rad50 mutants block formation of tripartite SC structure but permit other aspects of SC development, i.e., formation of axial cores. In light of this and other observations, the meiotic and mitotic defects of rad50 mutants can be accounted for economically by the proposal that meiotic recombination, meiotic chromosome pairing, and vegetative DNA repair all use a common chromosomal homology search that involves RAD50 function."
https://openalex.org/W2044267903,"The mechanism by which MPF induces nuclear lamin disassembly and nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis was studied in a frog egg extract in which the transition from interphase to mitosis can be induced by the addition of MPF. Bacterially expressed human nuclear lamin C, assembled in vitro into filaments, showed increased phosphorylation on specific sites in the extract in response to MPF. Phosphorylation was accompanied by disassembly of the lamin filaments. We determined the sequences of the sites phosphorylated both in the presence and absence of MPF. The sequence data suggest that multiple protein kinases act on the lamins, and S6 kinase II was identified as one potentially important lamin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1518225155,"The intracellular site of sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis was examined in subcellular fractions from rat liver using a radioactive ceramide analog N-([1-14C]hexanoyl)-D-erythro-sphingosine. This lipid readily transferred from a complex with bovine serum albumin to liver fractions without disrupting the membranes, and was metabolized to radioactive SM. To prevent degradation of the newly synthesized SM to ceramide, all experiments were performed in the presence of EDTA to minimize neutral sphingomyelinase activity and at neutral pH to minimize acid sphingomyelinase activity. An intact Golgi apparatus fraction gave an 85-98-fold enrichment of SM synthesis and a 58-83-fold enrichment of galactosyltransferase activity. Controlled trypsin digestion demonstrated that SM synthesis was localized to the lumen of intact Golgi apparatus vesicles. Although small amounts of SM synthesis were detected in plasma membrane and rough microsome fractions, after accounting for contamination by Golgi apparatus membranes, their combined activity contributed less than 13% of the total SM synthesis in rat liver. Subfractions of the Golgi apparatus were obtained and characterized by immunoblotting and biochemical assays using cis/medial (mannosidase II) and trans (sialyltransferase and galactosyltransferase) Golgi apparatus markers. The specific activity of SM synthesis was highest in enriched cis and medial fractions but far lower in a trans fraction. We conclude that SM synthesis in rat liver occurs predominantly in the cis and medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and not at the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum as has been previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1508909871,"In order to clarify the cellular mechanisms of denervation atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have studied protein turnover in denervated and control rat soleus muscles in vitro under different conditions. By 24 h after cutting the sciatic nerve, overall protein breakdown was greater in the denervated soleus than in the contralateral control muscle, and by 3 days, net proteolysis had increased about 3-fold. Since protein synthesis increased slightly following denervation, the rise in proteolysis must be responsible for the muscle atrophy and the differential loss of contractile proteins. Like overall proteolysis, the breakdown of actin (as shown by 3-methyl-histidine production by the muscles) increased each day after denervation and by 3 days was 2.5 times faster than in controls. Treatments that block the lysosomal and Ca2(+)-dependent proteolytic systems did not reduce the increase in overall protein degradation and actin breakdown in the denervated muscles (maintained in complete medium at resting length). However, the content of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, increased about 2-fold by 3 days after denervation. Furthermore, conditions that activate intralysosomal proteolysis (incubation without insulin or amino acids) stimulated proteolysis 2-3-fold more in the denervated muscles than in controls. Also, incubation conditions that activate the Ca2(+)-dependent pathway (incubation with Ca2+ ionophores or allowing muscles to shorten) were 2-3 times more effective in enhancing overall proteolysis in the denervated muscle. None of these treatments affected 3-methylhistidine production. Thus, multiple proteolytic systems increase in parallel in the denervated muscle, but a nonlysosomal process (independent of Ca2+) appears mainly responsible for the rapid loss of cell proteins, especially of myofibrillar components."
https://openalex.org/W2168412354,"Initiation of tumorigenesis in mouse skin can be accomplished by mutagenesis of the H-ras gene by treatment with chemical carcinogens. A mouse model system has been developed to study the additional genetic events that take place during tumor progression. Skin carcinomas were induced in F1 hybrid mice exhibiting restriction fragment length polymorphisms at multiple chromosomal loci. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity in such tumors showed that imbalance of alleles on mouse chromosome 7, on which the H-ras gene is located, occurs very frequently in skin carcinomas. The chromosomal alterations detected, which included both nondisjunction and mitotic recombination events, were only seen in tumors that have activated ras genes. We conclude that gross chromosomal alterations that elevate the copy number of mutant H-ras and/or lead to loss of normal H-ras are a consistent feature of mouse skin tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W1991131571,"The identification of ras oncogenes in human and animal cancers including precancerous lesions indicates that these genes participate in the early stages of neoplastic development. Yet, these observations do not define the timing of ras oncogene activation in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. To ascertain the timing of ras oncogene activation, an animal model system was devised that involves the induction of mammary carcinomas in rats exposed at birth to the carcinogen nitrosomethylurea. High-resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified ras sequences revealed the presence of both H-ras and K-ras oncogenes in normal mammary glands 2 weeks after carcinogen treatment and at least 2 months before the onset of neoplasia. These ras oncogenes can remain latent within the mammary gland until exposure to estrogens, demonstrating that activation of ras oncogenes can precede the onset of neoplasia and suggesting that normal physiological proliferative processes such as estrogen-induced mammary gland development may lead to neoplasia if the targeted cells harbor latent ras oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W1999606080,"After systemic administration to immature rodents, L-cysteine destroys neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum, but the underlying mechanism has never been clarified. This neurotoxicity of L-cysteine, in vitro or in vivo, has now been shown to be mediated primarily through the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (with quisqualate receptor participation at higher concentrations). In addition, the excitotoxic potency of L-cysteine was substantially increased in the presence of physiological concentrations of bicarbonate ion. L-Cysteine is naturally present in the human brain and in the environment, and is much more powerful than beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a bicarbonate-dependent excitotoxin, which has been implicated in an adult neurodegenerative disorder endemic to Guam. Thus, the potential involvement of this common sulfur-containing amino acid in neurodegenerative processes affecting the central nervous system warrants consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1588762192,"Insulin inhibition of apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was investigated in pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine as label. Radioactivity incorporation into apoBH and apoBL, the higher and lower molecular weight forms, was assessed after immunoprecipitation of detergent-solubilized cells and media and separation of the apoB forms using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hepatocyte monolayers were incubated for 12-14 h in medium with and without an inhibitory concentration of insulin. Cells were then incubated for 10 min with label, and, after differing periods of chase with unlabeled methionine, cellular medium and media labeled apoB were analyzed; greater than 90% of labeled apoB was present in cells at 10 and 20 min after pulse, and labeled apoB did not appear in the medium until 40 min of chase. Insulin treatment inhibited the incorporation of label into total apoB by 48%, into apoBH by 62%, and into apoBL by 40% relative to other cellular proteins. Insulin treatment favored the more rapid disappearance of labeled cellular apoBH with an intra-cellular retention half-time of 50 min (initial half-life of decay, t1/2 = 25 min) compared with 85 min in control (t1/2 = 60 min). Intracellular retention half-times of labeled apoBL were similar in control and insulin-treated hepatocytes and ranged from 80 to 100 min. After 180 min of chase, 44% of labeled apoBL in control and 32% in insulin-treated hepatocytes remained cell associated. Recovery studies indicated that insulin stimulated the degradation of 45 and 27% of newly synthesized apoBH and apoBL, respectively. When hepatocyte monolayers were continuously labeled with [35S]methionine and then incubated in chase medium with and without insulin, labeled apoBH was secreted rapidly, reaching a plateau by 1 h of chase, whereas labeled apoBL was secreted linearly over 3-5 h of chase. Insulin inhibited the secretion of immunoassayable apoB but not labeled apoB. Results demonstrate that 1) insulin inhibits synthesis of apoB from [35S]methionine, 2) insulin stimulates degradation of freshly translated apoB favoring apoBH over apoBL, and 3) an intracellular pool of apoB, primarily apoBL, exists that is largely unaffected by insulin. Overall, insulin action in primary hepatocyte cultures reduces the secretion of freshly synthesized apoB and favors secretion of preformed apoB enriched in apoBL."
https://openalex.org/W1965929121,"The rate of excision repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers (PDs) was measured at specific sites in each strand of a yeast minichromosome containing an active gene (URA3), a replication origin (ARS1), and positioned nucleosomes. All six PD sites analyzed in the transcribed URA3 strand were repaired more rapidly (>5-fold on average) than any of the nine PD sites analyzed in the nontranscribed strand. Efficient repair also occurred in both strands of a disrupted TRP1 gene (ten PD sites), containing four unstable nucleosomes, and in a nucleosome gap at the 5′ end of URA3 (two PD sites). Conversely, slow repair occurred in both strands immediately downstream of the URA3 gene (12 of 14 PD sites). This region contains the ARS1 consensus sequence, a nucleosome gap, and two stable nucleosomes. Thus, modulation of DNA repair occurs in a simple yeast minichromosome and correlates with gene expression, nucleosome stability, and (possibly) control of replication."
https://openalex.org/W1568518323,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the few physiological inducers of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF kappa B. NF kappa B may play a central role in mediating TNF's gene regulatory action; however, the molecular mechanisms of TNF-induced NF kappa B activation are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate with two human leukemic cell lines, K562 and Jurkat, that TNF induces rapid and transient activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PK-C) from the cytosol to the membranes, which is followed by the emergence of kappa B-binding activity. In order to investigate whether TNF-mediated PK-C activation can be linked to induction of NF kappa B, we tried to block TNF action by use of various protein kinase C inhibitors as well as down-regulation of PK-C. Preincubation of Jurkat cells with protein kinase inhibitor H7 or staurosporine blocked PK-C activation by either TNF or phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). This pretreatment regimen completely inhibited NF kappa B activation by PMA. In contrast, TNF's ability to induce NF kappa B remained unaffected. In addition, NF kappa B was TNF-inducible in Jurkat cells depleted for PK-C by long-term exposure to high dose phorbol ester. The data indicate that PK-C is not required for NF kappa B activation by TNF and imply a novel, PK-C-independent mechanism of physiological NF kappa B activation."

Substitution of the Leu residue in P1 with norleucine, Met, Phe, or Tyr had minimal effects on the kinetic parameters (kappa cat and kappa cat/Km) determined at different pH values, whereas peptides containing Ile or Val in P1 were hydrolyzed extremely slowly. The spectrophotometric assay has been used to characterize the proteinase further with respect to pH dependence, ionic strength dependence, and the effect of competitive inhibitors of various types."
https://openalex.org/W1529716765,"Blot hybridization of RNA isolated from rat brain revealed the presence of two HO-2 homologous transcripts (1.3 and 1.9 kilobases (kb] at all stages of development ranging from 1 day before birth to adulthood. The level of both HO-2 messages appeared to be developmentally regulated and a gradual increase was observed from prenatal day 1 to adulthood. The two transcripts were highly homologous as assayed through hybridization studies using probes derived from the 5' end, middle, and 3' end of a cloned rat testis HO-2 cDNA. The 1.3-kb mRNA was essentially identical in size to the testis HO-2 cDNA. The message was efficiently translated in the brain, and is believed to encode the HO-2 protein. It seems unlikely that the 1.9-kb species represents a precursor of the 1.3-kb mRNA, as it was also translated in vivo, although less efficiently than the smaller mRNA species. Neither of the two HO-2 mRNA species were induced by bacterial endotoxin. Unlike HO-2, only one HO-1 transcript of approximately 1.8 kb could be detected. This transcript was of very low abundance and was not developmentally regulated, but could be increased by bacterial endotoxin. The product of this induced message, however, was not detectable by Western immunoblot analysis using antibody raised against liver HO-1. An immunoprecipitate could be detected in brain microsomes by radioimmunoassay using the same antibody. This protein, however, exhibited antigenic properties different from that of the purified liver HO-1 or that of spleen microsomal HO-1. Brain heme oxygenase activity correlated well with the amount of immunoreactive HO-2 protein and both reflect the abundance of the 1.3-kb mRNA message over the course of development."
https://openalex.org/W1480830771,"Tissue-specific expression of the human insulin gene is regulated by cis-acting DNA elements 5' to the transcription start site. Deletion of the 5' region of the human insulin gene between nucleotides -279 and -258 caused a 25-fold rise in transcriptional activity whereas further deletion to nucleotide -229 reduced transcription activity 25-fold. In vitro analysis of protein binding in the 5' regulatory region revealed: (i) the major positive regulatory region (-258 to -229) contains a protein-binding site (GC-II) with 75% sequence identity to a motif in the rat insulin I gene, shown to be a powerful transcriptional activator. GC-II motif-binding factors are not restricted to insulin-producing cell lines. (ii) An islet cell-specific factor binds between nucleotides -217 to -210 (CT-II motif). (iii) A region between nucleotides -153 and -127, containing two identical motifs, GG-I and GG-II was also revealed. GG-I-binding factors are ubiquitous, whereas binding to the GG-II motif is beta cell-specific. (iv) A ubiquitous factor binds to a motif between nucleotides -179 and -183, identical to a half-site for the cyclic nucleotide regulatory element. (v) The negative regulatory element between -279 and -258 contains overlapping binding sites for at least 3 protein factors, with differing cell-specific distributions and can independently down-regulate thymidine kinase promoter activity in a beta cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1976534033,"Most proteins destined for export from Escherichia coli are made as precursors containing amino-terminal leader sequences that are essential for export and that are removed during the process. The initial step in export of a subset of proteins, which includes maltose-binding protein, is binding of the precursor by the molecular chaperone SecB. This work shows directly that SecB binds with high affinity to unfolded maltose-binding protein but does not specifically recognize and bind the leader. Rather, the leader modulates folding to expose elements in the remainder of the polypeptide that are recognized by SecB."
https://openalex.org/W2090286898,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the product of the CDC25 gene controls the RAS-mediated production of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). In vivo the carboxyl-terminal third of the CDC25 gene product is sufficient for the activation of adenylate cyclase. The 3'-terminal part of SCD25, a gene of S. cerevisiae structurally related to CDC25, can suppress the requirement for CDC25. Partially purified preparations of the carboxy-terminal domain of the SCD25 gene product enhanced the exchange rate of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) of pure RAS2 protein by stimulating the release of GDP. This protein fragment had a similar effect on the human c-H-ras-encoded p21 protein. Thus, the SCD25 carboxyl-terminal domain can enhance the regeneration of the active form of RAS proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2036479824,"The Drosophila abelson (abl) gene encodes the homolog of the mammalian c-abl cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and is an essential gene for the development of viable adult flies. Three second-site mutations that suppress the lethality caused by the absence of abl function have been isolated, and all three map to the gene enabled (ena). The mutations are recessive embryonic lethal mutations but act as dominant mutations to compensate for the neural defects of abl mutants. Thus, mutations in a specific gene can compensate for the absence of a tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1565707529,"Monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 (MDNCF/IL-8) is an 8,000-dalton protein produced by monocytes which exhibits activity as a chemoattractant for neutrophils with maximal activity achieved at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. This polypeptide has been iodinated by chloramine-T methodology (350 Ci/mM), and specific receptors for MDNCF/IL-8 have been detected on human neutrophils, U937 cells, THP-1 cells, and dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 cells. The binding of MDNCF/IL-8 to human neutrophils is not inhibited by interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, insulin, or epidermal growth factor. In addition, chemoattractants such as C5a, fMet-Leu-Phe, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor fail to inhibit binding, suggesting that MDNCF/IL-8 utilizes a unique receptor. The receptor for MDNCF/IL-8 is apparently glycosylated since ligand binding is inhibited by the presence of wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin with a binding specificity for N-acetylglucosamine and neuraminic acid. Steady state binding experiments indicate Kd values of 4 and 0.5 nM and receptor numbers of 75,000 and 7,400 for human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells, respectively. 125I-MDNCF/IL-8 bound to human neutrophils is rapidly internalized and subsequently released from cells as trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Affinity labeling experiments suggest that the human neutrophil MDNCF/IL-8 receptor exhibits a mass of approximately 58,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1528542216,"Undulin, a novel noncollagenous extracellular matrix protein, was isolated from skin and placenta. In polyacrylamide gels most of the unreduced protein migrates with Mr above 1,000,000 yielding bands A (Mr 270,000), B1 (Mr 190,000), and B2 (Mr 180,000) after reduction. Undulin is biochemically and immunochemically distinct from other previously characterized large matrix glycoproteins. Immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies suggests that bands A and B are closely related. Electron microscopy reveals undulin as structures consisting of an approximately 80-nm-long-tail with a nodule on one end and with one or two shorter arms on the other. Ultrastructurally immunolabeled undulin is found mainly between densely packed mature collagen fibrils. Indirect immunofluorescence shows bundles of uniform wavy fibers in dense connective tissues superimposable on a subpopulation of type I collagen structures. This suggests that undulin serves a specific yet unknown function in the supramolecular organization of collagen fibrils in soft tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2034882151,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β cells of the pancreatic islets. The target antigen(s) involved in this immunopathological process has not been identified. Our strategy was to determine whether expression of a novel surface antigen by murine pancreatic β cells would result in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have generated lines of transgenic mice (RIP-HA) that express the hemagglutinin of the A/Japan/305/57 strain of influenza virus on their insulin-producing β cells. Hyperglycemia developed in mice derived from all three founders at a frequency varying from 13% to 27%, and was associated with lymphocytic infiltration of the islets and a humoral response against β cell antigens, including hemagglutinin. These results suggest that the RIP-HA mice should provide a useful system in which to study the cellular interactions involved in the induction of self-tolerance and autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1588995881,"In addition to ganglioside GM1b, an unusual and extremely minor ganglioside, GD1 alpha, was efficiently isolated from bovine brain by combination of Q-Sepharose and Iatrobeads column chromatographies. In the course of purification steps, the presence of the sialidase-labile ganglioside was proved by a highly sensitive TLC/enzyme-immunostaining method. The structure was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography, permethylation study, sialidase degradation, immunostaining with specific antibodies, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and proton magnetic resonance spectrometry. The content of the ganglioside was very small (0.016%) in the total gangliosides. This finding suggests that a synthetic pathway of asialo GM1----GM1b----GD1 alpha may exist in mammalian brains. A monoclonal antibody NA-6 that was obtained by immunizing mice with purified GM1b reacted specifically with GM1b but showed no cross-reactivity with other structurally related gangliosides such as GM1a, GD1a, and so on. Using the method of TLC/immunostaining with NA-6, GM1b was found to be strongly expressed during embryonic days 14-17 in chick brains. Thus, it is assumed that extremely minor gangliosides like GM1b and GD1 alpha found in adult brains are characterized as embryonic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1502961271,"Studies on BC3H-1 myocytes suggest that the insulin-induced increase in cellular diacylglycerol level mediates the insulin-stimulated glucose transport in these cells (Standaert, M. L., Farese, R. V., Cooper, D. R., and Pollet, R. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8696-8705). The present study tested whether diacylglycerol could mediate the insulin-induced and exercise-induced increases in glucose uptake by rat skeletal muscle in vivo. Glucose uptake by calf muscles of the rat was assessed by measuring cellular 2-deoxyglucose uptake in vivo. Diacylglycerol and ceramides in muscles frozen in situ were assayed with diacylglycerol kinase. Intravenous injection of 0.1 unit of insulin/rat resulted in a 6-fold increase in muscle 2-deoxyglucose uptake during the subsequent 25-min period. In contrast, no statistically significant changes in muscle diacylglycerol or ceramide levels were observed at 2, 5, 10, and 25 min after insulin injection. When calf muscles of the hindlimb were exercised in vivo for 25 min by electrical stimulation inducing one contraction/s, 2-deoxyglucose uptake by muscles was increased 15-fold. However, no statistically significant changes in muscle diacylglycerol or ceramide content were observed at 5, 10, 15, and 25 min of exercise. Although the findings do not exclude the possibility of a compartmentalized increase in diacylglycerol level, the present data suggest that diacylglycerol is not a mediator of the insulin-induced or exercise-induced augmentation of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in vivo. Since interruption of nerve supply to the muscles makes the muscles insulin resistant (Turinsky, J., (1987) Am. J. Physiol. 252, R531-R537), the effect of denervation on diacylglycerol and ceramide levels in calf muscles of the rat was also examined. The denervation resulted in 21, 51, and 117% increases in muscle diacylglycerol levels at 3, 16, and 32 days after denervation, respectively. No statistically significant changes in muscle ceramide levels were observed at any postdenervation interval. Finally, the measured lipids were studied in muscles and livers of rats infused with supraphysiological doses of vasopressin (86 pmol/min). In controls, diacylglycerol concentrations of the muscles and liver did not significantly differ, but the liver exhibited a 5-fold higher level of ceramides than the muscles. Infusion of vasopressin for 5 min did not have a statistically significant effect on diacylglycerol concentration of the liver but continuation of the same infusion for 10 min resulted in a 63% increase in liver diacylglycerol. The 10-min infusion had no effect on muscle diacylglycerol concentration or ceramide levels in any of the tissues studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1574037572,"The catalytic functions of the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of the large subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli have been identified using site-directed mutagenesis. Glycine residues at positions 176, 180, and 722 within the putative mononucleotide-binding site were replaced with isoleucine residues. Each of these mutations resulted in at least a 1 order of magnitude reduction in the Vmax for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The mutations on the amino-terminal half, G176I and G180I, caused slight reduction in the rate of synthesis of ATP from ADP and carbamoyl phosphate (the partial ATP synthesis reaction) but the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction velocity was reduced to less than 10% of the wild-type rate. The mutant G722I, which is on the carboxy-terminal half, caused the partial ATP synthesis reaction to be reduced by 1 order of magnitude but the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction was reduced only slightly. All three mutations are within regions which show homology to the putative glycine-rich loops of many ATP-binding proteins. These results have been interpreted to suggest that the two homologous halves of the large subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase each contain a binding site for ATP. The NH2-terminal domain contains the portion of the large subunit that is primarily involved with the phosphorylation of bicarbonate to carboxy phosphate while the COOH-terminal domain contains the region of the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of carbamate to carbamoyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1584825859,"We have recently identified and characterized a 53-kDa inner nuclear membrane-associated protein in Drosophila and termed it otefin. Here we report the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic clones of the otefin gene. Based on sequence analysis, we deduced that the primary translation product has a calculated mass of 45 kDa, contains many serine and threonine residues, and is mostly hydrophilic. However, in the carboxyl terminus, there is a hydrophobic region which may serve as a membrane anchoring domain. RNA blot analysis indicated that the otefin gene codes for a single poly(A+) transcript of 1.6 kilobases and that relatively large amounts of this transcript are present during developmental stages in which many nuclear divisions occur. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the cDNA translation product react with a 58-kDa mammalian nuclear envelope protein, demonstrating evolutionary conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2055707621,"Although bacteriophage T4 late promoters are selectively recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bearing a single protein encoded by T4 gene 55 (gp55), efficient transcription at these promoters requires enhancement by the three T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins, bound to distal ""mobile enhancer"" sites. Two principles are shown to govern this transcriptional enhancement: (i) Promoter recognition and communication between the enhancer and the promoter require separate phage-coded proteins. Only RNA polymerase that has the T4 gene 33 protein (gp33) bound to it is subject to enhancement by the three DNA replication proteins. (ii) Transcriptional enhancement in this prokaryotic system is promoter-specific. Promoter specificity is generated by a direct competition of phage T4 gp33 and gp55 with the E. coli promoter recognition protein, σ70, for binding to the E. coli RNA polymerase core. Thus, polymerase that contains σ70 is competent to transcribe T4 early and middle genes, but lacks the ability to be enhanced by the DNA replication proteins, while polymerase that contains gp55 and gp33 is capable of enhancement via gp33, but its activity is restricted to T4 late promoters by gp55."
https://openalex.org/W1554986753,"The gastrin gene is expressed in fetal pancreatic islet cells, but after birth expression is selectively repressed as the islets terminally differentiate. DNA transfection studies identified a cis regulatory domain between -108 and -76 in the gastrin promoter which controls gastrin transcription in islet cells. This cis regulatory domain comprises adjacent positive and negative elements. The negative element (-108 to -82) contains the sequence ATTCCTCT, which is also found in the negative element of the beta-interferon promoter. Gel retardation assays and DNase footprinting studies demonstrated that specific islet nuclear protein(s) bind to the gastrin negative element. In vivo competition studies demonstrated that the trans-acting factors which bind to this element specifically repress gastrin promoter activity in islet cells. Immediately downstream of the negative element lies a positive element (-82 CATATGG -76), which activates gastrin transcription in islet cells. The sequence of the positive element resembles the islet-specific enhancer elements of the insulin gene (CATCTGG/C). Gel mobility shift assays and in vivo competition studies indicate that this positive element activates the gastrin promoter by binding to the same islet cell transcription factor which binds enhancer elements in the rat insulin gene. The tandem organization of the negative and positive elements suggests that this regulatory domain may act as a switch controlling the transient transcription of the gastrin gene during fetal islet development."
https://openalex.org/W2034489475,"An RNA hairpin identical in sequence with the one formed during autocyclization of the 414-nucleotide Tetrahymena intervening sequence undergoes strand scission at a specific site in the presence of Mn2+. In addition to representing one of the smallest and simplest ribozymes possible, strand scission occurs readily under physiological conditions, is unaffected by the presence of Mg2+, and displays salt, pH, and temperature optima of potential use in exploiting Mn2+ as a regulatory switch in intact cells. The chemistry of strand scission of the RNA hairpin is described, as is the Mn2+-dependent solvolysis of a 231-nucleotide RNA transcript containing this structural motif."
https://openalex.org/W1568627855,"Two monoclonal IgG antibodies E11 and G11, which react with parathyroid and kidney tubule cells, are in the present communication demonstrated to immunostain the surface of cytotrophoblast cells in human placenta. The G11 but not the E11 antibody has earlier been found to interfere with the sensing and gating of extracellular calcium in parathyroid cells. Microfluorometric measurement of the cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+i) concentration was performed on suspended placental cells loaded with fura-2. The E11-positive placental cells displayed biphasic and parathyroid-like increases in Ca2+i in response to extracellular Ca2+. This increase was blocked by the G11 antibody and absent in the E11-negative placental cells. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was constructed in which the G11 and E11 antibodies were shown to react with the same molecule. This calcium sensor was isolated and found to consist of a single, glycosylated polypeptide of approximately 500 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1571615080,"In the present study, we show that hydroxyurea-inactivated ribonucleotide reductase protein M2 has a destabilized iron center, which readily releases iron. In addition, evidence is presented which indicates that single or multistep selection for hydroxyurea resistance, in a variety of mammalian cell lines, leads to alterations in the expression of the gene for the iron storage protein, ferritin. In all hydroxyurea-resistant cell lines examined, including human, hamster, rat, and mouse, there was an elevation in ferritin heavy (H)- and/or light (L)-mRNA levels, but no change in the corresponding gene copy number. A detailed analysis of ferritin expression in a hydroxyurea-resistant mouse L cell line showed that when compared to its wild type counterpart, there was an increase in H subunit concentration but no significant change in L subunit levels. The increased H/L subunit ratio was not brought about by specific changes in the rates of ferritin subunit biosynthesis, but rather resulted from changes in the post-translational stability of H subunits relative to L subunits in the resistant cell line compared to its parental wild type. Also, we show that treatment of cells with hydroxyurea results in an increased rate of ferritin biosynthesis in the absence of changes in H- or L-mRNA levels. These results indicate that the development of even low level hydroxyurea resistance in mammalian cells may require alterations in ferritin gene expression, and they show an interesting relationship between the expressions of two highly regulated activities, ribonucleotide reductase and ferritin."

https://openalex.org/W1534901545,"We present a map describing the binding of cellular proteins to a 300-base pair (bp) region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat. The map accounts for nearly all of the DNase I protection reported in a previous study using crude nuclear extracts. Notable features include a complex arrangement of overlapping binding sites encompassing the 21-bp repeat elements (see accompanying paper) as well as binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-I that significantly deviate from the previously defined consensus recognition sequences. Based on the binding results, we constructed simple chimeric promoters containing 21-bp repeat elements, Sp1-, and nuclear factor I-binding sites upstream of a TATA box. Transient transfection experiments show that these promoters are expressed in T-cells and are regulated by the viral tax2 gene product. Deletion of the Sp1 and nuclear factor I sites abolishes tax-induction, suggesting that one or both of these proteins play a role in mediating the tax-responsiveness conferred by the 21-bp repeat element."
https://openalex.org/W2090020796,"In many organisms, interactions between cells play a critical role in the specification of cell fates. In the sea urchin embryo, primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) regulate the developmental program of a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs). The timing of this cell interaction was analyzed by means of a fluorescence photoablation technique, which was used to specifically ablate PMCs at various stages of development. In addition, the PMCs were microinjected into PMC-depleted recipient embryos at different developmental stages and their effect on SMC fate was examined. The critical interaction between PMCs and SMCs was brief and took place late in gastrulation. Before that time, SMCs were insensitive to the suppressive signals transmitted by the PMCs."
https://openalex.org/W1513665765,"In vitro hydroxylation of aspartic acid has recently been demonstrated in a synthetic peptide based on the structure of the first epidermal growth factor domain in human factor IX (Gronke, R. S., VanDusen, W. J., Garsky, V. M., Jacobs, J. W., Sardana, M. K., Stern, A. M., and Friedman, P. A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 3609-3613). The putative enzyme responsible for the posttranslational modification, aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, has been shown to be a member of a class of 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which include prolyl-4- and lysyl-hydroxylases. In the present study, we describe the solubilization with nonionic detergent of the enzyme from bovine liver microsomes and its purification using DEAE-cellulose followed by heparin-Sepharose. No additional detergent was required during purification. The partially purified enzyme preparation was found to contain no prolyl-4- or lysyl-hydroxylase activity. Using a synthetic peptide based on the structure of the epidermal growth factor-like region in human factor X as substrate, the apparent Km values for iron and alpha-ketoglutarate were 3 and 5 microM, respectively. The enzyme hydroxylated the factor X peptide with the same stereospecificity (erythro beta-hydroxyaspartic acid) and occurred only at the aspartate corresponding to the position seen in vivo. Furthermore, the extent to which either peptide (factor IX or X) was hydroxylated reflected the extent of hydroxylation observed for both human plasma factors IX and X."
https://openalex.org/W1680208415,"We show that the mammalian transcription Sp1 stimulates accurate transcription in a partially fractionated RNA polymerase II-dependent system from Drosophila cultured cells. Moreover, the extent of stimulation is equal for intact RNA polymerase II (polymerase IIA) and polymerase lacking the unique carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit (polymerase IIB). We conclude that in this system Sp1 interacts with a component of the transcription machinery, other than the carboxyl-terminal domain, which is preserved between mammals and insects."
https://openalex.org/W1643444615,"A transfer RNA lacking modified nucleosides was produced by transcription in vitro of a cloned gene that encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycine tRNA. At least three different uridines (in nucleotide positions 13, 32, and 55) of this transcript tRNA are modified to pseudouridine by an extract of S. cerevisiae. Variants of the RNA substrate were also constructed that each had only one of these sites, thus allowing specific monitoring of pseudouridylation at different nucleotide positions. Using such RNAs to assay pseudouridine synthesis, enzymes producing this nucleoside were purified from an extract of S. cerevisiae. The activities corresponding to positions 13, 32, and 55 in the tRNA substrate could all be separated chromatographically, indicating that there is a separate enzyme for each of these sites. The enzyme specific for position 55 (denoted pseudouridine synthase 55) was purified approximately 4000-fold using a combination of DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite."
https://openalex.org/W1540558042,"An insulin receptor mutant was constructed utilizing site-directed mutagenesis to delete the Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg basic amino acid cleavage site (positions 720-723) from the cDNA encoding the human insulin proreceptor. This mutant was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cells revealed a 205-kDa proreceptor which bound to wheat germ agglutinin. Processed 130-kDa alpha and 95-kDa beta subunits were also observed and contained approximately 20% as much protein as the proreceptor on a molar basis. Trypsin digestion of intact metabolically labeled cells decreased the proreceptor band by 80%. Pulse-chase studies revealed a half-life of 28 h for the proreceptor. When cells were photolabeled with 125I-B2(2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des-PheB1 (NAPA)-insulin, the proreceptor incorporated 10% as much label as the 130-kDa alpha subunit in spite of a 5-fold molar excess. Incubation of NAPA-labeled cells at 37 degrees C for 20 min resulted in 60% of the labeled subunits, but little labeled proreceptor, becoming resistant to trypsin degradation. Immunoprecipitation of NAPA-insulin-stimulated cells with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that 62% of the processed labeled receptors, but very little proreceptor, contained phosphotyrosine. Thus, this mutant receptor is synthesized, glycosylated, and expressed on the cell surface as uncleaved proreceptor, although some processing to alpha and beta subunits still occurs. It exhibits a markedly decreased affinity for insulin, and when insulin is bound to, demonstrates defective internalization, down-regulation, and autophosphorylation. These data suggest that cleavage of the mutant proreceptor into subunits is required not only for the development of high affinity binding sites, but also for normal transduction of the signal which activates the beta subunit tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1549363229,"In most highly structured native proteins, as well as in thyroglobulin, the reactivity in vitro of the various tyrosyl residues toward iodine is widely different. The present work demonstrates that of nearly 70 tyrosyl residues present in rat thyroglobulin, there is one, residue number 5 from the NH2-terminal end, which has in vivo the highest affinity toward iodine, being the first one to be iodinated. In fact, when 6-(n-propyl)-2-thiouracil (PTU)-treated, iodine-deficient animals were injected with 125I and killed shortly after, we isolated from thyroid glands poorly iodinated thyroglobulin (about 1 iodine atom/thyroglobulin molecule), nearly 90% of the radioactivity of which was found as monoiodotyrosine. Although CNBr cleavage of this protein gave several fragments after gel electrophoresis only one of these, with apparent mass 27,000 Da, contained 125I. This fragment was isolated and fully characterized. Twelve cycles of automated Edman degradation were performed; the sequence found, i.e. N-I-F-E-X-Q-V-X-A-Q-X-L, indicated that the 27,000-Da fragment is the NH2 terminus of thyroglobulin. This portion of the polypeptide chain contains several tyrosyl residues which may well all be potentially involved in the early iodination of the protein. The observation that the removal of seven amino acids from the NH2 terminus is accompanied (at the fifth step) by the total disappearance of radioactivity in the resulting shortened peptide suggested that the fifth residue was the only one iodinated under these conditions. A second, more quantitative experiment was performed on thyroglobulin obtained from 6-(n-propyl)-2-thiouracil-treated animals whose death was postponed 24 h after the injection of 125I. In this case the radioactivity was found not only in a single CNBr fragment (27,000 Da) but also in other discrete species of lower molecular mass. The mixture of these peptides was subjected to seven steps of manual Edman degradation. Fragments before and after partial degradation were run in parallel on a polyacrylamide gel and the distribution of 125I compared. Besides some change in the background, the two profiles were identical except for the absence of the 27,000-Da species. This proves that all the 125I present in the 27,000-Da species was localized at the fifth residue, the same site at which the hormone molecule is preferentially synthesized under normal conditions. This result is not unexpected and is in accord with the known properties of thyroglobulin which has a polypeptide chain designed for efficient synthesis of the hormone even at low levels of iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1579600581,"Specific transcription of yeast 35 S rDNA by RNA polymerase I has been demonstrated using fractionated extracts prepared from whole cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Determination of the 5'-nucleotides of the in vitro transcripts indicated that two apparent start sites, corresponding to the first (initiating) and fifth nucleotide of the in vivo transcript, were utilized. Production of the 35 S rDNA transcript in this system was not inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Specific transcription of both the 35 S and 5 S rDNA sequences contained on the same template occurred simultaneously in these extracts. Sequential template competition experiments demonstrated that 35 S and 5 S rDNA transcription required different transcription factors. Specific antisera raised against the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I significantly inhibited synthesis of the 35 S rDNA transcript, but had a negligible effect on 5 S rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III. Additionally, this 35 S rDNA transcriptional activity was present in extracts prepared from a strain deficient in the mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Experiments using truncated rDNA templates showed that in vitro no more than 206 base pairs of the sequence upstream of the initiation site are required for maximal activity in this system; the enhancer element did not stimulate 35 S rDNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1530835371,"The expression of mutant 5 S rRNA genes in vivo is examined as a basis for further studies on the control, structure, and function of the ribosomal 5 S RNA. Specific single base substitutions (e.g. positions 98 or 99) or short insertions can result in substantial structural changes that can easily be detected by gel electrophoresis and permit the assay of mutant RNA synthesis and utilization. In addition, the use of high and low copy shuttle vectors as well as alternate growth conditions permits the adjustment of mutant RNA levels in vivo. Despite the high genomic copy number for the 5 S rRNA gene, under optimized conditions as much as 80% of the cellular 5 S RNA can be mutant, and RNA structure analyses indicate that some of these RNAs can readily be assembled into the ribosome structure resulting in an in vivo ribosome population which is also approximately 80% mutant. The results indicate that plasmid integrated 5 S rRNA genes are preferentially expressed and suggest that additional features of the chromosome structure regulate 5 S rRNA gene expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1606780473,"Anti-alpha monoclonal antibodies have been used to investigate the role of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase in initiation and elongation. The four inhibitory monoclonal antibodies studied strongly inhibit cAMP receptor protein-dependent initiation with lac P+ and partially inhibit initiation directed by the lac UV5 promoter. The data suggest that the epitopes to which each of the monoclonal antibodies bind may be proximal to the contact domain between cAMP receptor protein and RNA polymerase. Recycling of RNA polymerase through the initiation process is slower in the presence of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody. Once a 9-nucleotide-long transcript has formed, incubation with the anti-alpha monoclonal antibody does not affect subsequent elongation. The monoclonal antibodies still bind to the elongation complex as indicated by sedimentation of the complex formed after incubation with Staphylococcus aureus cells (immunoprecipitin). These results suggest that the resistance of the elongation complex to these antibodies is not a consequence of their inability to bind to RNA polymerase. Only one of the alpha subunits may be involved in the initial process of transcription, and the antigenic domain of this subunit appears to be occluded by the nascent transcript present in the elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1590248669,"The binding and mitogenic properties of thrombin have been established in various transformed cell lines. In such systems, thrombin induces cell division in the absence of exogenous growth factors, and the enzyme is considered to act directly as a mitogen. This study explores thrombin's interaction with nontransformed, growth factor-dependent cells. Binding of 125I-alpha-thrombin to colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1-dependent bone marrow-derived macrophages is saturable, time-dependent, and displaceable by both unlabeled alpha-thrombin, and esterolytically inactive thrombin. Both dissociation studies of pre-bound radio-labeled thrombin and Scatchard analysis assisted by the program Ligand suggest adherence of thrombin-binding data to a multi-site model. There are an estimated 2 x 10(4) high affinity sites (Kd = 7 x 10(-9)M) and 2 x 10(6) low affinity sites (Kd = 9 x 10(-7)M) per cell. Quiescent bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured with either 10(-8)M thrombin, 1000 units of CSF-1/ml, or both and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Thrombin alone did not induce mitogenesis. CSF-1 induced mitogenesis with peak [3H] thymidine incorporation occurring 24 h after addition of the mitogen. This CSF-1-dependent mitogenic influence was enhanced greater than 2-fold by treatment with thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1529748011,"The citrate carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae fermenting this substrate has been solubilized from the bacterial membranes with Triton X-100. The transport function was reconstituted by incorporation of the carrier into proteoliposomes using a freeze-thaw sonication procedure. Citrate uptake into these proteoliposomes required the presence of Na+ ions on the outside; the amount of citrate accumulated increased as the external Na+ concentration increased from 0 to 100 mM. Proteoliposomes preloaded with citrate catalyzed citrate counterflow when added to external [14C] citrate. Sodium ions were required for counterflow activity. The kinetics of citrate uptake, counterflow, or efflux were not influenced by an inside negative membrane potential, and the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was without effect on citrate uptake. The data therefore suggest an electroneutral Na(+)-citrate symport mechanism for the transport of this tricarboxylic acid into K. pneumoniae."
