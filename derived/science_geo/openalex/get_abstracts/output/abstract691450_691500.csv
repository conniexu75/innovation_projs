https://openalex.org/W4226050764,"Vaccines are highly effective for curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Yet, millions of Americans remain hesitant about getting vaccinated, jeopardizing our ability to end the COVID-19 pandemic by fueling the spread and development of new variants. We show that brief video-based messages of encouragement addressing specific COVID-19 vaccine concerns increase vaccination intentions, and that vaccination intentions, in turn, are predictive of future vaccine uptake. Results from our online experiment reveal that willingness to get vaccinated is driven by messages that increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and perceived behavioral control to get vaccinated. Importantly, messages were particularly effective among more skeptical populations including people who identify as politically conservative or moderate and those who express low trust in government institutions. Our findings corroborate the real-world behavioral significance of vaccination intentions, and devise how even short, scalable online messages can provide governments and health authorities an inexpensive, yet effective tool for increasing intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19 among populations most reluctant to get them."
https://openalex.org/W4224219045,"Evidence-based public health policy often comes years or decades after the underlying scientific breakthrough. The World Health Organization's (WHO's) provisional 10 μg/L arsenic (As) drinking water guideline was set in 1993 based on ""analytical achievability."" In 2011, an additional proviso of ""treatment performance"" was added; a health-based risk assessment would lead to a lower and more protective guideline. Since the WHO does not require United Nations member states to submit copies of national drinking water regulations, there is no complete database of national drinking water standards or guidelines. In this study, we collated and analyzed all drinking water regulations for As from national governments worldwide. We found regulations for 176 countries. Of these countries, 136 have drinking water regulations that specify 10 μg/L As or less, while 40 have regulations that allow more than 10 μg/L of As; we could not find any evidence of regulations for 19 countries. The number of people living in countries that do not meet the WHO's guideline constitutes 32% of the global population. Global As regulations are also strongly tied to national income, with high income countries more likely to meet the WHO's guideline. In this study, we examined the health risk assessments that show a clear need for reducing As exposure to levels far below the current WHO provisional guideline. We also show that advances in analytical chemistry, drinking water treatment, and the possibility of accessing alternative drinking water supplies without As suggest that both low-income countries with limited resources and high-income countries with adequate resources can adopt a lower and more protective national drinking water standards or guidelines for As. Thus, we recommend that regulators and stake holders of all nations reassess the possibilities for improving public health and reducing health care expenses by adopting more stringent regulations for As in drinking water."
https://openalex.org/W4225575044,"Background and aims Stigmatization is a well-documented problem of some diseases. Perceived stigma is common in alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, but little information exists on stigma in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Aim of the study was to investigate frequency and characteristics of perceived stigma among patients with NAFLD. Methods One-hundred and ninety-seven patients seen at the liver clinic were included: a study group of 144 patients with NAFLD, 50 with cirrhosis (34 compensated, 16 decompensated), and a control group of 53 patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Quality-of-life was assessed by chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ). Perceived stigma was assessed using a specific questionnaire for patients with liver diseases categorized in 4 domains: stereotypes, discrimination, shame, and social isolation. Results Perceived stigma was common in patients with NAFLD (99 patients, 69%) and affected all 4 domains assessed. The frequency was slightly higher, yet not significant, in patients with NAFLD cirrhosis vs those without (72% vs 67%, respectively; p = 0.576). In patients without cirrhosis perceived stigma was unrelated to stage of disease, since frequency was similar in patients with no or mild fibrosis compared to those with moderate/severe fibrosis (66% vs 68%, respectively). There were no differences in perceived stigma between patients with compensated cirrhosis and these with decompensated cirrhosis. Among patients with cirrhosis, stigmatization was more common in alcohol-related vs NAFLD-cirrhosis, yet differences were only significant in two domains. In patients with NAFLD, perceived stigma correlated with poor quality-of-life, but not with demographic or clinical variables. Conclusions Perceived stigmatization is common among patients with NAFLD independently of disease stage, is associated with impaired quality-of-life, and may be responsible for stereotypes, discrimination, shame, and social isolation, which may affect human and social rights of affected patients."
https://openalex.org/W4226268175,"South Asia primarily consists of developing economies with diverse financial systems. The commercial banking industry plays a crucial role in each country's financial development in the region. This research aims to evaluate commercial banking industries' efficiency and productivity growth in the South Asian (SA) region over 6 years (2013-2018). In addition, the technology gap among the banking industries of all countries is also explored. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) Meta-frontier is employed to measure the technical efficiency (TE) and technology gap ratio (TGR) among the countries. Further Malmquist productivity index (MPI) is used for productivity change estimation. Results indicate that, on average, 147 commercial banks (CBs) have a technical efficiency score of 0.6208, while CBs in Nepal are the most efficient in the region with an average score of 0.7153. The Meta frontier analysis also confirms the presence of different production technologies in CBs. Nepal's CBs group frontier is closer to meta-frontier (technology gap ratio, TGR = 0.9361) While, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka rank second, third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. The results of productivity contend that the total factor productivity change of all 147 CBs decreases by 0.8 percent on average over the study period. CBs have enhanced their productivity growth in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan, but declining trends have been witnessed in Indian and Bangladesh's commercial banking industries."
https://openalex.org/W4226277414,"Isodon rubescens (Hemsley) H. Hara (Lamiaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine plant that has been used to treat various human diseases and conditions such as inflammation, respiratory and gastrointestinal bacterial infections, and malignant tumors. However, the contents of the main active components of I. rubescens from different origins differ significantly, which greatly affected its quality. Therefore, a molecular method to identify and classify I. rubescens is needed. Here, we report the DNA sequence of the chloroplast genome of I. rubescens collected from Lushan, Henan province. The genome is 152,642 bp in length and has a conserved structure that includes a pair of IR regions (25,726 bp), a LSC region (83,527 bp) and a SSC region (17,663 bp). The chloroplast genome contains 113 unique genes, four rRNA genes, 30 tRNA genes, and 79 protein-coding genes, 23 of which contain introns. The protein-coding genes account for a total of 24,412 codons, and most of them are A/T biased usage. We identified 32 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 48 long repeats. Furthermore, we developed valuable chloroplast molecular resources by comparing chloroplast genomes from three Isodon species, and both mVISTA and DnaSP analyses showed that rps16-trnQ, trnS-trnG, and ndhC-trnM are candidate regions that will allow the identification of intraspecific differences within I. rubescens. Also 14 candidate fragments can be used to identify interspecific differences between species in Isodon. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete chloroplast genomes of 24 species in subfamily Nepetoideae was performed using the maximum likelihood method, and shows that I. rubescens clustered closer to I. serra than I. lophanthoides. Interestingly, our analysis showed that I. rubescens (MW018469.1) from Xianyang, Shaanxi Province (IR-X), is closer to I. serra than to the other two I. rubescens accessions. These results strongly indicate that intraspecific diversity is present in I. rubescens. Therefore, our results provide further insight into the phylogenetic relationships and interspecific diversity of species in the genus Isodon."
https://openalex.org/W4226093040,"Fish display a remarkable diversity of social behaviors, both within and between species. While social behaviors are likely critical for survival, surprisingly little is known about how they evolve in response to changing environmental pressures. With its highly social surface form and multiple populations of a largely asocial, blind, cave-dwelling form, the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, provides a powerful model to study the evolution of social behavior. Here we use motion tracking and analysis of swimming kinematics to quantify social swimming in four Astyanax mexicanus populations. In the light, surface fish school, maintaining both close proximity and alignment with each other. In the dark, surface fish no longer form coherent schools, however, they still show evidence of an attempt to align and maintain proximity when they find themselves near another fish. In contrast, cavefish from three independently-evolved populations (Pachón, Molino, Tinaja) show little preference for proximity or alignment, instead exhibiting behaviors that suggest active avoidance of each other. Two of the three cave populations we studied also slow down when more fish are present in the tank, a behavior which is not observed in surface fish in light or the dark, suggesting divergent responses to conspecifics. Using data-driven computer simulations, we show that the observed reduction in swimming speed is sufficient to alter the way fish explore their environment: it can increase time spent exploring away from the walls. Thus, the absence of schooling in cavefish is not merely a consequence of their inability to see, but may rather be a genuine behavioral adaptation that impacts the way they explore their environment."
https://openalex.org/W4226175650,"The gender gap in computer science (CS) research is a well-studied problem, with an estimated ratio of 15%-30% women researchers. However, far less is known about gender representation in specific fields within CS. Here, we investigate the gender gap in one large field, computer systems. To this end, we collected data from 72 leading peer-reviewed CS conferences, totalling 6,949 accepted papers and 19,829 unique authors (2,946 women, 16,307 men, the rest unknown). We combined these data with external demographic and bibliometric data to evaluate the ratio of women authors and the factors that might affect this ratio. Our main findings are that women represent only about 10% of systems researchers, and that this ratio is not associated with various conference factors such as size, prestige, double-blind reviewing, and inclusivity policies. Author research experience also does not significantly affect this ratio, although author country and work sector do. The 10% ratio of women authors is significantly lower than the 16% in the rest of CS. Our findings suggest that focusing on inclusivity policies alone cannot address this large gap. Increasing women's participation in systems research will require addressing the systemic causes of their exclusion, which are even more pronounced in systems than in the rest of CS."
https://openalex.org/W4226063144,"Vented tumble dryers release moist warm air from the drying process to the external environment, usually through pipework linking the appliance to a vent in an exterior wall. Although such dryers contain a lint filter to remove fibers from this air stream, recent reports suggest that this process is incomplete, leading to microfibers being released in the ducted warm air and subsequently polluting the external environment. Microfiber release from wash loads comprising 10 100% cotton and 10 100% polyester T-shirts (total load mass ratio 48% cotton, 52% polyester) was measured at different stages of the washing and drying process to compare the quantities of fibers released ‘down the drain’, collected in the dryer lint filter, and released to air from the tumble dryer. Testing under both European and North American washing conditions found that the quantities of microfibers released to air during tumble drying were significant and comparable to levels released ‘down the drain’ during washing. Use of conventional rinse-added liquid fabric conditioner increased microfiber accumulation on the dryer lint filter, with reduced release from the dryer exhaust observed at the highest fabric conditioner dose tested (21.6% and 14.2% reduction under North American and European conditions, respectively). Conventional liquid fabric conditioner did not significantly impact microfiber release from the washing machine, in line with previous studies. A fabric conditioner specially designed for anti-wrinkle performance reduced microfiber release from the dryer exhaust at all levels tested (by 17.6–35.6%, depending on dose), apparently by increasing the efficiency of microfiber accumulation in the lint filter. Tumble dryer sheets were also found to cause a reduction in microfiber release from the dryer exhaust (by 14.1–34.9%, depending on the dose/product), likely driven by collection of liberated fibers on the sheet during the drying process. The use of both antiwrinkle liquid fabric conditioner and dryer sheet enabled a 44.9% reduction in microfiber emissions from the dryer exhaust. In all studies, the fiber mass collected on the lint filter or emitted from the dryer exhaust was richer in cotton fibers (range 83.4–96.3% on the lint filter, 93.0–99.8% from the dryer exhaust) than the wash load composition (48% cotton). Moreover, fibers collected by the lint filter contained a higher proportion of polyester than emissions from the dryer exhaust (range 3.7–16.6% on the lint filter, 0.2–7.0% from the dryer exhaust). There is significant variation in the porosity of lint filters among installed vented tumble dryers. Single-variable testing of the impact of lint filter design concluded that reducing screen pore size significantly reduces airborne microfiber release during tumble drying; a reduction in lint filter pore size from 0.2 mm 2 to 0.04 mm 2 reduced release by 34.8%. As some lint filters have pore sizes of around 1 mm 2 , there is enormous scope to reduce microfiber release from dryers though improved lint filter design. However, it is suggested that a step-change in appliance design away from vented dryers to only fully-sealed condenser dryers might be necessary to eliminate the contribution of tumble drying to airborne microfiber pollution."
https://openalex.org/W4225784718,"The aim of this preregistered study was to identify dispositional predictors of podcast listening and examine the associations between aspects of podcast listening, dispositional predictors, and psychological outcomes. Three hundred and six adults from a range of countries completed an online questionnaire that assessed individual difference predictors (the Big Five personality factors, curiosity, need for cognition, need to belong, age, and gender), aspects of podcast listening (amount, format, setting, device, and social aspects), and potential outcomes (autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, and smartphone addiction). As predicted, openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition positively predicted podcast listening. Contrary to predictions, need to belong negatively predicted podcast listening, and time spent listening to podcasts was not associated with autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, or smartphone addiction. However, certain aspects of podcast listening (e.g., parasocial relationships and social engagement) were related to positive outcomes and to our predictor variables. Furthermore, neuroticism negatively predicted podcast listening. Overall, the findings support the idea that informational motives can play a role in podcast listening, and that some aspects of listening are associated with positive outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4225893745,"Background Robust public health and health system response to the increasing burden of multimorbidity worldwide requires detailed epidemiological examination of its key sociodemographic and geographic determinants. We investigated the role of gender, age and socioeconomic and geographic factors on multimorbidity (i.e., having two or more conditions) in the adult population in France and examined implications for surveillance and prevention. Methods We used data from two large nationwide representative surveys with cross-sectional and longitudinal health and socio-demographic indicators, conducted in France between 2008 and 2014. Morbidity counts and frequent dyads/triads of conditions independently impacting mortality, activity limitations, and perceived health were investigated with regard to differences in gender, age, socioeconomic (education, occupation and income) and geography (size of the urban unit and region). Results The component conditions of multimorbidity varied with gender and age. Women experienced multimorbidity 23–31% more frequently and at a younger age (5–15 years earlier) than men. Multimorbidity increased with age while its associations with most health indicators weakened with it. Multimorbidity was strongly and independently associated with socioeconomic indicators, with a strong inverse dose-response relationship with education, but less consistently with geographic factors. Conclusions Multimorbidity has diverse and variable components and impacts across gender and age. It is strongly associated with socioeconomic factors, notably educational level, for which causality appears likely. Consideration of this diversity and variability, its common occurrence in dyads and triads, and its impact on health outcomes according to age and gender may contribute to efficient surveillance and support the identification of prevention strategies targeting middle-aged men and women."
https://openalex.org/W4226106812,"Shareable e-scooters have become popular, but injuries to riders and bystanders have not been well characterized. The goal of this study was to describe e-scooter injuries and estimate the rate of injury per e-scooter trip.Retrospective review of patients presenting to 180 clinics and 2 hospitals in greater Los Angeles between January 1, 2014 and May 14, 2020. Injuries were identified using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm not previously used to identify injuries, tallied, and described along with required healthcare resources. We combine these tallies with municipal data on scooter use to report a monthly utilization-corrected rate of e-scooter injuries. We searched 36 million clinical notes. Our NLP algorithm correctly classified 92% of notes in the testing set compared with the gold standard of investigator review. In total, we identified 1,354 people injured by e-scooters; 30% were seen in more than one clinical setting (e.g., emergency department and a follow-up outpatient visit), 29% required advanced imaging, 6% required inpatient admission, and 2 died. We estimate 115 injuries per million e-scooter trips were treated in our health system.Our observed e-scooter injury rate is likely an underestimate, but is similar to that previously reported for motorcycles. However, the comparative severity of injuries is unknown. Our methodology may prove useful to study other clinical conditions not identifiable by existing diagnostic systems."
https://openalex.org/W4226445320,"Internet coupled with agricultural development in full swing, green agri-food product e-commerce has become a hot topic in the development of e-commerce. However, due to the seasonality, territoriality, weak quality, difference, and dispersion of agri-food products, e-commerce of green agri-food products are facing difficulties. Based on the gap between consumers’ willingness and behavior to buy green agri-food products online, this paper quantitatively studied the factors that affect consumers’ behavior deviation to buy green agri-food products online. The method of constructing the binary Logistic regression model was adopted, and analysis tools such as SPSS and Excel were used for analysis, to study the influence of various factors on consumers’ purchase willingness and behavior. The research conclusion shows that: consumers’ gender, age, understanding of online agri-food products, and monthly disposable income have a positive impact on the consistency of consumers’ behavior and willingness, while the price of green agri-food products and online purchasing frequency have a negative impact on consumers’ willingness and behavior of online purchasing. The results are discussed in the context of existing studies. Suggestions and research prospects are presented at the end of the article."
https://openalex.org/W4225596716,"Background Biomedical waste management is an important precondition to safeguard the healthcare workers and community members, as well as the environment, from being contaminated with infectious substances. However, biomedical waste management practices during the pandemic era of COVID-19 were unknown. Objective This study was aimed to assess biomedical waste management practices and associated factors among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic era at metropolitan city private hospitals, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at metropolitan city private hospitals in Amhara Region. Simple random sampling was used to select 431 study participants. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire and observational checklists. The data were cleaned, coded, and entered into the Epi-data version 4.6, and then exported to SPSS version 20. for analysis. Variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered as significant factors in multivariable logistic regression analysis and AOR with a 95% confidence level was used to measure the strength of association. Results The proportion of health care workers who had good practices in biomedical waste management was 49.4%. Participants who had MSc education level, [AOR = 4.20, 95% CI (1.01, 17.40)], Bachelor degree [AOR = 3.52, 95% CI (2.13, 5.82)], got training on biomedical waste management [AOR = 4.33, 95% CI (2.71, 6.93)], access to color-coded three bins in their working department [AOR = 6.24.95% CI (3.84, 10.13)] and those who had good attitude (AOR = 2.64, 95% CI (1.65, 4.22), were significantly associated with biomedical waste management practices in private hospitals. Conclusion The practice of biomedical waste management in the study area was low. Level of education, taking training on biomedical waste management, availability of color-coded three bins, and attitude of health care workers were significantly associated with biomedical waste management practices. Hence, in-service training is recommended to improve biomedical waste management practices."
https://openalex.org/W4225775921,"This study compares the effectiveness of different front-of-package label designs in a Brazilian sample (n = 1384). Eligible adults were randomized to one of two study arms and viewed images of snacks with either a triangular warning label (TL) or a rectangular ‘high in’ label with a magnifying glass (ML). They responded to a series of questions that captured label usefulness, understanding, and purchase intentions. Compared to participants in the ML arm, those in the TL arm agreed that the TL communicated important information [Mean (SD) - 5.47 (0.07) vs 4.49 (0.08), p-value &lt;0.001], was a useful tool [Mean (SD) - 6.12 (0.06) vs 5.75 (0.07), p-value &lt;0.001], and was easier to understand as measured subjectively [Mean (SD) - 4.96 (0.07) vs 4.44 (0.08), p-value &lt;0.001]. However, both the TL and the ML performed similarly in communicating nutrient information as measured by the objective understanding of nutrient content [57.09% vs 54.65%, p-value 0.259]. The ML performed marginally better at improving purchase intentions [Mean (SD) - 2.57 (0.07) vs 2.79 (0.08), p-value &lt;0.049]. The current study adds to the growing evidence base on the pathways through which FoP labels, particularly ‘high in’ labels, might influence consumer perceptions and behavior. It is also one of the first studies to provide evidence on the utility of the ML design for Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W4224301846,"To combine a feedforward neural network (FNN) and Lie group (symmetry) theory of differential equations (DEs), an alternative artificial NN approach is proposed to solve the initial value problems (IVPs) of ordinary DEs (ODEs). Introducing the Lie group expressions of the solution, the trial solution of ODEs is split into two parts. The first part is a solution of other ODEs with initial values of original IVP. This is easily solved using the Lie group and known symbolic or numerical methods without any network parameters (weights and biases). The second part consists of an FNN with adjustable parameters. This is trained using the error back propagation method by minimizing an error (loss) function and updating the parameters. The method significantly reduces the number of the trainable parameters and can more quickly and accurately learn the real solution, compared to the existing similar methods. The numerical method is applied to several cases, including physical oscillation problems. The results have been graphically represented, and some conclusions have been made."
https://openalex.org/W4225588561,"Along with the rapid development of the Internet, the form of destination marketing is becoming increasingly innovative and diverse. Celebrity endorsement via social media, as an effective marketing strategy, has been widely used by various tourism companies to attract and engage with their customers. Previous studies have investigated the various aspects of such endorsement (e.g. the effect of endorser's attributes) in different contexts (e.g. Hotel, Restaurant, Airline). However, little research has focused on the influence of the tourists' parasocial relationship with endorsers on destination marketing. Accordingly, the current study aims to explore the role of parasocial relationships on tourists' destination attitude and visit intention.This study adopted quantitative method and conducted Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis. 498 valid questionnaires were collected from Weibo (One of China's most popuar social media platforms).Results suggested that endorser's credibility positively influenced follower's parasocial relationship (p<0.001), which in turn positively influenced destination attitude and visit intention (p<0.001). Additionally, the parasocial relationship significantly mediated the relationship between credibility and destination attitude as well as visit intention (p<0.001).The emerging trend of celerbity endorsement via live-streaming makes tourism destination marketing more diverse and even effective. Through exploring the underlying mechanism of celebrity endorsement, this study can provide destination marketers with insights about how to build and strengthen the tourist's attitude and visit intention towards destiantion by developing their parasocial relationships with endorsers. This study also adds to the literature of using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) in tourism and hospiatlity research."
https://openalex.org/W4226023830,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive complication affecting 8-10% of US pregnancies annually. While there is no cure for PE, aspirin may reduce complications for those at high risk for PE. Furthermore, PE disproportionately affects racial minorities, with a higher burden of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown early prediction of PE would allow for prevention. We approached the prediction of PE using a new method based on a cost-sensitive deep neural network (CSDNN) by considering the severe imbalance and sparse nature of the data, as well as racial disparities. We validated our model using large extant rich data sources that represent a diverse cohort of minority populations in the US. These include Texas Public Use Data Files (PUDF), Oklahoma PUDF, and the Magee Obstetric Medical and Infant (MOMI) databases. We identified the most influential clinical and demographic features (predictor variables) relevant to PE for both general populations and smaller racial groups. We also investigated the effectiveness of multiple network architectures using three hyperparameter optimization algorithms: Bayesian optimization, Hyperband, and random search. Our proposed models equipped with focal loss function yield superior and reliable prediction performance compared with the state-of-the-art techniques with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 66.3% and 63.5% for the Texas and Oklahoma PUDF respectively, while the CSDNN model with weighted cross-entropy loss function outperforms with an AUC of 76.5% for the MOMI data. Furthermore, our CSDNN model equipped with focal loss function leads to an AUC of 66.7% for Texas African American and 57.1% for Native American. The best results are obtained with 62.3% AUC with CSDNN with weighted cross-entropy loss function for Oklahoma African American, 58% AUC with DNN and balanced batch for Oklahoma Native American, and 72.4% AUC using either CSDNN with weighted cross-entropy loss function or CSDNN with focal loss with balanced batch method for MOMI African American dataset. Our results provide the first evidence of the predictive power of clinical databases for PE prediction among minority populations."
https://openalex.org/W4226046698,"Prunus subgenus Cerasus (cherry) is an economically important group that distributed in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. However, shared interspecific morphological traits and variability across taxa of Cerasus are among the impediments to taxonomic efforts to correctly delimit taxa. This is further complicated by a lack of genetic information on these taxa, with no focused genomic or phylogenetic studies being done on Cerasus . In this study, we conducted comparative analysis on the complete plastid genomes (plastomes) of 20 Cerasus species to gain a greater understanding of the attributes of the plastome of these taxa while helping resolve their phylogenetic placement in Prunus sensu lato and interspecific relationships within the subgenus. Our results displayed that (1) the plastomes of the 20 Cerasus species studied exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with conversed genome arrangement, structure, and moderate divergence. (2) The average size of complete plastomes for the Cerasus taxa studied was 157,861 bp, ranging from 157,458 to 158,024 bp. A total of 134 genes were annotated, including 86 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNAs, and 8 rRNAs across all species. In simple sequence repeat analysis, we found Cerasus had a comparable number of dispersed and tandem repeats to those identified in other angiosperm taxa, with only P . pseudocerasus found to contain trinucleotide repeats. Nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that the trnG-GCC gene and rpl32 - trnL region had the highest Pi value showing potential as phylogenetic markers. (3) Two phylogenetic trees of the plastomes verified the monophyletic relationship of Cerasus and provided a more resolved species-level phylogeny. Our study provides detailed plastome information for exploring the phylogeny of subg. Cerasus taxa. We identified various types of repeats and nucleotide diversity hotspots, which can be a reference for species identification and reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4225598420,"The British colony of South Australia, established in 1836, offered a fresh start to migrants hoping for a better life. A cohort of settlers buried in a section of St Mary's Anglican Church Cemetery (1847-1927) allocated for government funded burials was investigated to determine their health, with a focus on skeletal manifestations associated with metabolic deficiencies. Findings of St Mary's sample were compared with those published for contemporary skeletal samples from two British cemeteries, St Martin's, Birmingham, and St Peter's, Wolverhampton, to explore similarities and differences. To investigate the changing economic background of the St Mary's cohort, which may have influenced the location of their burial within the cemetery, the number and demographic profile of government funded burials and those in privately funded leased plots were compared. The study sample consisted of the skeletal remains of 65 individuals (20 adults, 45 subadults) from St Mary's Cemetery 'free ground' section. The bones and teeth of individuals in this cohort showed evidence of pathological manifestations, including areas of abnormal porosity in bone cortices in 9 adults and 12 subadults and flaring of metaphyses (one subadult) and costochondral junctions of the ribs (one subadult). Porous lesions of orbital roof bones (Types 3 to 4) were seen on three subadults. Macroscopic examination of teeth identified enamel hypoplastic defects and micro-CT scans showed areas of interglobular dentine. Comparison of St Mary's findings with the British samples revealed that prevalences of manifestations associated with vitamin C deficiency were higher at St Mary's and manifestations associated with vitamin D deficiency were lower respectively. The location of burial pattern at St Mary's Cemetery, from the mid-1840s to1860s, showed differences in the economic status of migrants. This pattern changed from the 1870s, which reflected improvements in the local economy and the economic recovery of the colony."

Posing the right questions is crucial, when diagnosing urinary incontinence, but also to evaluate the need of treatment and treatment effect. Therefore, reliable and validated questionnaires within this area are needed. Even though the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) has been used on a daily basis in the Danish Urogynaecological Database since 2006, it has not yet been validated in a Danish population of both men and women.To test the reliability and validity of the Danish version of the ICIQ-UI SF in a Danish speaking population of men and women among municipal employees.Content validity was evaluated with semi-structured interviews. A quantitative field test was performed, in which the questionnaire was distributed electronically to municipal workers by E-mail. Statistical methods included item characteristics (missings, kurtosis and skewness), internal consistency (Chronbach's alfa), test-retest (ICC), construct validity (known group validation), and floor and ceiling effect.A number of 1814 Danish municipal workers completed the questionnaire. Of the total number of responders, 426 were invited to complete the questionnaire twice (for test-retest) and 215 (50.5%) of these completed the questions again two weeks later. Statistical analyses of the ICIQ-UI SF demonstrated no floor and ceiling effects, skewness was zero and kurtosis 0.00-0.49. Cronbach's alfa was 0.87 and intraclass correlation coefficient 0.73. Two out of three hypotheses were accepted in the known-groups validation.This study offers an adaptation of the ICIQ-UI SF to a Danish setting.

NCT was identified by structural similarity to previously the previously identified but weak HNF4α agonists alverine and benfluorex. Here, we administered NCT to mice fed a high fat diet, with the goal of studying the role of HNF4α in obesity-related diseases. Intestines from NCT-treated mice were examined by RNA-seq to determine the role of HNF4α in that organ. Surprisingly, the major classes of genes altered by HNF4α were involved in IBD and Paneth cell biology. Multiple genes downregulated in IBD were induced by NCT. Paneth cells identified by lysozyme expression were reduced in high fat fed mice. NCT reversed the effect of high fat diet on Paneth cells, with multiple markers being induced, including a number of defensins, which are critical for Paneth cell function and intestinal barrier integrity. NCT upregulated genes that play important role in IBD and that are downregulated in that disease. It reversed the loss of Paneth cell markers that occurred in high fat diet fed mice. These data suggest that HNF4α could be a therapeutic target for IBD and that the agonists that we have identified could be candidate therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4226494971,"Activity recognition modelling using smartphone Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is an underutilized resource defining and assessing work efficiency for a wide range of natural resource management tasks. This study focused on the initial development and validation of a smartphone-based activity recognition system for excavator-based mastication equipment working in Ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) plantations in North Idaho, USA. During mastication treatments, sensor data from smartphone gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sound pressure meters (decibel meters) were collected at three sampling frequencies (10, 20, and 50 hertz (Hz)). These data were then separated into 9 time domain features using 4 sliding window widths (1, 5, 7.5 and 10 seconds) and two levels of window overlap (50% and 90%). Random forest machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated for 40 combinations of model parameters to determine the best combination of parameters. 5 work elements ( masticate , clear , move , travel , and delay ) were classified with the performance metrics for individual elements of the best model (50 Hz, 10 second window, 90% window overlap) falling within the following ranges: area under the curve (AUC) (95.0% - 99.9%); sensitivity (74.9% - 95.6%); specificity (90.8% - 99.9%); precision (81.1% - 98.3%); F1-score (81.9% - 96.9%); balanced accuracy (87.4% - 97.7%). Smartphone sensors effectively characterized individual work elements of mechanical fuel treatments. This study is the first example of developing a smartphone-based activity recognition model for ground-based forest equipment. The continued development and dissemination of smartphone-based activity recognition models may assist land managers and operators with ubiquitous, manufacturer-independent systems for continuous and automated time study and production analysis for mechanized forest operations."
https://openalex.org/W4225748420,"Humans perceive light in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm). Some night vision systems use infrared light that is not perceptible to humans and the images rendered are transposed to a digital display presenting a monochromatic image in the visible spectrum. We sought to develop an imaging algorithm powered by optimized deep learning architectures whereby infrared spectral illumination of a scene could be used to predict a visible spectrum rendering of the scene as if it were perceived by a human with visible spectrum light. This would make it possible to digitally render a visible spectrum scene to humans when they are otherwise in complete ""darkness"" and only illuminated with infrared light. To achieve this goal, we used a monochromatic camera sensitive to visible and near infrared light to acquire an image dataset of printed images of faces under multispectral illumination spanning standard visible red (604 nm), green (529 nm) and blue (447 nm) as well as infrared wavelengths (718, 777, and 807 nm). We then optimized a convolutional neural network with a U-Net-like architecture to predict visible spectrum images from only near-infrared images. This study serves as a first step towards predicting human visible spectrum scenes from imperceptible near-infrared illumination. Further work can profoundly contribute to a variety of applications including night vision and studies of biological samples sensitive to visible light."
https://openalex.org/W4225926322,"Salinity is a global problem, and almost more than 20% of the total cultivated area of the world is affected by salt stress. Phytoremediation is one of the most suitable practices to combat salinity and recently biochar has showed the tremendous potential to alleviate salt-affected soils and enhance vegetation. Trees improve the soil characteristics by facilitating the leaching of salts and releasing organic acids in soil. Moreover, in the presence of trees, higher transpiration rates and lower evaporation rates are also helpful in ameliorating salt affected soils. This study was designed to check the effect of different levels of biochar on the morph-physiological characteristics of three important agroforestry tree species: Eucalyptus camaldulensis , Vachellia nilotica , and Dalbergia sissoo , in saline soils. Farmyard manure biochar was applied at the rate of 3% (w/w), 6% (w/w), and 9% (w/w) to find appropriate levels of biochar for promoting the early-stage trees growth under saline conditions. Results of the current study revealed that maximum shoot length (104.77 cm), shoot dry weight (23.72 g), leaves dry weight (28.23 g), plant diameter (12.32 mm), root length (20.89 cm), root dry weight (18.90 g), photosynthetic rate (25.33 μ moles CO 2 m -2 s -1 ) and stomatal conductance (0.12 mol H 2 O m -2 s -1 ) were discovered in the plants of Eucalyptus camaldulensis at the rate of 6% (w/w). All tree species showed better results for growth and physiological characteristics when biochar was applied at the rate of 6% (w/w). In comparison, a decreasing trend in growth parameters was found in the excessive amount of biochar when the application rate was increased from 6% (w/w) to 9% (w/w) for all three species. So, applying an appropriate level of biochar is important for boosting plant growth in saline soils. Among different tree species, Vachellia nilotica and Eucalyptus camaldulensis both showed very promising results to remediate salt affected soils with Vachellia nilotica showing maximum potential to absorb sodium ions."

https://openalex.org/W4226029047,"The Florida Horse Conch, Triplofusus giganteus, one of the largest marine gastropods in the world, has been intensely exploited by shell collectors, curio dealers, and commercial harvest for over a century and is now in decline. Effective management of horse conch populations requires better data on commercial and recreational harvest intensities but also on the species' intrinsic capacity to recover. Here, we use stable oxygen and carbon isotope sclerochronology to investigate the horse conch's life history, including its maximum life span, growth rates, age at first spawning, and number of lifetime spawning seasons. The largest two shells studied (460 and 475 mm linear shell length) grew for 13 and 11 years, respectively. Growth curves for these shells, extrapolated out to the length of the record size shell (606 mm linear shell length) predict a maximum age of just 16 years. Carbon isotopes and field photographs of spawning females suggest that females mature relatively late in life. However, the largest horse conchs remaining in the wild are also smaller and younger than those studied here. Thus, the largest females left in the wild could have few lifetime spawning events. High fecundity can buffer horse conchs from overfishing but only if females reach spawning age and reproductive-age females are protected. Our study highlights the usefulness of stable isotope sclerochronology for characterizing the life histories of molluscan species now too uncommon to study through traditional mark and recapture approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4226062741,"Background Blood pressure (BP) elevations are commonly treated in hospitalized patients; however, treatment is not guideline directed. Our objective was to assess BP response to commonly prescribed antihypertensives after the development of severe inpatient hypertension (HTN). Methods This is a cohort study of adults, excluding intensive care unit patients, within a single healthcare system admitted for reasons other than HTN who developed severe HTN (systolic BP&gt;180 or diastolic BP &gt;110 mmHg at least 1 hour after admission). We identified the most commonly administered antihypertensives given within 6 hours of severe HTN (given to &gt;10% of treated patients). We studied the association of treatment with each antihypertensive vs. no treatment on BP change in the 6 hours following severe HTN development using mixed-effects model after adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics. Results Among 23,147 patients who developed severe HTN, 9,166 received antihypertensive treatment. The most common antihypertensives given were oral metoprolol (n = 1991), oral amlodipine (n = 1812), oral carvedilol (n = 1116), IV hydralazine (n = 1069) and oral hydralazine (n = 953). In the fully adjusted model, treatment with IV hydralazine led to 13 [-15.9, -10.1], 18 [-22.2, -14] and 11 [-14.1, -8.3] mmHg lower MAP, SBP, and DBP in the 6 hours following severe HTN development compared to no treatment. Treatment with oral hydralazine and oral carvedilol also resulted in significantly lower BPs in the 6 hours following severe HTN development (6 [-9.1, -2.1 and -7 [-9.1, -4.2] lower MAP, respectively) compared to no treatment. Receiving metoprolol and amlodipine did not result in a drop in BP compared to no treatment. Conclusion Among commonly used antihypertensives, IV hydralazine resulted in the most significant drop in BP following severe HTN, while metoprolol and amlodipine did not lower BP. Further research to assess the effect of treatment on clinical outcomes and if needed which antihypertensives to administer are necessary."

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the university teaching to consider in high priority the switch from in-presence teaching to remote teaching, including laboratory teaching. While excellent virtual-laboratory teaching has been proposed and turned out to be very useful, the need of a real-laboratory in-presence teaching is still a major need. This study was aimed at presenting a laboratory exercise focusing (a) on a very challenging therapeutic strategy, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, and (b) on technologies that are playing a central role in applied biochemistry and molecular biology, i.e. PCR and RT-PCR. The aims of the practical laboratory were to determine: (a) the possibility to identify SARS-CoV-2 sequences starting from a recombinant plasmid and (b) the possibility to discriminate cells with respect to the expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. This activity is simple (cell culture, RNA extraction, RT-qPCR are all well-established technologies), fast (starting from isolated and characterized RNA, few hours are just necessary), highly reproducible (therefore easily employed by even untrained students). We suggest that this laboratory practical exercises should be considered for face-to-face teaching especially if the emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic is maintained. The teaching protocol here described might be considered in order to perform fast but meaningful in-presence teaching, making feasible the division of crowded classes in low-number cohorts of students, allowing the maintenance of the required social distance."
https://openalex.org/W4226145655,"The nematode genus Bursaphelenchus is a highly divergent group. This genus mainly consists of mycophagous entomophilic species, but some species have specialized as obligate or facultative plant parasites, facultative insect parasites, or exhibit feeding dimorphism (phenotypic plasticity) leading to mycophagous and predatory forms. In the present study, a new Bursaphelenchus species, B . suri n. sp. was isolated from fresh syconia (figs) of Ficus sur and is described and illustrated based on its typological characters and molecular phylogenetic status. The new species is characterized by its highly derived feeding structures found in obligate plant parasites, lip possessing a labial disc and a long and thick stylet with a long conus and extremely well-developed basal swellings. In addition, slender body of both sexes is characteristic of the species. The new species is phylogenetically and typologically closely related to B . sycophilus , i.e., these two species share the characteristic feeding structures and form a well-supported clade within the B . fungivorus group in the genus. Biologically, these two species are both isolated from fresh figs of the section Sycomorus . However, the new species differs from B . sycophilus by the length of the female post-uterine sac and the shape of the male spicule, i.e., the new species has a long post-uterine sac and spicule condylus without dorsal recurvature. Thus, the new species is the second obligate fig parasite of the genus, and the evolutionary relationship between the B . suri n. sp. and B . sycophilus clade and section Sycomorus figs is hypothesized as an example of adaptive radiation with more species to be discovered."

Haplotype diversity analysis showed that the cultivated S. miltiorrhiza populations had a very rich genetic diversity and an excellent capacity to resist environmental pressure. The best-fit nucleotide substitution models for ETS, psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF, ycf1-rps15, and their combined sequences were HKY+I, T92, T92, T92+G, and T92+G, respectively; the nucleotide conversion frequency in the combined sequences was lower than the transversion, and the relatively high nucleotide substitution frequencies suggests its high genetic variability. Neutral tests showed that the spacer sequences of the populations conform with the neutral evolution model, and there has been no current expansion events occurred. Phylogeny analyses based on both the individual and the combined sequences showed that the 40 populations were clustered in two clades with a very similar topological structure. The discrimination rate of the combined sequence marker is significantly increased to 52.5% (21 populations) over the highest 35% (13 populations) by the single marker of ETS, though still inadequate but a big step forward. Further exploration of more DNA markers is needed. This study for the first time revealed the rich genetic diversity and phylogeny of the currently cultivated S. miltiorrhiza populations in China and provides novel alternative molecular markers for the genetic identification and resources evaluation of the cultivated S. miltiorrhiza populations."
https://openalex.org/W4226305380,"Background Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy driven by dietary intake of gluten proteins. Typical histopathologic features are villous flattening, crypt hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria. The disease is hallmarked by the gluten-dependent production of autoantibodies targeting the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). While these antibodies are specific and sensitive diagnostic markers of the disease, a role in the development of the enteropathy has never been established. Methods We addressed this question by injecting murine antibodies harboring the variable domains of a prototypic celiac anti-TG2 immunoglobulin into TG2-sufficient and TG2-deficient mice evaluating for celiac enteropathy. Results We found no histopathologic abnormalities nor clinical signs of disease related to the injection of anti-TG2 IgG or IgA. Conclusions Our findings do not support a direct role for secreted anti-TG2 antibodies in the development of the celiac enteropathy."
https://openalex.org/W4226331949,"Controlled assembly of retinal cells on artificial surfaces is important for fundamental cell research and medical applications. We investigate fractal electrodes with branches of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes and silicon dioxide gaps between the branches that form repeating patterns spanning from micro- to milli-meters, along with single-scaled Euclidean electrodes. Fluorescence and electron microscopy show neurons adhere in large numbers to branches while glial cells cover the gaps. This ensures neurons will be close to the electrodes' stimulating electric fields in applications. Furthermore, glia won't hinder neuron-branch interactions but will be sufficiently close for neurons to benefit from the glia's life-supporting functions. This cell 'herding' is adjusted using the fractal electrode's dimension and number of repeating levels. We explain how this tuning facilitates substantial glial coverage in the gaps which fuels neural networks with small-world structural characteristics. The large branch-gap interface then allows these networks to connect to the neuron-rich branches."
https://openalex.org/W4225502316,"Purpose Research on the novel coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) mainly relies on cross-sectional data, but this approach fails to consider the temporal dimension of the pandemic. This study assesses three temporal dimensions of the COVID-19 infection risk in US counties, namely probability of occurrence, duration of the pandemic, and intensity of transmission, and investigate local patterns of the factors associated with these risks. Methods Analyzing daily data between January 22 and September 11, 2020, we categorize the contiguous US counties into four risk groups—High-Risk, Moderate-Risk, Mild-Risk, and Low-Risk—and then apply both conventional (i.e., non-spatial) and geographically weighted (i.e., spatial) ordinal logistic regression model to understand the county-level factors raising the COVID-19 infection risk. The comparisons of various model fit diagnostics indicate that the spatial models better capture the associations between COVID-19 risk and other factors. Results The key findings include (1) High- and Moderate-Risk counties are clustered in the Black Belt, the coastal areas, and Great Lakes regions. (2) Fragile labor markets (e.g., high percentages of unemployed and essential workers) and high housing inequality are associated with higher risks. (3) The Monte Carlo tests suggest that the associations between covariates and COVID-19 risk are spatially non-stationary. For example, counties in the northeastern region and Mississippi Valley experience a stronger impact of essential workers on COVID-19 risk than those in other regions, whereas the association between income ratio and COVID-19 risk is stronger in Texas and Louisiana. Conclusions The COVID-19 infection risk levels differ greatly across the US and their associations with structural inequality and sociodemographic composition are spatially non-stationary, suggesting that the same stimulus may not lead to the same change in COVID-19 risk. Potential interventions to lower COVID-19 risk should adopt a place-based perspective."

HLCS deficiency causes multiple carboxylase deficiency which results in fatal consequences unless patients are diagnosed early and treated with pharmacological doses of biotin. The objective of this study was to develop an HLCS conditional knockout (KO) mouse and assess effects of HLCS knockout on embryo survival. In the mouse, exon 8 is flanked by LoxP sites, thereby removing a catalytically important region upon recombination by Cre. HLCS conditional KO mice were backcrossed for 14 generations with C57BL/6J mice to yield Hlcstm1Jze. Fertility and weight gain were normal and no frank disease phenotypes and abnormal feeding behavior were observed in the absence of Cre. HLCS knockout was embryonic lethal when dams homozygous for both the floxed Hlcs gene and tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (denoted Hlcstm1.1Jze) were injected with tamoxifen on gestational days 2.5 and 10.5. This is the first report of an HLCS conditional KO mouse, which enables studies of the roles of HLCS and biotin in intermediary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4225662613,"Despite great progress in antiretroviral treatment (ART) access in recent decades, HIV incidence remains high in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the role of individual and healthcare supply-related factors in HIV transmission risk in HIV-positive adults enrolled in 19 HIV services in the Centre and Littoral regions of Cameroon.Factors associated with HIV transmission risk (defined as both unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use with HIV-negative or unknown status partners) were identified using a multi-level logistic regression model. Besides socio-demographic and behavioral individual variables, the following four HIV-service profiles, identified using cluster analysis, were used in regression analyses as healthcare supply-related variables: 1) district services with large numbers of patients, almost all practicing task-shifting and not experiencing antiretroviral drugs (ARV) stock-outs (n = 4); 2) experienced and well-equipped national reference services, most practicing task-shifting and not experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 5); 3) small district services with limited resources and activities, almost all experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 6); 4) small district services with a wide range of activities and half not experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 4).Of the 1372 patients (women 67%, median age [Interquartile]: 39 [33-44] years) reporting sexual activity in the previous 12 months, 39% [min-max across HIV services: 25%-63%] were at risk of transmitting HIV. The final model showed that being a woman (adjusted Odd Ratio [95% Confidence Interval], p-value: 2.13 [1.60-2.82], p<0.001), not having an economic activity (1.34 [1.05-1.72], p = 0.019), having at least two sexual partners (2.45 [1.83-3.29], p<0.001), reporting disease symptoms at HIV diagnosis (1.38 [1.08-1.75], p = 0.011), delayed ART initiation (1.32 [1.02-1.71], p = 0.034) and not being ART treated (2.28 [1.48-3.49], p<0.001) were all associated with HIV transmission risk. Conversely, longer time since HIV diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of transmitting HIV (0.96 [0.92-0.99] per one-year increase, p = 0.024). Patients followed in the third profile had a higher risk of transmitting HIV (1.71 [1.05-2.79], p = 0.031) than those in the first profile.Healthcare supply constraints, including limited resources and ARV supply chain deficiency may impact HIV transmission risk. To reduce HIV incidence, HIV services need adequate resources to relieve healthcare supply-related barriers and provide suitable support activities throughout the continuum of care."
https://openalex.org/W4225680532,"Background There is limited knowledge about the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with cardiometabolic disorders in lean persons. This study examines the contribution of cardiometabolic disorders to NAFLD risk among lean individuals and compares to non-lean individuals. Methods We analyzed longitudinal data from 6,513 participants of a yearly voluntary routine health testing conducted at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. NAFLD was defined as hepatic ultrasound diagnosed fatty liver in individuals scoring below 8 on the alcohol use disorders identification test. Our main exposure variables were elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure (BP), presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD, defined as the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol) and physical inactivity (&lt;150 minutes/week of moderate activity). We further assessed the risk of NAFLD with elevations in waist circumference and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP). Results Over 15,580 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the incidence rate of NAFLD was 7.7 per 100 PY. In multivariate analysis adjusting for likely confounders, AD was associated with a 72% greater risk of NAFLD (IRR: 1.72 [95% CI:1.32–2.23]). Elevated blood glucose (IRR: 1.71 [95%CI: 1.29–2.28]) and physical inactivity (IRR: 1.46 [95%CI: 1.28–1.66]) were also independently associated with increased risk of NAFLD. In lean individuals, AD, elevated blood glucose and elevated BP were significantly associated with NAFLD although for elevated blood glucose, statistical significance was lost after adjusting for possible confounders. Physical inactivity and elevations in HsCRP were not associated with the risk of NAFLD in lean individuals only. Among lean (and non-lean) individuals, there was an independent association between progressively increasing waist circumference and NAFLD. Conclusion Cardiometabolic risk factors are independently associated with NAFLD. However, there are significant differences in the metabolic risk predictors of NAFLD between lean and non-lean individuals. Personalized cardiovascular disease risk stratification and appropriate preventive measures should be considered in both lean and non-lean individuals to prevent the development of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4225685407,"Direct interactions among species are only possible if there is some overlap in their geographical distributions. However, despite intense focus of macroecological research on species geographical ranges, relatively little theoretical and empirical work has been done on the evolution of range overlap. In this study we explore a simple model of range overlap based on a log-normal distribution of species range sizes along a one-dimensional domain, with or without absorbing boundary conditions. In particular, we focus on the mean and variance of range overlap distributions, as well as the topology of the resulting overlap networks with respect to their degree distribution, evenness, and betweenness scores. According to the model, there is an approximately linear relationship between many aspects of the distribution of range overlaps and their underlying species distributions, such as their mean and variance. However, the expected mean number of non-zero range overlaps for a given species varied from linear to convex depending on the variance of the underlying geographical range distribution. The expected topology of range overlap networks varied substantially depending on the mean and variance in the corresponding geographical distributions, particularly in the case of the degree and closeness distributions. Finally, we test the expectations of our model against five datasets of altitudinal distributions of Neotropical birds. We found strong departures from the expectations based on our model, which could potentially result from phylogenetic niche conservatism related to altitudinal gradients in environmental conditions, or from the asymmetric colonization of mountains by species from lowlands. Potential applications of range overlap networks to a variety of ecological and evolutionary phenomena are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4225920893,"Advances in Molecular Therapy have made gene editing through systemic or topical administration of reagents a feasible strategy to treat genetic diseases in a rational manner. Encapsulation of therapeutic agents in nanoparticles can improve intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents, provided that the nanoparticles are efficiently taken up within the target cells. In prior work we had established proof-of-principle that nanoparticles carrying gene editing reagents can mediate site-specific gene editing in fetal and adult animals in vivo that results in functional disease improvement in rodent models of β-thalassemia and cystic fibrosis. Modification of the surface of nanoparticles to include targeting molecules (e.g. antibodies) holds the promise of improving cellular uptake and specific cellular binding.To improve particle uptake for diseases of the airway, like cystic fibrosis, our group tested the impact of nanoparticle surface modification with cell surface marker antibodies on uptake in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Binding kinetics of antibodies (Podoplanin, Muc 1, Surfactant Protein C, and Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM)) were determined to select appropriate antibodies for cellular targeting. The best target-specific antibody among those screened was ICAM antibody. Surface conjugation of nanoparticles with antibodies against ICAM improved cellular uptake in bronchial epithelial cells up to 24-fold.This is a first demonstration of improved nanoparticle uptake in epithelial cells using conjugation of target specific antibodies. Improved binding, uptake or specificity of particles delivered systemically or to the luminal surface of the airway would potentially improve efficacy, reduce the necessary dose and thus safety of administered therapeutic agents. Incremental improvement in the efficacy and safety of particle-based therapeutic strategies may allow genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis to be cured on a fundamental genetic level before birth or shortly after birth."

Poor and marginalized populations are more vulnerable to the health, social and economic effects of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to know about the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 among poor and marginalized communities in central India and the factors associated with them so that effective risk communication messages can be designed and community engagement needs and strategies can be identified. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an Interactive Voice Response System as part of the NISHTHA-Swasthya Vani intervention, which is a platform for dissemination of key messages related to COVID-19, social welfare schemes, national health programs and other important information. A total of 1673 respondents participated in the survey. The mean knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the respondents was 4.06 (SD = 1.67) out of 8, 2.46 (SD = 1.18) out of 4 and 3.65 (SD = 0.73) out of 4 respectively. More than 50% respondents exhibited stigma towards recovered COVID-19 patients(n = 347) and towards health workers(n = 384) catering to COVID-19 patients. The factors associated with higher KAP scores were education, occupation, age and primary source of information on COVID-19. There was a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude (co-efficient: 0.32) and a negative correlation between knowledge and stigma (co-efficient: -0.28). The knowledge, and attitude scores related to COVID-19 were low among the poor and marginalized communities, while the prevalence of stigma was high. Therefore, there is a need for effective risk communication for these communities through alternate channels."

The aim of this study was to verify whether using a tight-fitting half-facepiece breath-response powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) in combination with a self-produced cooling device could abate the deep body temperature while performing activities. We conducted a crossover study involving 10 subjects. The subjects were subjected to three conditions: wearing a PAPR equipped with a cooling device, PAPR, or a replaceable particulate respirator. During the experiment, the rectal temperature of the subjects was measured, along with the temperature near the PAPR inlet in container with the cooling device when the PAPR equipped with the cooling device was worn. The subjects rested in a cold chamber set at a dry-bulb temperature of 28°C and relative humidity of 45% for 20 min. Then, they moved to a hot chamber set to a dry-bulb temperature of 36°C (with the same relative humidity) in 5 min and exercised on a cycle ergometer for 30 min. After that, the subjects moved to the cold chamber for 5 min and rested for 20 min. Notably, the air inhaled by the subjects wearing PAPR equipped with the cooling device was approximately 10°C cooler than the ambient air. Furthermore, 35 min after the initiation of the experiment (after the middle of the exercise period), the rectal temperature of the participants wearing the PAPR equipped with the cooling device was lower than of those wearing PAPR or replaceable particulate respirators (p <0.05). Thus, we could deduce that the self-produced cooling device was useful in abating deep body temperature. PAPR is useful for its potential applications in hot occupational environments and can save lives in working environments where heat stress can result in major medical complications."
https://openalex.org/W4226226535,"Temporal variations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness profoundly impact cellular behaviors, possibly more significantly than the influence of static stiffness. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures with tunable matrix stiffness have been utilized to characterize the mechanobiological interactions of elasticity-mediated cellular behaviors. Conventional studies usually perform static interrogations of elasticity at micro-scale resolution. While such studies are essential for investigations of cellular mechanotransduction, few tools are available for depicting the temporal dynamics of the stiffness of the cellular environment, especially for optically turbid millimeter-sized biomaterials. We present a single-element transducer shear wave (SW) elasticity imaging system that is applied to a millimeter-sized, ECM-based cell-laden hydrogel. The single-element ultrasound transducer is used both to generate SWs and to detect their arrival times after being reflected from the side boundaries of the sample. The sample's shear wave speed (SWS) is calculated by applying a time-of-flight algorithm to the reflected SWs. We use this noninvasive and technically straightforward approach to demonstrate that exposing 3D cancer cell cultures to X-ray irradiation induces a temporal change in the SWS. The proposed platform is appropriate for investigating in vitro how a group of cells remodels their surrounding matrix and how changes to their mechanical properties could affect the embedded cells in optically turbid millimeter-sized biomaterials."

However, it has not been explored whether any appropriate intervention in the cutaneous sensory input can augment the output motor performance, particularly in motor tasks such as jumping that involve the kinematic chain of the entire body. Using shoes with active vibrating insoles, we applied mechanical vibration to the soles of 20 young and healthy adults and evaluated the change in the jump height and muscle activation using within-participants repeated measures. The noise-like vibration having an amplitude of 130% of the sensory threshold of each participant led to an average increase of 0.38 cm in the jump height (p = 0.008) and activation of the rectus femoris of the dominant leg (p = 0.011). These results indicate that application of a properly designed cutaneous stimulus to the soles, the distal end effectors of motor tasks, can augment the output performance by involving the prime movers distant from the end effector."
https://openalex.org/W4226257471,"Retinoblastoma like protein-2 (Rbl2) is functionally regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. Previously, we demonstrated that lysine K1083 (K1079 in human Rbl2) is a potential target for acetylation but its functional role remains elusive. We investigated alterations in human Rbl2 gene specifically targeting exons 19-22 harbouring acetylatable residues i.e. K1072, K1083 and K1115 through single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) in breast cancer patients. The K1083 was found altered into arginine (R) in 51% of the cases but K1072 and K1115 remained conserved. The 'K1083R' mutation impairs the acetylation potential of this motif that may result in functional inactivation of Rbl2. These patients also showed poor survival outcome that highlights prognostic relevance of this residue. NIH3T3 cells expressing glutamine (K1083Q) mutated Rbl2 could not be arrested in G1 by serum starvation, whereas cells expressing Rbl2 with K1083R showed prolonged G1 arrest in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. This suggests that K1083 acetylation is important for G1/S transition. Further, we performed molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) to analyse kinetics of residue K1083 with Cyc-D1/CDK4. Mutations at K1083 impaired this binding exposing neighbouring residues S1080, P1081, S1082 and R1084, hence enhancing the possibility of accelerated phosphorylation. S1080 has previously been reported as a promising candidate of cell cycle dependent phosphorylation in Rbl2. This highlights significance of mutations in the pocket domain of Rbl2 gene in breast cancer, and also strengthen the supposition that K1083 acetylation is pre-requisite for its phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W4226495128,"Rising obesity rates have become a major public health concern within the United States. Understanding the systemic and neural effects of obesity is crucial in designing preventive and therapeutic measures. In previous studies, administration of a high fat diet has induced significant weight gain for mouse models of obesity. Interestingly, sex differences in high-fat diet-induced weight gain have been observed, with female mice gaining significantly less weight compared to male mice on the same high-fat diet. It has also been observed that consumption of a high-fat diet can increase neurogliosis, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still not fully understood. Recent research has suggested that the gut microbiome may mediate diet-induced glial activation. The current study aimed to (1) analyze changes to the gut microbiome following consumption of a high fat (HF) diet as well as antibiotic treatment, (2) evaluate hippocampal microgliosis and astrogliosis, and (3) identify sex differences within these responses. We administered a low fat (Research Diets D12450 K) or high fat diet (Research Diets D12451) to male and female C57Bl/6 mice for sixteen weeks. Mice received an antibiotic cocktail containing 0.5g/L of vancomycin, 1.0 g/L ampicillin, 1.0 g/L neomycin, and 1.0 g/L metronidazole in their drinking water during the last six weeks of the study and were compared to control mice receiving normal drinking water throughout the study. We observed a significant reduction in gut microbiome diversity for groups that received the antibiotic cocktail, as determined by Illumina next-generation sequencing. Male mice fed the HF diet (± antibiotics) had significantly greater body weights compared to all other groups. And, female mice fed the low fat (LF) diet and administered antibiotics revealed significantly decreased microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared to LF-fed females without antibiotics. Interestingly, male mice fed the LF diet and administered antibiotics revealed significantly increased microgliosis, but decreased astrogliosis, compared to LF-fed males without antibiotics. The observed sex differences in LF-fed mice given antibiotics brings forward questions about sex differences in nutrient metabolism, gut microbiome composition, and response to antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4224239141,"The project sought to understand the factors which underlie cultural transmission, adapting self-reported methods from cross-cultural psychology and sociology to test the external validity of several constructs from existing evolutionary models. The target population were native-foreigner mixed-couples, allowing the analyses to benefit from asymmetrical cultural inputs. Sampling took place in Italy and Portugal, with recruitment relying on social networks, online newspapers, friends, organizations, universities, parishes, and embassies. The questionnaire was personally delivered or filled online. The validated variables were: contact with a population in which the majority endorses the culture being acquired, the relative quantity of friends from that culture, the perceived relationship quality with the companion, affective ties with one's own family, and the desire and emotional components behind the culture-transmission motive (a concept similar to cultural conservatism). An unexpected strong, positive association between both cultural identities was found. Thus, it was suggested that these participants adopted an integrative orientation, allowing both cultural identities to blend, whereas most research so far focuses on assimilation scenarios. Overall, acculturation was driven by either conformity to the majority or random learning, without discarding the influence of preferred demonstrators, and the emotional bounds embedded in the individual's cultural identity. Acculturation proved to be flexible and potentially changing according to the cultural trait being examined."
https://openalex.org/W4225502775,"The incineration and burying of the soiled bedding of laboratory animals, as well as using detergents to treat their feces, is hazardous to the environment. This highlights the need for an alternative, environmentally friendly solution for the treatment of the waste of laboratory animal facilities. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ozone disinfection of the soiled bedding and feces of laboratory animals.Two grams of soiled beddings were randomly sampled from the cages of mice and rats. These samples were mixed in a beaker with 40ml saline. Ozone was piped into the beaker at a concentration of 500mg/h. Samples were taken from the beaker at time 0min, 30min, 45min and 60min after ozone treatment for microbiological culturing in an incubator for 48h. Colony form unit of each plate (CFU/plate) at each time point were counted, the mean CFU/plate at each time point after ozone treatment were compared with that present at time zero. Feces of rabbits and dogs were treated and pathogens were counted the similar way as that of bedding of the mice and rats; samples being taken at 0min, 15min, 30min, 45min and 60min.Pathogens were observed in beddings of both mice and rats as well as in feces of rabbits and dogs. Ozone treatment for 30min killed more than 93% of pathogens in the bedding of the two rodent species and 60min of treatment killed over 99% of pathogens. Treatment of rabbit and dog feces for 30min killed over 96% pathogens present, and 60min's treatment killed nearly all the pathogens. Both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens were sensitive to ozone treatment.Ozone treatment of bedding and feces is an effective and environment friendly way to deal with the waste of animal facilities, saving energy and potentially enabling their reuse as fertilizer."
https://openalex.org/W4225915917,"It is currently unknown why obesity leads in some patients to prediabetes and metabolic syndrome. Microinflammation potentially caused by extracellular DNA is supposed to be involved. The aim of this cross-sectional study in healthy mice was to analyze the association between plasma extracellular DNA and glucose metabolism. Fasting glycemia and insulin were measured in healthy adult female mice that subsequently underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Indices of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were calculated. DNA was isolated from plasma and quantified fluorometrically. Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity of plasma was measured using the single radial enzyme diffusion method. Fasting glycemia correlated negatively with both, extracellular DNA and DNase (r = -0.44 and r = -0.32, respectively). DNase was associated positively with the incremental area under curve (r = 0.35), while extracellular DNA correlated negatively with total area under curve of glycemia during oral glucose tolerance test (r = -0.34). Measures of insulin sensitivity were found to be associated with neither extracellular DNA, nor DNase. The hypothesis of an association of low DNase with increased fasting glucose was partially proved. Surprisingly, low extracellular DNA is associated with higher fasting glucose and lower glucose tolerance in mice. As novel therapeutic targets for prediabetes and metabolic syndrome are highly needed, this study provides novel unexpected associations within the limitations of the focus on physiological variability as it was conducted on healthy mice. The causality of these associations should be proved in further interventional experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4225919876,"We experimentally study the effectiveness of policy interventions in reducing the negative welfare effects of behavioral biases on job search. Due to quasi-hyperbolic discounting, individuals reduce their search effort and reservation wage, while the sunk-cost fallacy makes individuals decrease their reservation wage over the search spell. We compare the effects of search cost reduction and nudging. We find that search cost reduction increases the search effort and payoffs but not the reservation wage. Conversely, nudging increases the reservation wage, but not the search effort or payoffs. Both interventions reduce the impact of the sunk-cost fallacy on the reservation wage."
https://openalex.org/W4226020101,"This paper studies the increase in innovation concentration levels of U.S. industries over the last two decades. I present a model of imperfectly competitive patent market with heterogeneous firms that generate endogenous variable markups. Theoretically and empirically, the price of a firm’s newly invented knowledge, the profit and survival rate of the innovating firm depends on the market share of this firm’s knowledge stock and the position of industry in the knowledge network. In the process of innovating, firm pays a random fixed cost in each period which together with market share largely determines its decision on whether to innovate into different sectors. I find that firms with larger market share not only invest more in R&amp;D but also enter into more sectors. Since innovating firms could create blueprints for new varieties and manufacture the products that have been invented, I bridge the gap between the product and the R&amp;D markets to document the similar concentration trends between them. I prove that large firms in the product market would charge higher price on their product so that they can charge higher profit which is a part of the value of their knowledge. Lastly, the increasing trend of concentration could decrease consumers’ welfare in the industries with high initial concentration levels."
https://openalex.org/W4226180931,"The detailed electrophysiological characteristics of atrial fibrillation (AF) initiating non-pulmonary vein (PV) triggers excluding origins from the superior vena cava (SVC) and left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) (Non-PV-SVC-LAPW triggers) remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the detailed electrophysiological characteristics of non-PV-SVC-LAPW triggers.Among 446 AF ablation procedures at 2 institutions, patients with reproducible AF initiating non-PV-SVC-LAPW triggers were retrospectively enrolled. The trigger origin was mapped using the self-reference mapping technique. The following electrophysiological parameters were evaluated: the voltage during sinus rhythm and at the onset of AF at the earliest activation site, coupling interval of the trigger between the prior sinus rhythm and AF trigger, and voltage change ratio defined as the trigger voltage at the onset of AF divided by the sinus voltage.Detailed electrophysiological data were obtained at 28 triggers in 21 patients. The median trigger voltage at the onset of AF was 0.16mV and median trigger coupling interval 182msec. Normal sinus voltages (≧0.5mV) were observed at 16 triggers and low voltages (<0.5mV) at 12 triggers. The voltage change ratio was significantly lower for the normal sinus voltage than low sinus voltage (0.20 vs. 0.60, p = 0.002). The trigger coupling intervals were comparable between the normal sinus voltage and low sinus voltage (170ms vs. 185ms, p = 0.353).The trigger voltage at the onset of AF was low, regardless of whether the sinus voltage of the trigger was preserved or low."
