We sought to measure the impact of on-demand VR versus “health and wellness” television programming for pain in hospitalized patients. Methods We performed a prospective, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial in hospitalized patients with an average pain score of ≥3 out of 10 points. Patients in the experimental group received a library of 21 VR experiences administered using the Samsung Gear Oculus headset; control patients viewed specialized television programming to promote health and wellness. Clinical staff followed usual care; study interventions were not protocolized. The primary outcome was patient-reported pain using a numeric rating scale, as recorded by nursing staff during usual care. Pre- and post-intervention pain scores were compared immediately after initial treatment and after 48- and 72-hours. Results There were 120 subjects (61 VR; 59 control). The mean within-subject difference in immediate pre- and post-intervention pain scores was larger in the VR group (-1.72 points; SD 3.56) than in the control group (-0.46 points; SD 3.01); this difference was significant in favor of VR (P < .04). When limited to the subgroup of patients with severe baseline pain (≥7 points), the effect of VR was more pronounced vs. control (-3.04, SD 3.75 vs. -0.93, SD 2.16 points; P = .02). In regression analyses adjusting for pre-intervention pain, time, age, gender, and type of pain, VR yielded a .59 (P = .03) and .56 (P = .04) point incremental reduction in pain versus control during the 48- and 72-hour post-intervention periods, respectively. Conclusions VR significantly reduces pain versus an active control condition in hospitalized patients. VR is most effective for severe pain. Future trials should evaluate standardized order sets that interpose VR as an early non-drug option for analgesia."

https://openalex.org/W2968306050,"Effective conservation and restoration of estuarine wetlands require accurate maps of their historical and current extent, as well as estimated losses of these valued habitats. Existing coast-wide tidal wetland mapping does not explicitly map historical tidal wetlands that are now disconnected from the tides, which represent restoration opportunities; nor does it use water level models or high-resolution elevation data (e.g. lidar) to accurately identify current tidal wetlands. To better inform estuarine conservation and restoration, we generated new maps of current and historical tidal wetlands for the entire contiguous U.S. West Coast (Washington, Oregon, and California). The new maps are based on an Elevation-Based Estuary Extent Model (EBEEM) that combines lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) and water level models to establish the maximum historical extent of tidal wetlands, representing a major step forward in mapping accuracy for restoration planning and analysis of wetland loss. Building from this new base, we also developed an indirect method for mapping tidal wetland losses, and created maps of these losses for 55 estuaries on the West Coast (representing about 97% of historical West Coast vegetated tidal wetland area). Based on these new maps, we estimated that total historical estuary area for the West Coast is approximately 735,000 hectares (including vegetated and nonvegetated areas), and that about 85% of vegetated tidal wetlands have been lost from West Coast estuaries. Losses were highest for major river deltas. The new maps will help interested groups improve action plans for estuarine wetland habitat restoration and conservation, and will also provide a better baseline for understanding and predicting future changes with projected sea level rise."
https://openalex.org/W2967962604,"Metformin is a hypoglycaemic agent used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients, with a broad safety profile. Since previous epidemiological studies had shown that the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) decreased significantly in metformin treated DM2 patients, we hypothesised that intervention with metformin could reduce the risk of neoplastic transformation of hepatocytes. HCC is the most common primary liver malignancy and it generally originates in a background of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. In the present study, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse (TG221) characterized by microRNA-221 overexpression, with cirrhotic liver background induced by chronic administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This mouse model develops fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver tumours that become visible in 100% of mice at 5-6 months of age. Our results demonstrated that metformin intervention improves liver function, inhibits hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, reduces liver fibrosis, depletes lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, halts progression to decompensated cirrhosis and abrogates development HCC in CCl4 challenged transgenic mouse model. The study establishes the rationale for investigating metformin in cirrhotic patients regardless of concomitant DM2 status."
https://openalex.org/W2967836441,"ZFP42 zinc finger protein (REX1), a pluripotency marker in mouse pluripotent stem cells, has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several human cancers. However, the function of REX1 in cervical cancer remains unknown. Both IHC and western blot assays demonstrated that the expression of REX1 protein in cervical cancer tissue was much higher than that in normal cervical tissue. A xenograft assay showed that REX1 overexpression in SiHa and HeLa cells facilitated distant metastasis but did not significantly affect tumor formation in vivo. In addition, in vitro cell migration and invasion capabilities were also promoted by REX1. Mechanistically, REX1 overexpression induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating VIMENTIN and downregulating E-CADHERIN. Furthermore, the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway was activated in REX1-overexpressing cells, which also exhibited increased levels of p-STAT3 and p-JAK2, as well as downregulated expression of SOCS1, which is an inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and qChIP assays confirmed that REX1 trans-suppressed the expression of SOCS1 by binding to two specific regions of the SOCS1 promoter. Therefore, all our data suggest that REX1 overexpression could play a crucial role in the metastasis and invasion of cervical cancer by upregulating the activity of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by trans-suppressing SOCS1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2967849152,"Human tumors show altered patterns of protein isoforms that can be related to the dysregulation of messenger RNA alternative splicing also observed in transformed cells. Although somatic mutations in core spliceosome components and their associated factors have been described in some cases, almost nothing is known about the contribution of distorted epigenetic patterns to aberrant splicing. Herein, we show that the splicing RNA-binding protein CELF2 is targeted by promoter hypermethylation-associated transcriptional silencing in human cancer. Focusing on the context of breast cancer, we also demonstrate that CELF2 restoration has growth-inhibitory effects and that its epigenetic loss induces an aberrant downstream pattern of alternative splicing, affecting key genes in breast cancer biology such as the autophagy factor ULK1 and the apoptotic protein CARD10. Furthermore, the presence of CELF2 hypermethylation in the clinical setting is associated with shorter overall survival of the breast cancer patients carrying this epigenetic lesion."

https://openalex.org/W2967209644,"LSD1 (KDM1A) is a histone demethylase that plays both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in breast cancer. However, the exact contexts under which it plays these opposite functions remain largely elusive. By characterizing its role in luminal breast epithelial cells, here we show that inhibition of LSD1 by both genetic and pharmacological approaches increases their invasion and migration, whereas its inhibition by genetic approach, but not by pharmacological approach, impairs their proliferation/survival. Induced loss of LSD1 in luminal cells in a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, MMTV-PyMT, leads to a profound increase in lung metastasis. Mechanistically, LSD1 interacts with GATA3, a key luminal-specific transcription factor (TF), and their common target genes are highly related to breast cancer. LSD1 positively regulates GATA3 expression. It also represses expression of TRIM37, a breast epithelial oncogene encoding a histone H2A ubiquitin ligase, and ELF5, a key TF gene for luminal progenitors and alveolar luminal cells. LSD1-loss also leads to reduced expression of several cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., CDH1, VCL, CTNNA1), possibly via TRIM37-upregulation and subsequently TRIM37-mediated repression. Collectively, our data suggest LSD1 largely plays a tumor suppressor role in luminal breast cancer and the oncogenic program associated with LSD1-inhibition may be suppressed via TRIM37-inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2967707418,"Clinical applications of antiangiogenic agents profoundly affect tumor cell behaviors via the resultant hypoxia. To date, how the hypoxia regulates tumor cells remains unclear. Here, we show that hypoxia promotes the growth of human breast tumorigenic cells that repopulate tumors [tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs)] in vitro and in vivo. This stimulating effect is ascribed to hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activates Akt and NF-κB, dependent on the attenuated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We find that fumarate is accumulated in the TCA cycle of hypoxic TRCs, leading to glutathione succination, NADPH/NADP+ decrease, and an increase in ROS levels. Mechanistically, hypoxia-increased HIF-1α transcriptionally downregulates the expression of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), leading to TCA cycle attenuation and fumarate accumulation. These findings reveal that hypoxia-reprogrammed TCA cycle promotes human breast TRCs growth via a HIF-1α-downregulated PCK2 pathway, implying a need for a combination of an antiangiogenic therapy with an antioxidant modulator."
https://openalex.org/W2966985783,"Introduction Egypt’s National Road Project is a large infrastructure project which presently aims to upgrade 2500 kilometers of road networks as well as construct 4000 kilometers of new roads to meet today’s need. This leads to an increase in the number of work zones on highways and therefore a rise in hazardous traffic conditions. This is why highways agencies are shifting towards night construction in order to reduce the adverse traffic impacts on the public. Although many studies have investigated work zone crashes, only a few studies provide comparative analysis of the difference between nighttime and daytime work zone crashes. Methods Data from Egyptian long-term highway work zone projects between 2010 and 2016 are studied with respect to the difference in injury severity between nighttime and daytime crashes by using separate mixed logit models. Results The results indicate that significant differences exist between factors contributing to injury severity. Four variables are found significant only in the nighttime model and four other variables significant in the daytime model. The results show that older and male drivers, the number of lane closures, sidewise crashes, and rainy weather have opposite effects on injury severity in nighttime and daytime crashes. The findings presented in this paper could serve as an aid for transportation agencies in development of efficient measures to improve safety in work zones."
https://openalex.org/W2968327275,"Repeated exposure to blast overpressure remains a major cause of adverse health for military personnel who, as a consequence, are at a higher risk for neurodegenerative disease and suicide. Acute, early tracking of blast related effects holds the promise of rapid health assessment prior to onset of chronic problems. Current techniques used to determine blast-related effects rely upon reporting of symptomology similar to that of concussion and neurocognitive assessment relevant to operational decrement. Here, we describe the results of a cross sectional study with pared observations. The concentration of multiple TBI-related proteins was tested in serum collected within one hour of blast exposure as a quantitative and minimally invasive strategy to augment assessment of blast-exposure effects that are associated with concussion-like symptomology and reaction time decrements. We determined that median simple reaction time (SRT) was slowed in accordance with serum Nf-L, tau, Aβ-40, and Aβ-42 elevation after overpressure exposure. In contrast, median levels of serum GFAP decreased. Individual, inter-subject analysis revealed positive correlations between changes in Nf-L and GFAP, and in Aβ-40 compared to Aβ-42. The change in Nf-L was negatively associated with tau, Aβ-40, and Aβ-42. Participants reported experiencing headaches, dizziness and taking longer to think. Dizziness was associated with reaction time decrements, GFAP or NfL suppression, as well as Aβ peptide elevation. UCH-L1 elevation had a weak association with mTBI/concussion history. Multiplexed serum biomarker quantitation, coupled with reaction time assessment and symptomology determined before and after blast exposure, may serve as a platform for tracking adverse effects in the absence of a head wound or diagnosed concussion. We propose further evaluation of serum biomarkers, which are often associated with TBI, in the context of acute operational blast exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2967698866,"Deregulated expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is associated with various human diseases, including many types of cancer. Despite their growing links to cancer, there has been limited characterization of circRNAs in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the major cause of prostate cancer mortality. Here, through the analysis of an exome-capture RNA-seq dataset from 47 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples and ribodepletion and RNase R RNA-sequencing of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and cell models, we identified 13 circRNAs generated from the key prostate cancer driver gene-androgen receptor (AR). We validated and characterized the top four most abundant, clinically relevant AR circRNAs. Expression of these AR circRNAs was upregulated during castration-resistant progression of PDXs. The upregulation was not due to global increase of circRNA formation in these tumors. Instead, the levels of AR circRNAs correlated strongly with that of the linear AR transcripts (both AR and AR variants) in clinical samples and PDXs, indicating a transcriptional mechanism of regulation. In cultured cells, androgen suppressed the expression of these AR circRNAs and the linear AR transcripts, and the suppression was attenuated by an antiandrogen. Using nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation and RNA in-situ hybridization assays, we demonstrated predominant cytoplasmic localization of these AR circRNAs, indicating likely cytoplasmic functions. Overall, this is the first comprehensive characterization of circRNAs arising from the AR gene. With greater resistance to exoribonuclease compared to the linear AR transcripts and detectability of AR circRNAs in patient plasma, these AR circRNAs may serve as surrogate circulating markers for AR/AR-variant expression and castration-resistant prostate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2968133503,"Picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) are comparatively a new extension of fuzzy sets which describe the human opinions that has more answers like acceptance, rejection, neutral and desist, which cannot be correctly presented in fuzzy sets (FSs) and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). The PFSs are categorized by three objects, the degree of belonging, the degree of neutral belonging and the degree of non- belonging such that the total of these three degrees must not be more than one. So far, there is no such work presented in the literature which deals with unknown weights of criteria based on PFSs. In the present work, we have developed a linear programming (LP) model to find the exact weights from the given constraints of weights for the criteria and construct a modified distance based on similarity measure between picture fuzzy sets. Then we have utilized this similarity measure to achieve the best option in the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Lastly, two practical examples for the selection of alternatives are presented to compare the obtained results with the existing similarity measures."
https://openalex.org/W2967465319,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is currently complementing techniques to age-grade mosquitoes. NIRS classifies lab-reared and semi-field raised mosquitoes into < or ≥ 7 days old with an average accuracy of 80%, achieved by training a regression model using partial least squares (PLS) and interpreted as a binary classifier.We explore whether using an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis instead of PLS regression improves the current accuracy of NIRS models for age-grading malaria transmitting mosquitoes. We also explore if directly training a binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier improves the accuracy. A total of 786 and 870 NIR spectra collected from laboratory reared An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, respectively, were used and pre-processed according to previously published protocols. The ANN regression model scored root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.6 ± 0.2 for An. gambiae and 2.8 ± 0.2 for An. arabiensis; whereas the PLS regression model scored RMSE of 3.7 ± 0.2 for An. gambiae, and 4.5 ± 0.1 for An. arabiensis. When we interpreted regression models as binary classifiers, the accuracy of the ANN regression model was 93.7 ± 1.0% for An. gambiae, and 90.2 ± 1.7% for An. arabiensis; while PLS regression model scored the accuracy of 83.9 ± 2.3% for An. gambiae, and 80.3 ± 2.1% for An. arabiensis. We also find that a directly trained binary classifier yields higher age estimation accuracy than a regression model interpreted as a binary classifier. A directly trained ANN binary classifier scored an accuracy of 99.4 ± 1.0 for An. gambiae and 99.0 ± 0.6% for An. arabiensis; while a directly trained PLS binary classifier scored 93.6 ± 1.2% for An. gambiae and 88.7 ± 1.1% for An. arabiensis. We further tested the reproducibility of these results on different independent mosquito datasets. ANNs scored higher estimation accuracies than when the same age models are trained using PLS. Regardless of the model architecture, directly trained binary classifiers scored higher accuracies on classifying age of mosquitoes than regression models translated as binary classifiers.We recommend training models to estimate age of An. arabiensis and An. gambiae using ANN model architectures (especially for datasets with at least 70 mosquitoes per age group) and direct training of binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier."
https://openalex.org/W2967956480,"The glucose-responsive transcription factor carbohydrate response element–binding protein (ChREBP) critically promotes aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. It has been reported that ubiquitination may be important in the regulation of ChREBP protein levels and activities. However, the ChREBP-specific E3 ligase and molecular mechanism of ChREBP ubiquitination remains unclear. Using database exploration and expression analysis, we found here that levels of the E3 ligase SMURF2 (Smad-ubiquitination regulatory factor 2) negatively correlate with those of ChREBP in cancer tissues and cell lines. We observed that SMURF2 interacts with ChREBP and promotes ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway. Interestingly, ectopic SMURF2 expression not only decreased ChREBP levels but also reduced aerobic glycolysis, increased oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, SMURF2 knockdown increased aerobic glycolysis, decreased oxygen consumption, and enhanced cell proliferation in these cells, mostly because of increased ChREBP accumulation. Furthermore, we identified Ser/Thr kinase AKT as an upstream suppressor of SMURF2 that protects ChREBP from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Taken together, our results indicate that SMURF2 reduces aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation by promoting ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway in colorectal cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2968295221,"Background In 2013, Turkey introduced one-dose universal varicella vaccination (UVV) at 12 months of age. Inclusion of a second dose is being considered. Methods We developed a dynamic transmission model to evaluate three vaccination strategies: single dose at 12 months (1D) or second dose at either 18 months (2D-short) or 6 years of age (2D-long). Costs and utilization were age-stratified and separated into inpatient and outpatient costs for varicella and herpes zoster (HZ). We ran the model including and excluding HZ-related costs and impact of exogenous boosting. Results Five years post-introduction of UVV (1D), the projected varicella incidence rate decreases from 1,674 cases pre-vaccine to 80 cases/100,000 person-years. By 25 years, varicella incidence equilibrates at 39, 12, and 16 cases/100,000 person-years for 1D, 2D-short, and 2D-long strategies, respectively, using a highly effective vaccine. With or without including exogenous boosting impact and/or HZ-related costs and health benefits, the 1D strategy is least costly, but 2-dose strategies are cost-effective considering a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to the gross domestic product. The model predicted a modest increase in HZ burden during the first 20–30 years, after which time HZ incidence equilibrates at a lower rate than pre-vaccine. Conclusions Our findings support adding a second varicella vaccine dose in Turkey, as doing so is highly cost-effective across a wide range of assumptions regarding the burden associated with varicella and HZ disease."
https://openalex.org/W2968306640,"Bone metastatic prostate cancer provokes extensive osteogenesis by driving the recruitment and osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The resulting lesions greatly contribute to patient morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for defining how prostate metastases subvert the MSC-osteoblast differentiation program. To gain insights into this process we profiled the effects of co-culture of primary MSCs with validated bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line models. These analyses revealed a cast of shared differentially induced genes in MSC, including betaglycan, a co-receptor for TGFβ. Betaglycan has not been studied in the context of bone metastatic disease previously. Here we report that loss of betaglycan in MSC is sufficient to augment TGFβ signaling, proliferation and migration, and completely blocks the MSC-osteoblast differentiation program. Further, betaglycan was revealed as necessary for prostate cancer-induced osteogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, gene expression analysis revealed betaglycan controls the expression of a large repertoire of genes in MSCs, and that betaglycan loss provokes >60-fold increase in the expression of Wnt5a that plays important roles in stemness. In accord with the increased Wnt5a levels, there was a marked induction of canonical Wnt signaling in betaglycan ablated MSCs, and the addition of recombinant Wnt5a to MSCs was sufficient to impair osteogenic differentiation. Finally, the addition of Wnt5a neutralizing antibody was sufficient to induce the expression of osteogenic genes in betaglycan-ablated MSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest a betaglycan-Wnt5a circuit represents an attractive vulnerability to ameliorate prostate cancer-induced osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2969030407,"The emerging and increasing prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a significant public health challenge. To begin to tackle this problem, it will be critical to not only understand the origins of this resistance but also document environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. In this study we investigated the possibility that both colony and field caught mosquitoes could harbor antibiotic resistant bacteria. Specifically, we characterized the antibiotic resistant bacterial populations from colony-reared Aedes aegypti larvae and adults and two field caught mosquito species Coquillettidia perturbans and Ochlerotatus canadensis. The cultured bacterial populations were dominated by isolates belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria. Among the antibiotic resistant populations, we found bacteria resistant to carbenicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline, including bacteria resistant to a cocktail of all three antibiotics in combination. The antibiotic resistant bacteria were numerically rare, at most 5% of total cell counts. Isolates were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and clustering into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; 99% sequence identity). 27 antibiotic resistant OTUs were identified, although members of an OTU did not always share the same resistance profile. This suggests the clustering was either not sensitive enough to distinguish different bacteria taxa or different antibiotic resistant sub-populations exist within an OTU. Finally, the antibiotic selection opened up a niche to culture mosquito-associated fungi, and 10 fungal OTUs (28S rRNA gene sequencing) were identified. Two fungal OTUs both classified to the class Microbotryomycetes were commonly identified in the field-caught mosquitoes. Thus, in this study we demonstrate that antibiotic resistant bacteria and certain fungi are common and conserved mosquito microbiome members. These observations highlight the potential of invertebrates to serve as vehicles for the spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2967627151,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) related mortality and morbidity are high in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The pathophysiology of CVD in ESRD may involve non-traditional CVD risk factors, such as accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), dicarbonyls, endothelial dysfunction (ED) and low-grade inflammation (LGI). However, detailed data on the relation of AGEs and dicarbonyls with ED and LGI in ESRD are limited. Methods We examined cross-sectional Spearman’s rank correlations of AGEs and dicarbonyls with serum biomarkers of ED and LGI in 43 individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 not on dialysis (CKD5-ND). Free and protein-bound serum AGEs (N∈-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), N∈-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine (MG-H1)) and serum dicarbonyls (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone) were analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry, and tissue AGE accumulation was estimated by skin autofluorescence (SAF). Further, serum biomarkers of ED and LGI included sVCAM-1, sE-selectin, sP-selectin, sThrombomodulin, sICAM-1, sICAM-3, hs-CRP, SAA, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Results After adjustment for age, sex and diabetes status, protein-bound CML was positively correlated with sVCAM-1; free CEL with sVCAM-1 and sThrombomodulin; glyoxal with sThrombomodulin; and methylglyoxal with sVCAM-1 (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.36 to 0.44). In addition, free CML was positively correlated with SAA; protein-bound CML with IL-6; free CEL with hs-CRP, SAA and IL-6; free MG-H1 with SAA; protein-bound MG-H1 with IL-6; and MGO with hs-CRP and IL-6 (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.33 to 0.38). Additional adjustment for eGFR attenuated partial correlations of serum AGEs and serum dicarbonyls with biomarkers of ED and LGI. Conclusions In individuals with CKD5-ND, higher levels of serum AGEs and serum dicarbonyls were related to biomarkers of ED and LGI after adjustment for age, sex and diabetes mellitus. Correlations were attenuated by eGFR, suggesting that eGFR confounds and/or mediates the relation of serum AGEs and dicarbonyls with ED and LGI."
https://openalex.org/W2967412579,"Taxonomy is the cornerstone of extinction risk assessments. Currently, the IUCN Red List treats species complexes either under a single overarching species name—resulting in an unhelpfully broad circumscription and underestimated threat assessment that does not apply to any one species lineage—or omits them altogether—resulting in the omission of species that should be assessed. We argue that taxonomic uncertainty alone, as in species complexes, should be grounds for assessment as Data Deficient (DD). Yet, use of the DD category is currently discouraged, resulting in assessments based on poor data quality and dismissal of the importance of taxonomic confidence in conservation. This policy may be leading to volatile and unwarranted assessments of hundreds of species across the world, and needs to be revised. To illustrate this point, we here present a partial taxonomic revision of torrent frogs from eastern Madagascar in the Mantidactylus subgenus Hylobatrachus. Two named species, Mantidactylus (Hylobatrachus) lugubris and M. (H.) cowanii, and several undescribed candidate species are recognised, but the application of the available names has been somewhat ambiguous. In a recent re-assessment of its conservation status, M. (H.) lugubris was assessed including all complex members except M. (H.) cowanii within its distribution, giving it a status of Least Concern and distribution over most of eastern Madagascar. After describing two of the unnamed lineages as Mantidactylus (Hylobatrachus) atsimo sp. nov. (from southeastern Madagascar) and Mantidactylus (Hylobatrachus) petakorona sp. nov. (from the Marojejy Massif in northeastern Madagascar), we show that Mantidactylus (Hylobatrachus) lugubris is restricted to the central east of Madagascar, highlighting the inaccuracy of its current Red List assessment. We propose to re-assess its status under a more restrictive definition that omits well-defined candidate species, thus representing the actual species to which its assessment refers, to the best of current knowledge. We recommend that for species complexes in general, (1) nominal lineages that can be confidently restricted should be assessed under the strict definition, (2) non-nominal species-level lineages and ambiguous names should be prioritised for taxonomic research, and (3) ambiguous names should be assessed as DD to highlight the deficiency in data on their taxonomic status, which is an impediment to their conservation. This would reduce ambiguity and underestimation of threats involved in assessing species complexes, and place the appropriate emphasis on the importance of taxonomy in anchoring conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2969088588,"The apelin receptor (APLNR) is a GPCR involved in many pathophysiological processes; however, the correlation between APLNR expression and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been reported. In this study, we used cDNA microarray data to determine APLNR expression levels in NPC tissues. We found that APLNR expression was reduced in NPC tissues compared with noncancerous nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. Subsequently, a large-scale sample of 1015 tissues was used to validate this discovery and explore the relationship between APLNR expression and prognosis of NPC. Expression levels of APLNR in NPC tissues were indeed down-regulated. Furthermore, positive expression of APLNR in NPC predicted a better prognosis (disease-free survival: P = 0.001; overall survival: P < 0.001). Moreover, ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that an indirect interaction existed between APLNR and retinoic acid (RA) in the cancer regulatory network. Consistently, after treatment with all-trans-RA (ATRA), we found that APLNR was significantly up-regulated in NPC cell lines (5-8F and HNE1), and proliferation of NPC cells was inhibited. Cell cycle arrest occurred in the G0/G1 phase. In contrast, knockdown of APLNR diminished ATRA-induced growth inhibition of NPC cells. In addition, we surprisingly found that APLNR also played an important role in migration and invasion of NPC. Wound-healing and Transwell assays revealed that APLNR overexpression led to reduced migratory and invasive properties in 2 NPC cell lines. Western blot results revealed that hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were altered as well, suggesting that APLNR was capable of inhibiting EMT in NPC cells. Our study further demonstrated that low expression of APLNR promoted EMT in NPC cells by activating the PI3K-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that APLNR could potentially predict prognosis for patients with NPC and inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in nasopharyngeal cancer cells.-Liu, Y., Liu, Q., Chen, S., Liu, Y., Huang, Y., Chen, P., Li, X., Gao, G., Xu, K., Fan, S., Zeng, Z., Xiong, W., Tan, M., Li, G., Zhang, W.

We demonstrate that TLR9 and CD82 associate in macrophages, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-ER. Moreover, CD82 is essential for TLR9-dependent myddosome formation in response to CpG stimulation. Finally, CD82 modulates TLR9-dependent NF-κB nuclear translocation, which is critical for inflammatory cytokine production. To our knowledge, this is the first time a tetraspanin has been implicated as a key regulator of TLR signaling. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD82 is a specific regulator of TLR9 signaling, which may be critical in cancer immunotherapy approaches and coordinating the innate immune response to pathogens.-Khan, N.

https://openalex.org/W2967342593,"Background Despite the universal iodization of salt in Ethiopia, iodine deficiency disorder remains a major public health problem and continued to affect a large segment of the population. It is thus essential to assess factors contributing to the unacceptably high endemic goiter rate in the country and avail evidence for further additional interventions. In line with this, we examined the association of dietary pattern and iodine deficiency among school-age children in Ethiopia. Method We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study among 767 children aged 6 to 12 in southwest Ethiopia. We collected socio-demographic and other important health related information using a pre-tested structured questionnaire through the interview. Dietary pattern of children was measured using modified Hellen Keller’s food frequency questionnaire. We measured iodine deficiency using urinary iodine concentration level and total goiter rate, according to the World Health Organization threshold criteria. We used a multivariate linear regression model to identify dietary and sociodemographic factors that affect urinary iodine level among children. Result Out of the 767 children included in the study, 12% and 4% of children have grade 1 and grade 2 goiter respectively, making the total goiter rate 16%. While the prevalence of iodine deficiency based on urinary iodine concentration is 58.8% of which 13.7% had severe, 18.6% had moderate and 26.5% had mild form. The proportion of children who consumed godere/taro root/, banana, corn, Abyssinian cabbage, and potato, respectively at daily basis 57.8%, 53.1%, 37.9%, and 31.2%, respectively. Age (β = -0.7, 95%CI = -1.1, -0.4), sex (β = -22.3, 95%CI = -33.8, -10.8), consumption of taro root (β = -27.4, 95%CI = -22.9, -31.8), cabbage (β = -11.7, 95%CI = -5.7, -17.6), Abyssinian cabbage (β = 12.4, 95%CI = 6.7, 18.2), and banana (β = 5.6, 95%CI = 0.01, 11.2) significantly associated with urinary iodine level. Conclusion Iodine deficiency remains an important public health problem in southwest Ethiopia. Over-consumption of goitrogenic foods and under-consumption of iodine-rich foods were prevalent and associated with lower urinary iodine level. Therefore, dietary counseling apart from universal salt iodization is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2967805009,"Cystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR anion channel, many of which cause its misfolding and degradation. CFTR folding depends on the Hsc70 and Hsp70 chaperones and their co-chaperone DNAJA1, but Hsc70/Hsp70 is also involved in CFTR degradation. Here, we address how these opposing functions are balanced. DNAJA2 and DNAJA1 were both important for CFTR folding, however overexpressing DNAJA2 but not DNAJA1 enhanced CFTR degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum by Hsc70/Hsp70 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Excess Hsp70 also promoted CFTR degradation, but this occurred through the lysosomal pathway and required CHIP but not complex formation with HOP and Hsp90. Notably, the Hsp70 inhibitor MKT077 enhanced levels of mature CFTR and the most common disease variant ΔF508-CFTR, by slowing turnover and allowing delayed maturation, respectively. MKT077 also boosted the channel activity of ΔF508-CFTR when combined with the corrector compound VX809. Thus, the Hsp70 system is the major determinant of CFTR degradation, and its modulation can partially relieve the misfolding phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2968487504,"(-)-Oleocanthal (oleocanthal) is a phenolic compound found in varying concentrations in extra virgin olive oil oleocanthal has been shown to be active physiologically, benefiting several diseased states by conferring anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective benefits. Recently, we and other groups have demonstrated its specific and selective toxicity toward cancer cells; however, the mechanism leading to cancer cell death is still disputed. The current study demonstrates that oleocanthal, as well as naturally oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oils, induced damage to cancer cells’ lysosomes leading to cellular toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization following oleocanthal treatment in various cell lines was assayed via three complementary methods. Additionally, we found oleocanthal treatment reduced tumor burden and extended lifespan of mice engineered to develop pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Finally, following-up on numerous correlative studies demonstrating consumption of olive oil reduces cancer incidence and morbidity, we observed that extra virgin olive oils naturally rich in oleocanthal sharply reduced cancer cell viability and induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization while oleocanthal-poor oils did not. Our results are especially encouraging since tumor cells often have larger and more numerous lysosomes, making them especially vulnerable to lysosomotropic agents such as oleocanthal."
https://openalex.org/W2967367775,"This work aims at investigating the interactions between the flow of fluids in the eyes and the brain and their potential implications in structural and functional changes in the eyes of astronauts, a condition also known as spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). To this end, we propose a reduced (0-dimensional) mathematical model of fluid flow in the eyes and brain, which is embedded into a simplified whole-body circulation model. In particular, the model accounts for: (i) the flows of blood and aqueous humor in the eyes; (ii) the flows of blood, cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid in the brain; and (iii) their interactions. The model is used to simulate variations in intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure and blood flow due to microgravity conditions, which are thought to be critical factors in SANS. Specifically, the model predicts that both intracranial and intraocular pressures increase in microgravity, even though their respective trends may be different. In such conditions, ocular blood flow is predicted to decrease in the choroid and ciliary body circulations, whereas retinal circulation is found to be less susceptible to microgravity-induced alterations, owing to a purely mechanical component in perfusion control associated with the venous segments. These findings indicate that the particular anatomical architecture of venous drainage in the retina may be one of the reasons why most of the SANS alterations are not observed in the retina but, rather, in other vascular beds, particularly the choroid. Thus, clinical assessment of ocular venous function may be considered as a determinant SANS factor, for which astronauts could be screened on earth and in-flight."
https://openalex.org/W2968241575,"Threatened species are increasingly dependent on conservation investments for persistence and recovery. Information that resource managers could use to evaluate investments–such as the public benefits arising from alternative conservation designs–is typically scarce because conservation benefits arise outside of conventional markets. Moreover, existing studies that measure the public benefits of conserving threatened species often do not measure the benefits from partial gains in species abundance that fall short of official recovery, or the benefits from achieving gains in species abundance that happen earlier in time. We report on a stated preference choice experiment designed to quantify the non-market benefits for conservation investments aimed at threatened Pacific Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) along the Oregon Coast (OC). Our results show that a program aimed at increasing numbers of returning salmon can generate sizable benefits of up to $518 million/y for an extra 100,000 returning fish, even if the species is not officially declared recovered. Moreover, while conservation investment strategies expected to achieve relatively rapid results are likely to have higher up-front costs, our results show that the public attaches substantial additional value of up to $277 million/y for achieving conservation goals quickly. Our results and approach can be used to price natural capital investments that lead to gains in returning salmon, and as inputs to evaluations of the benefits and costs from alternative conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2968729795,"The iron status of blood donors is a subject of concern for blood establishments. The Finnish Red Cross Blood Service addresses iron loss in blood donors by proposing systematic iron supplementation for demographic at-risk donor groups. We measured blood count, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and acquired lifestyle and health information from 2200 blood donors of the FinDonor 10000 cohort. We used modern data analysis methods to estimate iron status and factors affecting it with a special focus on the effects of the blood service's iron supplementation policy. Low ferritin (< 15 μg/L), an indicator of low iron stores, was present in 20.6% of pre-menopausal women, 10.6% of post-menopausal women and 6% of men. Anemia co-occurred with iron deficiency more frequently in pre-menopausal women (21 out of 25 cases) than in men (3/6) or post-menopausal women (1/2). In multivariable regression analyses, lifestyle, dietary, and blood donation factors explained up to 38% of the variance in ferritin levels but only ~10% of the variance in sTfR levels. Days since previous donation were positively associated with ferritin levels in all groups while the number of donations during the past 2 years was negatively associated with ferritin levels in pre-menopausal women and men. FRCBS-provided iron supplementation was negatively associated with ferritin levels in men only. Relative importance analyses showed that donation activity accounted for most of the explained variance in ferritin levels while iron supplementation explained less than 1%. Variation in ferritin levels was not significantly associated with variation in self-reported health. Donation activity was the most important factor affecting blood donor iron levels, far ahead of e.g. red-meat consumption or iron supplementation. Importantly, self-reported health of donors with lower iron stores was not lower than self-reported health of donors with higher iron stores."
https://openalex.org/W2967402673,"Murine Astrovirus is one of the most prevalent viral agents in laboratory rodent facilities worldwide, but its influence on biomedical research results is poorly examined. Due to possible influence on research results and high seroprevalence rates in mice, it appears useful to include this virus into routine health monitoring programs. In order to establish exhaust air particle PCR as a reliable detection method for Murine Astrovirus infections in mice kept in individually ventilated cages (IVC) and compare the method to sentinel mice monitoring regarding reproducibility and detection limit, we conducted a study with defined Murine Astrovirus cage prevalence. In parallel, the efficacy of both detection strategies (soiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) and exhaust air dust (EAD) analysis) was tested for Myocoptes musculinus. The fur mite was used as a reference organism during the whole study period to ensure the validity of this method. Because some publications already demonstrated successful detection of several pathogens, including murine fur mite species, via EAP-PCR. Detection of Murine Astrovirus infections at low prevalence is possible with both methods tested. Detection by exhaust air particles (EAP) is faster, more sensitive and more reliable compared to soiled bedding sentinels (SBS). Exhaust air particle PCR also detected the reference organism Myocoptes musculinus, which was not detected at all by sentinel mice, not even by high sensitivity fur swab qPCR. In conclusion, Murine Astrovirus can be detected by both exhaust air particle PCR and soiled bedding sentinels. We recommend exhaust air particle PCR as the better detection technique for Murine Astrovirus, because it is more reliable. Environmental samples are the method of choice for detection of Myocoptes musculinus because relying on soiled bedding sentinels harbors a big risk of missing existing infestations."
https://openalex.org/W2968688156,"Neural networks are required to meet significant metabolic demands associated with performing sophisticated computational tasks in the brain. The necessity for efficient transmission of information imposes stringent constraints on the metabolic pathways that can be used for energy generation at the synapse, and thus low availability of energetic substrates can reduce the efficacy of synaptic function. Here we study the effects of energetic substrate availability on global neural network behavior and find that glucose alone can sustain excitatory neurotransmission required to generate high-frequency synchronous bursting that emerges in culture. In contrast, obligatory oxidative energetic substrates such as lactate and pyruvate are unable to substitute for glucose, indicating that processes involving glucose metabolism form the primary energy-generating pathways supporting coordinated network activity. Our experimental results are discussed in the context of the role that metabolism plays in supporting the performance of individual synapses, including the relative contributions from postsynaptic responses, astrocytes, and presynaptic vesicle cycling. We propose a simple computational model for our excitatory cultures that accurately captures the inability of metabolically compromised synapses to sustain synchronous bursting when extracellular glucose is depleted."
https://openalex.org/W2968302266,"Studying bacterial population diversity is important to understand healthcare associated infections' epidemiology and has a significant impact on dealing with multidrug resistant bacterial outbreaks. We characterised the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing K. pneumoniae (ESBLp KPN) population in our hospital using mini-MLST. Then we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare selected isolates belonging to the most prevalent melting types (MelTs) and the colonization/infection pair isolates collected from one patient to study the ESBLp KPN population's genetic diversity. A total of 922 ESBLp KPN isolates collected between 7/2016 and 5/2018 were divided into 38 MelTs using mini-MLST with only 6 MelTs forming 82.8% of all isolates. For WGS, 14 isolates from the most prominent MelTs collected in the monitored period and 10 isolates belonging to the same MelTs collected in our hospital in 2014 were randomly selected. Resistome, virulome and ST were MelT specific and stable over time. A maximum of 23 SNV per core genome and 58 SNV per core and accessory genome were found. To determine the SNV relatedness cut-off values, 22 isolates representing colonization/infection pair samples obtained from 11 different patients were analysed by WGS with a maximum of 22 SNV in the core genome and 40 SNV in the core and accessory genome within pairs. The mini-MLST showed its potential for real-time epidemiology in clinical practice. However, for outbreak evaluation in a low diversity bacterial population, mini-MLST should be combined with more sensitive methods like WGS. Our findings showed there were only minimal differences within the core and accessory genome in the low diversity hospital population and gene based SNV analysis does not have enough discriminatory power to differentiate isolate relatedness. Thus, intergenic regions and mobile elements should be incorporated into the analysis scheme to increase discriminatory power."
https://openalex.org/W2968761716,"Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) is a tumor suppressor gene deleted in many cancers, including angiosarcoma, an aggressive malignancy of endothelial cell derivation. DLC1-deficiency in primary endothelial cells causes the loss of cell contact inhibition of growth through incompletely defined mechanisms. We report that DLC1 is a regulator of YAP, a transcriptional coactivator of proliferation-promoting and tumor-promoting genes; when confluent, active/nuclear YAP was significantly more abundant in DLC1-deficient endothelial cells compared with control cells. We also found that YAP is a required effector of the loss of cell contact inhibition of growth manifested by DLC1-deficient endothelial cells, as the silencing of YAP prevents this loss. Consistently, human angiosarcomas specimens contained a significantly greater proportion of DLC1− tumor cells with nuclear YAP compared with the DLC1+ normal cells in the adjacent tissue. Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP, significantly reduced angiosarcoma growth in mice. These results identify YAP as a previously unrecognized effector of DLC1 deficiency-associated loss of cell contact growth inhibition in endothelial cells and a potential therapeutic target in angiosarcoma."

Currently, an appropriate instrument to assess cultural competence in clinical practice is limited. The present study aimed to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Nursing Cultural Competence Scale (NCCS) for clinical nurses. Methods Developing and assessing the scale was carried out in two phases: Phase I involved a qualitative research to explore the themes of nurses’ cultural competence and instrument development; Phase II established construct validity of the scale using a sample of 246 nurses in Taiwan. Data from the questionnaire were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Analysis results were used to determine the reliability and validity of the developed scale. Results The results showed four factors including cultural awareness ability, cultural action ability, cultural resources application ability, and self-learning cultural ability were generated by exploratory factor analysis, and these factors explained 62.0% of total variance. Cronbach’s α of the Nursing Cultural Competence Scale was .88, and test-retest reliability correlation was .70. Conclusions The establishment of the tool will facilitate accurate monitoring of the cultural competence among nurses and nursing managers, which can inform the construction of nursing policies aimed at pledge cultural competence expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2968611545,"The HIV envelope glycoprotein mediates virus entry into target cells by fusing the virus lipid envelope with the cell membrane. This process requires large-scale conformational changes of the fusion protein gp41. Current understanding of the mechanisms with which gp41 induces membrane merger is limited by the fact that the hydrophobic N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) and C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of the protein are challenging to characterize structurally in the lipid bilayer. Here we have expressed a gp41 construct that contains both termini, including the FP, the fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR), the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the TMD. These hydrophobic domains are linked together by a shortened water-soluble ectodomain. We reconstituted this gp41 into a virus-mimetic lipid membrane and conducted solid-state NMR experiments to probe the membrane-bound conformation and topology of the protein. 13C chemical shifts indicate that the C-terminal MPER-TMD is predominantly α-helical, whereas the N-terminal FP-FPPR exhibits β-sheet character. Water and lipid 1H polarization transfer to the protein revealed that the TMD is well-inserted into the lipid bilayer, whereas the FPPR and MPER are exposed to the membrane surface. Importantly, correlation signals between the FP-FPPR and the MPER are observed, providing evidence that the ectodomain is sufficiently collapsed to bring the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic domains into close proximity. These results support a hemifusion-like model of the short NC gp41 in which the ectodomain forms a partially folded hairpin that places the FPPR and MPER on the opposing surfaces of two lipid membranes."

Fifteen matched healthy subjects with measured plasma AAs served as controls.The best correlations of Alb were with tryptophan (Trp) and histidine (His) (r = + 0.53; p < 0.0001), and those of Hb were with histidine (r = +0.47) and Essential AAs (r = +0.47) (both p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, Trp (p< 0.0001) and His (p = 0.01) were shown to be the best positive predictors of Alb, whereas glutamine (p = 0.006) was the best positive predictor of Hb.The study shows that the majority of plasma AAs were positively correlated with Alb and Hb.

However, some low-acuity cases still receive an emergency ambulance dispatch following secondary triage. To date, no evidence exists identifying whether these cases required an emergency ambulance. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cases were appropriately referred for emergency ambulance dispatch following secondary telephone triage.A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of cases referred for emergency ambulance dispatch in Melbourne, Australia following secondary telephone triage between September 2009 and June 2012. Appropriateness was measured by assessing the frequency of advanced life support (ALS) treatment by paramedics, and paramedic transport to hospital.There were 23,696 cases included in this study. Overall, 54% of cases received paramedic treatment, which was similar to the state-wide rate for emergency ambulance cases (55.5%). All secondary telephone triage cases referred for emergency ambulance dispatch had transportation rates higher than all metropolitan emergency ambulance cases (82.2% versus 71.1%). Two-thirds of the cases that were transported were also treated by paramedics (66.5%), and 17.7% of cases were not transported to hospital by ambulance following paramedic assessment.Overall, the cases returned for emergency ambulance dispatch following secondary telephone triage were appropriate. Nevertheless, the paramedic treatment rates in particular indicate a considerable rate of overtriage requiring further investigation to optimize the efficacy of secondary telephone triage."
https://openalex.org/W2967205921,"In fungi, ergosterol is an essential component of the plasma membrane. Its biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA is the primary target of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. Here, we show that the pantothenate kinase Cab1p, which catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of pantothenic acid for CoA biosynthesis in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), significantly regulates the levels of sterol intermediates and the activities of ergosterol biosynthesis-targeting antifungals. Using genetic and pharmacological analyses, we show that altered pantothenate utilization dramatically alters the susceptibility of yeast cells to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors. Genome-wide transcription and MS-based analyses revealed that this regulation is mediated by changes both in the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes and in the levels of sterol intermediates. Consistent with these findings, drug interaction experiments indicated that inhibition of pantothenic acid utilization synergizes with the activity of the ergosterol molecule–targeting antifungal amphotericin B and antagonizes that of the ergosterol pathway–targeting antifungal drug terbinafine. Our finding that CoA metabolism controls ergosterol biosynthesis and susceptibility to antifungals could set the stage for the development of new strategies to manage fungal infections and to modulate the potency of current drugs against drug-sensitive and -resistant fungal pathogens.

In vitro pantothenate phosphorylation assays and MS analysis showed that α-PanAm is also phosphorylated by Cab1p and acts as a competitor of pantothenic acid at the enzyme catalytic site (9Chiu J.E.

In fungi, acetylation of CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetases generates acetyl-CoA, a key node in multiple metabolic and cellular processes, including the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes (Figure 1, Figure 2). Ergosterol serves fundamental cellular functions such as maintenance of membrane fluidity, permeability to nutrients and solutes, and response to environmental stresses (11Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D. White T.C. Overexpression or deletion of ergosterol biosynthesis genes alters doubling time, response to stress agents, and drug susceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.MBio. 2018; 9 (30042199): e01291-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway from acetyl-CoA involves 24 known Erg enzymes and can be divided into two main subpathways, the mevalonate route and the squalene-to-ergosterol route (also known as the distal ergosterol biosynthesis route) (11Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D. White T.C. Overexpression or deletion of ergosterol biosynthesis genes alters doubling time, response to stress agents, and drug susceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.MBio. 2018; 9 (30042199): e01291-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Figure 1, Figure 2). The mevalonate route produces farnesyl pyrophosphate, which in the ERG biosynthesis pathway serves as an intermediate in the synthesis of the triterpene (C30) squalene; whereas the distal route produces ergosterol from squalene and is the main target of allylamines, azoles, morpholines, and polyenes (Figure 1, Figure 2). Some of the ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes in the distal route can also catalyze alternative reactions to produce nonphysiological sterol intermediates, some of which have been shown to inhibit fungal growth (11Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D. White T.C. Overexpression or deletion of ergosterol biosynthesis genes alters doubling time, response to stress agents, and drug susceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.MBio. 2018; 9 (30042199): e01291-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This ability becomes relevant in cases of inhibition of enzymes in the pathway that causes accumulation of toxic steroidal substrates, which can then be metabolized through these alternative reactions. One of the first rate-limiting steps in the distal pathway is squalene oxygenation to form squalene epoxide catalyzed by squalene epoxidase, Erg1p. This enzyme is the target of the major allylamine-type antifungal drug terbinafine (12Ryder N.S. Terbinafine: mode of action and properties of the squalene epoxidase inhibition.Br. J.

Inhibition of Erg1p by terbinafine results in accumulation of squalene in the cell, which impairs fungal membrane function (13Carrillo-Muñoz A. Giusiano G. Ezkurra P.A. Quindós G.

Although ergosterol metabolism and inhibition have been studied extensively, the effect of pantothenic acid utilization and CoA metabolism on these processes remains completely unknown. Here, we report the first evidence for an important role of the CoA biosynthesis pathway and pantothenate phosphorylation in the regulation of ergosterol metabolism and yeast sensitivity to antifungals. We show that modulation of Cab1p activity results in altered sterol levels and dramatic changes in yeast susceptibility to drugs that target late enzymes in ergosterol biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that yeast cells altered in the uptake of pantothenic acid through the Fen2p transporter display reduced susceptibility to fenpropimorph, a morpholine-type antifungal, which targets the enzymes sterol C14-reductase (ERG24) and sterol C8-isomerase (ERG2) in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (6Stolz J.

This led us to investigate whether pantothenic acid utilization regulates ergosterol biosynthesis and yeast sensitivity to antifungals. The first step in pantothenic acid utilization is catalyzed by the pantothenate kinase Cab1p. In yeast, this step is essential for cell viability as knockout of the CAB1 gene results in cell death. Substitution of glycine 351 to serine in Cab1p results in a thermosensitive (ts) phenotype in which the yeast cells are unable to grow at 37 °C (8Olzhausen J. Schübbe S. Schüller H.J.

Biochemical analyses showed that the activity of the mutant Cab1G351Sp pantothenate kinase is only ∼7% that of the WT at 30 °C (Fig. 3B). The availability of the yeast cab1ts mutant strain made it possible to assess the effect of altered pantothenate kinase activity on yeast susceptibility to antifungals at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 3C, whereas the growth of the WT was inhibited by amorolfine, fluconazole, and terbinafine, the growth of the cab1ts mutant was not affected by these drugs. Conversely, with a sublethal dose of amphotericin B (1 μg/ml), the growth of the WT strain was only slightly inhibited, whereas that of the cab1ts mutant was reduced dramatically in the presence of the compound (Fig. 3C). MIC50 values for these drugs against the two yeast strains were obtained for cell growth in liquid YPD medium (2% Bacto Peptone, 2% d-(+)-glucose, and 1% yeast extract). According to these values, the WT strain was about 10× more susceptible to amorolfine, about 30× more susceptible to fluconazole, and about 150× more susceptible to terbinafine than the cab1ts strain. Conversely, cab1ts cells were about 5× more susceptible to amphotericin B than WT cells (Fig. 3D). To further investigate the link between pantothenate utilization and antifungal susceptibility, we examined the effect of inhibition of Cab1p activity on yeast susceptibility to terbinafine. Consistent with its defect in pantothenic acid utilization, the growth of the cab1ts mutant under permissive conditions was ameliorated with pantothenic acid supplementation as the times to mid-log phase were 48, 36, and 28 h for cells grown in media supplemented with 1, 10, and 100 μm pantothenic acid, respectively (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). Comparatively, the growth of the WT strain was not significantly altered by increasing concentrations of pantothenic acid as the times to mid-log phase were ∼26, 24, and 24 h at 1, 10, and 100 μm pantothenic acid, respectively (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). Interestingly, whereas the growth of the WT was dramatically decreased in media supplemented with 1 μm pantothenic acid in the presence of terbinafine (relative time to mid-log phase of 1.8 in the presence versus absence of the drug), the growth of the cab1ts mutant was only moderately affected by the drug (relative time to mid-log phase of 1.1 in the presence versus absence of the drug) (Fig. 4G). Addition of pantothenic acid to the culture medium at 10 or 100 μm resulted in higher sensitivity of both the WT (relative time to mid-log phase of 2.1 and 2.3 in the presence of 10 and 100 μm, respectively) and the cab1ts mutant (relative time to mid-log phase of 1.4 and 1.6 in the presence of 10 and 100 μm, respectively) to terbinafine (Fig. 4G). Because reduced activity of Cab1p in cab1ts cells correlated with reduced susceptibility to terbinafine, we reasoned that chemical inhibition of Cab1p activity and/or CoA biosynthesis in the WT could also result in reduced susceptibility to the drug. We therefore examined the susceptibility of the WT to terbinafine in the presence of the pantothenamide α-PanAm (9Chiu J.E. Thekkiniath J. Choi J.Y. Perrin B.A. Lawres L. Plummer M. Virji A.Z. Abraham A. Toh J.Y. Zandt M.V. Aly A.S.I. Voelker D.R. Mamoun C.B. The antimalarial activity of the pantothenamide α-PanAm is via inhibition of pantothenate phosphorylation.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (29079738): 1423410.1038/s41598-017-14074-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in the isobologram in Fig. 4H, terbinafine and α-PanAm displayed a typical drug–drug antagonism pattern in the WT, suggesting that inhibition of pantothenate utilization and CoA biosynthesis results in reduced susceptibility to terbinafine. Our studies also showed that the sensitivity of WT S. cerevisiae to amphotericin B depended on pantothenic acid availability. Whereas the growth rate of the WT strain was only moderately inhibited by 1 μg/ml amphotericin B in media supplemented with 100 μm pantothenic acid, it was significantly affected in media containing 1 μm pantothenic acid (relative time to mid-log phase of 2.1 in the presence versus absence of the drug) (Fig. 5, A, C, E, and G). Interestingly, the cab1ts mutant showed a much higher sensitivity to amphotericin B compared with the WT (Fig. 5, B, D, F, and G), indicating that reduced pantothenate kinase activity leads to increased sensitivity to this drug. Consistent with this phenotype, drug–drug interactions showed synergistic effects between amphotericin B and α-PanAm (Fig. 5H). To investigate the mechanism by which modulation of Cab1p activity alters yeast susceptibility to antifungals, we compared the levels of ergosterol, squalene, and other predominant sterol precursors by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) between WT and cab1ts strains under permissive conditions. Ergosterol comprised the largest percentage of total sterols in both WT and cab1ts cells followed by the open-chain sterol precursor squalene. All other sterols each comprised no more than ∼10% of total sterols (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, reduced pantothenate phosphorylation in the cab1ts mutant resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of squalene and lanosterol and a significant increase in ergosterol content. Consistent with these findings, supplementation of the growth medium of WT cells with 100 μg/ml squalene had only a slight effect on cell growth (mid-log phase reached at 28 h in the absence of squalene versus 34 h in the presence of squalene), whereas in the presence of terbinafine, the growth of WT cells was dramatically reduced (mid-log phase reached at 47 h in the absence of squalene versus 61 h in the presence of squalene) (Fig. 6, C and D). To determine whether the reduced level of squalene seen in the cab1ts mutant could also be due to changes in the transcription of the ERG1 gene or other genes in the ERG biosynthetic pathway, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on WT and cab1ts strains grown under permissive conditions (minimal medium supplemented with 100 μm pantothenic acid). Two high-quality mRNA samples were selected for RNA-Seq analysis from two independent replicates, and the expression of the CoA biosynthesis genes (CAB1–5), ergosterol biosynthesis genes (20 ERG genes), and the transcriptional factors UPC2 and ECM22 was examined (Fig. 7A). Of the 20 ERG genes analyzed, the expression of ERG1, ERG11, ERG28, and ERG2 was significantly induced in the cab1ts mutant compared with WT at 1.8-, 2.5-, 4.6-, and 2.4-fold, respectively (Fig. 7B). The ERG4 gene, a sterol reductase catalyzing the final step in ergosterol biosynthesis, was the only gene in the ERG biosynthesis pathway found to be down-regulated in the mutant, although not significantly. The expression of the transcriptional factors UPC2 and ECM22 was not significantly different between the WT and the cab1ts mutant (Fig. 7B). As a control, no significant differences between the WT and cab1ts strains could be detected in the expression levels of the housekeeping ACT1 gene (Fig. 7B). In this study, we provide the first evidence that changes in pantothenate phosphorylation, catalyzed by the pantothenate kinase Cab1p, control the metabolism of ergosterol and susceptibility of yeast cells to antifungal drugs. The CAB1 gene encodes the only pantothenate kinase in S. cerevisiae and is essential for cell viability. Other fungi, including all Candida spp., A. fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum, also express a single-copy gene encoding pantothenate kinase activity. Therefore, the encoded activity not only represents a promising new target in antifungal therapy but also a novel strategy to modulate the susceptibility of fungi to currently used antifungal drugs. We took advantage of the availability of a thermosensitive cab1ts strain, which expresses mutated Cab1p enzyme with a substitution of glycine 351 to serine, to examine the possible link between pantothenate utilization and both ergosterol metabolism and yeast susceptibility to antifungals. This amino acid substitution results in a dramatic decrease (>90%) in enzyme catalysis sufficient to allow cells to survive at 30 °C but not at 37 °C. Cell growth assays showed that at 30 °C the cab1ts mutant is less susceptible to the antifungal drugs terbinafine, amorolfine, and fluconazole (all of which inhibit enzymes in late ergosterol biosynthesis) and more susceptible to amphotericin B (a drug that acts by forming 1:1 adducts with ergosterol rather than acting as an enzyme inhibitor) than the wildtype strain. The reduced sensitivity of the cab1ts mutant to terbinafine was reversed in media supplemented with high concentrations of pantothenic acid. These data suggest that changes in the utilization of pantothenic acid to CoA through inhibition or activation of the pantothenate kinase modulate yeast sensitivity to antifungals that target ergosterol biosynthesis. This novel control mechanism was further investigated by mimicking the reduced pantothenate utilization activity of the cab1ts strain by treating WT cells with the pantothenate analog α-PanAm (9Chiu J.E.

Dis. 2017; 3 (28437604): 527-54110.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with the phenotype of the cab1ts mutant, treatment of WT cells with α-PanAm resulted in decreased susceptibility to terbinafine and increased susceptibility to amphotericin. To investigate the direct impact of pantothenate utilization on ergosterol metabolism, we compared sterol and gene expression levels between WT and cab1ts strains. Of all sterols and precursors analyzed, squalene and ergosterol were the most predominant in both strains with significantly different levels detected in the cab1ts mutant compared with the WT (Fig. 6). All other detected sterols, including lanosterol, T-MAS, fecosterol, lichesterol, episterol, ergosta-5,7-dien-3β-ol, and fungisterol, were present only in low quantities. Interestingly, the differences in squalene and ergosterol levels between the two strains were detected even though the cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μm pantothenic acid, which activates the metabolism of ergosterol and stimulates the growth of the cab1ts to levels similar to those found in the WT strain. Equally interestingly, transcriptional analysis revealed that the expression levels of several ERG genes were increased in the cab1ts mutant, including the ERG1 gene involved in squalene epoxidation. This suggests that the low steady-state levels of squalene in the mutant are due to both reduced metabolic input from the CoA biosynthesis pathway and increased squalene utilization by Erg1p, leading to reduced accumulation of this intermediate in the presence of terbinafine and consequently reduced sensitivity to the drug. This was further demonstrated in our studies as the susceptibility of WT cells to terbinafine was found to increase dramatically in the presence of excess squalene (Fig. 6C). Our studies have shown that, in addition to its reduced susceptibility to the squalene epoxidase inhibitor terbinafine, the cab1ts mutant also displays reduced susceptibility to amorolfine and fluconazole. Whereas fluconazole targets the Erg11p enzyme (a cytochrome P450 enzyme), amorolfine targets both the Erg24p and Erg2p enzymes, catalyzing double bond modifications in the sterol backbone. Consistent with the reduced susceptibility of cab1ts cells to amorolfine, the levels of lanosterol, the substrate of Erg11p, were significantly lower in the cab1ts mutant compared with the WT, whereas the tran"

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether movement asymmetries in riding horses in training are affected by anti-inflammatory treatment with meloxicam. In a crossover design, horses were treated with meloxicam or placebo for four days respectively, with a 14–16 day washout period between treatments. Objective movement analysis utilising body mounted accelerometers was performed on a hard and a soft surface before and on day four of each treatment. A trial mean was calculated for the differences between the two vertical displacement minima and maxima of head (HDmin, HDmax) and pelvis (PDmin, PDmax) per stride. Horses (n = 66) with trial mean asymmetries greater than 6 mm for HDmin or HDmax, or more than 3 mm for PDmin or PDmax, at baseline were included. The difference before and after each treatment in the measured movement asymmetry was assessed with linear mixed models. Treatment with meloxicam did not significantly affect the movement asymmetry in any of the models applied (all p>0.30). These results raise new questions: are the movement asymmetries in riding horses in training simply expressions of biological variation or are they related to pain/dysfunction that is non-responsive to meloxicam treatment?"

Methods This is a retrospective study where secondary data analysis was done on patient satisfaction data collected over three quarters for quality improvement purposes. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the data from the first quarter to identify the factor structure, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the rest of the data to confirm the EFA factor structure. A structural equation model (SEM) was fitted where the factors predicted overall satisfaction with the ED visit. Finally, measurement invariance was conducted to examine if patients and families perceived the factors related to ED services alike. Results Two factors were found to be predictive of satisfaction: clinical team and system processes. The SEM showed that system process was a statistically significant predictor of overall satisfaction, while clinical team predicted overall satisfaction to a smaller extent. Multi-group CFA showed that the factor structure fitted neither family nor patient groups adequately. The instrument did not exhibit partial invariance. Conclusion This study found that system process was the best predictor of overall satisfaction. Furthermore, this study showed that the same instrument might not reliably compare the perceptions of patients and families."

These kits enable bio-safe equipment-free concentration of sputum on filters and improved fluorescence microscopy at primary healthcare centres, ambient temperature transport of dried inactivated sputum filters to central laboratories and molecular detection of drug resistance by PCR and DNA sequencing (Mol-DST). In a 2-site evaluation (n = 1190 sputum specimens) on presumptive TB patients, BioFM-Filter smear exhibited a significant increase in positivity of 7% and 4% over ZN smear and LED-FM smear (p<0.05), respectively and an increment in smear grade status (1+ or 2+ to 3+) of 16% over ZN smear and 20% over LED-FM smear. The sensitivity of Mol-DST in presumptive MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases (n = 148) was 90% for Rifampicin (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-96%), 84% for Isoniazid (95% CI, 72-92%), 83% for Fluoroquinolones (95% CI, 66-93%) and 75% for Aminoglycosides (95% CI, 35-97%), using phenotypic DST as the reference standard. Test specificity was 88-93% and concordance was ~89-92% (κ value 0.8-0.9). The patient-friendly kits described here address several of the existing challenges and are designed to provide 'Universal Access' to rapid TB diagnosis, including drug-resistant disease. Their utility was demonstrated by application to sputum at 2 sites in India. Our findings pave the way for larger studies in different point-of-care settings, including high-density urban areas and remote geographical locations."
https://openalex.org/W2968081256,"Olfactory and trigeminal chemosensory systems reside in parallel within the mammalian nose. Psychophysical studies in people indicate that these two systems interact at a perceptual level. Trigeminal sensations of pungency mask odour perception, while olfactory stimuli can influence trigeminal signal processing tasks such as odour localization. While imaging studies indicate overlap in limbic and cortical somatosensory areas activated by nasal trigeminal and olfactory stimuli, there is also potential cross-talk at the level of the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb and trigeminal brainstem. Here we explored the influence of olfactory and trigeminal signaling in the nasal cavity. A forced choice water consumption paradigm was used to ascertain whether trigeminal and olfactory stimuli could influence behaviour in mice. Mice avoided water sources surrounded by both volatile TRPV1 (cyclohexanone) and TRPA1 (allyl isothiocyanate) irritants and the aversion to cyclohexanone was mitigated when combined with a pure odorant (rose fragrance, phenylethyl alcohol, PEA). To determine whether olfactory-trigeminal interactions within the nose could potentially account for this behavioural effect we recorded from single trigeminal sensory axons innervating the nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium using an isolated in vitro preparation. To circumvent non-specific effects of chemical stimuli, optical stimulation was used to excite olfactory sensory neurons in mice expressing channel-rhodopsin (ChR2) under the olfactory marker protein (OMP) promoter. Photoactivation of olfactory sensory neurons produced no modulation of axonal action potential conduction in individual trigeminal axons. Similarly, no evidence was found for collateral branching of trigeminal axon that might serve as a conduit for cross-talk between the olfactory and respiratory epithelium and olfactory dura mater. Using direct assessment of action potential activity in trigeminal axons we observed neither paracrine nor axon reflex mediated cross-talk between olfactory and trigeminal sensory systems in the rodent nasal cavity. Our current results suggest that olfactory sensory neurons exert minimal influence on trigeminal signals within the nasal cavity."

However, it is still unclear which process is prioritized when both are required. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine this question arising for one of the world’s most destructive agricultural pests, the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Transcripts from the ovaries and fat bodies of newly emerged locusts were analyzed, using RNA-seq based transcriptome and qualitative real-time PCR, at 4 h and 6 d after being infected with the gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus. Changes in the main biological pathways involved in reproduction and immunization were analyzed using bioinformatics. After 4 h of infection, 348 and 133 transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively, whereas 5699 and 44 transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively, at 6 d after infection. Moreover, KEGG analysis indicated that vital pathways related with immunity and reproduction, such as Insulin resistance, FoxO signaling, Lysosome, mTOR signaling, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways were up-regulated. Among the differentially expressed genes, 22 and 17 were related to immunity and reproduction, respectively. The expression levels of PPO1 and antimicrobial peptide defensin 3 were increased (log2FC = 5.93 and 6.75, respectively), whereas those of VgA and VgB were reduced (log2FC = -17.82 and -18.13, respectively). These results indicated that locust allocate energy and resources to maintain their own survival by increasing immune response when dealing with both immune and reproductive processes. The present study provides the first report of expression levels for genes related with reproduction and immunity in locusts, thereby providing a reference for future studies, as well as theoretical guidance for investigations of locust control."

High seeding years are seen as a threat to native and endangered species due to high predator density caused by the abundance of seed. An understanding of the molecular pathways that influence masting behaviour in plants could provide better prediction of a forthcoming masting season and enable conservation strategies to be deployed. The goal of this study was to identify candidate flowering genes that might be involved in regulating mast flowering. To achieve this, high-throughput large-scale RNA-sequencing was performed on two masting plant species, Celmisia lyallii (Asteraceae), and Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) to develop a reference transcriptome for functional and molecular analysis. An average total of 33 million 150 base-paired reads, for both species, were assembled using the Trinity pipeline, resulting in 151,803 and 348,649 transcripts respectively for C. lyallii and C. pallens. For both species, about 56% of the unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions to known proteins followed by Gene Ontology analysis, categorising them on the basis of putative biological processes, molecular function, and cellular localization. A total of 543 transcripts from C. lyallii and 470 transcripts from C. pallens were also mapped to unique flowering-time proteins identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting the conservation of the flowering network in these wild alpine plants growing in natural field conditions. Expression analysis of several selected homologous flowering-pathway genes showed seasonal and photoperiodic variations. These genes can further be analysed to understand why seasonal cues, such as the increasing photoperiod in spring, that triggers the annual flowering of most plants, are insufficient to always trigger flowering in masting plants and to uncover the molecular basis of how additional cues (such as temperature during the previous growing seasons) then determines flowering in mast years."
https://openalex.org/W2967795867,"Objective Organ radiation dose from a CT scan, calculated by CT dosimetry software, can be combined with cancer risk data to estimate cancer incidence resulting from CT exposure. We aim to determine to what extent the use of improved anatomical representation of the adult human body “phantom” in CT dosimetry software impacts estimates of radiation dose and cancer incidence, to inform comparison of past and future research. Methods We collected 20 adult cases for each of three CT protocols (abdomen/pelvis, chest and head) from each of five public hospitals (random sample) (January-April inclusive 2010) and three private clinics (self-report). Organ equivalent and effective dose were calculated using both ImPACT (mathematical phantom) and NCICT (voxelised phantom) software. Bland-Altman plots demonstrate agreement and Passing-Bablok regression reports systematic, proportional or random differences between results. We modelled the estimated lifetime attributable risk of cancer from a single exposure for each protocol, using age-sex specific risk-coefficients from the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report. Results For the majority of organs used in epidemiological studies of cancer incidence, the NCICT software (voxelised) provided higher dose estimates. Across the lifespan NCICT resulted in cancer estimates 2.9%-6.6% and 14.8%-16.3% higher in males and females (abdomen/pelvis) and 7.6%-19.7% and 12.9%-26.5% higher in males and females respectively (chest protocol). For the head protocol overall cancer estimates were lower for NCICT, but with greatest disparity, >30% at times. Conclusion When the results of previous studies estimating CT dose and cancer incidence are compared to more recent, or future, studies the dosimetry software must be considered. Any change in radiation dose or cancer risk may be attributable to the software and phantom used, rather than—or in addition to—changes in scanning practice. Studies using dosimetry software to estimate radiation dose should describe software comprehensively to facilitate comparison with past and future research."
https://openalex.org/W2966913934,"Transcriptome analyses show a surprisingly large proportion of the mammalian genome is transcribed; much more than can be accounted for by genes and introns alone. Most of this transcription is non-coding in nature and arises from intergenic regions, often overlapping known protein-coding genes in sense or antisense orientation. The functional relevance of this widespread transcription is unknown. Here we characterize a promoter responsible for initiation of an intergenic transcript located approximately 3.3 kb and 10.7 kb upstream of the adult-specific human β-globin genes. Mutational analyses in β-YAC transgenic mice show that alteration of intergenic promoter activity results in ablation of H3K4 di- and tri-methylation and H3 hyperacetylation extending over a 30 kb region immediately downstream of the initiation site, containing the adult δ- and β-globin genes. This results in dramatically decreased expression of the adult genes through position effect variegation in which the vast majority of definitive erythroid cells harbor inactive adult globin genes. In contrast, expression of the neighboring ε- and γ-globin genes is completely normal in embryonic erythroid cells, indicating a developmentally specific variegation of the adult domain. Our results demonstrate a role for intergenic non-coding RNA transcription in the propagation of histone modifications over chromatin domains and epigenetic control of β-like globin gene transcription during development."
https://openalex.org/W2967740474,"The ShangRing is a disposable, collar clamp circumcision device pre-qualified for use in men and boys 13 years and above. It has been shown to be faster than conventional circumcision with comparable adverse event (AE) rates and high client satisfaction. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in males. However, the fear of pain during circumcision is an important barrier to uptake. Use of topical anesthesia thus presents an opportunity to address this.We sought to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of the use of topical anaesthesia with ShangRing circumcision of men and boys 10 years of age and above.Participants were randomised 2:1 to receive topical or injectable anaesthesia. All participants underwent no-flip ShangRing circumcision. The primary outcome measure was pain. Secondary outcomes included ease of use of topical versus injectable anaesthesia, AEs and participant satisfaction.Compared to the topical group, participants in the injectable group reported significantly more pain on administration of the anesthesia and at approximately 20 minutes after the procedure. In the topical group, sufficient anaesthesia with topical cream was not achieved in 21 (9.3%) cases before the start of the procedure; in another 6 (2.6%), supplementary injectable anaesthesia was required as the circumcision was being carried out. The AE rate was significantly lower (p<0.01) in the topical (0%) vs. the injectable group (4.2%). The most common AE was pain during the post-operative period. All AEs were managed conservatively and resolved without sequeale. 96.7% of participants were satisfied with the appearance of the healed penis and 100% would recommend the ShangRing to others. All seven male circumcision providers involved in the study preferred topical to injectable anaesthesia.Our results demonstrate the safety, improved clinical experience, effectiveness, and acceptability of the use of topical anaesthesia in ShangRing circumcision using the no-flip technique. Topical anaesthesia effectively eliminates needlestick pain from the clients' VMMC experience and thus has the potential to increase demand for the service.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02390310."
https://openalex.org/W2968631148,"Although perianal fistulas occur commonly in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), evaluations of health services have been limited since no validated claims-based methods exist for identifying cases.To develop and validate accurate case definitions for perianal fistulas among pediatric patients with CD from administrative claims.Retrospective cohort study in which we developed and tested candidate case definitions for perianal fistula. Patients (age 5-21 years between 2005-2012) with CD enrolled in Michigan Medicaid with healthcare at University of Michigan were identified via claims. Medical records were obtained from all identified patients, whose entire records were abstracted. Medical record evidence for perianal fistula was considered the ""gold standard"" against which candidate case definitions were compared. The reference case definition of perianal fistula (ICD9 565.1) and candidate case definitions were evaluated.Of 843 patients identified via claims, 274 (33%) met CD criteria for inclusion. The true perianal fistula rate among CD patients was 18% (n = 49). The top-performing candidate case definition identified 15% (n = 42), had sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity of 98.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 90.5%, negative predictive value (NPV) 95.3%, and area under receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.88. In contrast, the reference case definition identified 9% (n = 26), sensitivity 51.0%, specificity 99.6%, PPV 96.2%, NPV 90.3%, and had an area under ROC of 0.75.We demonstrated that it is feasible to use administrative claims data to accurately identify pediatric patients with perianal fistula complications. Claims-based case definitions were found to be highly accurate through medical record review, providing a high degree of confidence for future studies where chart review is not feasible. These claims-based methods can be applied to claims data in other settings for the evaluation of health services utilization as well as to assess the comparative effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2967713326,"Rarebit is a simple and user-friendly perimetry that tests the visual field by using tiny supra-threshold dot stimuli. It appears to be especially useful for examining the visual field of children who are under 12 years of age. However, previous data showed that the number of errors was higher in children than adults. We ask whether the different number of errors in these two groups depended on task learning and whether it may be accounted for by sensitivity differences or a response bias. Thirty-one children between 9 and 12 years of age and thirty-nine adults were tested three times with Rarebit perimetry. A bias-free sensitivity index, d', rather than the simple hit rate, revealed a group difference that remained after extensive task repetition. Indeed, d' increased with task learning in a similar way in the two groups so that group difference remained after practice. The response bias differed in the two groups, being conservative in the older group (criterion C >0) and liberal in the younger (criterion C < 0). Both biases disappeared with task learning in the third session, suggesting that response bias cannot account for the group difference in sensitivity after practice. When bias-free measures of sensitivity are used and task learning effects are minimized, Rarebit perimetry may be a more valuable method than simple mean hit rate (MHR) to enlighten sensitivity differences in the visual field assessment within the pediatric population."
