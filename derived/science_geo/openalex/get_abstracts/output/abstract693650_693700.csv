https://openalex.org/W4280650748,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage) variants possessing numerous mutations has raised concerns of decreased effectiveness of current vaccines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs for COVID-19 against these variants1,2. The original Omicron lineage, BA.1, prevailed in many countries, but more recently, BA.2 has become dominant in at least 68 countries3. Here we evaluated the replicative ability and pathogenicity of authentic infectious BA.2 isolates in immunocompetent and human ACE2-expressing mice and hamsters. In contrast to recent data with chimeric, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strains expressing the spike proteins of BA.1 and BA.2 on an ancestral WK-521 backbone4, we observed similar infectivity and pathogenicity in mice and hamsters for BA.2 and BA.1, and less pathogenicity compared with early SARS-CoV-2 strains. We also observed a marked and significant reduction in the neutralizing activity of plasma from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and vaccine recipients against BA.2 compared to ancestral and Delta variant strains. In addition, we found that some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (REGN10987 plus REGN10933, COV2-2196 plus COV2-2130, and S309) and antiviral drugs (molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and S-217622) can restrict viral infection in the respiratory organs of BA.2-infected hamsters. These findings suggest that the replication and pathogenicity of BA.2 is similar to that of BA.1 in rodents and that several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antiviral compounds are effective against Omicron BA.2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4280516745,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with the worst prognosis and few effective therapies. Here we identified MS023, an inhibitor of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), which has antitumor growth activity in TNBC. Pathway analysis of TNBC cell lines indicates that the activation of interferon responses before and after MS023 treatment is a functional biomarker and determinant of response, and these observations extend to a panel of human-derived organoids. Inhibition of type I PRMT triggers an interferon response through the antiviral defense pathway with the induction of double-stranded RNA, which is derived, at least in part, from inverted repeat Alu elements. Together, our results represent a shift in understanding the antitumor mechanism of type I PRMT inhibitors and provide a rationale and biomarker approach for the clinical development of type I PRMT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4280505354,"We propose a simple framework-meta-matching-to translate predictive models from large-scale datasets to new unseen non-brain-imaging phenotypes in small-scale studies. The key consideration is that a unique phenotype from a boutique study likely correlates with (but is not the same as) related phenotypes in some large-scale dataset. Meta-matching exploits these correlations to boost prediction in the boutique study. We apply meta-matching to predict non-brain-imaging phenotypes from resting-state functional connectivity. Using the UK Biobank (N = 36,848) and Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,019) datasets, we demonstrate that meta-matching can greatly boost the prediction of new phenotypes in small independent datasets in many scenarios. For example, translating a UK Biobank model to 100 HCP participants yields an eight-fold improvement in variance explained with an average absolute gain of 4.0% (minimum = -0.2%, maximum = 16.0%) across 35 phenotypes. With a growing number of large-scale datasets collecting increasingly diverse phenotypes, our results represent a lower bound on the potential of meta-matching."
https://openalex.org/W4280500609,"Tuft cells are a rare chemosensory lineage that coordinates immune and neural responses to foreign pathogens in mucosal tissues1. Recent studies have also revealed tuft-cell-like human tumours2,3, particularly as a variant of small-cell lung cancer. Both normal and neoplastic tuft cells share a genetic requirement for the transcription factor POU2F3 (refs. 2,4), although the transcriptional mechanisms that generate this cell type are poorly understood. Here we show that binding of POU2F3 to the uncharacterized proteins C11orf53 and COLCA2 (renamed here OCA-T1/POU2AF2 and OCA-T2/POU2AF3, respectively) is critical in the tuft cell lineage. OCA-T1 and OCA-T2 are paralogues of the B-cell-specific coactivator OCA-B; all three proteins are encoded in a gene cluster and contain a conserved peptide that binds to class II POU transcription factors and a DNA octamer motif in a bivalent manner. We demonstrate that binding between POU2F3 and OCA-T1 or OCA-T2 is essential in tuft-cell-like small-cell lung cancer. Moreover, we generated OCA-T1-deficient mice, which are viable but lack tuft cells in several mucosal tissues. These findings reveal that the POU2F3-OCA-T complex is the master regulator of tuft cell identity and a molecular vulnerability of tuft-cell-like small-cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4280515860,"Estimating the basic reproduction number of a pandemic and the changes that appear on this value over time provide a good understanding of the contagious nature of the virus and efficiency of the controlling strategies. In this paper, we focus on studying the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for two important variants of COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: Alpha and Delta variants. We use four different methods, three statistical models and one mathematical model, to compute R 0 : Exponential Growth Rate (EGR), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Sequential Bayesian (SB), and time-dependent SIR model. Alpha variant of COVID-19 was active in Iran from March 10, 2021 until June 10, 2021. Our computations indicate that total R 0 of this variant according to EGR, ML, SB, and SIR model is respectively 0.9999 (95% CI: 0.9994-1), 1.046 (95% CI: 1.044-1.049), 1.06 (95% CI: 1.03-1.08), and 2.79 (95% CI: 2.77-2.81) in the whole active time interval. Moreover, during the time interval from April 3, 2021 to April 9, 2021 in which this variant was in its exponential growth in Iran, R 0 of Alpha variant in Iran according to SB, EGR, ML, and SIR model is respectively 2.26 (95% CI: 2.04-2.49), 2.64 (95% CI: 2.58-2.7), 11.38 (95% CI: 11.28-11.48), and 12.13 (95% CI: 12.12-12.14). Delta variant was active in Iran during the time interval from June 22, 2021 until September 22, 2021. Our computations show that during the time interval from July 3, 2021 to July 8, 2021 in which this variant was in its exponential growth in Iran, R 0 of Delta variant in Iran according to SB, EGR, ML, and SIR model is respectively 3 (95% CI: 2.34-3.66), 3.1 (95% CI: 3.02-3.17), 12 (95% CI: 11.89-12.12), and 23.3 (95% CI: 23.19-23.41). Further, total R 0 of Delta variant in Iran in the whole active time interval according to EGR, ML, SB, and SIR model is respectively 1.042 (95% CI: 1.04-1.043), 1.053 (95% CI: 1.051-1.055), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.95), and 5.65 (95% CI: 5.6-5.7). As the results show Delta variant was more severe than Alpha variant in Iran. Chasing the changes in R 0 during each variant shows that the controlling strategies applied were effective in controlling the virus spread."
https://openalex.org/W4280536523,"The timely identification of patients who are at risk of a mental health crisis can lead to improved outcomes and to the mitigation of burdens and costs. However, the high prevalence of mental health problems means that the manual review of complex patient records to make proactive care decisions is not feasible in practice. Therefore, we developed a machine learning model that uses electronic health records to continuously monitor patients for risk of a mental health crisis over a period of 28 days. The model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.797 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.159, predicting crises with a sensitivity of 58% at a specificity of 85%. A follow-up 6-month prospective study evaluated our algorithm's use in clinical practice and observed predictions to be clinically valuable in terms of either managing caseloads or mitigating the risk of crisis in 64% of cases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to continuously predict the risk of a wide range of mental health crises and to explore the added value of such predictions in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4280560954,"To understand how the cerebellar cortex transforms mossy fiber (MF) inputs into Purkinje cell (PC) outputs, it is vital to delineate the elements of this circuit. Candelabrum cells (CCs) are enigmatic interneurons of the cerebellar cortex that have been identified based on their morphology, but their electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections and function remain unknown. Here, we clarify these properties using electrophysiology, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization and serial electron microscopy in mice. We find that CCs are the most abundant PC layer interneuron. They are GABAergic, molecularly distinct and present in all cerebellar lobules. Their high resistance renders CC firing highly sensitive to synaptic inputs. CCs are excited by MFs and granule cells and are strongly inhibited by PCs. CCs in turn primarily inhibit molecular layer interneurons, which leads to PC disinhibition. Thus, inputs, outputs and local signals converge onto CCs to allow them to assume a unique role in controlling cerebellar output. Candelabrum cells have remained an obscure cerebellar cell type. The authors show that candelabrum cells are the most abundant Purkinje layer interneuron, are molecularly distinct and have a connectivity that allows them to control cerebellar output."
https://openalex.org/W4280574087,"Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of nicotine patches, is commonly offered to pregnant women who smoke to help them to stop smoking, but this approach has limited efficacy in this population. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are also used by pregnant women who smoke but their safety and efficacy in pregnancy are unknown. Here, we report the results of a randomized controlled trial in 1,140 participants comparing refillable e-cigarettes with nicotine patches. Pregnant women who smoked were randomized to e-cigarettes (n = 569) or nicotine patches (n = 571). In the unadjusted analysis of the primary outcome, validated prolonged quit rates at the end of pregnancy in the two study arms were not significantly different (6.8% versus 4.4% in the e-cigarette and patch arms, respectively; relative risk (RR) = 1.55, 95%CI: 0.95-2.53, P = 0.08). However, some participants in the nicotine patch group also used e-cigarettes during the study. In a pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding abstinent participants who used non-allocated products, e-cigarettes were more effective than patches (6.8% versus 3.6%; RR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.14-3.26, P = 0.02). Safety outcomes included adverse events and maternal and birth outcomes. The safety profile was found to be similar for both study products, however, low birthweight (<2,500 g) was less frequent in the e-cigarette arm (14.8% versus 9.6%; RR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.47-0.90, P = 0.01). Other adverse events and birth outcomes were similar in the two study arms. E-cigarettes might help women who are pregnant to stop smoking, and their safety for use in pregnancy is similar to that of nicotine patches. ISRCTN62025374."
https://openalex.org/W4280577818,"The radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is known as the world's toughest bacterium. The S-layer of D. radiodurans, consisting of several proteins on the surface of the cellular envelope and intimately associated with the outer membrane, has therefore been useful as a model for structural and functional studies. Its main proteinaceous unit, the S-layer deinoxanthin-binding complex (SDBC), is a hetero-oligomeric assembly known to contribute to the resistance against environmental stress and have porin functional features; however, its precise structure is unknown. Here, we resolved the structure of the SDBC at ∼2.5 Å resolution by cryo-EM and assigned the sequence of its main subunit, the protein DR_2577. This structure is characterized by a pore region, a massive β-barrel organization, a stalk region consisting of a trimeric coiled coil, and a collar region at the base of the stalk. We show that each monomer binds three Cu ions and one Fe ion and retains one deinoxanthin molecule and two phosphoglycolipids, all exclusive to D. radiodurans. Finally, electrophysiological characterization of the SDBC shows that it exhibits transport properties with several amino acids. Taken together, these results highlight the SDBC as a robust structure displaying both protection and sieving functions that facilitates exchanges with the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4280515880,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a serine/threonine kinase complex that promotes anabolic processes including protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis, while suppressing catabolic processes such as macroautophagy. mTORC1 activity is regulated by growth factors and amino acids, which signal through distinct but integrated molecular pathways: growth factors largely signal through the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway, whereas the availabilities of amino acids leucine and arginine are communicated to mTORC1 by the Rag-GTPase pathway. While it is relatively well described how acute changes in leucine and arginine levels affect mTORC1 signaling, the effects of prolonged amino acid deprivation remain less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged deprivation of arginine and/or leucine leads to reactivation of mTORC1 activity, which reaches activation levels similar to those observed in nutrient-rich conditions. Surprisingly, we find that this reactivation is independent of the regeneration of amino acids by canonical autophagy or proteasomal degradation but is dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling. Together, our data identify a novel crosstalk between the amino acid and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways upstream of mTORC1. These observations extend our understanding of the role of mTORC1 in growth-related diseases and indicate that dietary intervention by removal of leucine and/or arginine may be an ineffective therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W4280568486,"Drought stress seriously affects tomato growth, yield and quality. Previous reports have pointed out that melatonin (MT) can alleviate drought stress damage to tomato. To better understand the possible physiological and molecular mechanisms, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf transcriptome profiles were analyzed in the ""Micro Tom"" tomato cultivar with or without melatonin irrigation under normal and drought conditions. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) simulated continuous drought treatment reduced plant height, but melatonin treatment improved plant growth rate. Physiological parameter measurements revealed that the drought-induced decreases in maximum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, the effective quantum yield of PSII, electron transfer rate, and photochemical quenching value caused by PEG6000 treatment were alleviated by melatonin treatment, which suggests a protective effect of melatonin on PSII. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 447, 3982, 4526 and 3258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparative groups plus-melatonin vs. minus-melatonin (no drought), drought vs. no drought (minus-melatonin), drought vs. no drought (melatonin) and plus-melatonin vs. minus-melatonin (drought), respectively. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that DEGs in the four comparative groups were involved in multiple metabolic processes and closely related to hormone signal transduction and transcription factors. Transcriptome data revealed that melatonin changed the expression pattern of most hormone signal transduction related DEGs induced by drought, and improved plant drought resistance by down-regulating the expression of linoleic acid catabolic enzyme genes. These results provide new insights into a probable mechanism of the melatonin-induced protection of photosynthesis and enhancement of drought tolerance in tomato plants."
https://openalex.org/W4280490512,"Freshwater ecosystems host disproportionately high numbers of species relative to their surface area yet are poorly protected globally. We used data on the distribution of 1631 species of aquatic plant, mollusc, odonate and fish in 18,816 river and lake catchments in Europe to establish spatial conservation priorities based on the occurrence of threatened, range-restricted and endemic species using the Marxan systematic conservation planning tool. We found that priorities were highest for rivers and ancient lakes in S Europe, large rivers and lakes in E and N Europe, smaller lakes in NW Europe and karst/limestone areas in the Balkans, S France and central Europe. The a priori inclusion of well-protected catchments resulted in geographically more balanced priorities and better coverage of threatened (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable) species. The a priori exclusion of well-protected catchments showed that priority areas that need further conservation interventions are in S and E Europe. We developed three ways to evaluate the correspondence between conservation priority and current protection by assessing whether a cathment has more (or less) priority given its protection level relative to all other catchments. Each method found that priority relative to protection was high in S and E Europe and generally low in NW Europe. The inclusion of hydrological connectivity had little influence on these patterns but decreased the coverage of threatened species, indicating a trade-off between connectivity and conservation of threatened species. Our results suggest that catchments in S and E Europe need urgent conservation attention (protected areas, restoration, management, species protection) in the face of imminent threats such as river regulation, dam construction, hydropower development and climate change. Our study presents continental-scale conservation priorities for freshwater ecosystems in ecologically meaningful planning units and will thus be important in freshwater biodiversity conservation policy and practice, and water management in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W4280530238,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to there being a worldwide socio-economic crisis, with major impacts on developing countries. Understanding the dynamics of the disease and its driving factors, on a small spatial scale, might support strategies to control infections. This paper explores the impact of the COVID-19 on neighborhoods of Recife, Brazil, for which we examine a set of drivers that combines socio-economic factors and the presence of non-stop services. A three-stage methodology was conducted by conducting a statistical and spatial analysis, including clusters and regression models. COVID-19 data were investigated concerning ten dates between April and July 2020. Hotspots of the most affected regions and their determinant effects were highlighted. We have identified that clusters of confirmed cases were carried from a well-developed neighborhood to socially deprived areas, along with the emergence of hotspots of the case-fatality rate. The influence of age-groups, income, level of education, and the access to essential services on the spread of COVID-19 was also verified. The recognition of variables that influence the spatial spread of the disease becomes vital for pinpointing the most vulnerable areas. Consequently, specific prevention actions can be developed for these places, especially in heterogeneous cities."
https://openalex.org/W4280515189,"Physio-anatomical modifications and elemental distribution pattern in Acanthus ilicifolius subjected to Zn stress were analysed in this study. Survival of A . ilicifolius plants under a high concentration of ZnSO 4 was compensated by the reduction in the photosynthetic efficacy. Micro and macro-elemental distribution pattern in the root tissues was significantly influenced by heavy metal exposure. Tolerance towards the excess toxic metal ions in the tissue of A . ilicifolius was aided by the modified anatomical features. Moreover, the increased deposition of Zn around the central vasculature of the root confirms the complexation of Zn 2+ in the xylem vessels. Metal induced molecular level changes of root and leaf samples indicate the presence of OH, NH 2 , and CH 3 deformation as well as C-O-H and C-O-C stretch. A prominent band corresponding to CH 3 deformation, pointing hemicellulose fortification, occurs in the cell walls of the xylem, aiding in Zn localization. The phytostabilisation potential of A . ilicifolius is dependent on the coordinated responses which endow with phenotypic plasticity necessary to cope with Zn toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4280598744,"The integrity of the intestinal barrier is critical for protecting the host against the pathogen. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the intestinal barrier disfunction related to sepsis remained unclear. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of HIF-1α on oxidative damage, the intestinal mucosal permeability, structural and morphological changes during sepsis. Twenty-four Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups of 6 rats each: the sham group (sham), sepsis group (subjected to cecal ligation and perforation, CLP), sepsis + DMOG group (40 mg/kg of DMOG by intraperitoneal injection for 7 consecutive days before CLP), and sepsis + BAY 87-2243 group (9 mg/kg of BAY 87-2243 orally administered for 3 consecutive days before CLP). Sepsis increased plasma levels of inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress markers and HIF-1α expression; caused pathological damage; increased permeability (P < 0.05); and decreased TJ protein expression in the intestinal mucosa of rats with sepsis (P < 0.05). The addition of DMOG up-regulated HIF-1α, then decreased the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress markers, alleviated pathological damage to the intestinal mucosa and decreased intestinal permeability (P < 0.05); while BAY 87-2243 treatment had the opposite effects. Our findings showed that HIF-1α protects the intestinal barrier function of septic rats by inhibiting intestinal inflammation and oxidative damage, our results provide a novel insight for developing sepsis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4280509112,"Brazil presents large yield gaps in garlic crops partly due to nutrient mismanagement at local scale. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools to handle numerous combinations of yield-impacting factors that help reducing the number of assumptions about nutrient management. The aim of the current study is to customize fertilizer recommendations to reach high garlic marketable yield at local scale in a pilot study. Thus, collected 15 nitrogen (N), 24 phosphorus (P), and 27 potassium (K) field experiments conducted during the 2015 to 2017 period in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. In addition, 61 growers’ observational data were collected in the same region in 2018 and 2019. The data set was split into 979 experimental and observational data for model calibration and into 45 experimental data (2016) to test ML models and compare the results to state recommendations. Random Forest (RF) was the most accurate ML to predict marketable yield after cropping system (cultivar, preceding crops), climatic indices, soil test and fertilization were included features as predictor (R 2 = 0.886). Random Forest remained the most accurate ML model (R 2 = 0.882) after excluding cultivar and climatic features from the prediction-making process. The model suggested the application of 200 kg N ha -1 to reach maximum marketable yield in a test site in comparison to the 300 kg N ha -1 set as state recommendation. P and K fertilization also seemed to be excessive, and it highlights the great potential to reduce production costs and environmental footprint without agronomic loss. Garlic root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi likely contributed to P and K uptake. Well-documented data sets and machine learning models could support technology transfer, reduce costs with fertilizers and yield gaps, and sustain the Brazilian garlic production."
https://openalex.org/W4280523865,"Introduction The Handheld Dynamometer (HHD) has the potential to overcome some of the logistic and economic limitations of isokinetic dynamometers for measuring knee extension muscle strength. However, its reliability has not been fully assessed. The purpose of this study is to measure intra and inter-rater reliability of HHD for knee extension strength in patients receiving rehabilitation treatment, as well as to understand in which conditions is the reliability higher. Methods Twenty-nine patients admitted in an inpatient Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation unit were consecutively included in this cross-sectional study. Two experienced and two inexperienced physicians made two assessments of knee extension strength with HHD, separated by three hours. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), absolute differences between assessments, and correlations between strength and functional variables were calculated. Results Intra and inter-rater ICC were overall high (≥ 0.950 and 0.927, respectively). Higher values were found when average of two measurements were made for estimating intra-rater ICC (ICC = 0.978; 95%CI = 0.969–0.985) but not for inter-rater ICC. ICC were not statistically significantly different when calculated based on measurements performed by inexperienced physicians and experienced ones. There was a moderate correlation between strength and functional variables. Conclusion Handheld Dynamometer seems to be a reliable option to measure knee extension muscle strength, particularly when two measurements are performed and their average is reported."
https://openalex.org/W4280540198,"Early data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the disease has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color with higher infection and mortality rates within those communities. This study used demographic data from the 2018 US census estimates, mortality data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, and testing results from the Illinois Department of Public Health to perform bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to explore the role race plays in COVID-19 outcomes at the individual and community levels. We used the ZCTA Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a measure of ZCTA area level deprivation based on seven demographic characteristics to quantify the socio-economic variation in health outcomes and levels of disadvantage across ZCTAs. Principal findings showed that: 1) while Black individuals make up 22% of Cook County's population, they account for 28% of the county's COVID-19 related deaths; 2) the average age of death from COVID-19 is seven years younger for Non-White compared with White decedents; 3) residents of Minority ZCTA areas were 1.02 times as likely to test positive for COVID-19, (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 1.02, [95% CI 0.95, 1.10]); 1.77 times as likely to die (IRR 1.77, [95% CI 1.17, 2.66]); and were 1.15 times as likely to be tested (IRR 1.15, [95% CI 0.99, 1.33]). There are notable differences in COVID-19 related outcomes between racial and ethnic groups at individual and community levels. This study illustrates the health disparities and underlying systemic inequalities experienced by communities of color."
https://openalex.org/W4280602761,"Suillus luteus (L.) Roussel is an edible mushroom commonly known as slippery jack or ""Kallampa"" by indigenous people from Loja province. It is used in traditional medicine to manage gastrointestinal disorders and headaches. In addition, edible mushrooms have been used for neurodegenerative diseases; however, there is no report about the anticholinesterase effect produced by this species. The aim of this work was to isolate the main secondary metabolite of Suillus luteus and characterize its inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase. Fruiting bodies were extracted with ethanol (EtOH) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc). From the EtOAc, suillin, is reported as the major compound. The cholinesterase inhibitory potential of extracts and the major isolated compound was assessed by Ellman´s method and progression curves were recorded at 405 nm for 60 min. Donepezil hydroclhoride was used as a positive control. The samples were dissolved in methanol at 10 mg/mL and two more 10× dilutions were included to obtain final concentrations of 1, 0.1 and 0.01 mg/mL at the mix of reaction. IC50, Km, Vmax, and Ki were calculated for suillin. Suillin (200 mg) along with linoleic acid, ergosterol peroxide and ergosterol were isolated. The EtOH and EtOAc extracts exerted a moderate inhibitory effect (IC50 > 200 μg/mL. In adittion, suillin exerted a non-competitive mixed mechanism. against AChE with an IC50 value of 31.50 μM and Ki of 17.25 μM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the anticholinesterase effect of Suillus luteus and suillin. The kinetic parameters and the moderate potency of the compound determined in this study, encourage us to propose suillin as a promising chemopreventing agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer."
https://openalex.org/W4280609028,"Background Persons with submicroscopic malaria infection are a major reservoir of gametocytes that sustain malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite recent decreases in the national malaria burden in Kenya due to vector control interventions, malaria transmission continues to be high in western regions of the country bordering Lake Victoria. The objective of this study was to advance knowledge of the topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria basin in Kisumu County. Methods Cross-sectional community surveys for malaria infection were undertaken in three eco-epidemiologically distinct zones in Nyakach sub-County, Kisumu. Adjacent regions were topologically characterized as lakeshore, hillside and highland plateau. Surveys were conducted during the 2019 and 2020 wet and dry seasons. Finger prick blood smears and dry blood spots (DBS) on filter paper were collected from 1,777 healthy volunteers for microscopic inspection and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) diagnosis of Plasmodium infection. Persons who were PCR positive but blood smear negative were considered to harbor submicroscopic infections. Topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors were correlated with community prevalence of submicroscopic infections. Results Out of a total of 1,777 blood samples collected, 14.2% (253/1,777) were diagnosed as submicroscopic infections. Blood smear microscopy and RT-PCR, respectively, detected 3.7% (66/1,777) and 18% (319/1,777) infections. Blood smears results were exclusively positive for P . falciparum , whereas RT-PCR also detected P . malariae and P . ovale mono- and co-infections. Submicroscopic infection prevalence was associated with topographical variation (χ 2 = 39.344, df = 2, p &lt;0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in the lakeshore zone (20.6%, n = 622) followed by the hillside (13.6%, n = 595) and highland plateau zones (7.9%, n = 560). Infection prevalence varied significantly according to season (χ 2 = 17.374, df = 3, p &lt;0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in residents of the lakeshore zone in the 2019 dry season (29.9%, n = 167) and 2020 and 2019 rainy seasons (21.5%, n = 144 and 18.1%, n = 155, respectively). In both the rainy and dry seasons the likelihood of submicroscopic infection was higher in the lakeshore (AOR: 2.71, 95% CI = 1.85–3.95; p &lt;0.0001) and hillside (AOR: 1.74, 95% CI = 1.17–2.61, p = 0.007) than in the highland plateau zones. Residence in the lakeshore zone ( p &lt;0.0001), male sex ( p = 0.025), school age ( p = 0.002), and living in mud houses ( p = 0.044) increased the risk of submicroscopic malaria infection. Bed net use ( p = 0.112) and occupation ( p = 0.116) were not associated with submicroscopic infection prevalence. Conclusion Topographic features of the local landscape and seasonality are major correlates of submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria area of western Kenya. Diagnostic tests more sensitive than blood smear microscopy will allow for monitoring and targeting geographic sites where additional vector interventions are needed to reduce malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4280644047,"Background There have been no studies to date of moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in national samples of U.S. health workers. The purpose of this study was to determine, in a national sample of internal medicine physicians (internists) in the U.S.: 1) the intensity of moral distress; 2) the predictors of moral distress; 3) the outcomes of moral distress. Methods We conducted a national survey with an online panel of internists, representative of the membership of the American College of Physicians, the largest specialty organization of physicians in the United States, between September 21 and October 8, 2020. Moral distress was measured with the Moral Distress Thermometer, a one-item scale with a range of 0 (“none”) to 10 (“worst possible”). Outcomes were measured with short screening scales. Results The response rate was 37.8% (N = 810). Moral distress intensity was low (mean score = 2.4, 95% CI, 2.2–2.6); however, 13.3% (95% CI, 12.1% - 14.5%) had a moral distress score greater than or equal to 6 (“distressing”). In multiple linear regression models, perceived risk of death if infected with COVID-19 was the strongest predictor of higher moral distress (β (standardized regression coefficient) = 0.26, p &lt; .001), and higher perceived organizational support (respondent belief that their health organization valued them) was most strongly associated with lower moral distress (β = -0.22, p &lt; .001). Controlling for other factors, high levels of moral distress, but not low levels, were strongly associated (adjusted odds ratios 3.0 to 11.5) with screening positive for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, burnout, and intention to leave patient care. Conclusions The intensity of moral distress among U.S. internists was low overall. However, the 13% with high levels of moral distress had very high odds of adverse mental health outcomes. Organizational support may lower moral distress and thereby prevent adverse mental health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4280514730,"C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRP1-15) constitute a conserved group of secreted proteins of the C1q family with diverse functions. In vitro studies have shown that CTRP11/C1QL4 can inhibit adipogenesis, antagonize myoblast fusion, and promote testosterone synthesis and secretion. Whether CTRP11 is required for these processes in vivo remains unknown. Here, we show that knockout (KO) mice lacking CTRP11 have normal skeletal muscle mass and function, and testosterone level, suggesting that CTRP11 is dispensable for skeletal muscle development and testosterone production. We focused our analysis on whether this nutrient-responsive secreted protein plays a role in controlling sugar and fat metabolism. At baseline when mice are fed a standard chow, CTRP11 deficiency affects metabolic parameters in a sexually dimorphic manner. Only Ctrp11-KO female mice have significantly higher fasting serum ketones and reduced physical activity. In the refeeding phase following food withdrawal, Ctrp11-KO female mice have reduced food intake and increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure, highlighting CTRP11's role in fasting-refeeding response. When challenged with a high-fat diet to induce obesity and metabolic dysfunction, CTRP11 deficiency modestly exacerbates obesity-induced glucose intolerance, with more pronounced effects seen in Ctrp11-KO male mice. Switching to a low-fat diet after obesity induction results in greater fat loss in wild type relative to KO male mice, suggesting impaired response to obesity reversal and reduced metabolic flexibility in the absence of CTRP11. Collectively, our data provide genetic evidence for novel sex-dependent metabolic regulation by CTRP11, but note the overall modest contribution of CTRP11 to systemic energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4280569642,"Over the years, several global models have been proposed to forecast global sustainability, provide a framework for sustainable policy-making, or to study sustainability across the FEW nexus. An integrated model is presented here with components like food-web ecosystem dynamics, microeconomics components, including energy producers and industries, and various socio-techno-economic policy dimensions. The model consists of 15 compartments representing a simplified ecological food-web set in a macroeconomic framework along with a rudimentary legal system. The food-web is modeled by Lotka-Volterra type expressions, whereas the economy is represented by a price-setting model wherein firms and human households attempt to maximize their economic well-being. The model development is done using global-scale data for stocks and flows of food, energy, and water, which were used to parameterize this model. Appropriate proportions for some of the ecological compartments like herbivores and carnivores are used to model those compartments. The modeling of the human compartment was carried out using historical data for the global mortality rate. Historical data were used to parameterize the model. Data for key variables like the human population, GDP growth, greenhouse gases like CO2 and NOX emissions were used to validate the model. The model was then used to make long-term forecasts and to study global sustainability over an extended time. The purpose of this study was to create a global model which can provide techno-socio-economic policy solutions for global sustainability. Further, scenario analysis was conducted for cases where the human population or human consumption increases rapidly to observe the impact on the sustainability of the planet over the next century. The results indicated that the planet can support increased population if the per capita consumption levels do not rise. However, increased consumption resulted in exhaustion of natural resources and increased the CO2 emissions by a multiple of 100."
https://openalex.org/W4280577912,"Thirdhand smoke (THS) is a newly described health hazard composed of toxicants, mutagens and carcinogens, including nicotine-derived tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), one of which is 1-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-4-butanal (NNA). Although TSNAs are generally potent carcinogens, the risk of NNA, which is specific to THS, is poorly understood. We recently reported that THS exposure-induced adverse impact on DNA replication and transcription with implications in the development of cancer and other diseases. Here, we investigated the role of NNA in THS exposure-induced harmful effects on fundamental cellular processes. We exposed cultured human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells to NNA. The formation of DNA base damages was assessed by Long Amplicon QPCR (LA-QPCR); DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and NNA effects on replication and transcription by immunofluorescence (IF); and genomic instability by micronuclei (MN) formation. We found increased accumulation of oxidative DNA damage and DSBs as well as activation of DNA damage response pathway, after exposure of cells to NNA. Impaired S phase progression was also evident. Consistent with these results, we found increased MN formation, a marker of genomic instability, in NNA-exposed cells. Furthermore, ongoing RNA synthesis was significantly reduced by NNA exposure, however, RNA synthesis resumed fully after a 24h recovery period only in wild-type cells but not in those deficient in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). Importantly, these cellular effects are common with the THS-exposure induced effects. Our findings suggest that NNA in THS could be a contributing factor for THS exposure-induced adverse health effect."
https://openalex.org/W4280616026,"The detection of rail surface defects is vital for high-speed rail maintenance and management. The CNN-based computer vision approach has been proved to be a strong detection tool widely used in various industrial scenarios. However, the CNN-based detection models are diverse from each other in performance, and most of them require sufficient training samples to achieve high detection performance. Selecting an appropriate model and tuning it with insufficient annotated rail defect images is time-consuming and tedious. To overcome this challenge, motivated by ensemble learning that uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance, we develop an ensemble framework for industrialized rail defect detection. We apply multiple backbone networks individually to obtain features, and mix them in a binary format to obtain better and more diverse sub-networks. Image augmentation and feature augmentation operations are randomly applied to further make the model more diverse. A shared feature pyramid network is adopted to reduce model parameters as well as computation cost. Experimental results substantiate that the approach outperforms single detecting architecture in our specified rail defect task. On the collected dataset with 8 defect classes, our algorithm achieves 7.4% higher mAP.5 compared with YOLOv5 and 2.8% higher mAP.5 compared with Faster R-CNN."

The analysis of the data included progressive coding and categorization, constant comparative analysis and memo writing.A core category emerged, ""Autonomy"", composed of three categories: ""Between illusion and ignorance. Genesis of a habitus"", ""The recognisable and recognised habitus"" and ""Habitus called into question"", showing the genesis of the nursing role in primary health care and the elements that influence the autonomy of the role: the ability to decide their training, assume their own leadership, configure teams and acquire independent skills. ""Seeking autonomy"" was the substantive theory that emerged from the data.The results reveal the elements that strengthen the autonomous professional role and that this role is legitimated when two elements are identified: the acquisition of a habitus, based on practices carried out regularly and the recognition of this habitus by the population and others professionals.The results of this study identify the elements that guide and strengthen the professional role and redefine the concept of autonomy. These are operational findings and could potentially be used to define new strategies for advancing the role of nursing in primary health care."

Flavonoids and antioxidants are under study for their cytoprotective effects and antidiabetic potential. In this study, we aimed to compare the protective effect of the Rooibos components aspalathin, isoorientin, 3-hydroxyphloretin (3-OH) and green Rooibos extract (GRT) itself, and exendin-4 and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as reference molecules, against lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. The insulin-producing β cell line INS1E was exposed to hydrogen peroxide or streptozotocin (STZ) to induce oxidative stress, and palmitate to induce lipotoxicity. Cell viability was assessed by a MTS cell viability assay. Antioxidant response and antiapoptotic gene expression was performed by qRT-PCR. Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2) transporter inhibition was assessed through 2-NBDG uptake. GRT and the flavonoids aspalathin and 3-hydroxyphloretin offered significant protection against oxidative stress and lipotoxicity. GRT downregulated expression of pro-apoptotic genes Txnip and Ddit3 . The flavonoids aspalathin and 3-hydroxyphloretin also downregulated these genes and in addition upregulated expression of antioxidant response genes Hmox1 , Nqo1 and Sod1 . Isoorientin gave no cytoprotection. Cytoprotection by Rooibos components was significantly higher than by NAC or exendin-4. Rooibos components strongly protect INS1E β cells against diabetogenic stress. Cytoprotection was associated with the upregulation of antioxidant response genes of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway or suppression of the TXN system. The Rooibos molecules offered better protection against these insults than exendin-4 and NAC, making them interesting candidates as β cell cytoprotectants for therapeutic or nutraceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4280546666,"Studies have shown that Nrf2E79Q/+ is one of the most common mutations found in human tumors. To elucidate how this genetic change contributes to lung cancer, we compared lung tumor development in a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) with dual Trp53/p16 loss, the most common mutations found in human lung tumors, in the presence or absence of Nrf2E79Q/+. Trp53/p16-deficient mice developed combined-small cell lung cancer (C-SCLC), a mixture of pure-SCLC (P-SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Mice possessing the LSL-Nrf2E79Q mutation showed no difference in the incidence or latency of C-SCLC compared with Nrf2+/+ mice. However, these tumors did not express NRF2 despite Cre-induced recombination of the LSL-Nrf2E79Q allele. Trp53/p16-deficient mice also developed P-SCLC, where activation of the NRF2E79Q mutation associated with a higher incidence of this tumor type. All C-SCLCs and P-SCLCs were positive for NE-markers, NKX1-2 (a lung cancer marker) and negative for P63 (a squamous cell marker), while only P-SCLC expressed NRF2 by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of a consensus NRF2 pathway signature in human NE+-lung tumors showed variable activation of NRF2 signaling. Our study characterizes the first GEMM that develops C-SCLC, a poorly-studied human cancer and implicates a role for NRF2 activation in SCLC development."

Using logistic regression, we calculated weighted outcome prevalences, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to address confounding.Small for gestational age, preterm delivery, neonatal and maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission, preeclampsia, and stillbirth or termination at > 20 weeks.Among 6346 deliveries, 87% with chronic hypertension, the risk of the infant being small for gestational age (birthweight < 10th percentile) was lower with methyldopa than labetalol (prevalence 13.6% vs. 16.6%; aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92). For birthweight < 3rd percentile the aOR was 0.57 (0.39 to 0.80). Compared with labetalol (26.0%), risk of preterm delivery was similar for methyldopa (26.5%; aOR 1.10 [0.95 to 1.27]) and slightly higher for nifedipine (28.5%; aOR 1.25 [1.06 to 1.46]) and other β-blockers (31.2%; aOR 1.58 [1.07 to 2.23]). Neonatal ICU admission was more common with nifedipine than labetalol (25.9% vs. 23.3%, aOR 1.21 [1.02 to 1.43]) but not elevated with methyldopa. Risks of other outcomes did not differ by medication.Risk of most outcomes was similar comparing labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. Risk of the infant being small for gestational age was substantially lower for methyldopa, suggesting this medication may warrant further consideration."

Fourteen participants with SIS, and 14 without SIS were recruited through convenient sampling in this study. Transcranial magnetic stimulation assessment of the scapular muscles was performed while the participants were holding their arm at 90 degrees scaption. The motor-evoked potential (MEP), active motor threshold (AMT), latency of MEP, cortical silent period (CSP), activated area and center of gravity (COG) of cortical mapping were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U tests. The SIS group demonstrated following significances, higher AMTs of the lower trapezius (SIS: 0.60 ± 0.06; Comparison: 0.54 ± 0.07, p = 0.028) and the serratus anterior (SIS: 0.59 ± 0.04; Comparison: 0.54 ± 0.06, p = 0.022), longer CSP of the lower trapezius (SIS: 62.23 ± 22.87 ms; Comparison: 45.22 ± 14.64 ms, p = 0.019), and posteriorly shifted COG in the upper trapezius (SIS: 1.88 ± 1.06; Comparison: 2.76 ± 1.55, p = 0.048) and the serratus anterior (SIS: 2.13 ± 1.02; Comparison: 3.12 ± 1.88, p = 0.043), than the control group.

https://openalex.org/W4280519314,"Background Despite the discovery of familial cases with mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Guanine nucleotide exchange C9orf72, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP) and RNA-binding protein FUS as well as a number of other genes linked to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), the etiology and molecular pathogenesis of this devastating disease is still not understood. As proteins do not act alone, conducting an analysis of ALS at the system level may provide new insights into the molecular biology of ALS and put it into relationship to other neurological diseases. Methods A set of ALS-associated genes/proteins were collected from publicly available databases and text mining of scientific literature. We used these as seed proteins to build protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks serving as a scaffold for further analyses. From the collection of networks, a set of core modules enriched in seed proteins were identified. The molecular biology of the core modules was investigated, as were their associations to other diseases. To assess the core modules’ ability to describe unknown or less well-studied ALS biology, they were queried for proteins more recently associated to ALS and not involved in the primary analysis. Results We describe a set of 26 ALS core modules enriched in ALS-associated proteins. We show that these ALS core modules not only capture most of the current knowledge about ALS, but they also allow us to suggest biological interdependencies. In addition, new associations of ALS networks with other neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease were found. A follow-up analysis of 140 ALS-associated proteins identified since 2014 reveals a significant overrepresentation of new ALS proteins in these 26 disease modules. Conclusions Using protein-protein interaction networks offers a relevant approach for broadening the understanding of the biological context of known ALS-associated genes. Using a bottom-up approach for the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks is a useful method to avoid bias caused by over-connected proteins. Our ALS-enriched modules cover most known biological functions associated with ALS. The presence of recently identified ALS-associated proteins in the core modules highlights the potential for using these as a scaffold for identification of novel ALS disease mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4280544777,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an important inducer of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various cancers. Our previous study demonstrated that prohaptoglobin (proHp) stimulates Smad1/5 activation via ALK1, a TGF-β type I receptor, in endothelial cells, suggesting that proHp plays a role in TGF-β signaling. However, the function of proHp in cellular events downstream of Smads remains unclear. The current study investigated the effects of proHp on TGF-β-mediated Smad-dependent EMT induction and cell invasion in vitro using proHp-overexpressing SK-Hep1 liver cancer cells. The results of Western blotting, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry indicated that proHp downregulated expression of mesenchymal marker and EMT regulator such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and twist, and upregulated expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Compared with control cells, proHp-overexpressing cells exhibited high levels of ALK1/2/3 receptors and markedly increased Smad1/5 phosphorylation. Interestingly, proHp attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of mesenchymal markers and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. It also significantly suppressed cell invasion and migration. Knockdown of Smad1/5 abolished the inhibitory effects of proHp on TGF-β-stimulated Smad2/3 phosphorylation and mesenchymal marker expression. These findings indicate that proHp suppresses the TGF-β-induced EMT and cell invasion in vitro by enhancing Smad1/5 activation via ALK1/2/3 receptors and thus suppressing the Smad2/3 signaling pathway in SK-Hep1 cells. This study suggests that proHp may prevent a de-differentiation of hepatic cells and induce a cell differentiation by regulating the Smad signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4280592791,"This study analyzed the asymmetric impact of the physical infrastructure and trade openness on Pakistan’s ecological footprint over the period 1970–2019 using the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model. The study results posit that positive and negative shocks to physical infrastructure increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically in the short-run and symmetrically in the long-run. Likewise, the positive and negative shocks to trade openness increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically, both in the short and in the long run. Furthermore, urbanization also positively and significantly increases Pakistan’s ecological footprint in the short and long run. Moreover, a 1% increase in physical infrastructure increases the ecological footprint by 0.32%, while a 1% decrease in physical infrastructure decreases the ecological footprint by 0.33% in the long run. Similarly, a 1% increase in trade openness causes a 0.09% increase in the ecological footprint in the long term, while a 1% reduction in trade openness causes a 0.61% reduction in the ecological footprint. The results also conclude that urbanization is a major determinant of Pakistan’s long-term ecological footprint. Thus, a 1% increase in urbanization causes a 1.31% increase in the ecological footprint in the long run. Finally, this study recommends that policies regarding physical infrastructure be formulated keeping in view its environmental impact. In addition, strict environmental policies should be implemented to reduce the environmental degradation effect of trade openness."
https://openalex.org/W4280595682,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been widely used in biomedical research, particularly on those genomics-related studies. One of NGS applications is the high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which is usually applied to evaluate gene expression level (i.e. copies of isoforms), to identify differentially expressed genes, and to discover potential alternative splicing events. Popular tools for differential expression (DE) analysis using RNA-seq data include edgeR and DESeq. These methods tend to identify DE genes at the gene-level, which only allows them to compare the total size of isoforms, that is, sum of an isoform's copy number times its length over all isoforms. Naturally, these methods may fail to detect DE genes when the total size of isoforms remains similar but isoform-wise expression levels change dramatically. Other tools can perform isoform-level DE analysis only if isoform structures are known but would still fail for many non-model species whose isoform information are missing. To overcome these disadvantages, we developed an isoform-free (without need to pre-specify isoform structures) splicing-graph based negative binomial (SGNB) model for differential expression analysis at isoform level. Our model detects not only the change in the total size of isoforms but also the change in the isoform-wise expression level and hence is more powerful.We performed extensive simulations to compare our method with edgeR and DESeq. Under various scenarios, our method consistently achieved a higher detection power, while controlling pre-specified type I error. We also applied our method to a real data set to illustrate its applicability in practice."

However, the durability of protection, associated factors and cost-effectiveness of IPT remain uncertain in low-and-middle income countries, Uganda inclusive. The Uganda Ministry of health recommends a single standard-dose IPT course for eligible people living with HIV (PLHIV). In this study we determined the incidence, associated factors and median time to TB diagnosis among PLHIV on Antiretroviral therapy (ART) who initiated IPT. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at eleven The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) centers in Uganda. We reviewed medical records of 2634 PLHIV on ART who initiated IPT from 1 st January 2016 to 30 th June 2018, with 30 th June 2021 as end of follow up date. We analyzed study data using STATA v.16. Incidence rate was computed as the number of new TB cases divided by the total person months. A Frailty model was used to determine factors associated with TB incidence. Results The 2634 individuals were observed for 116,360.7 person months. IPT completion rate was 92.8%. Cumulative proportion of patients who developed TB in this cohort was 0.83% (22/2634), an incidence rate of 18.9 per 100,000 person months. The median time to TB diagnosis was 18.5 months (minimum– 0.47; maximum– 47.3, IQR: 10.1–32.4). World Health Organization (WHO) HIV clinical stage III (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 95%CI: 3.66 (1.08, 12.42) (P = 0.037) and discontinuing IPT (aHR 95%CI: 25.96(4.12, 169.48) (p = 0.001)), were associated with higher odds of TB diagnosis compared with WHO clinical stage II and IPT completion respectively. Conclusion Incidence rates of TB were low overtime after one course of IPT, and this was mainly attributed to high completion rates."

As a typical rapidly urbanizing area and an emerging megacity in China, Chengdu is confronting the pressure of inadequate water supply. The present study divides the macroeconomic factors that affect the water resource supply and demand balance into six major subsystems: water resources supply, water demand, water drainage, population, ecological environment and economy. The combining variable interaction description and predictive simulation models are applied to simulate the water supply and demand ratio (S:D) from 2005 to 2035. Further, this study designs different development scenarios to simulate the change of S:D ratios by altering the parameter values of driving factors. The results show that: (1) the S:D ratio will decline if the current development scenario continues, implying the serious water resources shortage and the severe water supply-demand conflict in Chengdu; (2) socio-economic water demand and wastewater/rainwater reuse are the key driving parameters of S:D ratio, especially the water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial value-added; (3) the S:D ratio will increase from 0.92 in the current baseline scenario to 1.06 in the integrated optimization scenario in 2025, and the long-term planning brings 2035 from 0.71 to 1.03, with the proportion of unconventional water supply rise to 38% and 61%, respectively. This study can provide a decision-making tool for policy-makers to explore plausible policy scenarios necessary for bridging the gap between the water supply and demand in megacities."
https://openalex.org/W4280494767,"Excessive neuroinflammation and neuronal loss contribute to mechanisms of spinal cord injury (SCI). Accumulating evidence has suggested that topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibition can suppress exacerbated immune responses and protect against lethal inflammation. Pyroptosis is a recently identified pro-inflammatory programmed mode of cell death. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of Top1 inhibition in SCI remains unclear. Locomotor functional recovery in mice was evaluated through Basso Mouse Scale (BMS). Neuronal loss was evaluated by immunochemistry staining of NeuN. Pyroptosis was determined by immunofluorescence staining, western blot, flow cytometry, cell viability, and cytotoxicity assays. In the present study, we estimated the effects of chemical inhibition of Top1 in an SCI model. Administration of Top1 inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) to mice significantly improved locomotor functional recovery after SCI. Moreover, CPT reduced Top1 level, inhibited nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, attenuated proinflammatory cytokines levels, diminished the number of neutrophil and neuronal loss in mice. Furthermore, CPT in oxygen-glucose deprivation neurons down-regulated Top1 level, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and suppressed pyroptosis and inflammatory response. Together, our findings indicate that inhibition of Top1 with CPT can inhibit pyroptosis, control neuroinflammation, and improve functional recovery after SCI."

https://openalex.org/W4280518224,"Research on olfactory stimulation indicates that it can influence human cognition and behavior, as in the perception of facial expressions. Odors can facilitate or impair the identification of facial expressions, and apparently its hedonic valence plays an important role. However, it was also demonstrated that the presentation of happiness and disgust faces can influence the emotional appraisal of odorants, indicating a bilateral influence in this phenomenon. Hence, it's possible that odor influences on emotional categorization vary depending on the intensity of expressions. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed an emotion recognition task using facial expressions of five emotional categories (happiness, fear, disgust, anger and sadness) with ten different intensities. Thirty-five participants completed four blocks of the task, each with a different olfactory condition, and we found that odorants' effects varied according to the facial expressions intensity. Odorants enhanced the Reaction Time (RT) differences between threshold and high-intensity expressions for disgust and fear faces. Also, analysis of the RT means for high-intensity facial expressions revealed that the well-known advantage in recognition of happiness facial expressions, compared to other emotions, was enhanced in the positive olfactory stimulation and decreased in the negative condition. We conclude that olfactory influences on emotional processing of facial expressions vary along intensities of the latter, and the discrepancies of past research in this field may be a result of a bilateral effect in which the odorants influence the identification of emotional faces just as the facial expressions influence the emotional reaction to the odor."

Thus, computational approaches are especially valuable in the case of membrane proteins and their assemblies.

Currently, structure prediction of protein complexes (protein docking) is a well-developed field of study. However, the generic protein docking approaches are not optimal for the membrane proteins because of the differences in physicochemical environment and the spatial constraints imposed by the membranes. Thus, docking of the membrane proteins requires specialized computational methods. Development and benchmarking of the membrane protein docking approaches has to be based on high-quality sets of membrane protein complexes. In this study we present a new dataset of 456 non-redundant alpha helical binary interfaces. The set is significantly larger and more representative than the previously developed sets.

https://openalex.org/W4280523943,"Loops are a rich source of parallelism. Unfortunately, many loops cannot be safely parallelized at compile time because the compiler is not able to guarantee that there will be no dependence violations. Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) techniques, either hardware or software-based, allow the parallel execution of non-analyzable loops, issuing the execution of blocks of consecutive iterations (called chunks) while a hardware or software monitor ensures that no dependence violations arise. If such a dependence violation occurs, the chunk that was fed with incorrect values is discarded and re-started, in order to consume the correct information. In the speculative execution of non-analyzable loops, it is very important to correctly choose the chunk size, because this choice dramatically affects the performance of the parallel execution. Bigger chunks imply less scheduling overheads, but smaller chunks allow fewer calculations to be discarded in the event of a dependence violation. To find a good chunk size is not a simple task, because loops may present dependencies that cannot be detected at compile time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of different scheduling methods to estimate the optimal chunk size in the speculative execution of non-analyzable loops. This evaluation ranges from the simple, classical methods originally devised to achieve load balancing in loops with no dependencies, to methods that make some assumptions on the distribution pattern of dependencies, such as Meseta and Just-in-Time scheduling. We also propose and evaluate a general, more complex method called Moody Scheduling, that does not require a-priori assumptions to achieve the highest performance."
https://openalex.org/W4280530974,"The advent of content-centric networks and Small Cell Networks (SCN) has resulted in the exponential growth of data for both uplink and downlink transmission. Data caching is considered one of the popular solutions to cater to the resultant challenges of network congestion and bottleneck of backhaul links in B5G networks. Caching for uplink transmission in distributed B5G scenarios has several challenges such as duplicate matching of contents, mobile station's unawareness about the cached contents, and the storage of large content size. This paper proposes a cache framework for uplink transmission in distributed B5G SCNs. Our proposed framework generates comprehensive lists of cache contents from all the Small Base Stations (SBSs) in the network to remove similar contents and assist uplink transmission. In addition, our framework also proposes content matching at a Mobile Station (MS) in contrast to an SBS, which effectively improves the energy and spectrum efficiency. Furthermore, large size contents are segmented and their fractions are stored in the distributed cache to improve the cache hit ratio. Our analysis shows that the proposed framework outperforms the existing schemes by improving the energy and spectrum efficiency of both access and core networks. Compared to the existing state of the art, our proposed framework improves the energy and spectrum efficiency of the access network by 41.28% and 15.58%, respectively. Furthermore, the cache hit ratio and throughput are improved by 9% and 40.00%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4280535546,"The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) is an emerging wellbeing scale to measure the frequency of positive and negative emotions. This study explores the psychometric properties of SPANE on a sample from the Arab Gulf region. The Arab Gulf region shares cultural elements with the broader Muslim and Arab world, but maintains distinct features that warrants validation studies for psychological instruments. There were 1393 participants from Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and other Arab Gulf countries. The factorial structure of SPANE was examined using a principal axis factor analysis, followed up with a confirmatory factor analysis. The convergent validity was examined by correlating SPANE with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The findings confirmed a two-factor structure of SPANE, and demonstrated adequate psychometric properties and convergent validity. In conclusion, this study indicates that SPANE shows sufficient validity for use as a measure of wellbeing in the Arab Gulf region."

https://openalex.org/W4280563348,"Investigating whether landmarks and routes affect navigational efficiency and learning transfer in traffic is essential. In this study, a virtual reality-based driving system was employed to determine the effects of landmarks and routes on human neurocognitive behavior. The participants made four (4) journeys to predetermined destinations. They were provided with different landmarks and routes to aid in reaching their respective destinations. We considered two (2) groups and conducted two (2) sessions per group in this study. Each group had sufficient and insufficient landmarks. We hypothesized that using insufficient landmarks would elicit an increase in psychophysiological activation, such as increased heart rate, eye gaze, and pupil size, which would cause participants to make more errors. Moreover, easy and difficult routes elicited different cognitive workloads. Thus, a high cognitive load would negatively affect the participants when trying to apply the knowledge acquired at the beginning of the exercise. In addition, the navigational efficiency of routes with sufficient landmarks was remarkably higher than that of routes with insufficient landmarks. We evaluated the effects of landmarks and routes by assessing the recorded information of the drivers’ pupil size, heart rate, and driving performance data. An analytical strategy, several machine learning algorithms, and data fusion methods have been employed to measure the neurocognitive load of each participant for user classification. The results showed that insufficient landmarks and difficult routes increased pupil size and heart rate, which caused the participants to make more errors. The results also indicated that easy routes with sufficient landmarks were deemed more efficient for navigation, where users’ cognitive loads were much lower than those with insufficient landmarks and difficult routes. The high cognitive workload hindered the participants when trying to apply the knowledge acquired at the beginning of the exercise. Meanwhile, the data fusion method achieved higher accuracy than the other classification methods. The results of this study will help improve the use of landmarks and design of driving routes, as well as paving the way to analyze traffic safety using the drivers’ cognition and performance data."
https://openalex.org/W4280584790,"In recent years, studies on malware analysis have noticeably increased in the cybersecurity community. Most recent studies concentrate on malware classification and detection or malicious patterns identification, but as to malware activity, it still relies heavily on manual analysis for high-level semantic descriptions. We develop a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network, called TagSeq, to investigate a sequence of Windows API calls recorded from malware execution, and produce tags to label their malicious behavior. We propose embedding modules to transform Windows API function parameters, registry, filenames, and URLs into low-dimension vectors, while still preserving the closeness property. Moreover, we utilize an attention mechanism to capture the relations between generated tags and certain API invocation calls. Results show that the most possible malicious actions are identified by TagSeq. Examples and a case study demonstrate that the proposed embedding modules preserve semantic-physical relations and that the predicted tags reflect malicious intentions. We believe this work is suitable as a tool to help security analysts recognize malicious behavior and intent with easy-to-understand tags."
https://openalex.org/W4280648351,"One challenge in avian embryology is establishing a standard developmental timetable, primarily because eggs incubated for identical durations can vary in developmental progress, even within the same species. For remedy, avian development is classified into distinct stages based on the formation of key morphological structures. Developmental stages exist for a few galliform species, but the literature is lacking a description of normal stages for California valley quail (Callipepla californica). Thus, the objective of this study was to stage and document the morphological and structural development of California valley quail. Over two laying seasons, 390 eggs were incubated at 37.8֯ C in 60% RH for ≤23 days. Eggs were opened every ≤6 hours to document embryonic development, including, blastoderm diameter, anterior angle of nostril to beak tip, and lengths of wing, tarsus, third toe, total beak, total foot, and embryo. California valley quail embryos were staged and compared to domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), the staging standard for galliformes, as well as Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), blue-breasted quail (Synoicus chinensis) and northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). This study produced the first description of the 43 normal stages of development for California valley quail. Compared with other galliformes, the California valley quail has a different number of stages and displays developmental heterochrony in stages 1-24, and morphological and developmental differences in stages 25-hatch. The observed differences emphasize the importance of staging individual avian species instead of relying on poultry animal models or close relatives for developmental reference. This is extremely important in species-specific embryological studies that evaluate critical windows of development or evaluate the impacts of environmental change on avian development. This study also suggests that staging frequencies of ≤6 hours and egg transport protocols should be standardized for future staging studies."
