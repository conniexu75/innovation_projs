https://openalex.org/W2073222604,"Fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor, produced by the fetal lung fibroblast in response to glucocorticoids, was partially purified by column chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The resulting preparation showed two major and two minor bands on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When fetal rats were injected on day 17 of gestation with 1 microgram of this material, they showed on day 20 biochemical evidence of accelerated lung maturation as compared to littermate controls. There were no differences between the two groups in body weights, organ weights, or circulating corticosteroid levels."

A column of tenacious mucus that occupies the lumen of the rabbit oviduct isthmus during estrus may permit sperm transport. After ovulation the mucus disappears, with subsequent efforescence of cilia, which probably assist transport of ova to the uterus."

https://openalex.org/W2006350882,"Recent experimental work suggests a possible cyclical pathway for early prebiotic oligonucleotide formation that involves (i) dry-state (nontemplate) synthesis of random copolymers with mixed 2′,5′ and 3′,5′ bonds, (ii) passage of these oligomers into solution at low temperatures, and (iii) a preferential hydrolysis of the 2′,5′ bond in any short helices that have formed. This early system could have selected for complementary sequences that were largely 3′,5′-linked, but may not have selected efficiently for a single enantiomer of ribose."
https://openalex.org/W72400761,"High sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry has been employed to study the thermotropic behavior, over the range from 12-83”C, of dispersed mixtures of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) with bovine brain ganglioside GM1 of high purity. No thermal phase transitions of pure GM1 alone in excess water could be detected, even at concentrations of 4 mg/ml? over the temperature range of these studies. The excess heat capacity curve for multilamellar dis- persions of pure DPPC was as previously reported, with a pretransition at 32.7”C and a main transition at 41.4”C. As GM1 was added in increasing amounts to DPPC, the curve remained qualitatively similar up to a GM1 mole fraction (xc) of 0.24, but the temperature of the pretransition gradually increased, from 32.7 to about 37”C, and that of the main transition gradually increased, from 41.4-44.3%. When xo was increased above 0.24, several changes were observed: 1) the tur- bidity of the suspensions abruptly decreased, becoming negligible at xo r, 0.40; 2) the pretransition disap- peared; 3) the amplitude of the main transition began to decrease; and 4) a new transition appeared at a higher temperature, 48°C. The calculated enthalpy of the main transition was constant, within the error of the measurement, up to xo = 0.24, and then decreased linearly to zero over the range of xo between 0.24 and 0.63; over the same range the enthalpy of the transition at 48°C increased linearly from zero, so that the sum of the two enthalpies remained constant. All the observed thermotropic transitions were experimentally reversi- ble over a period of at least 2 weeks. These results are interpreted in terms of a model, consistent with pre- vious observations, in which GM1 at concentrations up to xG = 0.24 is incorporated into the multilamellar DPPC structure, but at higher concentrations induces the progressive formation of mixed micelles because of the repulsive interaction of its bulky and negatively charged head groups. In both lamellar and micellar structures, GM1 appears to stabilize the phospholipid lattice, causing the transition temperature to be higher than for pure DPPC. The thermotropic behavior of biomembranes and their lipid components has come increasingly under investigation (1, 2). The calorimetric properties of the numerically predominant"

When egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles are used as substrate, the phospholipase has an apparent Km of 4.4 mM, an apparent Vmax of 100 mumol min-1 mg-1 of protein, and a pH optimum of 5.0 at 40 degrees C. The phospholipase hydrolyzed the gel state of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles at a rate 2 to 3 times greater than the liquid crystalline state, taking into account temperature effects on the enzymatic reaction itself. The results suggest that, toward sonicated vesicles, there is no specific enhancement of the rate when the both liquid crystalline and gel states are present together, as has been suggested to occur for multibilayers studied with other phospholipases. An apparent stimulation of activity as the reaction proceeded was observed above the phase transition temperature. This might be attributed to an increase in the phase transition temperature caused by free fatty acids so that, in the presence of reaction products, the enzyme is actually hydrolyzing gel state phospholipid which was found to be the preferred lipid state for phospholipase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2077657990,"Disaturated (fully saturated) lecithins adsorb onto solid surfaces more readily than lecithins in which one or both fatty acids are unsaturated. If saturated lecithins adsorb to arterial walls as they do to glass and polystyrene surfaces, there may be increased probability of atherosclerosis when the disaturated lecithin content of plasma is elevated. Analyses of lecithins in plasma samples from patients with myocardial infarction, and from patients with premature atherosclerosis but with low concentrations of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, are consistent with the hypothesis that a high concentration of disaturated lecithin in plasma may be a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, independent of triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations."

This method showed that light has a fast effect on bilirubin metabolism in homozygous Gunn rats, even at low doses and intensities. This is consistent with geometric isomerization of bilirubin IXα as a primary step in phototherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2059792916,"HETEROZYGOTES for haemoglobin (Hb) Wayne possess two minor haemoglobin components that migrate more rapidly than HbA on electrophoresis at pH8.6. Each of the minor haemoglobin components contains an abnormal α chain in which the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide sequence, Lys-Tyr-Arg, has been replaced by an octapeptide1. The slower of the two components, henceforth designated Wayne-Asn, has the following octapeptide sequence: Asn-Thr-Val-Lys-Leu-Glu-Pro-Arg, whereas the faster one (Wayne-Asp) has exactly the same sequence except that asparagine at position 139 is replaced by aspartic acid. (These components, formerly designated1 Wayne-1 and Wayne-2, respectively, have been renamed for clarity.) This is the first variant described in which deamidation of the gene product is believed to occur. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the proposed deamidation and to explain another interesting feature of the Hb Wayne phenotype in heterozygotes; namely, the presence of the variant haemoglobins in markedly reduced quantities relative to HbA (3% and 4%, respectively, for Hb Wayne-Asn and Hb Wayne-Asp)."
