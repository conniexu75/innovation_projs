https://openalex.org/W2491163602,"Influenza virus remains a threat because of its ability to evade vaccine-induced immune responses due to antigenic drift. Here, we describe the isolation, evolution, and structure of a broad-spectrum human monoclonal antibody (mAb), MEDI8852, effectively reacting with all influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes. MEDI8852 uses the heavy-chain VH6-1 gene and has higher potency and breadth when compared to other anti-stem antibodies. MEDI8852 is effective in mice and ferrets with a therapeutic window superior to that of oseltamivir. Crystallographic analysis of Fab alone or in complex with H5 or H7 HA proteins reveals that MEDI8852 binds through a coordinated movement of CDRs to a highly conserved epitope encompassing a hydrophobic groove in the fusion domain and a large portion of the fusion peptide, distinguishing it from other structurally characterized cross-reactive antibodies. The unprecedented breadth and potency of neutralization by MEDI8852 support its development as immunotherapy for influenza virus-infected humans."
https://openalex.org/W2495730383,"The performance of an action relies on the initiation and execution of appropriate movement sequences. Two basal ganglia pathways have been classically hypothesized to regulate this process via opposing roles in movement facilitation and suppression. By using a series of state-dependent optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the contributions of each pathway and found that both the direct striatonigral pathway and the indirect striatopallidal pathway are necessary for smooth initiation and the execution of learned action sequences. Optogenetic inhibition or stimulation of each pathway before sequence initiation increased the latency for initiation: manipulations of the striatonigral pathway activity slowed action initiation, and those of the striatopallidal pathway aborted action initiation. The inhibition of each pathway after initiation also impaired ongoing execution. Furthermore, the subtle activation of striatonigral neurons sustained the performance of learned sequences, while striatopallidal manipulations aborted ongoing performance. These results suggest a supportive versus permissive model, where patterns of coordinated activity, rather than the relative amount of activity in these pathways, regulate movement initiation and execution."
https://openalex.org/W2491683774,"Antibodies capable of neutralizing divergent influenza A viruses could form the basis of a universal vaccine. Here, from subjects enrolled in an H5N1 DNA/MIV-prime-boost influenza vaccine trial, we sorted hemagglutinin cross-reactive memory B cells and identified three antibody classes, each capable of neutralizing diverse subtypes of group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. Co-crystal structures with hemagglutinin revealed that each class utilized characteristic germline genes and convergent sequence motifs to recognize overlapping epitopes in the hemagglutinin stem. All six analyzed subjects had sequences from at least one multidonor class, and-in half the subjects-multidonor-class sequences were recovered from >40% of cross-reactive B cells. By contrast, these multidonor-class sequences were rare in published antibody datasets. Vaccination with a divergent hemagglutinin can thus increase the frequency of B cells encoding broad influenza A-neutralizing antibodies. We propose the sequence signature-quantified prevalence of these B cells as a metric to guide universal influenza A immunization strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2505422908,"Specialized niches support the lifelong maintenance and function of tissue-specific stem cells. Adult neural stem cells in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) contact the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which flows through the lateral ventricles. A largely ignored component of the V-SVZ stem cell niche is the lateral ventricle choroid plexus (LVCP), a primary producer of CSF. Here we show that the LVCP, in addition to performing important homeostatic support functions, secretes factors that promote colony formation and proliferation of purified quiescent and activated V-SVZ stem cells and transit-amplifying cells. The functional effect of the LVCP secretome changes throughout the lifespan, with activated neural stem cells being especially sensitive to age-related changes. Transcriptome analysis identified multiple factors that recruit colony formation and highlights novel facets of LVCP function. Thus, the LVCP is a key niche compartment that translates physiological changes into molecular signals directly affecting neural stem cell behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2504810550,"Targeted HIV cure strategies require definition of the mechanisms that maintain the virus. Here, we tracked HIV replication and the persistence of infected CD4 T cells in individuals with natural virologic control by sequencing viruses, T cell receptor genes, HIV integration sites, and cellular transcriptomes. Our results revealed three mechanisms of HIV persistence operating within distinct anatomic and functional compartments. In lymph node, we detected viruses with genetic and transcriptional attributes of active replication in both T follicular helper (TFH) cells and non-TFH memory cells. In blood, we detected inducible proviruses of archival origin among highly differentiated, clonally expanded cells. Linking the lymph node and blood was a small population of circulating cells harboring inducible proviruses of recent origin. Thus, HIV replication in lymphoid tissue, clonal expansion of infected cells, and recirculation of recently infected cells act together to maintain the virus in HIV controllers despite effective antiviral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2504182378,"The transcription factor Snail is a master regulator of cellular identity and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) directly repressing a broad repertoire of epithelial genes. How chromatin modifiers instrumental to its activity are recruited to Snail-specific binding sites is unclear. Here we report that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR (for HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA) mediates a physical interaction between Snail and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an enzymatic subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 and the main writer of chromatin-repressive marks. The Snail-repressive activity, here monitored on genes with a pivotal function in epithelial and hepatic morphogenesis, differentiation and cell-type identity, depends on the formation of a tripartite Snail/HOTAIR/EZH2 complex. These results demonstrate an lncRNA-mediated mechanism by which a transcriptional factor conveys a general chromatin modifier to specific genes, thereby allowing the execution of hepatocyte transdifferentiation; moreover, they highlight HOTAIR as a crucial player in the Snail-mediated EMT."

Embryogenesis is guided by cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, but it is unclear how these physical cues influence stem cells in culture. We used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to examine whether mechanical features of the extracellular microenvironment could differentially modulate mesoderm specification. We found that, on a hydrogel-based compliant matrix, hESCs accumulate β-catenin at cell-cell adhesions and show enhanced Wnt-dependent mesoderm differentiation. Mechanistically, Src-driven ubiquitination of E-cadherin by Cbl-like ubiquitin ligase releases P120-catenin to facilitate transcriptional activity of β-catenin, which initiates and reinforces mesoderm differentiation. By contrast, on a stiff hydrogel matrix, hESCs show elevated integrin-dependent GSK3 and Src activity that promotes β-catenin degradation and inhibits differentiation. Thus, we found that mechanical features of the microenvironmental matrix influence tissue-specific differentiation of hESCs by altering the cellular response to morphogens.

Regenerative medicine is predicated on understanding the molecular basis of tissue-specific differentiation and then judiciously applying the appropriate soluble and physical cues to optimize stem cell fate. Although much is known about the role of morphogens and transcription factors in stem cell fate specification, less is known about how physical cues modulate stem cell behavior. Thus, while it is appreciated that mechanical cues can dramatically affect cell fate (McBeath et al., 2004McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Cell shape, cytoskeletal tension, and RhoA regulate stem cell lineage commitment.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3409) Google Scholar), little is known about how extracellular forces are translated into intracellular signals to direct tissue-specific differentiation and development. Cells undergoing the coordinated processes involved in embryonic development require dynamic and reciprocal changes in cytoskeletal organization, which affect mechanical inputs via changes in tension at cell adhesions between cells and between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM). Indeed, many developmental processes require mechanical signaling at cell-cell adhesions (Simões et al., 2014Simões S. de M. Mainieri A. Zallen J.A.

Consistently, knockout of E-cadherin in cell-cell adhesions is embryonic lethal during epiblast formation before implantation (Riethmacher et al., 1995Riethmacher D. Brinkmann V. Birchmeier C. A targeted mutation in the mouse E-cadherin gene results in defective preimplantation development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), while loss of integrin β1-containing cell-ECM adhesions causes embryos to degenerate soon after implantation and inhibits mesoderm formation (Stephens et al., 1995Stephens L.E. Sutherland A.E. Klimanskaya I.V. Andrieux A. Meneses J. Pedersen R.A. Damsky C.H. Deletion of beta 1 integrins in mice results in inner cell mass failure and peri-implantation lethality.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). These studies imply that coordination of cell adhesions is likely a key mechanism whereby mechanics regulate tissue-specific development, though the molecular mechanisms that link cell adhesion to mechanics to direct development remain unclear. A more thorough understanding of how these signals guide developmental processes will inform the generation of differentiation strategies that faithfully recapitulate the complexity of mature tissues and organs. Tissue architecture during morphogenesis is controlled in part by the mechanical properties of the tissue substrate, and this effect and the underlying mechanisms can be studied using engineered matrices of tunable stiffness (Paszek et al., 2005Paszek M.J.

Functionalized polyacrylamide substrates (PA gels) have revealed a role for ECM stiffness in directing the neurogenic, myogenic, or osteogenic fate of mesenchymal stem cells (Engler et al., 2006Engler A.J.

Lutolf M.P. Substrate elasticity modulates the responsiveness of mesenchymal stem cells to commitment cues.Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2015; 7: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they have demonstrated that substrate stiffness affects the self-renewal potential of pluripotent stem cells (Chowdhury et al., 2010Chowdhury F. Li Y. Poh Y.-C. Yokohama-Tamaki T. Wang N. Tanaka T.S. Soft substrates promote homogeneous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells via downregulating cell-matrix tractions.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15655Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Our studies using optimized functionalized PA gels showed that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit striking changes in actin organization in response to ECM stiffness, consistent with differences in cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesions (Lakins et al., 2012Lakins J.N. Chin A.R. Weaver V.M. Exploring the link between human embryonic stem cell organization and fate using tension-calibrated extracellular matrix functionalized polyacrylamide gels.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 916: 317-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Przybyla et al., 2016Przybyla L. Lakins J.N. Sunyer R. Trepat X. Weaver V.M. Monitoring developmental force distributions in reconstituted embryonic epithelia.Methods. 2016; 94: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and differential cytoskeletal organization within hESC colonies has been linked to changes in differentiation potential (Rosowski et al., 2015Rosowski K.A. Mertz A.F. Norcross S. Dufresne E.R. Horsley V. Edges of human embryonic stem cell colonies display distinct mechanical properties and differentiation potential.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14218Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The tissue-level architecture of embryoid bodies (EBs) made from pluripotent stem cells can also influence differentiation potential (Bauwens et al., 2008Bauwens C.L. Peerani R. Niebruegge S. Woodhouse K.A. Kumacheva E. Husain M. Zandstra P.W. Control of human embryonic stem cell colony and aggregate size heterogeneity influences differentiation trajectories.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2300-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), so the ability to control tissue architecture via altering substrate stiffness could avoid the heterogeneity frequently encountered using EBs while providing a tunable parameter for optimization of pluripotent stem cell differentiation. The embryonic process of mesoderm specification during gastrulation requires mechanically driven coordinated cell rearrangements as cells undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to migrate into the primitive streak. Mesoderm specification requires many spatiotemporally regulated signals, including Wnts, which are expressed at the primitive streak (McMahon, 1992McMahon A.P. The Wnt family of developmental regulators.Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 236-242Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and are required for both mesoderm differentiation and EMT (Howard et al., 2011Howard S. Deroo T. Fujita Y. Itasaki N. A positive role of cadherin in Wnt/β-catenin signalling during epithelial-mesenchymal transition.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Lindsley et al., 2006Lindsley R.C. Gill J.G. Kyba M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Canonical Wnt signaling is required for development of embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.Development. 2006; 133: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog of β-catenin, a downstream effector of Wnt, is a mechanoregulator of transcription during gastrulation (Farge, 2003Farge E. Mechanical induction of Twist in the Drosophila foregut/stomodeal primordium.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1365-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and β-catenin is activated by mechanical loading during bone development (Hens et al., 2005Hens J.R. Wilson K.M. Dann P. Chen X. Horowitz M.C. Wysolmerski J.J. TOPGAL mice show that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is active during bone development and growth and is activated by mechanical loading in vitro.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Kang and Robling, 2015Kang K.S. Robling A.G. New insights into Wnt–Lrp5/6–β-catenin signaling in mechanotransduction.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2015; 5: 246PubMed Google Scholar), indicating its mechanosensitivity (Ou and Weaver, 2015Ou G. Weaver V.M. Tumor-induced solid stress activates β-catenin signaling to drive malignant behavior in normal, tumor-adjacent cells.BioEssays. 2015; 37: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the association of β-catenin with cell-cell adhesions and its regulation by cell-ECM signaling suggests that it may transduce adhesion-dependent force cues within the cell as a critically conserved node in mechanotransduction during development. The involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mediating mechanosignaling during mesoderm differentiation may, therefore, represent a system in which to study how changes in cytoskeletal organization affect cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts to influence response to differentiation cues and regulate developmental fate. Protocols exist to induce mesoderm specification of hESCs (Evseenko et al., 2010Evseenko D. Zhu Y. Schenke-Layland K. Kuo J. Latour B. Ge S. Scholes J. Dravid G. Li X. MacLellan W.R. Crooks G.M. Mapping the first stages of mesoderm commitment during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and geometric confinement of pluripotent stem cells was found to trigger differentiation into regionally organized ectoderm and mesendoderm (Warmflash et al., 2014Warmflash A. Sorre B. Etoc F. Siggia E.D. Brivanlou A.H. A method to recapitulate early embryonic spatial patterning in human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 847-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we leverage our ability to grow and differentiate hESCs on PA gels to explore how mechanical signals can integrate with soluble signals to regulate embryonic specification by differentially modulating cell-cell versus cell-ECM adhesion. We first examined the impact of ECM stiffness on hESC phenotype using gels functionalized with reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) that spanned a broad range of stiffness using an approach we previously described (Lakins et al., 2012Lakins J.N. Chin A.R. Weaver V.M. Exploring the link between human embryonic stem cell organization and fate using tension-calibrated extracellular matrix functionalized polyacrylamide gels.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 916: 317-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Przybyla et al., 2016Przybyla L. Lakins J.N. Sunyer R. Trepat X. Weaver V.M. Monitoring developmental force distributions in reconstituted embryonic epithelia.Methods. 2016; 94: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, hESCs were plated at high cell densities using 3D printed guides to rapidly form adherent, monolayered circular colonies with a diameter similar to the size of gastrulation-stage embryos (3 mm).This approach reduced the time to form coherent colonies from 8 to 10 days on the softest gels (Lakins et al., 2012Lakins J.N. Chin A.R. Weaver V.M. Exploring the link between human embryonic stem cell organization and fate using tension-calibrated extracellular matrix functionalized polyacrylamide gels.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 916: 317-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and normalized it to 3 days across the stiffness range. We found that hESCs remained viable, but they exhibited differences in morphology in response to stiffnesses that ranged from a soft substrate analogous to the stiffness of the gastrulation-stage embryo (E = 400 Pa) (Majkut et al., 2013Majkut S. Idema T. Swift J. Krieger C. Liu A. Discher D.E. Heart-specific stiffening in early embryos parallels matrix and myosin expression to optimize beating.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2434-2439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to much stiffer gels (E = 60 kPa) on which hESCs morphologically recapitulated hESCs cultured on tissue culture plastic (TCP; E = ∼3 GPa, Hollinger, 2011Hollinger J.O. An Introduction to Biomaterials.Second Edition. CRC Press, 2011Google Scholar). On the softest gels, hESCs assembled a columnar epithelium with extensive apical circumferential actin networks and pronounced cell-cell associations, while they spread appreciably and formed abundant basal actin stress fibers that emanated from cell-ECM contacts in response to the stiffest gel (Figure 1A). Although we observed a modest but significant enhancement of cell viability in the hESCs plated on the softest gels (Figure S1A), their proliferation was similar regardless of substrate stiffness (Figure 1B) and their rate of cell growth was equivalent (Figure S1B). Importantly, 5 days after culture, gross measures of pluripotency, including mRNA levels of the self-renewal markers Nanog and Oct4 (Figures 1C and S1C) and Oct4 protein (Figure 1D), remained unchanged. Moreover, hESCs re-plated onto fibroblast feeders from either the soft substrate or the stiff substrate adhered, spread, and retained pluripotency and viability for multiple passages (Figures 1E and S1D). Consistently, analysis of changes in genes involved in hESC self-renewal and lineage commitment, including ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm markers, were similar in cells grown on soft and stiff gels (Figures 1F and S1E). These findings indicate that, despite a marked effect on cell morphology, ECM stiffness has little to no direct effect on hESC differentiation or pluripotency. Although substrate compliance did not directly affect the differentiation of hESCs, the striking similarity in cytoarchitecture between hESCs on 400 Pa substrates to cells in the pregastrulation epiblast prompted us to ask whether hESCs would differentiate differently in response to exogenous morphogens associated with gastrulation. Directed differentiation protocols have been amended to include strategies that tune substrate stiffness to physiological levels to improve the differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells and adult neural stem cells (Gobaa et al., 2015Gobaa S. Hoehnel S. Lutolf M.P. Substrate elasticity modulates the responsiveness of mesenchymal stem cells to commitment cues.Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2015; 7: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Keung et al., 2011Keung A.J. de Juan-Pardo E.M. Schaffer D.V. Kumar S. Rho GTPases mediate the mechanosensitive lineage commitment of neural stem cells.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 1886-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and to enhance the propagation potential of adult satellite stem cells (Gilbert et al., 2010Gilbert P.M. Havenstrite K.L. Magnusson K.E.G. Sacco A. Leonardi N.A. Kraft P. Nguyen N.K. Thrun S. Lutolf M.P. Blau H.M. Substrate elasticity regulates skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal in culture.Science. 2010; 329: 1078-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we asked if the differentiation behavior of hESCs could be modified by culture on a substrate that approximated the stiffness of the gastrulation-stage embryo (400 Pa). Because mesoderm is specified early during gastrulation and represents a motile population that is responsive to mechanical cues, we applied a differentiation protocol designed to generate multipotent mesoderm progenitors (Evseenko et al., 2010Evseenko D. Zhu Y. Schenke-Layland K. Kuo J. Latour B. Ge S. Scholes J. Dravid G. Li X. MacLellan W.R. Crooks G.M. Mapping the first stages of mesoderm commitment during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to hESCs plated as monolayers on rBM (Figure 2A). On day 3.5 after the induction of mesoderm differentiation, we noted a significant increase in the percentage of cells expressing NCAM, a marker of mesoderm progenitor differentiation, in the hESCs on soft substrates as compared to those on the stiffer substrates (Figure 2B). Transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis confirmed that the increase in NCAM expression was accompanied by the upregulation of several mesoderm markers as well as genes reflecting the associated EMT (Figure 2C; Table S1). When we grouped the differential gene expression into gene ontology categories, we clearly observed a significant upregulation of terms involving mesoderm progenitor differentiation, morphogenesis, and development (Figure S2A), but not endoderm or ectoderm differentiation (Figure S2B). We validated the downregulation of self-renewal markers (Figure S2C) and the upregulation of a panel of mesoderm and EMT markers at the mRNA (Figure 2D) and protein levels (Figures 2E and 2F) in hESCs differentiated on soft, embryo-like as compared to stiff substrates. We also demonstrated that our observation was not confined to only one hESC line (Figures S2D and S2E). We found that E-cadherin levels dropped significantly following differentiation on hydrogels or on TCP (Figure 2G), consistent with the loss of E-cadherin expression observed upon initiation of EMT (Huber et al., 1996Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Cadherins and catenins in development.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, Takeichi, 1995Takeichi M. Morphogenetic roles of classic cadherins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for differences in cell proliferation, as indicated by phospho-HistoneH3 staining in differentiating hESCs on soft versus stiff matrices (Figure S2F). Moreover, prolonged incubation of morphogen-differentiated cells did not enhance mesoderm or EMT marker induction in the hESCs on the stiff matrices, thereby confirming the specificity of the enhanced differentiation induced on the compliant ECMs (Figure S2G). Importantly, the mesoderm progenitor cells generated on soft substrates could be further differentiated to generate mesenchymal stromal cells (Figure S2H) and cardiomyocytes (Figures S2I and S2J; Movie S1), emphasizing the functionality of the resulting mesoderm progenitors, as has been demonstrated previously (Evseenko et al., 2010Evseenko D. Zhu Y. Schenke-Layland K. Kuo J. Latour B. Ge S. Scholes J. Dravid G. Li X. MacLellan W.R. Crooks G.M. Mapping the first stages of mesoderm commitment during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These findings not only reveal that recreating the substrate compliance of the developing human embryo significantly enhances the ability of hESCs to differentiate toward mesoderm progenitors, they argue that substrate stiffness per se is insufficient and must synergize with developmental morphogens. Likewise, developmental morphogens are similarly insufficient and also must synergize with substrate stiffness, since lineages such as cardiomyocytes are clearly suppressed by stiff substrates, particularly with respect to their contractility dynamics (Majkut et al., 2014Majkut S. Dingal P.C.D.P. Discher D.E. Stress sensitivity and mechanotransduction during heart development.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: R495-R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We next explored how the tissue-level organization dictated by substrate compliance potentiated mesoderm progenitor differentiation. Noting that the Wnt family of secreted proteins is involved in both mesoderm differentiation (Lindsley et al., 2006Lindsley R.C. Gill J.G. Kyba M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Canonical Wnt signaling is required for development of embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.Development. 2006; 133: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and EMT (Howard et al., 2011Howard S. Deroo T. Fujita Y. Itasaki N. A positive role of cadherin in Wnt/β-catenin signalling during epithelial-mesenchymal transition.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we checked whether secreted Wnts were upregulated upon mesoderm induction of hESCs to potentiate autocrine signaling (Figure 3A). We quantified higher levels of Wnt mRNAs in cells differentiated on soft embryo-like versus stiff gels (Figures 3B and S3A), corresponding to an upregulation in protein expression of Wnt3a (Figure 3C), an essential mesoderm-inducing morphogen (Takada et al., 1994Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Wnt-3a regulates somite and tailbud formation in the mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Evidence of Wnt functionality was indicated using a 7×TCF-GFP reporter hESC line to assess transcriptional activity downstream of Wnt signaling. We found higher Wnt target transcriptional activity in hESCs differentiated on soft versus stiff gels, and we noted that addition of the Wnt inhibitor IWP2 repressed this activity (Figure 3D). To directly implicate Wnt signaling in mesoderm differentiation, we assessed the ability of IWP2 to inhibit mesoderm differentiation. Consistently, we noted that Wnt inhibition caused a decrease in mRNA and protein mesoderm marker induction (Figures 3E and 3F). Conversely, adding recombinant Wnt3a to cells on stiff substrates enhanced their ability to differentiate toward mesoderm (Figure 3G). Moreover, consistent with the notion that functional Wnts are secreted by cells on soft substrates, when we added conditioned media from cells grown on soft gels to cells on stiff gels, we noted a significant enhancement of their differentiation (Figure 3G). Likewise conditioned media from cells on stiff substrates decreased mesoderm markers in hESCs induced to differentiate on soft gels (Figure 3H), findings suggesting that cells on stiff gels may secrete factors that are inhibitory to Wnt signaling or mesoderm induction. Indeed, we detected elevated mRNA and protein levels of the Sfrp family of soluble secreted Wnt inhibitors in hESCs differentiated on the stiff gels (Figures 3I, 3J, and S3B). Of these, Sfrp1, which binds and inhibits Wnt3a extracellularly (Wawrzak et al., 2007Wawrzak D. Métioui M. Willems E. Hendrickx M. de Genst E. Leyns L. Wnt3a binds to several sFRPs in the nanomolar range.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was the most dramatically increased. Consistently, we quantified higher levels of Sfrp1 in hESCs differentiated on compliant gels when they were treated with IWP2, whereas we detected a decrease in cells on stiff gels in the presence of recombinant Wnt3a (Figure 3K). Further analysis revealed that multiple secreted factors that function as autocrine regulators of mesoderm differentiation also were induced in differentiating cells on soft gels (Figure S3C). These findings indicate that a substrate of compliance similar to that of an embryo enables the development of a Wnt-dependent feedforward signaling cascade that strengthens and reinforces mesoderm differentiation by enhancing the expression of Wnt activators and reducing the transcription of Wnt inhibitors. The data argue that, in the absence of a permissive microenvironment, such as on a stiff ECM, this feedforward mechanism does not become activated. This example of a self-reinforcing signaling mechanism is highly reminiscent of classic developmental programs, which frequently rely on robust, stable signal propagation to orchestrate coordinated tissue movements and to pattern tissue-specific differentiation and organization (Freeman and Gurdon, 2002Freeman M. Gurdon J.B. Regulatory principles of developmental signaling.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 515-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Gastrulation is a highly orchestrated process that requires precisely timed changes in intracellular protein expression and localization. We observed high Wnt transcript levels in hESC colonies but only following their morphogen-induced differentiation (Figures 4A and S4A), analogous to the strong upregulation of Wnt3a observed in the differentiating mesoderm cells migrating into the primitive streak during gastrulation (Chapman et al., 2004Chapman S.C. Brown R. Lees L. Schoenwolf G.C. Lumsden A. Expression analysis of chick Wnt and frizzled genes and selected inhibitors in early chick patterning.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Wnt acts canonically in vivo to stabilize β-catenin and enable its nuclear translocation and gene transcription activity, and, consistently, we observed a significant increase in nuclear β-catenin in differentiating hESC colonies (Figure 4B). We therefore asked whether hESCs on the soft gels were primed to upregulate Wnts prior to mesoderm differentiation (Figure 4C). The Wnt/β-catenin axis plays a critical role throughout early embryogenesis, where the levels and function of β-catenin are regulated through several mechanisms, including its spatial localization, stabilization, and degradation (Wang and Wynshaw-Boris, 2004Wang J. Wynshaw-Boris A. The canonical Wnt pathway in early mammalian embryogenesis and stem cell maintenance/differentiation.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, while β-catenin is required for mesoderm differentiation (Haegel et al., 1995Haegel H. Larue L. Ohsugi M. Fedorov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Lack of beta-catenin affects mouse development at gastrulation.Development. 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), β-catenin transcripts also are expressed earlier, throughout pre-streak and gastrulation-stage chick embryos (Schmidt et al., 2004Schmidt M. Patterson M. Farrell E. Münsterberg A. Dynamic expression of Lef/Tcf family members and β-catenin during chick gastrulation, neurulation, and early limb development.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and β-catenin is involved in the initiation of primitive streak formation (Skromne and Stern, 2001Skromne I. Stern C.D. Interactions between Wnt and Vg1 signalling pathways initiate primitive streak formation in the chick embryo.Development. 2001; 128: 2915-2927PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the role and status of β-catenin in undifferentiated hESCs cultured on s"

https://openalex.org/W2471934658,"A single bout of high intensity aerobic exercise (~90% VO2peak) was previously demonstrated to amplify off-line gains in skill level during the consolidation phase of procedural memory. High intensity exercise is not always a viable option for many patient groups or in a rehabilitation setting where low to moderate intensities may be more suitable. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of intensity in mediating the effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on motor skill learning. We investigated the effects of different exercise intensities on the retention (performance score) of a visuomotor accuracy tracking task. Thirty six healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups that performed either a single bout of aerobic exercise at 20 min post motor skill learning at 45% (EX45), 90% (EX90) maximal power output (Wmax) or rested (CON). Randomization was stratified to ensure that the groups were matched for relative peak oxygen consumption (ml O2/min/kg) and baseline score in the tracking task. Retention tests were carried out at 1 (R1) and 7 days (R7) post motor skill learning. At R1, changes in performance scores were greater for EX90 compared to CON (p<0.001) and EX45 (p = 0.011). The EX45 and EX90 groups demonstrated a greater change in performance score at R7 compared to the CON group (p = 0.003 and p<0.001, respectively). The change in performance score for EX90 at R7 was also greater than EX45 (p = 0.049). We suggest that exercise intensity plays an important role in modulating the effects that a single bout of cardiovascular exercise has on the consolidation phase following motor skill learning. There appears to be a dose-response relationship in favour of higher intensity exercise in order to augment off-line effects and strengthen procedural memory."
https://openalex.org/W2501155544,"Endodermal stem/progenitor cells have diverse potential applications in research and regenerative medicine, so a readily available source could have widespread uses. Here we describe derivation of human induced endodermal progenitor cells (hiEndoPCs) from gastrointestinal epithelial cells using a cocktail of defined small molecules along with support from tissue-specific mesenchymal feeders. The hiEndoPCs show clonal expansion in culture and give rise to hepatocytes, pancreatic endocrine cells, and intestinal epithelial cells when treated with defined soluble molecules directing differentiation. The hiEndoPC-derived hepatocytes are able to rescue liver failure in Fah-/-Rag2-/- mice after transplantation, and, unlike hESCs, transplanted hiEndoPCs do not give rise to teratomas. Since human gastric epithelial cells are readily available from donors of many ages, this conversion strategy can generate clonally expandable cell populations with a variety of potential applications, including personalized drug screening and therapeutic strategies for liver failure and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2499565557,"The spatial patterns of biodiversity and their underlying mechanisms have been an active area of research for a long time. In this study, a total of 63 samples (20m × 30m) were systematically established along elevation gradients on Mount Tai and Mount Lao, China. We explored altitudinal patterns of plant diversity in the two mountain systems. In order to understand the mechanisms driving current diversity patterns, we used phylogenetic approaches to detect the spatial patterns of phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic structure along two elevation gradients. We found that total species richness had a monotonically decreasing pattern and tree richness had a unimodal pattern along the elevation gradients in the two study areas. However, altitudinal patterns in shrub richness and herbs richness were not consistent on the two mountains. At low elevation, anthropogenic disturbances contributed to the increase of plant diversity, especially for shrubs and herbs in understory layers, which are more sensitive to changes in microenvironment. The phylogenetic structure of plant communities exhibited an inverted hump-shaped pattern along the elevation gradient on Mount Tai, which demonstrates that environmental filtering is the main driver of plant community assembly at high and low elevations and inter-specific competition may be the main driver of plant community assembly in the middle elevations. However, the phylogenetic structure of plant communities did not display a clear pattern on Mount Lao where the climate is milder. Phylogenetic beta diversity and species beta diversity consistently increased with increasing altitudinal divergence in the two study areas. However, the altitudinal patterns of species richness did not completely mirror phylogenetic diversity patterns. Conservation areas should be selected taking into consideration the preservation of high species richness, while maximizing phylogenetic diversity to improve the potential for diversification in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2504815856,"Finger millet is an important cereal crop in eastern Africa and southern India with excellent grain storage quality and unique ability to thrive in extreme environmental conditions. Since negligible attention has been paid to improving this crop to date, the current study used Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to develop both Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. Genomic DNA from cultivated finger millet genotypes KNE755 and KNE796 was sequenced using both Roche 454 and Illumina technologies. Non-organelle sequencing reads were assembled into 207 Mbp representing approximately 13% of the finger millet genome. We identified 10,327 SSRs and 23,285 non-homeologous SNPs and tested 101 of each for polymorphism across a diverse set of wild and cultivated finger millet germplasm. For the 49 polymorphic SSRs, the mean polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.42, ranging from 0.16 to 0.77. We also validated 92 SNP markers, 80 of which were polymorphic with a mean PIC of 0.29 across 30 wild and 59 cultivated accessions. Seventy-six of the 80 SNPs were polymorphic across 30 wild germplasm with a mean PIC of 0.30 while only 22 of the SNP markers showed polymorphism among the 59 cultivated accessions with an average PIC value of 0.15. Genetic diversity analysis using the polymorphic SNP markers revealed two major clusters; one of wild and another of cultivated accessions. Detailed STRUCTURE analysis confirmed this grouping pattern and further revealed 2 sub-populations within wild E. coracana subsp. africana. Both STRUCTURE and genetic diversity analysis assisted with the correct identification of the new germplasm collections. These polymorphic SSR and SNP markers are a significant addition to the existing 82 published SSRs, especially with regard to the previously reported low polymorphism levels in finger millet. Our results also reveal an unexploited finger millet genetic resource that can be included in the regional breeding programs in order to efficiently optimize productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2494553925,"Betula utilis, also known as Himalayan silver birch has been used as a traditional medicine for many health ailments like inflammatation, HIV, renal and bladder disorders as well as many cancers from ages. Here, we performed bio-guided fractionation of Betula utilis Bark (BUB), in which it was extracted in methanol and fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, n-butanol and water. All six fractions were evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer activity in nine different cancer cell lines and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be one of the most potent fractions in terms of inducing cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. By utilizing column chromatography, six triterpenes namely betulin, betulinic acid, lupeol, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid and β-amyrin have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of BUB and structures of these compounds were unraveled by spectroscopic methods. β-amyrin and UA were isolated for the first time from Betula utilis. Isolated triterpenes were tested for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against six different cancer cell lines where UA was found to be selective for breast cancer cells over non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A). Tumor cell selective apoptotic action of UA was mainly attributed due to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway via up regulation of DR4, DR5 and PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells over non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Moreover, UA mediated intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption also play a key role for its anti cancer effect. UA also inhibits breast cancer migration. Altogether, we discovered novel source of UA having potent tumor cell specific cytotoxic property, indicating its therapeutic potential against breast cancer."

We employed differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (hSMC) cultured from Type 2 diabetic (T2D) and non-diabetic (ND) subjects to investigate the impact of T2D on myokine secretion. Following 24 hours of culture concentrations of selected myokines were determined to range over 4 orders of magnitude. T2D hSMC released increased amounts of IL6, IL8, IL15, TNFa, Growth Related Oncogene (GRO)a, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and follistatin compared to ND myotubes. T2D and ND hSMC secreted similar levels of IL1ß and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment with the inflammatory agents lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitate augmented the secretion of many myokines including: GROa, IL6, IL8, IL15, and TNFa, but did not consistently alter the protein content and/or phosphorylation of IkBa, p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-kB, nor lead to consistent changes in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or free fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, treatment with pioglitazone or oleate resulted in modest reductions in the secretion of several myokines. Our results demonstrate that altered secretion of a number of myokines is an intrinsic property of skeletal muscle in T2D, suggesting a putative role of myokines in the response of skeletal muscle to T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2480131574,"Electroporation-induced cell sensitization was described as the occurrence of a delayed hypersensitivity to electric pulses caused by pretreating cells with electric pulses. It was achieved by increasing the duration of the electroporation treatment at the same cumulative energy input. It could be exploited in electroporation-based treatments such as electrochemotherapy and tissue ablation with irreversible electroporation. The mechanisms responsible for cell sensitization, however, have not yet been identified. We investigated cell sensitization dynamics in five different electroporation buffers. We split a pulse train into two trains varying the delay between them and measured the propidium uptake by fluorescence microscopy. By fitting the first-order model to the experimental results, we determined the uptake due to each train (i.e. the first and the second) and the corresponding resealing constant. Cell sensitization was observed in the growth medium but not in other tested buffers. The effect of pulse repetition frequency, cell size change, cytoskeleton disruption and calcium influx do not adequately explain cell sensitization. Based on our results, we can conclude that cell sensitization is a sum of several processes and is buffer dependent. Further research is needed to determine its generality and to identify underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2484808876,"E2F transcription factors are important regulators of the cell cycle, and unrestrained activation of E2F-dependent transcription is considered to be an important driver of tumor formation and progression. Although highly expressed in normal skin and skin cancer, the role of the atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8, in keratinocyte homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis is unknown. Surprisingly, keratinocyte-specific deletion of E2F7 and E2F8 in mice did not interfere with skin development and wound healing. However, the rate for successful isolation and establishment of E2f7/8-deficient primary keratinocyte cultures was much higher than for wild-type keratinocytes. Moreover, E2f7/8-deficient primary keratinocytes proliferate more efficiently under stress conditions, such as low/high confluence or DNA damage. Application of in vivo stress using the DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis protocol revealed that combined inactivation of E2f7/8 enhanced tumorigenesis and accelerated malignant progression. Loss of atypical E2Fs resulted in increased expression of E2F target genes, including E2f1. Additional loss of E2f1 did not rescue, but worsened skin tumorigenesis. We show that loss of E2F7/8 triggers apoptosis via induction of E2F1 in response to stress, indicating that the tumor-promoting effect of E2F7/8 inactivation can be partially compensated via E2F1-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, E2F7/8 repressed a large set of E2F target genes that are highly expressed in human patients with skin cancer. Together, our studies demonstrate that atypical E2Fs act as tumor suppressors, most likely via transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes in response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2495240332,"p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in humans. It functions mostly as a transcriptional factor and its activity is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications. Among different covalent modifications found on p53 the most controversial one is lysine methylation. We found that human G9a (hG9a) unlike its mouse orthologue (mG9a) potently stimulated p53 transcriptional activity. Both ectopic and endogenous hG9a augmented p53-dependent transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, including Bax and Puma, resulting in enhanced apoptosis and reduced colony formation. Significantly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of hG9a attenuated p53-dependent activation of Puma. On the molecular level, hG9a interacted with histone acetyltransferase, p300/CBP, resulting in increased histone acetylation at the promoter of Puma. The bioinformatics data substantiated our findings showing that positive correlation between G9a and p53 expression is associated with better survival of lung cancer patients. Collectively, this study demonstrates that depending on the cellular and organismal context, orthologous proteins may exert both overlapping and opposing functions. Furthermore, this finding has important ramifications on the use of G9a inhibitors in combination with genotoxic drugs to treat p53-positive tumors."

Rapid haploid identification method is critical for large-scale selections of double haploids. The conventional methods based on the color of the endosperm and embryo seeds are slow, manual and prone to error. On the other hand, there exists a significant difference between diploid and haploid seeds generated by high oil inducer, which makes it possible to use oil content to identify the haploid. This paper describes a fully-automated high-throughput NMR screening system for maize haploid kernel identification. The system is comprised of a sampler unit to select a single kernel to feed for measurement of NMR and weight, and a kernel sorter to distribute the kernel according to the measurement result. Tests of the system show a consistent accuracy of 94% with an average screening time of 4 seconds per kernel. Field test result is described and the directions for future improvement are discussed."

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence and changes in primary levofloxacin resistance related to H. pylori gyrA sequences. The study utilized H. pylori strains isolated from patients undergoing gastroscopy in Bogotá, Colombia from 2009 to 2014. Levofloxacin susceptibility was assessed by agar dilution. Mutations in gyrA sequences affecting the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were evaluated by direct sequencing. Overall, the mean prevalence of primary levofloxacin resistance was 18.2% (80 of 439 samples). Resistance increased from 11.8% (12/102) in 2009 to 27.3% (21/77) in 2014 (p = 0.001). gyrA mutations in levofloxacin resistant strains were present in QRDR positions 87 and 91. The most common mutation was N87I (43.8%, 35/80) followed by D91N (28.8%, 23/80) and N87K (11.3%, 9/80). Levofloxacin resistance increased markedly in Colombia during the six-year study period. Primary levofloxacin resistance was most often mediated by point mutations in gyrA, with N87I being the most common QRDR mutation related to levofloxacin resistance."

To specifically identify the roles of iPLA2γ in cardiac myocytes, we generated cardiac myocyte-specific iPLA2γ knock-out (CMiPLA2γKO) mice by removing the exon encoding the active site serine (Ser-477). Hearts of CMiPLA2γKO mice exhibited normal hemodynamic function, glycerophospholipid molecular species composition, and normal rates of mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. In contrast, CMiPLA2γKO mice demonstrated attenuated Ca2+-induced mPTP opening that could be rapidly restored by the addition of palmitate and substantially reduced production of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Furthermore, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in CMiPLA2γKO mice (30 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion in vivo) dramatically decreased oxidized fatty acid production in the ischemic border zones. Moreover, CMiPLA2γKO mice subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion in vivo developed substantially less cardiac necrosis in the area-at-risk in comparison with their WT littermates.

Through immunohistochemistry and cardiac myocyte-specific expression, iPLA2γ was shown to be localized to mitochondrial and peroxisomal compartments. Transgenic expression of iPLA2γ resulted in the dramatic increase of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine and 2-docosahexaenoyl lysophosphatidylcholine in cardiac myocytes (19Mancuso D.J.

These studies revealed that iPLA2γ loss of function dramatically reduced the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in liver mitochondria and that calcium challenge of myocardial mitochondria obtained from the iPLA2γ KO mouse markedly decreased the production of inflammatory eicosanoids in comparison with wild-type mice. However, germ line iPLA2γ KO mice displayed multiple defects in virtually every organ system studied, thus rendering definitive mechanistic interpretation of responses to in vivo cardiac ischemia difficult. To traverse this difficulty, in this study we generated cardiac myocyte-specific iPLA2γ knock-out mice (CMiPLA2γKO) by inserting flox sites proximal and distal to the active site serine of iPLA2γ (Ser-477 in exon 5) and subsequently excising the exon containing the active site by tamoxifen-activated cardiac myocyte-specific Cre recombinase. Utilizing this novel genetic mouse model, we have investigated the effects of cardiac myocyte-specific KO of iPLA2γ on ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. The regiospecificity of iPLA2γ toward phospholipid substrates is atypical among mammalian PLA2 enzymes in that the site of hydrolysis is dependent on the nature of the sn-2 aliphatic group (25Yan W. Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Sims H.F. Yang K. Gross R.W. The highly selective production of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine catalyzed by purified calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ: identification of a novel enzymatic mediator for the generation of a key branch point intermediate in eicosanoid signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26669-26679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Specifically, if the sn-2 group is saturated or contains a single double bond, iPLA2γ exhibits no preference for cleavage of the fatty acyl group at the sn-1 or sn-2 position. In sharp contrast, if the sn-2 substituent is polyunsaturated, iPLA2γ serves predominantly as a PLA1 releasing the saturated fatty acid from the sn-1 position and generating 2-polyunsaturated fatty acyl lysolipids. Thus, the regiospecificity of hydrolysis is determined by the degree of unsaturation in the sn-2 phospholipid constituent. This unusual feature allows the enzyme to accomplish multiple regulatory functions in mitochondria, including the release of palmitate in the inner membrane, which opens the mPTP, the generation of polyunsaturated lysophospholipids, which are readily hydrolyzed by endogenous lipases to lead to the production of bioactive oxidized fatty acids (e.g. eicosanoids, docosanoids, etc.), and the provision of fatty acid substrates for use in mitochondrial energy generation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that loss of cardiac iPLA2γ function would decrease I/R injury through a four-tiered synergistic mechanism involving the following: 1) attenuation of mPTP opening; 2) decreased inflammatory lipid second messengers; 3) preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential; and 4) attenuated release of toxic lipid metabolites (e.g. non-esterified saturated fatty acids, lysolipids, acyl-CoAs, and acylcarnitines) that accumulate during myocardial ischemia and are released during reperfusion. In this study, we utilized CMiPLA2γKO mice to investigate iPLA2γ-mediated mPTP opening upon calcium challenge, its role in the production of proinflammatory lipid metabolites (eicosanoids, docosanoids, and oxidized linoleic acid metabolites) in the border zone, and the development of cardiac necrosis after I/R in the absence of the confounding pathologies that were present in the germ line knock-out. Importantly, we demonstrate that myocardial loss of iPLA2γ function substantially reduces infarct size after I/R in vivo and markedly decreases production of inflammatory oxidized fatty acids (oxylipins) in the ischemic border zone. Through ablation of iPLA2γ-facilitated mPTP opening, generation of inflammatory lipid second messengers, and the release of toxic mitochondrial metabolites, a novel strategy to attenuate cardiac necrosis and inflammation during acute coronary syndromes has been identified. To definitively identify the mechanistic importance of iPLA2γ in cardiac myocytes, we engineered an inducible cardiac myocyte-specific knock-out of iPLA2γ. Because of the presence of multiple transcriptional start sites in iPLA2γ, our strategy was to flox exon 5 containing the active site and remove it by tamoxifen induction of cardiac myocyte-specific Cre recombinase (Fig. 1). Southern analysis for the floxed iPLA2γ allele in multiple tissues of the f/f mouse and PCR analyses for the identification of ablation of the PGK-neo cassette and iPLA2γf/f Cre+ in the iPLA2γ conditional KO mice are shown in Fig. 1. Northern and Western analyses demonstrated the specific ablation of iPLA2γ in heart but not in other tissues in the CMiPLA2γKO mouse (Fig. 1, E and F). Myocardium is composed of multiple cell types, including cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Although myocardium contains substantial amounts of iPLA2γ activity and protein, the cell type of origin of iPLA2γ is not known with certainty. Comparisons of WT Cre+ with CMiPLA2γKO mice definitively demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of iPLA2γ protein of murine myocardium is present in cardiac myocytes by tissue-specific knock-out mediated by the specificity of cardiac myocyte-specific expression of Cre recombinase. Moreover, the results of Fig. 1F demonstrate the diverse tissue-specific distribution of iPLA2γ isoforms (e.g. 88, 74, 63, and 52 kDa), which were previously identified by germ line knock-out and transgenic overexpression of iPLA2γ (9Moon S.H.

For example, note the predominance of the lower molecular mass iPLA2γ isoforms (50–60 kDa) in liver in comparison with myocardium and brain. Collectively, these results demonstrate that iPLA2γ in myocardium is predominantly located in cardiac myocytes and identify the tissue-specific distributions of different isoforms of iPLA2γ.

To examine mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency under different conditions, we utilized multiple substrates, including pyruvate/malate, palmitoylcarnitine/malate, and pyruvate/glutamate/malate. Mitochondria from CMiPLA2γKO mice demonstrated similar oxygen consumption rates in comparison with WT littermates during both state 2 and 3 respiration or after inhibition of complex I (rotenone) or complex V (oligomycin-induced state 4) (Fig. 2). The coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation (P/O ratio), which was determined by quantifying ATP production and O2 consumption during state 3 respiration, was not significantly different in WT versus CMiPLA2γKO mice (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the ability of mitochondria from the CMiPLA2γKO to respire normally and efficiently synthesize ATP. To determine alterations in the myocardial lipidome of WT versus CMiPLA2γKO mice, we utilized multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL) (26Han X. Yang K. Gross R.W. Multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics and novel strategies for lipidomic analyses.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2012; 31: 134-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The major phospholipid classes in myocardium are choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. Examination of choline glycerophospholipids demonstrated the presence of over 45 molecular species in murine myocardium that were largely composed of diacyl (D) phosphatidylcholine molecular species containing D16:0–22:6/D18:2–20:4, D18:0–22:6, D16:0–20:4/D18:2–18:2, D18:2–22:6, and D18:0–20:4/D18:2–20:2 in both the WT and the CMiPLA2γKO mice. Mirror plots of choline glycerophospholipids from averaged tandem mass spectra collected from six different mice demonstrated nearly identical profiles of individual molecular species (Fig. 3A). Similarly, MDMS-SL analysis of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids demonstrated over 30 diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species largely composed of D18:0–22:6, D16:0–22:6, D18:1–22:6, and D18:0–20:4 molecular species as well as 20 plasmenyl (P) ethanolamine phospholipid molecular species largely composed of P16:0–22:6, P18:1–20:4/P16:0–22:5, P18:0–22:6, and P18:1–22:6 molecular species. Mirror plots of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids from averaged mass spectra from six separate mice did not identify any significant differences between WT and CMiPLA2γKO mouse hearts (Fig. 3B). Triglyceride analysis by MDMS-SL demonstrated nearly identical total amounts of triglycerides and no differences in their molecular species composition in WT versus CMiPLA2γKO mice (Fig. 3C). Negative ion mass spectra did not reveal any significant differences in phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylglycerol molecular species (Fig. 3D).

Here, we quantify the prognostic impact of blood-based biomarkers on recurrence risk and long-term survival in a large cohort of gastrointestinal stroma tumor (GIST) patients after curative surgery.One-hundred-forty-nine consecutive GIST patients were followed-up for a median period of 4.8 years. Local recurrence, distant metastasis, and death occurred in 9, 21, and 31 patients, respectively. Time-to-event and competing risk analysis were applied to study the association between haemoglobin (Hb) level, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with risk of local or distant recurrence (RR), recurrence free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).A low Hb (p = 0.029), and elevations in the parameters WBC (p = 0.004), NLR (p = 0.015) and dNLR (p = 0.037) were associated with a poor OS in GIST patients in multivariate analysis. Moreover, a low Hb (p = 0.049) and an elevated WBC (p = 0.001), NLR (p = 0.007), dNLR (p = 0.043) and PLR (p = 0.024) were independently associated with decreased RFS after adjusting for Miettinen score. However, only an increase of dNLR/NLR showed a significant association to higher RR (p = 0.048). Inclusion of NLR or PLR to Miettinen risk score did not reasonably improve the clinical risk prediction of 2-year RFS.Low Hb, elevated WBC, elevated dNLR, and elevated PLR are independent prognostic factors for a worse clinical outcome in GIST patients after curative resection."
https://openalex.org/W2491657139,"Matter turnover in soil is tightly linked to soil structure which governs the heterogeneous distribution of habitats, reaction sites and pathways in soil. Thereby, the temporal dynamics of soil structure alteration is deemed to be important for essential ecosystem functions of soil but very little is known about it. A major reason for this knowledge gap is the lack of methods to study soil structure turnover directly at microscopic scales. Here we devise a conceptual approach and an image processing workflow to study soil structure turnover by labeling some initial state of soil structure with small garnet particles and tracking their fate with X-ray microtomography. The particles adhere to aggregate boundaries at the beginning of the experiment but gradually change their position relative to the nearest pore as structure formation progresses and pores are destructed or newly formed. A new metric based on the contact distances between particles and pores is proposed that allows for a direct quantification of soil structure turnover rates. The methodology is tested for a case study about soil compaction of a silty loam soil during stepwise increase of bulk density (ρ = {1.1, 1.3, 1.5} g/cm3). We demonstrate that the analysis of mean contact distances provides genuinely new insights about changing diffusion pathways that cannot be inferred neither from conventional pore space attributes (porosity, mean pore size, pore connectivity) nor from deformation analysis with digital image correlation. This structure labeling approach to quantify soil structure turnover provides a direct analogy to stable isotope labeling for the analysis of matter turnover and can be readily combined with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2496337554,"DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 are three of the most replicated dyslexia candidate genes (DCGs). Recently, these DCGs were implicated in functions at the cilium. Here, we investigate the regulation of these DCGs by Regulatory Factor X transcription factors (RFX TFs), a gene family known for transcriptionally regulating ciliary genes. We identify conserved X-box motifs in the promoter regions of DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 and demonstrate their functionality, as well as the ability to recruit RFX TFs using reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, we uncover a complex regulation pattern between RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 and their significant effect on modifying the endogenous expression of DYX1C1 and DCDC2 in a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line immortalized with hTERT (hTERT-RPE1). In addition, induction of ciliogenesis increases the expression of RFX TFs and DCGs. At the protein level, we show that endogenous DYX1C1 localizes to the base of the cilium, whereas DCDC2 localizes along the entire axoneme of the cilium, thereby validating earlier localization studies using overexpression models. Our results corroborate the emerging role of DCGs in ciliary function and characterize functional noncoding elements, X-box promoter motifs, in DCG promoter regions, which thus can be targeted for mutation screening in dyslexia and ciliopathies associated with these genes.-Tammimies, K., Bieder, A., Lauter, G., Sugiaman-Trapman, D., Torchet, R., Hokkanen, M.-E., Burghoorn, J., Castrén, E., Kere, J., Tapia-Páez, I., Swoboda, P.

https://openalex.org/W2498901901,"In clinical states associated with systemic oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), oxidative modifications of serum albumin impair its quantification, resulting in apparent hypoalbuminemia. As the maintenance of oncotic pressure/colloid osmotic pressure (COP) is a major function of albumin, this study examined the impact of albumin oxidation on COP, both in-vivo and in-vitro.Patients with proteinuria and patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) with systemic inflammation and OS were enrolled. Blood samples were collected from 134 subjects: 32 healthy controls (HC), proteinuric patients with high (n = 17) and low (n = 31) systemic inflammation and from 54 patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) with the highest levels of OS and inflammation.In-vitro oxidized albumin showed significantly higher COP values than non-oxidized albumin at identical albumin levels. In vivo, in hypoalbuminemic HD patients with the highest OS and inflammation, COP values were also higher than expected for the low albumin levels. The contribution to COP by other prevalent plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen and immunoglobulins was negligible. We imply that the calculation of COP based on albumin levels should be revisited in face of OS and inflammation. Hence, in hypoalbuminemic proteinuric patients with systemic OS and inflammation the assumption of low COP should be verified by its measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2476621834,"Aims Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. Recurrence is inevitable and most likely connected to tumor invasion and presence of therapy resistant stem-like tumor cells. The aim was therefore to establish and characterize a three-dimensional in vivo-like in vitro model taking invasion and tumor stemness into account. Methods Glioblastoma stem cell-like containing spheroid (GSS) cultures derived from three different patients were established and characterized. The spheroids were implanted in vitro into rat brain slice cultures grown in stem cell medium and in vivo into brains of immuno-compromised mice. Invasion was followed in the slice cultures by confocal time-lapse microscopy. Using immunohistochemistry, we compared tumor cell invasion as well as expression of proliferation and stem cell markers between the models. Results We observed a pronounced invasion into brain slice cultures both by confocal time-lapse microscopy and immunohistochemistry. This invasion closely resembled the invasion in vivo. The Ki-67 proliferation indexes in spheroids implanted into brain slices were lower than in free-floating spheroids. The expression of stem cell markers varied between free-floating spheroids, spheroids implanted into brain slices and tumors in vivo. Conclusion The established invasion model kept in stem cell medium closely mimics tumor cell invasion into the brain in vivo preserving also to some extent the expression of stem cell markers. The model is feasible and robust and we suggest the model as an in vivo-like model with a great potential in glioma studies and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2488519071,"Tumour suppressor p53 or proto-oncogene MYC is frequently altered in squamous carcinomas, but this is insufficient to drive carcinogenesis. We have shown that overactivation of MYC or loss of p53 via DNA damage triggers an anti-oncogenic differentiation-mitosis checkpoint in human epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in impaired cell division and squamous differentiation. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a transcription factor recently proposed to govern the expression of a set of mitotic genes. Deregulation of FOXM1 occurs in a wide variety of epithelial malignancies. We have ectopically expressed FOXM1 in keratinocytes of the skin after overexpression of MYC or inactivation of endogenous p53. Ectopic FOXM1 rescues the proliferative capacity of MYC- or p53-mutant cells in spite of higher genetic damage and a larger cell size typical of differentiation. As a consequence, differentiation induced by loss of p53 or MYC is converted into increased proliferation and keratinocytes displaying genomic instability are maintained within the proliferative compartment. The results demonstrate that keratinocyte oncogene-induced differentiation is caused by mitosis control and provide new insight into the mechanisms driving malignant progression in squamous cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2492585857,"Post-stroke cognitive dysfunction greatly influences patients' quality of life after stroke. However, its neurophysiological basis remains unknown. This study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the alterations in regional coherence in patients after subcortical stroke.Resting-state fMRI measurements were acquired from 16 post-stroke patients with poor cognitive function (PSPC), 16 post-stroke patients with good cognitive function (PSGC) and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HC). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to detect alterations in regional coherence. Abnormalities in regional coherence correlated with scores on neuropsychological scales.Compared to the HC and the PSGC, the PSPC showed remarkably decreased ReHo in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and the left posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. ReHo in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex positively correlated with the scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (r = 0.399, P = 0.036) and the Complex Figure Test-delayed recall subtest (r = 0.397, P = 0.036) in all post-stroke patients. Moreover, ReHo in the left posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus positively correlated with the scores on the Forward Digit Span Test (r = 0.485, P = 0.009) in all post-stroke patients.Aberrant regional coherence was observed in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in post-stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. ReHo could represent a promising indicator of neurobiological deficiencies in post-stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2499091050,"Emerging evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of microvasculature injury in the development and progression of renal fibrosis. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) is a secreted vascular growth factor that binds to the endothelial-specific Tie2 receptor. Ang-1/Tie2 signaling is critical for regulating blood vessel development and modulating vascular response after injury, but is dispensable in mature, quiescent vessels. Although dysregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling has been well studied in renal pathologies, much less is known about the role of the Ang-1/Tie2 pathway in renal interstitial fibrosis. Previous studies have shown contradicting effects of overexpressing Ang-1 systemically on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis when different engineered forms of Ang-1 are used. Here, we investigated the impact of site-directed expression of native Ang-1 on the renal fibrogenic process and peritubular capillary network by exploiting a conditional transgenic mouse system [Pax8-rtTA/(TetO)7 Ang-1] that allows increased tubular Ang-1 production in adult mice. Using a murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) fibrosis model, we demonstrate that targeted Ang-1 overexpression attenuates myofibroblast activation and interstitial collagen I accumulation, inhibits the upregulation of transforming growth factor β1 and subsequent phosphorylation of Smad 2/3, dampens renal inflammation, and stimulates the growth of peritubular capillaries in the obstructed kidney. Our results suggest that Ang-1 is a potential therapeutic agent for targeting microvasculature injury in renal fibrosis without compromising the physiologically normal vasculature in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2502570836,"Denture stomatitis (DS) is characterized by inflammation of the oral mucosa in direct contact with dentures and affects a significant number of otherwise healthy denture wearers. The disease is caused by Candida albicans, which readily colonizes and form biofilms on denture materials. While evidence for biofilms on abiotic and biotic surfaces initiating Candida infections is accumulating, a role for biofilms in DS remains unclear. Using an established model of DS in immunocompetent animals, the purpose of this study was to determine the role of biofilm formation in mucosal damage during pathogenesis using C. albicans or mutants defective in morphogenesis (efg1-/-) or biofilm formation (bcr1-/-). For in vivo analyses, rats fitted with custom dentures, consisting of fixed and removable parts, were inoculated with wild-type C. albicans, mutants or reconstituted strains and monitored weekly for fungal burden (denture and palate), body weight and tissue damage (LDH) for up to 8 weeks. C. albicans wild-type and reconstituted mutants formed biofilms on dentures and palatal tissues under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions as indicated by microscopy demonstrating robust biofilm architecture and extracellular matrix (ECM). In contrast, both efg1-/- and bcr1-/- mutants exhibited poor biofilm growth with little to no ECM. In addition, quantification of fungal burden showed reduced colonization throughout the infection period on dentures and palates of rats inoculated with efg1-/-, but not bcr1-/-, compared to controls. Finally, rats inoculated with efg1-/- and bcr1-/- mutants had minimal palatal tissue damage/weight loss while those inoculated with wild-type or reconstituted mutants showed evidence of tissue damage and exhibited stunted weight gain. These data suggest that biofilm formation is associated with tissue damage during DS and that Efg1 and Bcr1, both central regulators of virulence in C. albicans, have pivotal roles in pathogenesis of DS."
https://openalex.org/W2495925703,"Parents report psychological distress in association with their child's cancer. Reliable tools are needed to screen parental distress over the cancer trajectory. This study aimed to estimate the stability and repeatability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and the Depression and Anxiety items of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised (ESAS-r-D; -A) in parents of children diagnosed with cancer.Fifty parents (28 mothers, median age = 44) of clinically stable survivors of childhood solid and brain tumours completed questionnaires about their own distress (DT, ESAS-r-D; -A, Brief Symptom Inventory-18: BSI-18, Patient Health Questionnaire-9: PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7: GAD-7) and their children's quality of life (QoL; Peds Quality of Life: PedsQL) twice, with a month interval between the two assessments. At retest, parents also evaluated life events that occurred between the two time points. Hierarchical regressions explored moderators for the temporal stability of test measures.Stability estimates were ICC = .78 for the DT, .55 for the ESAS-r-D, and .47 for the ESAS-r-A. Caseness agreement between test and retest was substantial for the DT, fair for the ESAS-r-D, and slight for the ESAS-r-A. Repeatability analyses indicated that the error range for the DT was more than 2 pts below/above actual measurement, whereas it was more than 3 pts for the ESAS-r-A, and 2.5 for the ESAS-r-D. Instability of the DT could be explained by changes in children's physical QoL, but not by other components of QoL or life events. No moderators of stability could be identified for the ESAS-r items.The DT appears to be a fairly stable measure when the respondent's condition is stable yet with a relatively wide error range. Fluctuations in distress-related constructs may affect the temporal stability of the DT. The lower stability of ESAS-r items may result from shorter time-lapse instructions resulting in a greater sensitivity to change. Findings support future research on the DT as a reliable instrument in caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2496142342,"Background Leisure activity participation has been shown to lower risks of cognitive decline in non-stroke populations. However, effects of leisure activities participation upon cognitive functions and risk of dementia after stroke are unclear. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of recent past leisure activities participation upon cognitive functions and risk of incident dementia after stroke. Methods Hospital-based, retrospective cohort study. 88 of 1,013 patients with stroke or TIA having no prestroke dementia were diagnosed to have incident poststroke dementia (PSD) 3–6 months after stroke. Regular participation (≥3 times per week) in intellectual, recreational, social and physical activities over the year before the index stroke was retrospectively recorded at 3–6 months after stroke. Results Logistic regression analyses showed that regular participation in intellectual (RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.20–0.63) and stretching & toning physical exercise (0.37, 0.21–0.64) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of PSD after controlling for age, education, prestroke cognitive decline, stroke subtype, prior strokes and chronic brain changes including white matter changes, old infarcts and global atrophy. Results were similar in patients with past strokes in unadjusted models. Participation in increased number of activities in general (r = 0.41, p<0.01) and in intellectual (r = 0.40, p<0.01), recreational (r = 0.24, p<0.01), strenuous aerobic (r = 0.23, p<0.01) and mind-body (r = 0.10, p<0.01) activities was associated with higher poststroke Mini-mental State Examination scores in models adjusted for prestroke cognitive decline. Conclusions Regular participation in intellectual activities and stretching & toning exercise was associated with a significantly reduced short-term risk of PSD in patients with and without recurrent strokes. Participation in greater number of recent past leisure activities was associated with better poststroke cognitive performance. Findings of this retrospective cohort study call for studies of activity intervention for prevention of cognitive decline in individuals at elevated risk of stroke."

https://openalex.org/W2506663931,"This article presents an improved Filtering Facepiece Respirator (FFR) designed to increase the comfort of wearers during low-moderate work. The improved FFR aims to lower the deadspace temperature and CO2 level by an active ventilation fan. The reversing modeling is used to build the 3D geometric model of this FFR; the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is then introduced to investigate the flow field. Based on the simulation result, the ventilation fan of the improved FFR can fit the flow field well when placed in the proper blowing orientation; streamlines from this fan show a cup-shape distribution and are perfectly matched to the shape of the FFR and human face when the fan blowing inward. In the deadspace of the improved FFR, the CO2 volume fraction is controlled by the optimized flow field. In addition, an experimental prototype of the improved FFR has been tested to validate the simulation. A wireless temperature sensor is used to detect the temperature variation inside the prototype FFR, deadspace temperature is lowered by 2 K compared to the normal FFR without a fan. An infrared camera (IRC) method is used to elucidate the temperature distribution on the prototype FFR's outside surface and the wearer's face, surface temperature is lowered notably. Both inside and outside temperature results from the simulation are in agreement with experimental results. Therefore, adding an inward-blowing fan on the outer surface of an N95 FFR is a feasible approach to reducing the deadspace CO2 concentration and improve temperature comfort."
https://openalex.org/W2503121042,"Colonization of wood blocks by brown and white rot fungi rapidly resulted in detectable wood oxidation, as shown by a reduced phloroglucinol response, a loss of autofluorescence, and acridine orange (AO) staining. This last approach is shown to provide a novel method for identifying wood oxidation. When lignin was mildly oxidized, the association between AO and lignin was reduced such that stained wood sections emitted less green light during fluorescence microscopy. This change was detectable after less than a week, an interval that past work has shown to be too short for significant delignification of wood. Although fungal hyphae were observed in only a few wood lumina, oxidation was widespread, appearing relatively uniform over regions several hundred micrometers from the hyphae. This observation suggests that both classes of fungi release low molecular weight mild oxidants during the first few days of colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2505972010,"Small amounts of cyclic monomers and oligomers are present in polyamide (PA)-based kitchen utensils. In this study, we isolated eight PA-based cyclic monomers and oligomers from kitchen utensils made from PA6 (a polymer of ε-caprolactam) and PA66 (a polymer of 1,6-diaminohexane and adipic acid). Their structures were identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry and 1H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their residual levels in PA-based kitchen utensils and degree of migration into food simulants were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using purchased PA6 monomer and isolated PA66 monomers, and isolated PA6 and PA66 oligomers as calibration standards. Their total residual levels among 23 PA-based kitchen utensils made from PA6, PA66, and copolymers of PA6 and PA66 (PA6/66) ranged from 7.8 to 20 mg/g. Using water, 20% ethanol, and olive oil as food simulants, the total migration levels of the PA monomers and oligomers ranged from 0.66 to 100 μg/cm2 under most examined conditions. However, the total migration levels of the PA66 monomer and oligomers from PA66 and PA6/66 kitchen utensils into 20% ethanol at 95°C were very high (1,700 and 2,200 μg/cm2, respectively) due to swelling by high-temperature ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2481037500,"The β3-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling pathway is a major component of adaptive thermogenesis in brown and white adipose tissue during cold acclimation. The β3-AR signaling highly induces the expression of transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α and its splice variant N-terminal (NT)-PGC-1α, which in turn activate the transcription program of adaptive thermogenesis by co-activating a number of transcription factors. We previously reported that NT-PGC-1α is able to increase mitochondrial number and activity in cultured brown adipocytes by promoting the expression of mitochondrial and thermogenic genes. In the present study, we performed genome-wide profiling of NT-PGC-1α-responsive genes in brown adipocytes to identify genes potentially regulated by NT-PGC-1α. Canonical pathway analysis revealed that a number of genes upregulated by NT-PGC-1α are highly enriched in mitochondrial pathways including fatty acid transport and β-oxidation, TCA cycle and electron transport system, thus reinforcing the crucial role of NT-PGC-1α in the enhancement of mitochondrial function. Moreover, canonical pathway analysis of NT-PGC-1α-responsive genes identified several metabolic pathways including glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. In order to validate the identified genes in vivo, we utilized the FL-PGC-1α-/- mouse that is deficient in full-length PGC-1α (FL-PGC-1α) but expresses a slightly shorter and functionally equivalent form of NT-PGC-1α (NT-PGC-1α254). The β3-AR-induced increase of NT-PGC-1α254 in FL-PGC-1α-/- brown and white adipose tissue was closely associated with elevated expression of genes involved in thermogenesis, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. Increased adipose tissue thermogenesis by β3-AR activation resulted in attenuation of adipose tissue expansion in FL-PGC-1α-/- adipose tissue under the high-fat diet condition. Together, the data strengthen our previous findings that NT-PGC-1α regulates mitochondrial genes involved in thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism in brown and white adipocytes and further suggest that NT-PGC-1α regulates a broad spectrum of genes to meet cellular needs for adaptive thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2485712345,"Baculoviruses are insect-specific pathogens with a generally narrow host ranges. Successful primary infection is initiated by the proper interaction of at least 8 conserved per os infectivity factors (PIFs) with the host's midgut cells, a process that remains largely a mystery. In this study, we investigated the host specificities of the four core components of the PIF complex, P74, PIF1, PIF2 and PIF3 by using Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) backbone. The four pifs of HearNPV were replaced by their counterparts from a group I Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) or a group II Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV). Transfection and infection assays showed that all the recombinant viruses were able to produce infectious budded viruses (BVs) and were lethal to H. armigera larvae via intrahaemocoelic injection. However, feeding experiments using very high concentration of occlusion bodies demonstrated that all the recombinant viruses completely lost oral infectivity except SpltNPV pif3 substituted pif3-null HearNPV (vHaBacΔpif3-Sppif3-ph). Furthermore, bioassay result showed that the median lethal concentration (LC50) value of vHaBacΔpif3-Sppif3-ph was 23-fold higher than that of the control virus vHaBacΔpif3-Hapif3-ph, indicating that SpltNPV pif3 can only partially substitute the function of HearNPV pif3. These results suggested that most of PIFs tested have strict host specificities, which may account, at least in part, for the limited host ranges of baculoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2503291124,"Extracellular pyrophosphate is a potent endogenous inhibitor of vascular calcification, which is degraded by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and generated by hydrolysis of ATP via ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). ALP activity (as routinely measured in clinical practice) represents the maximal activity (in ideal conditions), but not the real activity (in normal or physiological conditions). For the first time, the present study investigated extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism during hemodialysis sessions (including its synthesis via eNPP1 and its degradation via ALP) in physiological conditions.45 patients in hemodialysis were studied. Physiological ALP activity represents only 4-6% of clinical activity. ALP activity increased post-hemodialysis by 2% under ideal conditions (87.4 ± 3.3 IU/L vs. 89.3 ± 3.6 IU/L) and 48% under physiological conditions (3.5 ± 0.2 IU/L vs. 5.2 ± 0.2 IU/L). Pyrophosphate synthesis by ATP hydrolysis remained unaltered post-hemodialysis. Post-hemodialysis plasma pH (7.45 ± 0.02) significantly increased compared with the pre-dialysis pH (7.26 ± 0.02). The slight variation in pH (~0.2 units) induced a significant increase in ALP activity (9%). Addition of phosphate in post-hemodialysis plasma significantly decreased ALP activity, although this effect was not observed with the addition of urea. Reduction in phosphate levels and increment in pH were significantly associated with an increase in physiological ALP activity post-hemodialysis. A decrease in plasma pyrophosphate levels (3.3 ± 0.3 μmol/L vs. 1.9 ± 0.1 μmol/L) and pyrophosphate/ATP ratio (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) post-hemodialysis was also observed.Extraction of uremic toxins, primarily phosphate and hydrogen ions, dramatically increases the ALP activity under physiological conditions. This hitherto unknown consequence of hemodialysis suggests a reinterpretation of the clinical value of this parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2499156035,"Red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio) behave quite differently towards two common nest predators. While the European jay (Garrulus glandarius) is commonly attacked, in the presence of the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), shrikes stay fully passive. We tested the hypotheses that this passive response to the magpie is an alternative defense strategy. Nesting shrikes were exposed to the commonly attacked European kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in a situation in which i) a harmless domestic pigeon, ii) a commonly attacked European jay, and iii) a non-attacked black-billed magpie are (separately) presented nearby. The kestrel dummy presented together with the magpie dummy was attacked with a significantly lower intensity than when it was presented with the other intruders (pigeon, jay) or alone. This means that the presence of the magpie inhibited the shrike’s defense response towards the other intruder. These results support our previous hypotheses that shrikes use an alternative defense strategy in the magpie’s presence. We hypothesize that the magpie is able to associate the active defense of the shrikes with the close proximity of a nest and that shrikes try not to draw the magpie’s attention to the nest. The reason why this strategy is not used against the jay remains unanswered as jays as well as magpies show very similar cognitive and foraging skills enabling them to individuate the nest presence according to active parental defense."
https://openalex.org/W2502254434,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine is considered a multifactorial and polygenic disease. We aimed to investigate the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pre-miRNAs [miR-146aC>G (rs2910164), miR-149T>C (rs2292832), miR-196a2T>C (rs11614913), and miR-499A>G (rs3746444)] and the risk of cervical OPLL in the Korean population.The genotypic frequencies of these four SNPs were analyzed in 207 OPLL patients and 200 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.For four SNPs in pre-miRNAs, no significant differences were found between OPLL patients and controls. However, subgroup analysis based on OPLL subgroup (continuous: continuous type plus mixed type, segmental: segmental and localized type) showed that miR-499GG genotype was associated with an increased risk of segmental type OPLL (adjusted odds ratio = 4.314 with 95% confidence interval: 1.109-16.78). In addition, some allele combinations (C-T-T-G, G-T-T-A, and G-T-C-G of miR-146a/-149/-196a2/-499) and combined genotypes (miR-149TC/miR-196a2TT) were associated with increased OPLL risk, whereas the G-T-T-G and G-C-C-G allele combinations were associated with decreased OPLL risk.The results indicate that GG genotype of miR-499 is associated with significantly higher risks of OPLL in the segmental OPLL group. The miR-146a/-149/-196a2/-499 allele combinations may be a genetic risk factor for cervical OPLL in the Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W2502965675,"Epithelial cells acquire migratory/invasive and stemness traits upon conversion to the mesenchymal phenotype. The expression of E-cadherin is a key to this transition; yet precise understanding of the pathways involved in integrating E-cadherin loss to the gain of mesenchymal traits remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphoinositide-generating enzyme, PIPKIγ, expression is upregulated upon epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and together with the cytoskeletal protein talin assemble into a signaling complex upon E-cadherin loss. PIPKIγ and talin together control the adhesion and phosphoinositide signaling that regulates conversion to the mesenchymal phenotypes. PIPKIγ and talin regulate the stability of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, snail and slug, induced by transforming growth factor-β1 or extracellular matrix protein. Loss of PIPKIγ or talin or their interaction impaired EMT and the acquisition of cell motility and stemness. This demonstrates a mechanism where a phosphoinositide-generating enzyme PIPKIγ couples with a cytoskeletal protein talin to control the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2499029373,"Based on (i) an analysis of the regularities in the standard genetic code and (ii) comparative genomics of the anticodon modification machinery in the three branches of life, we derive the tRNA set and its anticodon modifications as it was present in LUCA. Previously we proposed that an early ancestor of LUCA contained a set of 23 tRNAs with unmodified anticodons that was capable of translating all 20 amino acids while reading 55 of the 61 sense codons of the standard genetic code (SGC). Here we use biochemical and genomic evidence to derive that LUCA contained a set of 44 or 45 tRNAs containing 2 or 3 modifications while reading 59 or 60 of the 61 sense codons. Subsequent tRNA modifications occurred independently in the Bacteria and Eucarya, while the Archaea have remained quite close to the tRNA set as it was present in LUCA."
https://openalex.org/W2501580022,"Stress granules (SGs) in response to various stresses have been reported in many diseases. We previously reported the implication of programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) in obesity-induced stress responses, but the possible link between Pdcd4 and SGs remains lacking. In this study we showed that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) or high-fat diet (HFD) induced SG formation in mouse macrophages and liver tissues, and Pdcd4 deficiency in mice remarkably reduced its formation. In response to ox-LDL, either endogenous or ectopic Pdcd4 displayed granule-like expression and co-localized with SG markers including T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1, fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A. Ectopic expression of truncated Pdcd4 that depleted specific RNA-binding motif significantly disrupted the SG formation, suggesting the direct involvement of Pdcd4 in ox-LDL-induced SGs through its RNA-binding activity. Additionally, Pdcd4 deficiency drove AKT activation and suppression of eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby contributing to the resistance to ox-LDL or HFD-induced SG formation. Collectively, our data suggest that Pdcd4 as a crucial regulator in SGs induced by ox-LDL or HFD maybe a potential target for mitigating SG-associated stress responses in obesity and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2490678273,"GlnR-mediated repression of the GlnR regulon at acidic pH is required for optimal acid tolerance in Streptococcus mutans, the etiologic agent for dental caries. Unlike most streptococci, the GlnR regulon is also regulated by newly identified PmrA (SMUGS5_RS05810) at the transcriptional level in S. mutans GS5. Results from gel mobility shift assays confirmed that both GlnR and PmrA recognized the putative GlnR box in the promoter regions of the GlnR regulon genes. By using a chemostat culture system, we found that PmrA activated the expression of the GlnR regulon at pH 7, and that this activation was enhanced by excess glucose. Deletion of pmrA (strain ΔPmrA) reduced the survival rate of S. mutans GS5 at pH 3 moderately, whereas the GlnR mutant (strain ΔGlnR) exhibited an acid-sensitive phenotype in the acid killing experiments. Elevated biofilm formation in both ΔGlnR and ΔPmrA mutant strains is likely a result of indirect regulation of the GlnR regulon since GlnR and PmrA regulate the regulon differently. Taken together, it is suggested that activation of the GlnR regulon by PmrA at pH 7 ensures adequate biosynthesis of amino acid precursor, whereas repression by GlnR at acidic pH allows greater ATP generation for acid tolerance. The tight regulation of the GlnR regulon in response to pH provides an advantage for S. mutans to better survive in its primary niche, the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2487188975,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)is the fifth most common malignancy associated with high mortality. One of the risk factors for HCC is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The treatment strategy for the disease is dependent on the stage of HCC, and the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system is used in most HCC cases. However, the molecular characteristics of HBV-related HCC in different BCLC stages are still unknown. Using GSE14520 microarray data from HBV-related HCC cases with BCLC stages from 0 (very early stage) to C (advanced stage) in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including common DEGs and unique DEGs in different BCLC stages, were identified. These DEGs were located on different chromosomes. The molecular functions and biology pathways of DEGs were identified by gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and the interactome networks of DEGs were constructed using the NetVenn online tool. The results revealed that both common DEGs and stage-specific DEGs were associated with various molecular functions and were involved in special biological pathways. In addition, several hub genes were found in the interactome networks of DEGs. The identified DEGs and hub genes promote our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of HBV-related HCC through the different BCLC stages, and might be used as staging biomarkers or molecular targets for the treatment of HCC with HBV infection."

Early age of puberty is associated with non-communicable diseases in adulthood, and may be a long-term driver of population health with effects over generations. In a non-Western setting, we examined the association of maternal age of menarche with blood pressure in late childhood/adolescence.We used generalised estimating equations to estimate the adjusted association of maternal age of menarche with age-, sex- and height-adjusted blood pressure z-score from 10 to 16 years in Hong Kong's population-representative birth cohort, ""Children of 1997"" (n = 8327). We also assessed whether associations were mediated by body mass index (BMI) or pubertal stage.Earlier maternal age of menarche was associated with higher systolic blood pressure in adolescence [-0.02 z-score per year older maternal age of menarche, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to -0.003]. The association of maternal age of menarche with systolic blood pressure was mediated by adiposity and/or pubertal stage at 11 years. Maternal age of menarche was not associated with diastolic blood pressure.Earlier maternal age of puberty was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, largely mediated by adiposity, highlighting the importance of tackling childhood obesity as a public health priority in view of the secular trend of declining age of puberty."
