https://openalex.org/W2009544440,"Many oceanic island basalts show sublinear subparallel arrays in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic space. The depleted upper mantle is rarely a mixing end-member of these arrays, as would be expected if mantle plumes originated at a 670-kilometer boundary layer and entrained upper mantle during ascent. Instead, the arrays are fan-shaped and appear to converge on a volume in isotopic space characterized by low (87)Sr/(86)Sr and high (143)Nd/(144)Nd, (206)Pb/(204)Pb, and (3)He/(4)He ratios. This new isotopic component may be the lower mantle, entrained into plumes originating from the core-mantle boundary layer."

To produce PHB by genetic engineering in plants, genes from the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus that encoded the two enzymes required to convert acetoacetyl-coenzyme A to PHB were placed under transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana. Transgenic plant lines that contained both genes accumulated PHB as electron-lucent granules in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and vacuole; the size and appearance of these granules were similar to the PHB granules that accumulate in bacteria."

A dodecahedral structure of T(h) point symmetry accounts for the stability of these ionic clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1986472472,"Untrained Octopus vulgaris (observers) were allowed to watch conditioned Octopus(demonstrators) perform the task of selecting one of two objects that were presented simultaneously and differed only in color. After being placed in isolation, the observers, in a similar test, consistently selected the same object as did the demonstrators. This learning by observation occurred irrespective of the object chosen by the demonstrators as the positive choice and was more rapid than the learning that occurred during the conditioning of animals. The task was performed correctly without significant errors and further conditioning for 5 days. These results show that observational learning can occur in invertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2028317799,"Observations of galaxy-galaxy and cluster-cluster correlations as well as other large-scale structure can be fit with a ""limited"" fractal with dimension D approximately 1.2. This is not a ""pure"" fractal out to the horizon: the distribution shifts from power law to random behavior at some large scale. If the observed patterns and structures are formed through an aggregation growth process, the fractal dimension D can serve as an interesting constraint on the properties of the stochastic motion responsible for limiting the fractal structure. In particular, it is found that the observed fractal should have grown from two-dimensional sheetlike objects such as pancakes, domain walls, or string wakes. This result is generic and does not depend on the details of the growth process."
