https://openalex.org/W2040370123,"A central question in developmental biology is whether and how mechanical forces serve as cues for cellular behavior and thereby regulate morphogenesis. We found that morphogenesis at the Arabidopsis shoot apex depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton, which in turn is regulated by mechanical stress. A combination of experiments and modeling shows that a feedback loop encompassing tissue morphology, stress patterns, and microtubule-mediated cellular properties is sufficient to account for the coordinated patterns of microtubule arrays observed in epidermal cells, as well as for patterns of apical morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2164244652,"Cells sense the environment's mechanical stiffness to control their own shape, migration, and fate. To better understand stiffness sensing, we constructed a stochastic model of the ""motor-clutch"" force transmission system, where molecular clutches link F-actin to the substrate and mechanically resist myosin-driven F-actin retrograde flow. The model predicts two distinct regimes: (i) ""frictional slippage,"" with fast retrograde flow and low traction forces on stiff substrates and (ii) oscillatory ""load-and-fail"" dynamics, with slower retrograde flow and higher traction forces on soft substrates. We experimentally confirmed these model predictions in embryonic chick forebrain neurons by measuring the nanoscale dynamics of single-growth-cone filopodia. Furthermore, we experimentally observed a model-predicted switch in F-actin dynamics around an elastic modulus of 1 kilopascal. Thus, a motor-clutch system inherently senses and responds to the mechanical stiffness of the local environment."

Here, we show that gold nanoparticles supported on titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and nanoparticulated cerium dioxide (CeO 2 ) catalyze the aerobic oxidation of aromatic anilines to aromatic azo compounds with yields above 98% under mild reaction conditions. Gold on TiO 2 can also act as a reductive catalyst to access the compound directly from nitroaromatics through a two-step, one-pot reaction. The catalytic process shows promise for efficient synthesis of symmetric aromatic azo compounds, and even a range of asymmetric aromatic azo compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2061100095,"Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) inhibits triglyceride hydrolysis and has been implicated in coronary artery disease. Through a genome-wide association study, we have found that about 5% of the Lancaster Amish are heterozygous carriers of a null mutation (R19X) in the gene encoding apoC-III ( APOC3 ) and, as a result, express half the amount of apoC-III present in noncarriers. Mutation carriers compared with noncarriers had lower fasting and postprandial serum triglycerides, higher levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower levels of LDL-cholesterol. Subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcification, was less common in carriers than noncarriers, which suggests that lifelong deficiency of apoC-III has a cardioprotective effect."
https://openalex.org/W2037621685,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a powerful probe of molecular structure, but it has previously been too slow to track the earliest dynamics after photoexcitation. We investigated the ultrafast formation of the lowest quintet state of aqueous iron(II) tris(bipyridine) upon excitation of the singlet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer ( 1 MLCT) state by femtosecond optical pump/x-ray probe techniques based on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). By recording the intensity of a characteristic XANES feature as a function of laser pump/x-ray probe time delay, we find that the quintet state is populated in about 150 femtoseconds. The quintet state is further evidenced by its full XANES spectrum recorded at a 300-femtosecond time delay. These results resolve a long-standing issue about the population mechanism of quintet states in iron(II)-based complexes, which we identify as a simple 1 MLCT→ 3 MLCT→ 5 T cascade from the initially excited state. The time scale of the 3 MLCT→ 5 T relaxation corresponds to the period of the iron-nitrogen stretch vibration."
https://openalex.org/W2003515720,"Speciation genes restrict gene flow between the incipient species and related taxa. Three decades ago, we mapped a mammalian speciation gene, hybrid sterility 1 ( Hst1 ), in the intersubspecific hybrids of house mouse. Here, we identify this gene as Prdm9 , encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 trimethyltransferase. We rescued infertility in male hybrids with bacterial artificial chromosomes carrying Prdm9 from a strain with the “fertility” Hst1 f allele. Sterile hybrids display down-regulated microrchidia 2B ( Morc2b ) and fail to compartmentalize γH2AX into the pachynema sex (XY) body. These defects, seen also in Prdm9 -null mutants, are rescued by the Prdm9 transgene. Identification of a vertebrate hybrid sterility gene reveals a role for epigenetics in speciation and opens a window to a hybrid sterility gene network."
https://openalex.org/W2030083012,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in cancer and is an important therapeutic target. Aberrant expression and function of microRNAs have been associated with tumorigenesis. Bioinformatic predictions suggest that the human EGFR mRNA 3′-untranslated region contains three microRNA-7 (miR-7) target sites, which are not conserved across mammals. We found that miR-7 down-regulates EGFR mRNA and protein expression in cancer cell lines (lung, breast, and glioblastoma) via two of the three sites, inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death. Because miR-7 was shown to decrease EGFR mRNA expression, we used microarray analysis to identify additional mRNA targets of miR-7. These included Raf1 and multiple other genes involved in EGFR signaling and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, miR-7 attenuated activation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, two critical effectors of EGFR signaling, in different cancer cell lines. These data establish an important role for miR-7 in controlling mRNA expression and indicate that miR-7 has the ability to coordinately regulate EGFR signaling in multiple human cancer cell types.

Kondo K. Yamaguchi M. Richmond G. Hutchison M. Wakeling A. Averbuch S. Wadsworth P. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3639-3650PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR overexpression occurs in a range of solid tumors and is associated with disease progression, resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and poor prognosis (2Arteaga C.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 32S-40SPubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the EGFR and its downstream signaling effectors are major targets for new therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (3Ritter C.A. Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the clinical responses of tumors to existing anti-EGFR agents are often limited, and thus a major research focus is the development of novel approaches to block EGFR expression and signaling (4Bianco R. Troiani T. Tortora G. Ciardiello F. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: S159-S171Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous, non-coding RNA molecules that bind with imperfect complementarity to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target mRNAs, causing translational repression of the target gene or degradation of the target mRNA (5Bartel D.P.

Wu Q. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar), proliferation, and apoptosis (9Cheng A.M. Byrom M.W. Shelton J. Ford L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in cancer (10Zhang B. Pan X. Cobb G.P. Anderson T.A. Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Many miRNA genes are located at sites in the human genome that are frequently amplified, deleted, or rearranged in cancer (11Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Sevignani C. Ferracin M. Felli N. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Cimmino A. Zupo S. Dono M. Dell'Aquila M.L. Alder H. Rassenti L. Kipps T.J. Bullrich F. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11755-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), suggesting that some miRNAs may act as oncogenes (“oncomirs” 12) or tumor suppressors (12Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). For instance, reduced expression of the let-7 family of miRNAs is associated with increased Ras oncogene expression and reduced survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (13Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J.

Kosik K.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar), and breast, colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach cancers (16Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M. Roldo C. Ferracin M. Prueitt R.L. Yanaihara N. Lanza G. Scarpa A. Vecchione A. Negrini M. Harris C.C. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mo Y.Y. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 2799-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Computational approaches to miRNA target prediction have used criteria such as sequence complementarity between target mRNAs and a “seed” region within the miRNA, and conservation of predicted miRNA-binding sites across 3′-UTRs from multiple species (reviewed in Refs. 18Rajewsky N. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 19Maziére P. Enright A.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Recently, additional features that determine target site functionality have been identified (20Grimson A. Farh K.K. Johnston W.K. Garrett-Engele P. Lim L.P. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the imperfect complementarity of miRNA and target sequences means that identification and functional validation of authentic miRNA targets remains a major challenge. It has been suggested that miRNAs may have the ability to regulate hundreds or even thousands of target mRNAs (21Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9777) Google Scholar) and that much of this regulation could occur at the level of mRNA decay (22Krützfeldt J. Rajewsky N. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Because specific miRNAs have the potential to regulate the expression of several members of a signaling pathway or cellular process (23Stark A. Brennecke J. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E60Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), we hypothesized a role for miRNAs in aberrant EGFR expression and signaling in human cancers. In this study, we identify EGFR and Raf1 as direct targets of miR-7 in cancer cells, with miR-7 blocking EGFR and Raf1 expression by inducing mRNA decay. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential for miR-7 to act as a tumor suppressor by coordinately regulating the EGFR signaling pathway at multiple levels to repress protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity in human cancer cell lines. Cell Culture, miRNA Precursors, and Normal Tissue RNA—A549, MDA-MB-468, U87, DU145, and U373 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Synthetic miRNA precursor molecules corresponding to human miR-7 (Pre-miR miRNA Precursor Product ID: PM10047) and a negative control miRNA (miR-NC; Pre-miR miRNA Precursor Negative Control #1, Product ID: AM17110) were obtained from Ambion. Total RNA (First-Choice) from normal brain, normal lung, and normal breast tissue was purchased from Ambion. Luciferase Plasmid Construction—pGL3-miR-7-target was generated by ligating annealed DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the perfect hsa-miR-7 target site (forward: 5′-CAA CAA AAT CAC TAG TCT TCC A-3′ and 5′-TGG AAG ACT AGT GAT TTT GTT G-3′) to unique SpeI and ApaI sites that were inserted 3′ of the luciferase open reading frame of pGL3-control (Promega) firefly luciferase reporter vector (designated pGL3-control-MCS (24Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). Full-length EGFR 3′-UTR reporter plasmid was synthesized by GenScript Corp. using the entire EGFR 3′-UTR (nt 3879-5616 of GenBank™ accession number NM_005228) and the pMIR-REPORT luciferase plasmid backbone (Ambion). Wild-type (WT) EGFR target reporter plasmids pGL3-EGFR-A, -B, and -C were generated by cloning annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to nt 4214-4260, nt 4302-4348, and nt 4585-4631, respectively, of EGFR (GenBank™ accession number NM_005228) mRNA 3′-UTR into SpeI and ApaI sites in pGL3-control-MCS. Plasmid pGL3-EGFR-D contained a PCR-generated EGFR 3′-UTR sequence that spanned the predicted miR-7 target sites B and C. Mutant (MT) reporters were also generated that included three nucleotide substitutions to impair binding of the miR-7 seed sequence to its target. Plasmids pGL3-RAF1-WT and pGL3-RAF1-MT were constructed by cloning annealed DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to nt 2965-3030 of the Raf1 mRNA 3′-UTR (GenBank™ accession number NM_002880), into the SpeI and ApaI sites in pGL3-control-MCS. The sequence of all plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with miRNA precursor molecules at final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 nm. Cells were harvested at 12-24 h (for RNA extraction) or 3 days (for protein extraction). For reporter gene assays, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 ng of firefly luciferase reporter DNA and 5 ng of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter DNA as a transfection control. Lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities 24 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Report Assay System (Promega) and a Fluostar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Expression values were normalized to Renilla luciferase. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I (Promega) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA. For qRT-PCR analysis of EGFR and Raf1 mRNA expression, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers and Thermoscript (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR for Raf1 and GAPDH was performed using a Corbett 3000 RotorGene instrument (Corbett Research) with Quanti-Tect SYBR Green PCR mixture (Qiagen) with primers from Primer Bank (25Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) (EGFR-F, 5′-GCG TTC GGC ACG GTG TAT AA-3′; EGFR-R, 5′-GGC TTT CGG AGA TGT TGC TTC-3′; RAF1-F, 5′-GCA CTG TAG CAC CAA AGT ACC-3′; RAF1-R, 5′-CTG GGA CTC CAC TAT CAC CAA TA-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-ATG GGG AAG GTG AAG GTC G-3′; GAPDH-R, 5′-GGG GTC ATT GAT GGC AAC AAT A-3′). Expression of EGFR and Raf1 mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA was determined using the 2-ΔΔCT method (26Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). For analysis of miR-7 expression by qRT-PCR, reverse transcription and PCR were carried out using TaqMan miRNA assay kits (Applied Biosystems) for hsa-miR-7 (Part #4373014) and U44 snRNA (Part #4373384) with a Corbett 3000 RotorGene thermocycler (Corbett Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analyses of qRT-PCR data were performed using GenEx software (MultiD). Western Blotting—Cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as described (24Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J.

Membranes were probed with anti-EGFR mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, Neomarkers, catalog #MS-400-P1), anti-Raf1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7267), anti-IRS2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, #4502), anti-Akt rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, #9272), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, #4060), anti-p44/42 (ERK1/2) MAPK mouse monoclonal antibody (1:750, Cell Signaling Technology, #4696), anti-phospho-p44/42 (P-ERK1/2) MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:750, Cell Signaling Technology, #9101), or anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:15,000, Abcam ab6276-100), prior to detection with ECL Plus detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and ECL-Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). Cell Cycle Analysis and Cell Counting—Following trypsinization, cells were permeabilized, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed on an EPICS XL-MCL (Coulter Corp. flow cytometer). Cell cycle analysis was performed using MultiPlus AV MultiParameter data analysis software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and assessed 3 days after miR-7 or miR-NC transfection by light microscopy. Five representative fields of view were photographed for each condition. Cells in each field of view were counted manually. Microarray Expression Profiling and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells transfected for 24 h with miR-7 or miR-NC (30 nm) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and assessed for quality and integrity using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Gene expression profiling by microarray hybridization was performed with two experimental replicates by the Lotterywest State Microarray Facility using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array chips (Affymetrix). The raw data were processed using GeneSifter software (VizX Labs). An “all groups must pass” restriction was imposed, with a threshold quality score of “P” (present) required for inclusion in subsequent analysis. Data were normalized to the all means fluorescence and were log2-transformed. Pairwise analysis of the probe intensities of miR-7- and miR-NC-treated sample data sets was performed using Student's t tests (two-tailed, unpaired), and used to identify transcripts that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated with miR-7 transfection (p < 0.05) by at least a factor of 2. These represented potential miR-7 target transcripts. Investigation of the enrichment of gene sets for predicted miRNA targets was conducted using the L2L microarray analysis tool (27Newman, J. C., and Weiner, A. M. (2005) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/R81Google Scholar). miRanda (28Enright, A. J., John, B., Gaul, U., Tuschl, T., Sander, C., and Marks, D. S.

Microarray expression data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under Accession Number GSE14507. EGFR 3′-UTR Contains Multiple, Specific Target Sequences for miR-7—As EGFR expression is regulated in part via cis-acting 3′-UTR mRNA stability sequences (30Balmer L.A. Beveridge D.J. Jazayeri J.A.

Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9777) Google Scholar) identified three putative miR-7 target sites (A, B, and C, Fig. 1A). The 3′-end of each site contains the hexamer motif UCUUCC, which is complementary to the seed region (nt 2-7) of human miR-7 (hsa-miR-7) (Fig. 1B). When contextual features of miRNA target sites associated with functionality were taken into account, such as their proximity to AU-rich sequences and positioning away from the center of 3′-UTRs (20Grimson A.

This raises the possibility that it may function as a tumor suppressor in these systems by inhibiting oncogene expression. The three putative EGFR 3′-UTR miR-7 target sites are poorly conserved between human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 1B). Binding sites that are not conserved between species are often excluded in an attempt to reduce the number of false-positives in target prediction sets. However, the evolution of miRNAs and their target mRNAs suggests that this exclusion could also increase the rate of false-negative predictions (19Maziére P. Enright A.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For instance, in mice, miR-7b regulates Fos oncogene translation via a 3′-UTR target site that is not present in human Fos mRNA (36Lee H.J. Palkovits M. Young W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15669-15674Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction between miR-7 and its predicted EGFR mRNA 3′-UTR target sites, we generated reporter vectors containing sequences with complementarity to miR-7 downstream of a luciferase open reading frame (Fig. 1C). These included a sequence with perfect complementarity to the miR-7 sequence (miR-7 target), the full-length wild-type EGFR 3′-UTR (EGFR 3′-UTR), four wild-type EGFR 3′-UTR sequences (A-D), and the same four EGFR sequences with three point mutations predicted to disrupt miR-7 binding in each of the seed match regions (Fig. 1D). In human EGFR-overexpressing NSCLC cells (A549) transfected with synthetic miR-7 precursor (miR-7), expression of the perfect target reporter was reduced, an effect that was not observed following transfection with a negative control miRNA precursor (miR-NC) (Fig. 1E). Similarly, miR-7, but not miR-NC, reduced expression of a reporter that contained the full-length EGFR 3′-UTR (Fig. 1E). We next investigated the relative contribution of each putative miR-7 target site in the EGFR 3′-UTR to the regulation of gene expression by miR-7. In A549 cells, miR-7 reduced the expression of reporters bearing putative target sites B and C, but not of the corresponding mutant reporters (Fig. 1F). In contrast, putative target site A did not mediate a change in reporter expression by miR-7 (Fig. 1F). This suggested that site A alone was not a target for miR-7 binding. The presence of sites B and C in the same reporter construct (plasmid construct EGFR D, Fig. 1C), conferred additive, although not synergistic, repression with miR-7, which was not observed with the EGFR D mutant reporter (Fig. 1F). Together, these data indicate that the EGFR 3′-UTR is a specific target of miR-7 and that two of the three predicted miR-7-binding sites in the EGFR mRNA 3′-UTR are likely to be specific targets of miR-7. Furthermore, these data suggest that miR-7 may repress EGFR expression via target sites B and C in an additive fashion. miR-7 Inhibits EGFR Expression in Human Cancer Cell Lines and Has Reduced Expression in U87 Glioblastoma Cells—We next sought to determine the effect of miR-7 on EGFR mRNA and protein expression in EGFR-positive A549, U87 (glioblastoma), MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer), and DU145 (prostate cancer) cell lines. Compared with transfection with miR-NC precursor, transfection with miR-7 precursor reduced EGFR mRNA expression significantly in A549, U87, MDA-MB-468, and DU145 cells at 24 h post-transfection by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A), consistent with miR-7 promoting EGFR mRNA decay. On the other hand, Lee and co-workers (36Lee H.J. Palkovits M. Young W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15669-15674Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) observed that miR-7 regulated translation of Fos mRNA in the mouse hypothalamus. These contrasting results suggest that miR-7 may regulate the stability and/or translation of target mRNAs. Furthermore, compared with transfection with either transfection reagent alone or miR-NC, transfection with miR-7 for 72 h reduced EGFR protein expression in A549, U87, MDA-MB-468, and DU145 cells, shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). This effect was observed with concentrations of miR-7 precursor as low as 1 nm (data not shown). In addition to investigations of the regulation of EGFR expression by miR-7 in cancer cells, we examined the expression of miR-7 in two EGFR-positive glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U373) using TaqMan miRNA qRT-PCR assays. We observed that the expression of miR-7 was significantly down-regulated in U87 and U373 cells compared with RNA extracted from total normal human brain tissue (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with the possibility that reduced miR-7 levels could be associated with elevated expression of EGFR in primary cerebral tumors. We also compared expression of miR-7 in normal brain, normal lung, and normal breast, to its expression in A549, MDA-MB-468, and DU145 cell lines (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 1), and found very low expression of miR-7 in the normal lung and breast compared with normal brain, suggesting that miR-7 expression is restricted to specific tissues that include those belonging to the central nervous system. Supporting this finding, we observed that miR-7 was expressed at low levels in A549, MDA-MB-468, and DU145 cells compared with normal brain. Functional Effects of miR-7 in EGFR-positive Human Cancer Cell Lines—Based on our data showing that miR-7 can regulate EGFR expression in cancer cells, we hypothesized that miR-7 might compromise the growth and viability of the same cells. To test this hypothesis, we transfected A549 cells with miR-7 or miR-NC precursors and measured cell cycle progression using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, and cell numbers using cell counts at 3 days post-transfection. Transfection with miR-7 induced cell cycle arrest at G1 (Fig. 3A) and caused a significant decrease in A549 cell numbers and cell viability (Fig. 3B). The reduction in viable cell number with miR-7 transfection did not appear to involve apoptosis, as evidenced by, firstly, the absence of a sub-G1 cell population by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 3A) and, secondly, the lack of activation of the executioner caspases 3 and 7 (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that miR-7 not only inhibits EGFR gene expression by targeting its mRNA for degradation but induces a program of gene expression to reduce cell viability and trigger non-apoptotic cell death. In view of the important role of EGFR in the protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways, two pathways linked to cancer, we examined the ability of miR-7 transfection to repress Akt and ERK1/2 activity in different cancer cell lines. Following transfection of A549, U87, MDA-MB-468, and DU145 cell lines with miR-7, we observed reductions in basal and EGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 2A) in all four cell lines. The capacity of miR-7 to regulate ERK1/2 activity appeared to be cell-specific, because miR-7 decreased EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in U87 cells but did not alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation in A549, MDA-MB-468, or DU145 cells (Fig. 3, E and F, and supplemental Fig. 2B). Together, these observations are consistent with miR-7's ability to inhibit cancer cell cycle progression and reduce cell viability, and suggest that, in addition to the regulation of EGFR expression, miR-7 can regulate the activity of important downstream signaling effectors of EGFR, including Akt and ERK1/2, in multiple EGFR-positive cancer cell lines. miR-7 Re"

However, the conformational changes that accompany substrate transport, the mechanism by which a substrate moves through the transporter, and principles of competitive inhibition remain unclear. We used crystallographic and functional studies on the leucine transporter (LeuT), a model for neurotransmitter sodium symporters, to show that various amino acid substrates induce the same occluded conformational state and that a competitive inhibitor, tryptophan (Trp), traps LeuT in an open-to-out conformation. In the Trp complex, the extracellular gate residues arginine 30 and aspartic acid 404 define a second weak binding site for substrates or inhibitors as they permeate from the extracellular solution to the primary substrate site, which demonstrates how residues that participate in gating also mediate permeation."
https://openalex.org/W2070677984,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a secreted lipid mediator that functions in vascular development; however, it remains unclear how S1P secretion is regulated during embryogenesis. We identified a zebrafish mutant, ko157, that displays cardia bifida (two hearts) resembling that in the S1P receptor-2 mutant. A migration defect of myocardial precursors in the ko157 mutant is due to a mutation in a multipass transmembrane protein, Spns2, and can be rescued by S1P injection. We show that the export of S1P from cells requires Spns2. spns2 is expressed in the extraembryonic tissue yolk syncytial layer (YSL), and the introduction of spns2 mRNA in the YSL restored the cardiac defect in the ko157 mutant. Thus, Spns2 in the YSL functions as a S1P transporter in S1P secretion, thereby regulating myocardial precursor migration."
https://openalex.org/W2086134746,"The presence or absence of a quantum critical point and its location in the phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors have been subjects of intense scrutiny. Clear evidence for quantum criticality, particularly in the transport properties, has proved elusive because the important low-temperature region is masked by the onset of superconductivity. We present measurements of the low-temperature in-plane resistivity of several highly doped La2-xSrxCuO4 single crystals in which the superconductivity had been stripped away by using high magnetic fields. In contrast to other quantum critical systems, the resistivity varies linearly with temperature over a wide doping range with a gradient that scales monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature. It is maximal at a critical doping level (pc) approximately 0.19 at which superconductivity is most robust. Moreover, its value at pc corresponds to the onset of quasi-particle incoherence along specific momentum directions, implying that the interaction that first promotes high-temperature superconductivity may ultimately destroy the very quasi-particle states involved in the superconducting pairing."

Despite the identification of several genes that cause hybrid sterility or inviability—many of which have evolved rapidly under positive Darwinian selection—little is known about the ecological or genomic forces that drive the evolution of postzygotic isolation. Here, we show that the same gene, Overdrive , causes both male sterility and segregation distortion in F 1 hybrids between the Bogota and U.S. subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura . This segregation distorter gene is essential for hybrid sterility, a strong reproductive barrier between these young taxa. Our results suggest that genetic conflict may be an important evolutionary force in speciation."

This requires two processes, antigen processing and cell motility, originally thought to occur independently. We found that the major histocompatibility complex II–associated invariant chain (Ii or CD74), a known regulator of antigen processing, negatively regulates DC motility in vivo. By using microfabricated channels to mimic the confined environment of peripheral tissues, we found that wild-type DCs alternate between high and low motility, whereas Ii-deficient cells moved in a faster and more uniform manner. The regulation of cell motility by Ii depended on the actin-based motor protein myosin II. Coupling antigen processing and cell motility may enable DCs to more efficiently detect and process antigens within a defined space."

However, RA acts too widely in mammalian development to account, by itself, for the cell-type and temporal specificity of meiotic initiation. We considered parallels to yeast, in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to restrict meiotic initiation. We demonstrate that, in mouse embryos, extrinsic and intrinsic factors together regulate meiotic initiation. The mouse RNA-binding protein DAZL, which is expressed by postmigratory germ cells, is a key intrinsic factor, enabling those cells to initiate meiosis in response to RA. Within a brief developmental window, Dazl -expressing germ cells in both XX and XY embryos actively acquire the ability to interpret RA as a meiosis-inducing signal."

We report the crystal structure of the mouse cytoplasmic dynein MTBD and a portion of the coiled coil, which supports a mechanism by which the ATPase domain and MTBD may communicate through a shift in the heptad registry of the coiled coil. Surprisingly, functional data suggest that the MTBD, and not the ATPase domain, is the main determinant of the direction of dynein motility."

This model has remained untested in humans. We used the pharmacological agent modafinil to promote low-tonic/high-phasic LC-NE activity in healthy humans performing a cognitive control task during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Modafanil administration was associated with decreased task-independent, tonic LC activity, increased task-related LC and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity, and enhanced LC-PFC functional connectivity. These results confirm in humans the role of the LC-NE system in PFC function and cognitive control and suggest a mechanism for therapeutic action of procognitive noradrenergic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2118479050,"We analyzed data from over 4500 elephants to show that animals in European zoos have about half the median life span of conspecifics in protected populations in range countries. This discrepancy is clearest in Asian elephants; unlike African elephants in zoos, this species' infant mortality is very high (for example, twice that seen in Burmese timber camps), and its adult survivorship in zoos has not improved significantly in recent years. One risk factor for Asian zoo elephants is being moved between institutions, with early removal from the mother tending to have additional adverse effects. Another risk factor is being born into a zoo rather than being imported from the wild, with poor adult survivorship in zoo-born Asians apparently being conferred prenatally or in early infancy. We suggest stress and/or obesity as likely causes of zoo elephants' compromised survivorship."

We investigated this question using medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes), by comparing the genomic sequences of two strains (Hd-rR and HNI) and by mapping approximately 37.3 million nucleosome cores from Hd-rR blastulae and 11,654 representative transcription start sites from six embryonic stages. We observed a distinctive approximately 200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately +200, +400, and +600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This approximately 200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0, +200, +400, and +600 bp. These data exemplify the potential for genetic activity (transcription) and chromatin structure to contribute to molding the DNA sequence on an evolutionary time scale."

However, the pathways involved in the relaxin-TGF-beta1/Smad2 interaction remain unknown. This study investigated the signaling mechanisms by which human gene-2 (H2) relaxin regulates myofibroblast differentiation in vitro by examining its effects on mixed populations of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts propagated from injured rat kidneys. Cultures containing approximately 60-70% myofibroblasts were used to determine which relaxin receptors, G-proteins, and signaling pathways were involved in the H2 relaxin-mediated regulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA; a marker of myofibroblast differentiation). H2 relaxin only inhibited alpha-SMA immunostaining and collagen concentration in the presence of relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). H2 relaxin also induced a transient rise in cAMP in the presence of G(i/o) inhibition, and a sustained increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), NO, and cGMP significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of relaxin on alpha-SMA and Smad2 phosphorylation, while the NO inhibitor, L-nitroarginine methyl ester (hydrochloride) (L-NAME) significantly blocked the inhibitory actions of relaxin on collagen concentration in vivo. These findings suggest that relaxin signals through RXFP1, and a nNOS-NO-cGMP-dependent pathway to inhibit Smad2 phosphorylation and interfere with TGF-beta1-mediated renal myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for tissue homeostasis and changes in the ECM microenvironment can be detrimental to cell function during inflammation and wound healing. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) contain a membrane-bound core protein and extracellular carbohydrate side chains. Syndecans are the most abundant HSPG in humans; there are 4 isoforms with variable cell expression (17Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev.

Because of the known functions of syndecans and its close interaction with EC-SOD, syndecan-1 is a key target that may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of EC-SOD in the lung and in the pulmonary fibrosis. This study was conducted to determine the role of EC-SOD in protecting the ECM from oxidative stress and to investigate our hypothesis that EC-SOD protects the lung from inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting oxidant-induced shedding of syndecan-1. Our findings suggest that a loss of EC-SOD in the lung leaves syndecan-1 vulnerable to oxidative stress and that oxidatively shed syndecan-1 ectodomain induces neutrophil chemotaxis, impairs epithelial wound healing, and promotes fibrogenesis. The discovery that oxidative stress alters the distribution of syndecan-1 in the lung microenvironment is a novel finding in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. These findings advance the understanding of the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and provide a potential new therapeutic target for intervention in IPF. Animal Treatments—Animal protocols were approved by the University of Pittsburgh IACUC. Wild-type C57BL/6 and EC-SOD-null mice (EC-SOD KO) (13Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Google Scholar) were treated intratracheally with 0.1 mg of crocidolite asbestos or titanium dioxide (inert control particle), as previously described (15Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2006; 40: 601-607Google Scholar, 23Kliment C.R. Tobolewski J.M. Manni M.L. Tan R.J. Enghild J. Oury T.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 261-268Google Scholar). Select studies at the 1 day time point included co-treatment with asbestos and 50 units purified human EC-SOD (30Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J.. 1996; 317: 51-57Google Scholar, 31Fattman C.L. Enghild J.J. Crapo J.D. Schaefer L.M. Valnickova Z. Oury T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2000; 275: 542-548Google Scholar). 1, 14, and 28 days after treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was recovered, and lungs were processed (32Fattman C.L. Chu C.T. Kulich S.M. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2001; 31: 1198-1207Google Scholar). Lungs were flash-frozen and homogenized for Western blot. Additional mice were treated intratracheally with 0.05 units of bleomycin and processed 7 days after treatment in the same manner as the asbestos experiments (14Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar). Human Samples—Human BALF and paraffin-embedded lung samples from IPF, and normal lungs were obtained at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, MD or at the University of Pittsburgh. IPF and control tissue samples for lung homogenates were obtained through the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Tissue Bank, as previously described (33Pardo A. Gibson K. Cisneros J. Richards T.J. Yang Y. Becerril C. Yousem S. Herrera I. Ruiz V. Selman M. Kaminski N. PLoS Med.. 2005; 2: e251Google Scholar). The use of these samples has been approved by the NHLBI and NHGRI of the National Institutes of Health, or the University of Pittsburgh IRBs. Lung homogenate samples were obtained from surgical remnants of biopsies or lungs explanted from patients with IPF who underwent pulmonary transplant. The homogenization process was the same as used for human lung samples described above. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IPF outlined by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (34Oury T.D. Schaefer L.M. Fattman C.L. Choi A. Weck K.E. Watkins S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L777-L784Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, see the section below. Western Blotting—BALF and lung homogenate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (14Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar, 23Kliment C.R. Tobolewski J.M. Manni M.L. Tan R.J. Enghild J. Oury T.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 261-268Google Scholar) and probed for proteins of interest. Membranes were probed with a rat anti-mouse antibody against syndecan-1 ectodomain (281.2, BD Biosciences) or mouse anti-human syndecan-1 (B-A38, Diaclone, Besancon, France), then a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rat and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). ECL detection reagents were used for visualization (ECL-plus, GE Healthcare). Ponceau red membrane staining was used for BALF protein normalization and β-actin densitometry was used to normalize homogenates. Images were captured with a Gel Logic 2200 system for densitometry (mean normalized net intensities ±S.E.). Real Time PCR—RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA expression (ddCt relative quantitation) of EC-SOD from wild-type mice treated with TiO2 or asbestos (14-day time point) and syndecan-1 from wild-type and EC-SOD KO mice treated with TiO2 (day 14), using a 7300 Applied Biosystem PCR System and primer/probe sets (EC-SOD-Mm00448831_s1; syndecan-1-Mm00448918_m1 Sdc1, Applied Biosystems) as previously described (35Englert J.M. Hanford L.E. Kaminski N. Tobolewski J.M. Tan R.J. Fattman C.L. Ramsgaard L. Richards T.J. Loutaev I. Nawroth P.P. Kasper M. Bierhaus A. Oury T.D. Am. J. Pathol.. 2008; 172: 583-591Google Scholar). Data are reported as percent expression (relative to GAPDH expression) versus control, n = 4 samples per group, per gene. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse lungs were inflation-fixed with 10% buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded. Paraffin-embedded IPF and control human lungs were also examined. 5-μm-thick sections of tissue were heated at 60 °C overnight, deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated with an ethanol series, and fluorescently stained for syndecan-1 and EC-SOD. Human and mouse lung sections were stained with antibodies specific to syndecan-1 (1:500, B-A38, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; mouse: 281.2, BD Bioscience) and EC-SOD (1:500, generated as described below) and secondary antibodies labeled with Cy3 and Alexa 488 (1:5,000, Jackson Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA). Control sections were stained with preimmune sera or non-immune IgG. Generation of Anti-EC-SOD Antibodies—Mouse and human EC-SOD specific polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated peptide containing either the first 19 amino acids in mouse EC-SOD and an additional cysteine residue at position 20 (SSFDLADRLDPVEKIDRLDC) or a peptide containing human EC-SOD amino acid residues 19–37 and an additional cysteine residue in position 20 (WTGEDSAEPNSDSAEWIRDC) by AnaSpec Corporation (San Jose, CA). Antibody specificity for EC-SOD was confirmed by the detection on a Western blot analysis of lung homogenate. Preimmune serum was also collected to obtain control IgG. Cell Culture—Primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells were harvested and cultured from 6-week-old C57BL-6 mice, as previously described (36Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L256-L264Google Scholar) and grown on collagen IV-coated 24-well plates for experiments in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 international units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). A549, human alveolar epithelial cells (ATCC), and LL47, human lung fibroblasts (ATCC), were separately grown on 24-well plates with growth medium for experiments (F12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum; Invitrogen). A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-human syndecan-1 ectodomain fusion protein (hS1ED) was used in cell experiments at concentrations between 500 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml (provided by Dr. Alan Rapraeger and purified as previously described (37McQuade K.J. Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci.. 2006; 119: 2445-2456Google Scholar)). The present studies focus on the functions of the ectodomain protein itself, as there are no glycosaminoglycan chains present on the protein. Fibroblast Proliferation and TGF-ß1 Release—LL47 fibroblasts were plated on 96-well plates (4,000 cells/well) and placed in serum-free F12K medium 24 h prior to treatment. Cells were treated with medium or 1 μg/ml hS1ED for 24 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. Fibroblast proliferation was determined over 2 h using CellTiter 96 AQ Non-Radioactive Assay at 333 μg/ml MTS and 25 μm PMS (Promega, Madison, WI). Absorbance at 490 nm, which is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells, was recorded on a plate reader, and reported as mean ±S.E., n = 8. LL47s were also cultured to confluency on 12 well polystyrene plates, placed in serum-free medium for 24 h, and treated with 1 μg/ml hS1ED for 48 h. Supernatants were collected and assayed by ELISA for latent and active TGF-ß1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) detection, fibroblast cell lysates were collected in ice-cold cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and separated on SDS page. After transfer to a membrane, mouse anti-α-SMA primary antibody (Sigma) was used for detection and normalized to β-actin as described. Neutrophil Chemotaxis—A modified Boyden chamber (38Zen K. Reaves T.A. Soto I. Liu Y. J. Immunol. Methods.. 2006; 309: 86-98Google Scholar), was used to evaluate human neutrophil (PMN) chemotaxis in response to shed syndecan-1 ectodomains in A549 cell supernatants, hS1ED (1 μg/ml), or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG, 6 μg/ml, Sigma). Samples were treated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) as previously described (23Kliment C.R. Tobolewski J.M. Manni M.L. Tan R.J. Enghild J. Oury T.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 261-268Google Scholar), purified human EC-SOD (30Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J.. 1996; 317: 51-57Google Scholar, 31Fattman C.L. Enghild J.J. Crapo J.D. Schaefer L.M. Valnickova Z. Oury T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2000; 275: 542-548Google Scholar) or CuZn-SOD (Alexis, San Diego, CA). ROS were generated in sterile HBSS using 1.25 μm copper sulfate (0.1 m NaH2PO4/50 μm CuSO4; pH 7.4) and 1.5 mm hydrogen peroxide in a Fenton chemistry-like system (23Kliment C.R. Tobolewski J.M.

Our previous studies (23Kliment C.R. Tobolewski J.M. Manni M.L. Tan R.J. Enghild J. Oury T.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 261-268Google Scholar) have shown that 0.068 nmol/min/ml superoxide are generated at the doses utilized in this study. Human PMN were isolated using a citrate and percoll isolation protocol (40Heit B. Colarusso P. Kubes P. J. Cell Sci.. 2005; 118: 5205-5220Google Scholar) and 2 × 106 cells in HBSS were added to upper transwell inserts (5 μm pore size, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Lower wells contained HBSS (Sigma) with the indicated treatments and incubated for 2 h. For select experiments, A549 cell monolayers were treated with medium, human syndecan-1 siRNA (sc-36587, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or negative control siRNA (AM4611, Ambion) 24 h prior to ROS treatment to knockdown cell surface syndecan-1 expression. The optimal siRNA concentration was determined at 30 and 60 μm. A concentration of 30 μm was used for all additional experiments along with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-mem I (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then treated with ROS for 2 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cell supernatants were collected and applied to the lower chamber of the chemotaxis assay. Neutrophils in the upper chambers were allowed to chemotax for 2 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. Lower well cell counts were completed on a Beckmann Coulter Counter (Beckmann Coulter, Fullerton, CA). A migration index was calculated for each group (41Sergejeva S. Ivanov S. Lotvall J. Linden A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.. 2005; 33: 248-253Google Scholar; migrated cells to treatment/randomly migrated cells (HBSS)). An index greater than 1 represents positive chemotaxis (±S.E.). Shedding and Wound Assays—For shedding assays, A549 cells were exposed to ROS and EC-SOD for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cells were immunofluorescently stained for syndecan-1 (42Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 148: 811-824Google Scholar), and supernatants were analyzed for shed syndecan-1 ectodomain by dot blot and by a syndecan-1 ELISA kit (anti-CD138, syn-1, Diaclone, France). Apoptosis, via caspase-3 activity, was assayed in 10 μg of A549 cell lysates using fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate IV, after ROS treatment and reported as mean relative fluorescent units, RFUs ±S.E. (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). For wound assays, primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells or A549s were plated on collagen IV-coated plates and grown to confluency in growth media. Straight wounds were created with a p-200 pipette tips (43Liang C.C. Park A.Y. Guan J.L. Nat. Protoc.. 2007; 2: 329-333Google Scholar), washed, and treated with hS1ED (500 ng/ml or 1 μg/ml) immediately after wounding. Images were captured using a 4× objective with phase contrast at time 0 and 18, or 20 h. Human syndecan-1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and negative control (scrambled) siRNA (Ambion) were used to knockdown syndecan-1 expression in A549 cells as described above. For siRNA experiments, wounds were created 24 h after siRNA treatment, and hS1ED (1 μg/ml) was added immediately after the wound was created and washed. Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) was used to measure wound areas. Results are presented as the percent wound healing. Percent healing was calculated as follows: (Wound Area (initial) – Wound Area-(final))/Wound area(initial) × 100. Statistical Analysis—Mean densitometry and all other quantitative data (mean ±S.E.) were assessed for significance using the Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Significance was achieved by a p value < 0.05. Sample sizes (n) are indicated in the figure legends. Syndecan-1 Ectodomain Shedding Increases after Asbestos-induced Lung Injury in Mice—To investigate syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding in models of pulmonary fibrosis, we measured shed syndecan-1 protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wild-type and EC-SOD-null mice (EC-SOD KO) in both asbestos and bleomycin-induced models of pulmonary fibrosis. EC-SOD KO mice are more susceptible to oxidative damage and lung fibrosis (13Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Google Scholar, 14Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar, 15Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2006; 40: 601-607Google Scholar, 34Oury T.D. Schaefer L.M. Fattman C.L. Choi A. Weck K.E. Watkins S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L777-L784Google Scholar). After asbestos injury, shed syndecan-1 levels increase in the BALF of wild-type mice at 1, 14, and 28 days post-asbestos exposure (Fig. 1, A–C, n = 5). Notably, shedding of syndecan-1 from the ECM after asbestos injury was significantly (p < 0.05) further increased in mice lacking EC-SOD at days 1 and 28 (EC-SOD KO mice, Fig. 1, A and C). Syndecan-1 was also found to significantly (p < 0.05) increase in lung homogenates at 28 days post-asbestos exposure, with the trend beginning at 14-days post-exposure (Fig. 1, E and F, n = 4–5). Similar results were observed in a bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis. Shed syndecan-1 levels significantly (p < 0.001) increase in the BALF of EC-SOD-KO mice when compared with wild-type mice at 7 days after bleomycin treatment (Fig. 1D, n = 5). Furthermore, in EC-SOD KO mice at the 24-h time point, co-treatment with asbestos and 50 units EC-SOD intratracheally results in a significant decrease in neutrophils (p < 0.05; Fig. 1, G–a) and a decrease in shed syndecan-1 in the BALF (p < 0.01; Fig. 1, G–b). Syndecan-1 Ectodomain Levels Increase in IPF—To determine if syndecan-1 shedding also occurs in subjects affected with IPF, we measured syndecan-1, by Western blot analysis, in BALF and lung homogenates obtained from patients who met ATS/ERS criteria for sporadic IPF (34Oury T.D. Schaefer L.M. Fattman C.L. Choi A. Weck K.E. Watkins S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L777-L784Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 levels were significantly increased in the BALF (p < 0.01) and lung homogenates (p < 0.05) of IPF patients when compared with control subjects (Fig. 2A). Syndecan-1 Is Increased in Fibrotic Lung Regions and Colocalizes with EC-SOD—To further evaluate syndecan-1 expression in response to pulmonary fibrosis, immunofluorescent staining for syndecan-1 and EC-SOD was performed on human and mouse lungs with and without fibrosis. Fig. 3A depicts lung sections of normal human lung and sporadic IPF. Normal human lung in Fig. 3, A–a shows ubiquitous staining for EC-SOD (green) with sparse staining for syndecan-1 (red), and co-localization of the two proteins (yellow with arrows). Similarly, in Fig. 3, A–c, an area of tissue with normal architecture from an IPF lung shows ubiquitous EC-SOD and sparse syndecan-1 staining. In contrast, Fig. 3A, b and d, depicts areas of fibrosis in IPF sections that stain strongly for syndecan-1 on the abluminal surface of alveolar epithelial cells, terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells, and within areas of fibrosis (double asterisks). EC-SOD staining decreases in fibrotic regions (Fig. 3, A–b, single asterisk) and co-localizes with syndecan-1 in the lung epithelium (Fig. 3, A–d, arrows). Areas of fibrosis were identified using H&E staining of serial lung sections by a board-certified pathologist. 3T. D. Oury, data not shown. Overall, in areas of fibrosis in IPF lung, there is an increase in syndecan-1 staining with a decrease in interstitial EC-SOD. In the asbestos mouse model, the asbestos-induced injury leads to peribronchial and alveolar fibrosis similar to that seen in IPF. To confirm the human IHC staining results, mouse lung sections were stained for EC-SOD and syndecan-1 after TiO2 or asbestos exposure (28-day time point). Fig. 3, B–a shows diffuse EC-SOD staining (green) and sparse syndecan-1 (red) of normal lung in wild-type mice after TiO2 exposure. In contrast, areas of fibrosis in Fig. 3, B–b show a diffuse increase in syndecan-1 (double asterisks), a decrease in interstitial EC-SOD (single asterisk), and co-localization of the two proteins in wild-type mice (yellow with arrows). Likewise, in EC-SOD KO mice, syndecan-1 expression significantly increases in areas of fibrosis after asbestos treatment (Fig. 3, B–d, double asterisks) compared with TiO2-treated mice (Fig. 3, B–c). Previous studies demonstrate that EC-SOD decreases in the lung interstitium after fibrosis-inducing injury while increasing in the alveolar lining fluid, as determined by Western blot analysis of lung homogenates and BALF, respectively (15Fattman C.L. Tan R.J. Tobolewski J.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2006; 40: 601-607Google Scholar, 32Fattman C.L. Chu C.T. Kulich S.M. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic Biol. Med.. 2001; 31: 1198-1207Google Scholar). Real time PCR was used to confirm our IHC staining for EC-SOD in mouse lung. EC-SOD gene expression decreases significantly in wild-type mouse lungs after asbestos treatment at 14-days-post-exposure; percent EC-SOD gene expression from TiO2-treated lungs: 100"
https://openalex.org/W2009769042,"Destruction of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix is an important pathological consequence of many diseases involving muscle wasting. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to extracellular matrix breakdown in skeletal muscle tissues remain unknown. Using a microarray approach, we investigated the effect of tumor necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), a recently identified muscle-wasting cytokine, on the expression of extracellular proteases in skeletal muscle. Among several other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), we found that the expression of MMP-9, a type IV collagenase, was drastically increased in myotubes in response to TWEAK. The level of MMP-9 was also higher in myofibers of TWEAK transgenic mice. TWEAK increased the activation of both classical and alternative nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity blocked the TWEAK-induced production of MMP-9 in myotubes. TWEAK also increased the activation of AP-1, and its inhibition attenuated the TWEAK-induced MMP-9 production. Overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase or IkappaB kinase-beta but not IkappaB kinase-alpha significantly inhibited the TWEAK-induced activation of MMP-9 promoter. The activation of MMP-9 also involved upstream recruitment of TRAF2 and cIAP2 proteins. TWEAK increased the activity of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38 MAPK. However, the inhibition of only p38 MAPK blocked the TWEAK-induced expression of MMP-9 in myotubes. Furthermore the loss of body and skeletal muscle weights, inflammation, fiber necrosis, and degradation of basement membrane around muscle fibers were significantly attenuated in Mmp9 knock-out mice on chronic administration of TWEAK protein. The study unveils a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle tissue destruction in pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2153095646,"The translocation of biopolymers through pores and channels plays a fundamental role in numerous biological processes. We describe here the mechanism of the threading of a series of polymer chains through a synthetic macrocycle, which mimics these natural processes. The threading of polymers involves a kinetically favorable “entron” effect, which is associated with the initial filling of the cavity by the end of the polymer. A preassociation between the outside of the macrocycle and the polymer induces a process in which the polymer end loops back into the cavity of the macrocycle. This looping mechanism results in accelerated threading rates and unidirectional motion and is reminiscent of the protein translocation through membrane pores."
https://openalex.org/W2082550050,"Multiple lines of evidence have shown that the isotopic composition and concentration of calcium in seawater have changed over the past 28 million years. A high-resolution, continuous seawater calcium isotope ratio curve from marine (pelagic) barite reveals distinct features in the evolution of the seawater calcium isotopic ratio suggesting changes in seawater calcium concentrations. The most pronounced increase in the δ 44/40 Ca value of seawater (of 0.3 per mil) occurred over roughly 4 million years following a period of low values around 13 million years ago. The major change in marine calcium corresponds to a climatic transition and global change in the carbon cycle and suggests a reorganization of the global biogeochemical system."

https://openalex.org/W1974020700,"Self-assembly of molecules on surfaces is a route toward not only creating structures, but also engineering chemical reactivity afforded by the intermolecular interactions. Dimethyldisulfide (CH 3 SSCH 3 ) molecules self-assemble into linear chains on single-crystal gold surfaces. Injecting low-energy electrons into individual molecules in the self-assembled structures with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope led to a propagating chemical reaction along the molecular chain as sulfur–sulfur bonds were broken and then reformed to produce new CH 3 SSCH 3 molecules. Theoretical and experimental evidence supports a mechanism involving electron attachment followed by dissociation of a CH 3 SSCH 3 molecule and initiation of a chain reaction by one or both of the resulting CH 3 S intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1968918423,"The accumulation of mutant protein in intracellular aggregates is a common feature of neurodegenerative disease. In Huntington disease, mutant huntingtin leads to inclusion body (IB) formation and neuronal toxicity. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been implicated in IB formation and Huntington disease pathogenesis. However, IBs form asynchronously in only a subset of cells with mutant huntingtin, and the relationship between IB formation and UPS function has been difficult to elucidate. Here, we applied single-cell longitudinal acquisition and analysis to monitor mutant huntingtin IB formation, UPS function, and neuronal toxicity. We found that proteasome inhibition is toxic to striatal neurons in a dose-dependent fashion. Before IB formation, the UPS is more impaired in neurons that go on to form IBs than in those that do not. After forming IBs, impairment is lower in neurons with IBs than in those without. These findings suggest IBs are a protective cellular response to mutant protein mediated in part by improving intracellular protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1979453310,"alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) and haptoglobin (Hp) are both abundant secreted glycoproteins that are best known for their protease trapping and hemoglobin binding activities, respectively. Like the small heat shock proteins, both these glycoproteins have in common the ability to protect a range of proteins from stress-induced amorphous aggregation and have been described as extracellular chaperones. Using an array of biophysical techniques, this study establishes that in vitro at substoichiometric levels and under physiological conditions alpha(2)M and Hp both inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils from a range of proteins. We also provide evidence that both alpha(2)M and Hp interact with prefibrillar species to maintain the solubility of amyloidogenic proteins. These findings suggest that both alpha(2)M and Hp are likely to play an important role in controlling the inappropriate aggregation of proteins in the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2088514755,"Chronic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines have recently been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. In the brain, neuroinflammatory cytokines affect the growth and differentiation of both normal and malignant glial cells, with interleukin 1 (IL-1) shown to be secreted by the majority of glioblastoma cells. Recently, elevated levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), but not SphK2, were correlated with a shorter survival prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiforme. SphK1 is a lipid kinase that produces the pro-growth, anti-apoptotic sphingosine 1-phosphate, which can induce invasion of glioblastoma cells. Here, we show that the expression of IL-1 correlates with the expression of SphK1 in glioblastoma cells, and neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibit both the growth and invasion of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, IL-1 up-regulates SphK1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and activity in both primary human astrocytes and various glioblastoma cell lines; however, it does not affect SphK2 expression. The IL-1-induced SphK1 up-regulation can be blocked by the inhibition of JNK, the overexpression of the dominant-negative c-Jun(TAM67), and the down-regulation of c-Jun expression by small interference RNA. Activation of SphK1 expression by IL-1 occurs on the level of transcription and is mediated via a novel AP-1 element located within the first intron of the sphk1 gene. In summary, our results suggest that SphK1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by IL-1 in glioblastoma cells, and this pathway may be important in regulating survival and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells. Chronic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines have recently been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. In the brain, neuroinflammatory cytokines affect the growth and differentiation of both normal and malignant glial cells, with interleukin 1 (IL-1) shown to be secreted by the majority of glioblastoma cells.

Here, we show that the expression of IL-1 correlates with the expression of SphK1 in glioblastoma cells, and neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibit both the growth and invasion of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, IL-1 up-regulates SphK1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and activity in both primary human astrocytes and various glioblastoma cell lines; however, it does not affect SphK2 expression. The IL-1-induced SphK1 up-regulation can be blocked by the inhibition of JNK, the overexpression of the dominant-negative c-Jun(TAM67), and the down-regulation of c-Jun expression by small interference RNA. Activation of SphK1 expression by IL-1 occurs on the level of transcription and is mediated via a novel AP-1 element located within the first intron of the sphk1 gene. In summary, our results suggest that SphK1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by IL-1 in glioblastoma cells, and this pathway may be important in regulating survival and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells.

Casado Saenz E. Cejas Guerrero P. Perona R. Gonzalez Baron M. Clin. Transl. Oncol.. 2006; 8: 635-641Google Scholar, 2Gilbertson R.J. Rich J.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2007; 7: 733-736Google Scholar). The ability of glioblastoma cells to diffusely infiltrate deeply into healthy brain tissue is the major obstacle for successful treatments, including surgery and radiotherapy, thus leading to the death of the patients within 10–12 months (3Hill C. Hunter S.B. Brat D.J. Adv. Anat. Pathol.. 2003; 10: 212-217Google Scholar, 4Deb P. Sharma M.C. Mahapatra A.K. Agarwal D. Sarkar C. Neurol. India.. 2005; 53: 329-332Google Scholar). Over the years, ample studies have aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of invasion of glioblastoma cells; however, they still remain elusive. Recently, the enhanced expression of several GBM biomarkers, such as EGFR, uPAR, uPA, PAI-1, and MMP-9, attracted significant attention (5Gondi C.S. Lakka S.S. Dinh D.H. Olivero W.C. Gujrati M.

More recently, a shorter prognosis for survival of patients with GBM was correlated with the elevated expression of SphK1, an enzyme that generates S1P by phosphorylating sphingosine (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.. 2005; 64: 695-705Google Scholar). S1P is a potent lipid mediator of various cell processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration (10Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 397-407Google Scholar). In the brain, S1P is present at high concentrations (11Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem.. 1999; 272: 80-86Google Scholar), and it has been shown to stimulate the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells (12Van Brocklyn J.R. Young N. Roof R. Cancer Lett.. 2003; 199: 53-60Google Scholar). S1P can either be secreted by the cells to activate G-coupled S1P receptors (S1P1–5), or act via unknown intracellular processes (10Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 397-407Google Scholar, 13Sanchez T. Hla T. J. Cell. Biochem.. 2004; 92: 913-922Google Scholar). In addition to SphK1, S1P can also be generated by SphK2, nevertheless the expression of SphK2 does not correlate with prognosis of GBM patients.In the past decade, it has been shown that the activity of SphK1 is stimulated by various growth factors and cytokines, including epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, and nerve growth factor (10Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 397-407Google Scholar). These factors induce rapid and transient activation of SphK1 and its subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane. In contrast to these observations, knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of the sphk1 gene is limited. The intrinsic expression of SphK1 depends on the specificity protein 1 binding elements located within the 5′-flanking region of the sphk1 gene (14Imamura T. Miyauchi-Senda N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Vet. Med. Sci.. 2004; 66: 1387-1393Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of SphK1 is enhanced by epidermal growth factor, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, histamine, prolactin, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor in different cell types (15Doll F. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1738: 72-81Google Scholar, 16Sobue S. Hagiwara K. Banno Y. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Suzuki M. Takagi A. Kojima T. Asano H. Nozawa Y. Murate T. J.

Neurochem.. 2007; 102: 1585-1594Google Scholar); however, molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of sphk1 gene in response to these factors are not known.Accordingly, the factors responsible for the enhanced SphK1 expression in GBM patients have not been identified. However, it recently became apparent that inflammation can be directly linked to the development and progression of many cancers (20Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature.. 2002; 420: 860-867Google Scholar, 21Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2005; 5: 749-759Google Scholar), with inflammatory cytokines involved in these processes. IL-1 is one of the major regulators of inflammation, immune responses, and is a major neuroinflammatory cytokine in the brain that is released in response to injury or a growing tumor (22Rothwell N.J. Luheshi G.N. Trends Neurosci.. 2000; 23: 618-625Google Scholar, 23Basu A. Krady J.K. Levison S.W. J. Neurosci. Res.. 2004; 78: 151-156Google Scholar). It can induce the secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, as well as promote proliferation of glioblastoma cells and astrocytes (24Tada M. de Tribolet N. J. Neurooncol.. 1993; 17: 261-271Google Scholar, 25Cinque S. Willems J. Depraetere S. Vermeire L. Joniau M. Immunol. Lett.. 1992; 34: 267-271Google Scholar, 26Giulian D. Lachman L.B.

Moreover, IL-1 has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis of various cancer cells (23Basu A. Krady J.K. Levison S.W. J. Neurosci. Res.. 2004; 78: 151-156Google Scholar, 28Apte R.N. Dotan S. Elkabets M. White M.R. Reich E. Carmi Y. Song X. Dvozkin T. Krelin Y. Voronov E.

Cancer.. 2006; 42: 751-759Google Scholar). More importantly, glioblastoma cells have recently been shown to secrete substantial, physiologically relevant amounts of IL-1 (30Lu T. Tian L. Han Y. Vogelbaum M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 4365-4370Google Scholar).We report here that the expression level of IL-1 correlates with the levels of SphK1, but not SphK2 in glioblastoma cell lines. IL-1 also activates the expression of SphK1, but not SphK2 in both glioblastoma cells and primary human astrocytes. We show that the response to IL-1 is mediated by the activation of the JNK-c-jun pathway, and subsequent binding of c-Jun to a novel AP-1 element located within the first intron of the sphk1 gene. Moreover, depletion of IL-1 or SphK1 levels decreases the growth and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells. Therefore, both IL-1 and SphK1 may be considered as future therapeutic targets for GBM.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human glioblastoma U373-MG cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), whereas human glioblastoma A172, U87, U251, and T98G cells were obtained from Dr. Jaharul Haque (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). The U373-TAM67 cells expressing the dominant-negative c-Jun(TAM67) were described previously (31Gopalan S.M. Wilczynska K.M. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 1956-1963Google Scholar). Human cortical astrocyte cultures were established using dissociated human cerebral tissue established exactly as previously described (32Wilczynska K.M. Gopalan S.M. Bugno M. Kasza A. Konik B.S. Bryan L. Wright S. Griswold-Prenner I. Kordula T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 34955-34964Google Scholar). Cortical tissue was provided by Advanced Bioscience Resources (Alameda, CA), and the protocol for obtaining postmortem fetal neural tissue complied with the federal guidelines for fetal research, and with the Uniformed Anatomical Gift Act. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids.Cytokines and Cell Stimulation—Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 (a gift from Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA), 5 μm S1P (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with 1 μm SP600125, 10 μm BAY-117082, 10 μm SB202190, 5 μm parthenolide, 5 μg/ml Actinomycin D (Sigma), 1 μm CAY10470, 10 μm JNK peptide inhibitor I, 10 μm, JNK negative control peptide inhibitor I (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), 10 μm LY294002, 1 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), 500 nm TAK-1 inhibitor (AnalytiCon Discovery, GmbH, Potsdam, Germany), 10 μm sphingosine kinase-1 inhibitor SK1-I (33Paugh S.W.

Blood.. 2008; 112: 1382-1391Google Scholar), and then stimulated with IL-1 as described in the figure legends.RNA Preparation and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was prepared by phenol extraction, exactly as described previously (34Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem.. 2005; 94: 763-773Google Scholar). SphK1, SphK2, IL-1β, α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), c-Jun, and 18 S mRNA levels were measured using TaqMan technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). Subsequently, the cDNAs were diluted 10-fold (Sphk1, SphK2, IL-1β, ACT, and c-jun), or 10,000-fold (18 S rRNA). For real-time PCR, pre-mixed primer-probe sets, and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems and cDNAs were amplified using ABI 7900HT cycler. SphK1a, SphK1c, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were measured using DyNAmo™ SYBR Green quantitative PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA). To measure the expression of mRNAs for SphK1-spliced isoforms, specific primers located on the boundaries of the exons were designed and cDNA was amplified using ABI 7900HT cycler.Semiquantitative PCR—The expression of SphK1 isoforms were analyzed by PCR using isoform specific primers, shown below. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide.Synthetic Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were synthesized to amplify the DNA fragments from the 5′-flanking region of the SphK1 gene: (300), 5′-GGGGGTCGACGCAGCTCGTCCCAAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTCTAGAACCCGGGCGGGAACCAGCTC-3′; (1200), 5′-TAACGTCGACCCGCGGCTCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTCTAGAACCCGGGCGGGAACCAGCTC-3′; (2400), 5′-GGGGGTCGACGCAGCTCGTCCCAAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGCATCTAGAGAGATCCAAGTGGCCCGCC-3′; (L3R3), 5′-TCCCTCTAGATCACACCTTGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGGATCCAGGTCTCTTCTGGGC-3′; (L4R4), 5′-GGCTTCTAGAAGCCAGAAAAG-3′ and 5′-GTAGGATCCTAAGGGTACAGGAGG-3′; (L5R5), 5′-GAGGTCTAGAAGAGACCTGGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GATGGATCCCCTTCCCACGGTTGC-3′. The mutations within the AP-1 and CRE elements were generated using the following primers: AP-1 mutant, 5′-GCTCTCTAGAATCCGTCGGGCCGGAACC-3′ and 5′-GGATTCTAGAGAGCCCCGTGGCTCCC-3′; CRE mutant, 5′-GGAAGGATCCCGGTGCTCCTGCAGCCAC-3′ and 5′-ACCGGGATCCTTCCCTGCGGCGGCTGG-3′. The AP-1 double-stranded oligonucleotides used in EMSA had the following sequence: 5′-GATCTGGGGCTCTGACTCATCCGTCGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCGACGGATGAGTCAGAGCCCCA-3′. The expression of SphK1 isoforms was assayed using the following isoform specific primers: (AB-R), 5′-CCTGCCTTCAGCTCCTTATC-3′; (AB-F), 5′-CCGGACCGACTGGGTCCAG-3′; (R), 5′-CCTTGCCGCCGCGCGGG-3′; (A-R), 5′-GGCCGCCCGCTGGATCC-3′; (B-R), 5′-TTCCGCCGCTCAGTGAGCA-3′; (B-F), 5′-GGTTATGGATCCAGTGGTCG-3′; (C-F), 5′-GGGATTTTTACGCAGCTGGAC-3′; and (AC-F), 5′-GGTTATGGATCCAGCGGG CG-3′.Plasmid Construction—Plasmids pSphK1(300)CAT, pSphK1(1200)CAT, and pSphK1(2400)CAT were generated by cloning the XbaI/SalI-digested PCR products into the XbaI/XhoI sites of ptkCATΔEH. pSphK1(L3R3)CAT, pSphK1(L4R4)CAT, and pSphK1(L5R5)CAT plasmids were generated by cloning the XbaI/BamHI-digested PCR products into the XbaI/BamHI sites of pSphK1(1200)CAT. pSphK1(L4R4)CAT plasmid was utilized as the template to construct plasmids with mutated AP-1 and CRE sites using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Transient Transfections—Primary human astrocytes were transfected in 12-well clusters using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), with 300 ng of the reporter CAT plasmid and 100 ng of the expression plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. One day after transfection, the cells were stimulated with IL-1 or PMA, cultured another 24 h, and harvested. Extracts were prepared by freeze thawing. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (35Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.).. 1988; 67: 271-277Google Scholar, 36Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and are means ± S.E. (3–5 determinations).EMSA—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (37Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science.. 1988; 242: 540-546Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for EMSA were designed to contain four base-long single-stranded 5′-overhangs at each end after annealing. Double-stranded DNA fragments were labeled by filling in the 5′-protruding ends with Klenow enzyme using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). EMSA was carried out according to the published procedures (38Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extracts and ∼10 fmol (10,000 cpm) of probe were used. The competition experiment was performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess of the cold oligonucleotides. Polyclonal anti-c-Fos, anti-FosB, anti-Fra1, anti-Fra2, anti-c-Jun, anti-JunB, and anti-JunD antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used for the supershift studies.Western Blotting and Antibodies—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Polyclonal anti-IκBϵ, anti-c-fos, anti-phospho-c-jun, and anti-tubulin antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-MKK3/6, anti-IκBα, anti-phospho-IκBα, anti-phospho-IKK, anti-phospho-p65, anti-phospho-ATF-2, and anti-phospho-Akt antisera were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB/anti-phospho-ATF-1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-sphingosine kinase 1 antibodies were described previously (39Hait N.C. Sarkar S. Le Stunff H. Mikami A. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 29462-29469Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The neutralizing anti-IL-1β antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Down-regulation with siRNA—The expression of p65 and c-jun was down-regulated using SMARTpool siRNAs purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). SphK1 mRNA was down-regulated with siRNA targeted to a unique hSphK1 sequence as described previously (40Bektas M. Jolly P.S. Muller C. Eberle J. Spiegel S. Geilen C.C. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 178-187Google Scholar). siRNAs were transfected into cells using Dharmafect 1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO).Sphingosine Kinase Activity Assay—SphK activity was measured using 10-μg cell lysates with 50 μm sphingosine, in the presence of 0.25% Triton X-100 and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi and 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine in a final volume of 200 μl, as described previously (41Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Google Scholar, 42Paugh S.W. Payne S.G. Barbour S.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett.. 2003; 554: 189-193Google Scholar). S1P was separated by TLC on silica gel G-60 with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3: 2:1, v/v) as a solvent, and the radioactive spots corresponding to S1P were quantified with a FX Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Background was determined in the absence of substrate. Activity is expressed as picomoles of S1P formed per min per mg of protein.Invasion Assay—The invasion of the cells was measured in a modified Boyden chamber, using polycarbonate filters (25 by 80 mm, 12-μm pore size) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). IL-1 was added to both the upper and lower chamber, and the cells were also added to the upper chamber at 5 × 104 cells/well. After 7 h, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were mechanically removed, and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Fisher Scientific). The migrated cells were counted with a microscope and a 10× objective. Each data point is the average number of cells in five random fields, and is the average ± S.D. of three individual wells.Proliferation Assay—The number of viable cells was measured using the WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science), according to the supplier's instructions.RESULTSCoexpression of SphK1 and IL-1β in Glioblastoma Cells; Effect of IL-1 on Proliferation and Invasion—Enhanced expression of SphK1, but not SphK2, has been correlated with the shorter survival of glioblastoma patients (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.. 2005; 64: 695-705Google Scholar); nevertheless, factors that enhance SphK1 expression in the tumors of these patients have not been identified. Because glioblastoma cells secrete IL-1 and chronic inflammation has been linked to cancer, the expression of SphK1 could be regulated by proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1. To examine whether IL-1 is responsible for the enhanced expression of SphK1, we analyzed the expression of SphK1, SphK2, and IL-1β in several glioblastoma cell lines, and found drastic differences in their expression (Fig. 1A). More importantly, the enhanced expression of IL-1β correlated with high expression levels of SphK1, but not SphK2. Of note, U87 cells expressed the highest levels of SphK1 and IL-1β, and these cells are fairly invasive in comparison to the other cell lines (43Schichor C. Kerkau S. Visted T. Martini R. Bjerkvig R. Tonn J.C. Goldbrunner R. J. Neurooncol.. 2005; 73: 9-18Google Scholar).To determine if IL-1 can also induce the expression of SphK1 in primary cells, we analyzed the expression of both SphK1 and SphK2 in primary human astrocytes. As a control, we stimulated cells with PMA, which has previously been shown to activate SphK1 expression in other cell types (44Nakade Y. Banno Y.K.T.K. Hagiwara K. Sobue S. Koda M. Suzuki M. Kojima T. Takagi A. Asano H. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1635: 104-116Google Scholar). Similarly to the coexpression of SphK1 and IL-1 in glioblastoma cells, the expression of SphK1 was significantly up-regulated by IL-1 (and PMA) in astrocytes, while the expression of SphK2 was not changed (Fig. 1B); thus suggesting that the activation of SphK1 expression by IL-1 may occur in the brain during inflammation. We conclude that IL-1 is an important regulator of SphK1 expression in human astrocytes and glioblastoma cells.Because IL-1 is secreted by glioblastoma cells and induces the expression of SphK1, whose product S1P stimulates their growth and invasion, we analyzed whether inhibition of IL-1 and SphK1 affects growth and invasiveness of these cells. We used U373 cells as a model, because their response to S1P is well characterized (12Van Brocklyn J.R. Young N. Roof R. Cancer Lett.. 2003; 199: 53-60Google Scholar). In fact, IL-1 increased the number of viable U373 cells, while the knockdown of SphK1 had an opposite effect (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies to IL-1β significantly decreased both the number of U373 cells and their invasion (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, IL-1 is an important factor that can influence glioblastoma cell number and invasion, likely via the activation of Sphk1 expression.IL-1 Up-regulates SphK1 Expression in Glioblastoma Cells—Subsequently, we used U373 and A172 cells, which express low levels of SphK1 and IL-1β (Fig. 1A), and analyzed the expression of SphK1 and SphK2 in response to IL-1. In addition, we stimulated these cells with S1P to determine if this product of SphK1 can modulate SphK1 expression. We found that both IL-1 and S1P efficiently activated the expression of SphK1 on the mRNA level in U373, and they had an additive effect when used together (Fig. 2A). In contrast to SphK1, SphK2 expression was not affected by IL-1 or S1P. The up-regulation of SphK1 expression by IL-1 was time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively), with a maximum stimulation at 8–18 h. The up-regulation of SphK1 expression on the mRNA level was paralleled by similar changes on the protein level (Fig. 2C) and in the enzymatic activity (Fig. 2D). Because of the presence of nonspecific bands detected by SphK1 antibodies, the identity of SphK1 bands was established by the down-regulation of SphK1 expression using specific siRNA (Fig. 2B). We found that both U373 and A172 cells express two SphK1 isoforms, migrating at 46 and 52 kDa, which likely represent SphK1a and Sphk1c splice variants described previously (45Imamura T. Ohgane J.

Biochem. J.. 2006; 397: 461-471Google Scholar). These data indicate that (i) SphK1 expression is tightly regulated by IL-1, which likely provides a sustained pool of S1P, and (ii) S1P provides additional positive feedback loop, which further enhances expression of SphK1.FIGURE 2IL-1 up-regulates SphK1 expression and activity in glioblastoma cells. U373 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 or 5 μm S1P for 18 h. A, SphK1 or SphK2 mRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. B, A172 and U373 cells were transfected with either control or SphK1 siRNA. 48 h later, protein lysates were prepared and down-regulation of SphK1 protein expression was measured by Western blotting. C, lysates were prepared, and SphK1 protein level was determined by Western blotting. D, sphingosine kinase assays were performed in whole cell lysates, and bands corresponding to [32P]S1P were separated and quantitated. E, U373 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 for the indicated times or for 18 h with indicated concentration of IL-1. F, subsequently, RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and SphK1 mRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR (TaqMan). Data shown in the A, E, and F are expressed as -fold induction after normalization to 18 S rRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the SphK1 Isoforms Regulated by IL-1—Multiple isoforms of SphK1 have previously been shown to exist in rats, mice, and humans (45Imamura T.

Proia R.L. Hla T. Biochem. J.. 2006; 397: 461-471Google Scholar). The gene encoding SphK1 contains five exons and can be alternatively spliced producing SphK1 isoforms: SphK1a, SphK1b, and SphK1c. SphK1a lacks a fragment of the third exon encoding 14 amino acids, which is present in SphK1b and SphK1c, whereas SphK1c possesses an additional 86 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig. 3A). To determine which of the SphK1 isoforms are expressed in U373 cells, isoform-specific primers were designed on the boundaries of the exons to specifically detect different mRNA splice variants (Fig. 3A). We found that both SphK1a and SphK1c isoforms are expressed in U373 cells, whereas the SphK1b was not detected (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, using isoform-specific quantitative PCR, we tested whether IL-1 regulates the expression of both isoforms. In fact, the expression of both SphK1a and SphK1c was similarly up-regulated by IL-1 (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3IL-1 regulates expression"
https://openalex.org/W2113621003,"O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification of proteins that functions as a nutrient sensing mechanism. We have previously shown a significant induction of O-GlcNAc modification under conditions of glucose deprivation. Increased O-GlcNAc modification was mediated by increased mRNA for nucleocytoplasmic O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (ncOGT). We have investigated the mechanism mediating ncOGT induction with glucose deprivation. The signal does not appear to be general energy depletion because no differences in AMP-dependent kinase protein levels or phosphorylation were observed between glucose-deprived and normal glucose-treated cells. However, treatment of glucose-deprived cells with a small dose (1 mm) of glucosamine blocked the induction of ncOGT mRNA and subsequent increase in O-GlcNAc protein modification, suggesting that decreased hexosamine flux is the signal for ncOGT up-regulation. Consistent with this, treatment of glucose-deprived cells with an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase (O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenyl carbamat) completely prevented the subsequent up-regulation of ncOGT. Glucosamine treatment also resulted in a 40% rescue of the down-regulation of glycogen synthase activity normally seen after glucose deprivation. We conclude that deglycosylation of proteins within the first few hours of glucose deprivation promotes ncOGT induction. These findings suggest a novel negative feedback regulatory loop for OGT and O-GlcNAc regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2144042665,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases, originally known as microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases, are activated in response to a variety of stimuli. Here we report that microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as colchicine or nocodazole induced strong activation of MAP kinases including JNK, ERK, and p38. This effect was markedly attenuated by parkin, whose mutations are linked to Parkinson disease (PD). Our previous study has shown that parkin stabilizes microtubules through strong interactions mediated by three independent domains. We found that each of the three microtubule-binding domains of parkin was sufficient to reduce MAP kinase activation induced by microtubule depolymerization. The ability to attenuate microtubule depolymerization and the ensuing MAP kinase activation was abrogated in B-lymphocytes and fibroblasts derived from PD patients with parkin mutations such as exon 4 deletion. Such mutations produced truncated parkin proteins lacking any microtubule binding domain and prevented parkin from protecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons against microtubule-depolymerizing toxins such as rotenone or colchicine. Consistent with these, blocking MAP kinase activation in midbrain dopaminergic neurons by knocking down MAP kinase kinases (MKK) significantly reduced the selective toxicity of rotenone or colchicine. Conversely, overexpression of MAP kinases caused marked toxicities that were significantly attenuated by parkin. Thus, the results suggest that parkin protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons against microtubule-depolymerizing PD toxins such as rotenone by stabilizing microtubules to attenuate MAP kinase activation.

Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), and p38 proteins (p38α/β/γ/δ) in mammalian species (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature.. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar). Initially, MAP kinase stood for microtubule-associated protein kinase because microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2 are excellent substrates of MAP kinases (2Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1986; 134: 565-571Google Scholar, 3Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1988; 85: 3753-3757Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a significant portion of ERK is associated with microtubules (4Reszka A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 8881-8885Google Scholar). It has also been shown that JNK1 is required for the maintenance of microtubule integrity in neurons through controlling the phosphorylation states of MAP2 and MAP1B (5Chang L. Jones Y. Ellisman M.H. Goldstein L.S. Karin M. Dev. Cell.. 2003; 4: 521-533Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau, an axon-enriched MAP, by p38δ promotes microtubule assembly (6Feijoo C. Campbell D.G. Jakes R. Goedert M. Cuenda A. J. Cell Sci.. 2005; 118: 397-408Google Scholar). All MAP kinases are proline-directed kinases, preferring serine or threonine residues followed by proline. The abundance of such sites on many microtubule-associated proteins suggests that MAP kinases play critical roles in regulating the phosphorylation states of MAPs; hence, the dynamic properties of microtubules.The selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and directly contributes to its locomotor symptoms. Nigral DA neurons project to striatal target areas with very long axons, which rely on microtubules to transport dopamine vesicles over long distances. Our previous studies have shown that these dopaminergic neurons are particularly vulnerable to microtubule-depolymerizing agents including rotenone (7Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Google Scholar), an environmental toxin that causes PD-like symptoms and pathologies in animal models (8Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci.. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Google Scholar). Microtubule depolymerization disrupts vesicular transport, which significantly elevates oxidative stress due to increased oxidation of cytosolic dopamine leaked from vesicles (7Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Google Scholar). On the other hand our previous studies have shown that parkin, a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase linked to Parkinson disease, strongly binds to microtubules (9Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Google Scholar) through redundant, high affinity interactions mediated by three independent domains (10Yang F. Jiang Q. Zhao J. Ren Y. Sutton M.D. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 17154-17162Google Scholar). In addition, parkin increases the ubiquitination and degradation of both α- and β-tubulin (9Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Google Scholar), whose complex folding reactions are prone to produce misfolded intermediates (11Lewis S.A. Tian G.L. Cowan N.J. Trends Cell Biol.. 1997; 7: 479-484Google Scholar). These results suggest that parkin plays an important role in maintaining the stability and normal functions of microtubules, which are critically involved in the survival of nigral DA neurons (12Feng J. Neuroscientist.. 2006; 12: 469-476Google Scholar).In the present study we examined the impact of parkin on MAP kinase activation induced by microtubule depolymerization. Our results showed that MAP kinases, including JNK, ERK, and p38, were activated by microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as colchicine and nocodazole. This effect was greatly attenuated by overexpression of wild-type parkin or any one of its three microtubule binding domains. The ability of parkin to suppress microtubule depolymerization and the ensuing MAP kinase activation was abrogated in PD patients with parkin mutations such as exon 4 deletion, which produced a truncated protein lacking any microtubule-binding domain. This mutation also prevented parkin from protecting dopaminergic neurons against the selective toxicity of microtubule-depolymerizing toxins such as rotenone or colchicine. Blocking MAP kinase activation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) of MAP kinase kinases significantly reduced the selective toxicity of rotenone or colchicine, whereas overexpression of MAP kinases produced toxicities that were significantly reduced by parkin. Together, the results suggest that parkin protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons against microtubule-depolymerizing PD toxins by stabilizing microtubules to rein in MAP kinase activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Expression Constructs—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total or phosphorylated JNK1/2, c-Jun, ERK1/2, or p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2) and cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against actin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-TH was from Affinity Bio-Reagents (Golden, CO). Various human parkin expression constructs and FLAG-tagged luciferase were generated previously (10Yang F. Jiang Q. Zhao J. Ren Y. Sutton M.D. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 17154-17162Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged expression constructs containing exon 4-deleted parkin cDNA were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from the human B lymphocyte cell line ND01037, which was derived from a PD patient with homozygous deletion of exon 4 of parkin (13Dogu O. Johnson J. Hernandez D. Hanson M. Hardy J. Apaydin H. Ozekmekci S. Sevim S. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Movement Disorders.. 2004; 19: 812-816Google Scholar). The primers for the Δ4 construct were ATGATAGTGTTTGTCAGGTTCAAC and GGAATTAAAACATCATCCCAGCAA. The primers for the Δ4′ construct were ATGATAGTGTTTGTCAGGTTCAAC and CTACACGTCGAACCAGTGGTC. The PCR products were verified by sequencing and subcloned into the mammalian expression construct pCMV-tag 2B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which added an N-terminal FLAG tag. Mouse cDNA for ERK1, JNK1, or p38α was purchased from Openbiosystems (Huntsville, AL) and was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), which adds GFP at the N terminus of the MAP kinase. FLAG-parkin was subcloned into the pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) for production of recombinant sindbis virus according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cell Lines, Neuronal Cultures, B-lymphocytes, and Skin Fibroblasts from PD Patients—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing FLAG-parkin were generated previously (14Jiang H. Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2004; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Primary midbrain neuronal cultures were prepared from rat embryos at E18 as previously described (7Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in 24-well plates in neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and AraC (5 μm, Sigma) for 14 days. Before neuronal cultures were treated with colchicine or nocodazole, they were incubated in neurobasal media without B27 for 2 h to lower the basal level of MAP kinase activation induced by growth factors in B27. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphocyte cell lines were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). ND01037 was derived from a PD patient (male Caucasian, 33 years of age at sampling) with homozygous deletion of exon 4 of parkin. ND01038 (male Caucasian, 41 years) and ND01040 (female Caucasian, 51 years) were derived from unaffected siblings of ND01037 and carried heterozygous deletion of exon 4 (13Dogu O. Johnson J. Hernandez D. Hanson M. Hardy J. Apaydin H. Ozekmekci S. Sevim S. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Movement Disorders.. 2004; 19: 812-816Google Scholar). Two unrelated and unaffected controls were used, ND00092 (male Caucasian, 37 years) and ND05706 (male Caucasian, 39 years). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Primary skin fibroblasts from two PD patients with parkin mutations and two normal subjects are described previously. One patient carried a homozygous deletion of exon 2, whereas the other carries compound heterozygous deletions of exons 3-4 and exons 3-5 (15Nakaso K. Adachi Y. Yasui K. Sakuma K. Nakashima K. Neurosci. Lett.. 2006; 400: 44-47Google Scholar). These primary fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The protocols covering the use of PD cell lines have been determined to meet exempt criteria for human subject research by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of the State University of New York at Buffalo.Transfection and Western Blotting—Transient transfection of various constructs in HEK293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method for 48 h. Cells cultured in 6-cm dishes were washed 3 times in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant fractions containing equal amounts of total proteins were boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min followed by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analysis by Western blots with various antibodies. Western blotting was carried out using the ECL method according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare).Extraction of Free or Polymerized Tubulin—Free or polymerized tubulin from HEK293 cells, B-lymphocytes, or primary fibroblasts was extracted as described previously (7Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Google Scholar). After the cells were treated with 10 μm colchicine or nocodazole for 2 h, they were washed twice at 37 °C with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.75, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 m glycerol. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 600 μl of free tubulin extraction buffer (buffer A plus 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors). The extracts were centrifuged at 37 °C for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant fractions contained free tubulin extracted from the cytosol. The pellet fraction and lysed cells in the culture dish were dissolved in 600 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, plus 0.5% SDS and contained tubulin originally in a polymerized state (i.e. as microtubules). Equal amounts of total proteins from free or polymerized tubulin fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-α-tubulin to assess the amount of tubulin or antiactin to show equal loading.Transfection of Midbrain Neuronal Culture, Immunocytochemistry, Image Acquisition, and Analysis—Primary embryonic rat midbrain neuronal cultures maintained for 10 days were transfected with 3 μg of various constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Four days later (i.e. at 14 days in vitro) the cultures were treated with rotenone (100 nm) or colchicine (10 μm) for 12 h. Cell death was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit from Roche Applied Science. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Heights, MI) and merged using the SPOT software (Diagnostic Instrument). The cultures contained many dead glial cells (TUNEL+), which were killed by AraC in the media. Double-stranded siRNA targeting rat MKK1 (NM_031643, CGUGUACAUCAUGGUAUUUtt), MKK2 (NM_ 133283, GGACAUCUUAGGGAAGGUCtt), MKK3 (NM_008928, GCCAUAAGCUACUGCCAUUtt), MKK4 (NM_001030023, GGACGAGUCCAAAAGGCCAtt), MKK6 (NM_053703, GCCUUCAAAUGUGCUCAUUtt), and MKK7 (NM_ 001025425, GCGUUAUCAGGCAGAAAUCtt) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). At 11 days in vitro, rat midbrain neuronal cultures were co-transfected with siRNA and an enhanced green fluorescence protein plasmid (Clontech, Cambridge, UK) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (16Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci.. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Google Scholar). To test the effectiveness of MKK siRNAs, 2-3 days after transfection cultures were treated with 10 μm colchicine for 2 h and stained for the corresponding activated MAP kinases: anti-phospho- (p)-ERK for siRNA of MKK1 or MKK2; anti-p-p38 for siRNA of MKK3 or MKK6; anti-p-JNK for siRNA of MKK4 or MKK7. The effects of these siRNAs on the selective toxicity of rotenone or colchicine were examined in rat midbrain neuronal cultures as described above. In experiments requiring the coexpression of a MAP kinase and parkin, we first transfected the cultures with a GFP-MAPK plasmid and 24 h later infected the cultures with the FLAG-parkin sindbis virus for another 24 h before the cultures were treated with 30 nm rotenone or 10 μm colchicine for 12 h. The lower concentration of rotenone was used because the combined toxicity of MAP kinase and 100 nm rotenone was too high for reliable quantification. For each condition we counted 6 coverslips with at least 50 transfected TH+ neurons on each coverslip and in some experiments with at least 25 TH+ neurons co-expressed a GFP-MAPK and FLAG-parkin. The sindbis virus infected at least 50% neurons. The total number of TH+ neuron per coverslip was about 400-500. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired t test using the software Origin (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA).RESULTSParkin Attenuates JNK Activation Induced by Microtubule Depolymerization—To examine the impact of microtubule depolymerization on MAP kinases, we treated the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 or the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent colchicine or nocodazole (both at 10 μm for 2 h). As shown in Fig. 1, colchicine or nocodazole treatment activated all three JNK isoforms (JNK1 at 46 kDa, JNK2 and JNK3 at 54 kDa), which were recognized by the antibodies against phospho-JNK and total JNK. To identify the optimal treatment regimen, we treated both cell lines with 10 μm colchicine or nocodazole for various durations. JNK activation in the two cell lines had a similar time course, which peaked at 1-2 h (data not shown). We also treated both cell lines for 2 h with different concentrations of colchicine or nocodazole. JNK activation reached a plateau at 10 μm concentrations of either drug (data not shown). Thus, we used 10 μm and 2 h for all subsequent experiments for consistency and maximal activation of MAP kinases. Stable expression of parkin in HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells greatly blocked JNK activation without affecting the expression level of JNK (Fig. 1).The Effect of Parkin on JNK Activation Is Occluded by Taxol—Because our previous study has shown that parkin stabilizes microtubules against depolymerizing agents (10Yang F. Jiang Q. Zhao J. Ren Y. Sutton M.D. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 17154-17162Google Scholar), we tested whether the effect of parkin was occluded by the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol. As shown in Fig. 2, taxol (10 μm for 2 h) blocked JNK activation induced by colchicine or nocodazole in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. By itself, taxol did not have any significant effect on JNK activation. Overexpression of parkin attenuated JNK activation to similar extents in the absence or presence of taxol. The occlusive effects of parkin and taxol suggest that both act on the same molecular target—microtubules.FIGURE 2The effect of parkin on JNK activation is occluded by taxol. HEK293 cells or HEK293 stably expressing parkin (A), SH-SY5Y cells or SH-SY5Y stably expressing parkin (B) were treated with 10 μm colchicine (C) or nocodazole (N) with or without taxol (T) for 2 h.

Stable expression of parkin in both cells significantly attenuated the activation of ERK and p38 (Fig. 3A). The effect of parkin on ERK activation was occluded by taxol in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3B) and HEK293 cells (data not shown). Similarly, parkin and taxol occluded each other on p38 activation induced by colchicine or nocodazole (data not shown). These results suggest that microtubule depolymerization-induced activation of all three major MAP kinases is significantly reduced by parkin through a mechanism occluded by taxol.FIGURE 3Parkin attenuates colchicine- or nocodazole-induced ERK and p38 activation in a manner occluded by taxol. A and B, HEK293 or HEK293 cells stably expressing parkin, SH-SY5Y, or SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing parkin were treated with 10 μm colchicine (C) or nocodazole (N) without or with taxol (T) for 2 h.

Any one of these domains stabilizes microtubules to a similar extent as the full-length parkin protein (10Yang F. Jiang Q. Zhao J. Ren Y. Sutton M.D. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 17154-17162Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism by which parkin suppressed MAP kinase activation, we transfected HEK293 cells with each of the five different domains of parkin (Fig. 4A) and treated the cells without or with colchicine (10 μm for 2 h). Expression of the Linker, RING1, or RING2 domain blocked colchicine-induced JNK activation, just as wild-type parkin. In contrast, the Ubl or IBR domain, like the luciferase control, did not significantly affect JNK activation (Fig. 4B). Expression levels of these constructs were shown in Fig. 4C. We found that each of the three microtubule-stabilizing domains of parkin (Linker, RING1, and RING2) also significantly attenuated colchicine-induced activation of ERK and p38 (data not shown). Thus, each of the microtubule binding domains of parkin is sufficient not only to stabilize microtubule but also to suppress MAP kinase activation induced by microtubule depolymerization.FIGURE 4Microtubule binding domains of parkin are sufficient to attenuate JNK activation induced by microtubule depolymerization.

The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, which expresses very little endogenous parkin, was used as a negative control. ND01037 was derived from a PD patient with homozygous deletion of exon 4, whereas ND01038 and ND01040, which were derived from unaffected siblings of the patient, carried the same mutation in the heterozygous state (13Dogu O. Johnson J. Hernandez D. Hanson M. Hardy J. Apaydin H. Ozekmekci S. Sevim S. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Movement Disorders.. 2004; 19: 812-816Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, this panel of cells was treated with 10 μm colchicine for 2 h. Significant activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 was only seen in HEK293 cells and ND01037, which had homozygous deletion of parkin exon 4. In contrast, none of the three MAP kinases was significantly activated in the heterozygous carriers or the unaffected normal controls. Anti-parkin immunoblot confirmed that parkin expression was lost in ND01037 and was very low in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). The same results were obtained when we used nocodazole (10 μm for 2 h) instead of colchicine (data not shown). The data suggest that homozygous exon 4 deletion of parkin abrogates the ability of parkin to attenuate MAP kinase activation induced by microtubule-depolymerizing agents.FIGURE 5The ability of parkin to suppress MAP kinase activation and microtubule depolymerization is lost in PD patients with parkin mutations. A and B, HEK293 cells (293) and B-lymphocytes derived from two normal controls (092 and 706) and a family with exon 4 deletion of parkin (037, homozygote with PD; 038 and 040, unaffected heterozygous siblings) were treated without or with colchicine (Col, 10 μm) for 2 h. Colchicine-induced activation of MAP kinases was greatly attenuated in normal subjects and unaffected heterozygotes but not in PD patient with homozygous exon 4 deletion or 293 cells. Parkin immunoblot confirmed the loss of parkin protein in the homozygote and the very low level of endogenous parkin in 293 cells (A). The amounts of free tubulin (tub) and polymerized (poly.) tubulin in microtubules showed that colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization was significantly attenuated in normal controls or unaffected heterozygotes but not in PD patient with homozygous exon 4 deletion or 293 cells (B). Anti-actin blot showed equal loading. Cell lines: 037, ND01037; 038, ND01038; 040, ND01040; 092, ND00092; 706, ND05706. C, the same experiments were repeated in primary skin fibroblasts derived from two normal controls (Con1 and Con2) and two PD patients with parkin homozygous exon 2 deletion (Δ2/2) or compound heterozygous deletions of exons 3-4 and 3-5 (Δ3-4/3-5). Fibroblasts from PD patients with parkin mutations lost the ability to attenuate colchicine-induced MAP kinase activation and microtubule depolymerization. Parkin expression was lost in cells from the two patients. All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined the impact of exon 4 deletion on the ability of parkin to suppress microtubule depolymerization. Free tubulin or polymerized tubulin was extracted from the same panel of cells treated with colchicine at 10 μm for 2 h. The amounts of free tubulin after treatment, which indicate the degree of microtubule depolymerization, were much higher in HEK293 cells and ND01037 than in the heterozygous carriers or the normal controls (Fig. 5B). Reciprocal changes were observed in the amount of polymerized tubulin (Fig. 5B). Thus, cells that contain homozygous exon 4 deletion of parkin behaved like HEK293 cells, which expressed very little parkin. In contrast, cells that carry the heterozygous mutation responded like cells with wild-type parkin. Same results were obtained when we used nocodazole (10 μm for 2 h) instead of colchicine (data not shown).To substantiate these results, we used primary skin fibroblasts derived from two normal subjects (Con1 and Con2) and two PD patients with parkin mutations (Δ2/2, homozygous exon 2 deletion; Δ3-4/3-5, compound heterozygous deletions of exons 3-4 and 3-5). These fibroblasts and HEK293 cells (as a negative control) were treated with 10 μm colchicine for 2 h. Activation of all three MAP kinases (JNK, ERK, and p38) was markedly attenuated in the two nor"
https://openalex.org/W2068348872,"Acid sphingomyelinase plays important roles in ceramide homeostasis, which has been proposed to be linked to insulin resistance. To test this association in vivo, acid sphingomyelinase deletion (asm(-/-)) was transferred to mice lacking the low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr(-/-)), and then offsprings were placed on control or modified (enriched in saturated fat and cholesterol) diets for 10 weeks. The modified diet caused hypercholesterolemia in all genotypes; however, in contrast to asm(+/+)/ldlr(-/-), the acid sphingomyelinase-deficient littermates did not display hepatic triacylglyceride accumulation, although sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids were substantially elevated, and the liver was enlarged. asm(-/-)/ldlr(-/-) mice on a modified diet did not accumulate body fat and were protected against diet-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Experiments with hepatocytes revealed that acid sphingomyelinase regulates the partitioning of the major fatty acid in the modified diet, palmitate, into two competitive and inversely related pools, triacylglycerides and sphingolipids, apparently via modulation of serine palmitoyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo sphingolipid synthesis. These studies provide evidence that acid sphingomyelinase activity plays an essential role in the regulation of glucose metabolism by regulating the hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerides and sphingolipids during consumption of a diet rich in saturated fats."

Four ASIC genes in the human genome, ASIC1 to ASIC4, give rise to at least six isoforms that associate in various combinations to form channels with different functional properties (1Wemmie J.A.

The ASICs constitute a distinct group in the large family of channels known as Degenerins characterized by a common structure but widely diverse gating stimuli: mechanical forces (3O'Hagan R.

Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), or no stimulus at all, such as ENaC, which exhibits constitutive activity (7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). The structure shared by all Degenerins consists of two transmembrane segments, TM1 and TM2, a large extracellular domain, and short cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. The recently published crystal structure of a truncated chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) at a resolution of 1.9 Å (8Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) shows that ASIC1 is a trimer, and it provides detailed structure of the large extracellular domain that is crucial for understanding the gating mechanism of the ASICs. A feature revealed by the atomic structure is a cluster of negatively and one positively charged residue in the interface of subdomain D (Arg-191), subdomain E (Asp-238 and Glu-239), and subdomain F (Asp-346 and Asp-350) (see Fig. 1A) that was hypothesized to constitute the proton sensor. Furthermore, it was proposed that binding of protons to this site displaces subdomain F toward TM1 to open the pore (8Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Although the solved atomic structure of cASIC1 provides a valuable tool to advance the understanding of how external protons activate the ASICs, it represents only a snapshot of the gating process thereby additional experimental evidence is needed to elucidate the gating mechanism. The general idea that conformational changes triggered by binding of the specific agonist to the extracellular domain of a ligand activated channel need to be transmitted to the transmembrane domain, where the pore gate is located, draws attention to the pair of closely located residues, Tyr-72 and Trp-288, as they provide a potential contact site between the extracellular and the transmembrane domains. This study examines the functional role of the conserved residues, Tyr-72 and Trp-288, that are located distantly in the primary sequence but are brought to close proximity (∼3.7 Å) by the folding of the extracellular domain (ECD). This arrangement could provide a contact site between the ECD and TM1 whereby a conformation change of the ECD is transmitted to the pore gate in the transmembrane domain. Electrophysiology and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp of Oocytes—Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA in a volume of 50 nl and used after 2-4 days of incubation at 16 °C. For two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (400 μl) perfused by gravity at a rate of 4 ml/min. Oocytes were impaled with two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl having a resistance lower than 1 megaohm. Membrane potential was held at -60 mV, and whole-cell currents were recorded with a Clamp OC-725B (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz (PowerLab/200, ADInstruments). Composition of the standard bath solution was 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-MES adjusted to pH 7.4. Activating solutions were administered by a perfusion system positioned directly in front of the oocyte. Composition of activating solutions was 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-MES or 10 mm MES adjusted to pH 7.2-4.0. Patch Clamp—Currents from outside-out patches were recorded with an EPC-9 amplifier and the Pulse acquisition program (HEKA Electronic). Patch pipettes were pulled from PG150T glass (Warner Instruments) to tip diameters of 2-5 μm after heat polishing. Bath solution for patch clamp recording was 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4. The pipette solution was of identical composition as the bath, but it did not contain CaCl2. Activating solutions were buffered with MES to pH 7.2, 7.0. 6.5, 6.0, 5.0, or 4.0. Application of activation solutions was performed using the SF 77A Perfusion Fast-Step device (Warner Instruments) under control of the program Pulse. Calculation of Apparent pH50—Oocytes were exposed sequentially to solutions of decreasing pH from 7.2 to 4.0. Between test applications, oocytes were perfused with solution of pH 7.4 for at least 30 s to recover from desensitization. If possible, each oocyte was tested twice with the whole range of pH solutions. The average of the peak currents from each pH was normalized to the value of pH that produced maximal current. The mean and standard deviation were obtained, and the pH50 was calculated according to the equation I = 1/(1 + (EC50/[H])n), where I is the normalized value for the test pH, EC50 is the concentration of protons that induces half-maximal currents, and n is the Hill coefficient. KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) was used to draw graphs and for curve-fitting. Desensitization Rates—The desensitization rate was calculated by fitting the decay of proton-activated currents from outside-out patches to a single exponential. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Rat ASIC1a cDNA was modified by the addition of a V5 tag at the carboxyl terminus. Mutations were introduced in the sequence of rASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 and rat α, β, and γ ENaC subunits using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations. Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Oocytes injected with wild type or mutant rASIC1 cRNAs were surface-biotinylated as previously described (9Coric T. Zheng D. Gerstein M. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 725-735Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 and cleared by centrifugation, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered with streptavidin beads (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and processed for Western blotting with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Residues Tyr-72 and Trp-288 Are Essential for ASIC Function—The residue Tyr-72, located in the tether after TM1, and Trp-288, at the tip of the loop of subdomain F (Fig. 1a), are in close proximity in the crystal structure of cASIC1. Substitution of any of them by Gly in rat ASIC1 makes channels unresponsive to pH as low as 4.0. The same positions were subsequently replaced by amino acids with different side chains as indicated in Table 1. Aromatic amino acids, Y, F, W, or H and swapping of the residues to Trp-72 and Tyr-288 produced functional channels (Fig. 2A). By contrast, small or large aliphatic side chains, proline, or negatively charged residues eliminated proton-induced currents. Histidine substitutions in 72 and 288 and arginine in position 72 (Y72R), but not in position 288 (W288R), retained channel function. However, all these functional mutant channels expressed lower proton sensitivity and faster desensitization rate than WT ASIC1 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Lysine, another positively charged residue, introduced in position 72 or 288 produced channels unresponsive to pH 4.0.TABLE 1The numbers represent the mean ± S.D. whole-cell currents elicited by pH 6.0 of at least 10 independent oocytesMutantCurrentMutantCurrentμAμAWT13 ± 5Y72F15 ± 4W288F14 ± 3Y72W11 ± 6W288Y10 ± 5Y72H4 ± 0.6ap < 0.001, statistically significant difference compared to WT.W288H18 ± 5Y72R8 ± 3W288R0Y72K0W288K0Y72G0W288G0Y72A0W288A0Y72L0W288L0Y72V0W288V0Y72T0W288T0Y72P0W288P0Y72E0W288E0Y72C0Y72C/W288H0Y72Q0W288Q0L284A15 ± 4.5Y72W/W288Y17 ± 6L284P0Y72H/W288H0.9 ± 0.3ap < 0.001, statistically significant difference compared to WT.P285Q/A14 ± 5Y72R/W288H0.7 ± 0.2ap < 0.001, statistically significant difference compared to WT.P287Q/A0P365A2.6 ± 1.5ap < 0.001, statistically significant difference compared to WT.a p < 0.001, statistically significant difference compared to WT. Open table in a new tab The absence of ASIC1 current induced by the former mutations was not explained by intracellular retention of the mutant channels because biotinylation of surface proteins revealed equal amounts of rASIC1 protein in the plasma membrane of cells expressing wild type or mutants Gly-72 or Gly-288 as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). As aromatic amino acids at positions corresponding to 72 and 288 in ASIC1 are present in other Degenerins, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, we examined whether those residues are also essential for function in other channels. Substitution of either one the aromatic residues by Ala or Gly in rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 also produced non-functional channels. The epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, is another member of the Degenerins and is closely related in structure to the ASICs, although it differs in means of activation as ENaC is not gated by protons but is instead constitutively open. Additionally, ENaC is a heterotrimer of three different subunits α, βm and γ; each of the subunits has aromatic residues in the following positions that correspond to Tyr-72 and Trp-288 in the ASICs: αTyr-138 and αTyr-418, βTrp-77 and βTyr-356, and γTyr-79 and γTyr-370. Substitution for alanine of all six aromatic residues and expression in oocytes of the double mutants α, β, and γ produced large non-desensitizing inward currents completely blocked by the specific inhibitor amiloride, wild type 22 ± 6 (n = 12), and mutant 26 ± 8 (n = 12) (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that aromatic residues or arginine must occupy position 72, and only aromatic residues must be in position 288 to maintain proton sensitivity of the ASICs. The same pair of aromatic residues in the structurally related ENaC channel is not essential for function. Functional Channels with Histidine or Arginine Substitutions—As indicated, all the aromatic residues Tyr, Phe, Trp, including His, at positions 72 and 288 produced channels responsive to protons, but only Tyr, Phe, and Trp maintained the functional properties of ASIC1 wild type. Substitutions by His shifted the sensitivity to protons toward more acidic pH and decreased the magnitude of the peak currents, in particular Y72H and the double mutant Y72H/W288H. The average magnitude of the peak current at pH 5.0 was 18 ± 5, 4 ± 0.6, and 0.9 ± 0.3 μA/oocyte for mutant channels W288H, Y72H, and Y72H/W288H, respectively (Table 1). Rates of desensitization were in average 3-fold faster in the mutant Y72H than in WT channels. Fig. 2C shows the calculated time constant of desensitization (τd) obtained from multichannel patches in the outside-out configuration. The apparent pH50 was 5.2 for Y72R compared with 6.6 for WT ASIC1 (Fig. 2B). We also observed a 3-fold faster desensitization rate in ASIC1-Y72R for all tested pH values (Fig. 2C). These findings show that the imidazole ring can substitute at least in part for other canonical aromatic rings but at the expense of decreasing proton sensitivity. Also significant is the no-additive effects of His in positions 72 and 288, suggesting that these two residues may interact functionally. Functional Interaction of Histidine Residues in Positions 72 and 288—Functional interaction between two residues can be measured by quantitatively comparing the properties of the two singly substituted proteins with that of the protein containing both mutations. If the sum of the effects of two single substitutions equals the change seen in the double mutant, then the residues at these two positions do not interact. If the effects are not additive, the two amino acids must interact either directly or indirectly (10Hurle M.R. Tweedy N.B. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6356-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Perry K.M. Onuffer J.J. Gittelman M.S. Barmat L. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7961-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Double-mutant cycle analysis is a formal way of quantifying the independence of two mutations in their effects on the function of a protein (12Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The square in Fig. 3 describes the double mutant cycle relating wild type, single mutants (Y72H or W288H), and double mutant (Y72H/W288H) channels. Each arrow number represents the factor by which proton affinity changes along the direction of the arrow. For instance, X1 equals EC50WT/EC50Y72H. The affinity change in going from WT to double mutant must be the same regardless of the pathway; hence, X1Y1 = X2Y2. Following the same approach previously used to examine the interaction of a scorpion toxin with the Shaker potassium channel (13Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), we define the coupling coefficient, Ω, as Ω = X1X2 = Y2Y1 = EC50WT × EC50Y72H/W288HEC50Y72H × EC50W288H(Eq. 1) If the two mutated residues are independent of one another, then Ω will be unity. If the resides interact and the mutations alter their interaction, then Ω will deviate from unity. The concentrations of protons to achieve half-maximal activation, expressed in mol, were 2.19 × 10-7 for WT, 3.72 × 10-6 for Y72H, 2.06 × 10-6 for W288H, and 3.72 × 10-6 for the double mutant Y72H/W288H. Introducing these numbers in the above equation gives a value for Ω of 0.1, significantly different from unity. We could not apply double-mutant cycle analysis to the pair of mutations Y72R and W288R because the latter did not respond to pH as low as 4.0, suggesting that the mutation markedly decreased proton sensitivity of ASIC1-W288R, shifting the pH50 into a more acidic range. Proline 287 in the Loop Containing Trp-288 Is Essential for ASIC1 Function—The tip of subdomain F forms a sharp loop that directs Trp-288 downward and toward Tyr-72. Most residues in this loop are conserved in all ASIC, specifically Leu-284, Pro-285, and Pro-287 (indicated in red, Fig. 1b). The functional effect of mutations of each of these conserved residues is shown in Table 1. Substitution of Leu-284 by alanine was functional, but proline in the same position abolished current. Substitutions of Pro-287 by Ala or Gln also abolished proton-activated currents despite good levels of expression at the cell surface (Fig. 2D). The high sensitivity to mutagenesis of this loop is unexpected given that the side chains of these residues, with the exception of Trp-288, are not engaged in interactions with other amino acids but are mostly surrounded by water. This observation rather suggests that the importance of the proline rests on correctly positioning the aromatic 288 in order to interact with the one in position 72. This occurs by the unique property of proline to bend the backbone of the protein, thereby changing the curvature of the loop or by cis-trans isomerization (14Lummis S.C.R. Beene D.L. Lee L.W. Lester H.A. Broadhurst R.W. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In either case the orientation of the aromatic ring in position 288 would be altered by the absence of proline in 287. The Linker Tethering Subdomain F to the Body of the Extracellular Domain Decreases Proton-activated Currents and Slows Activation of ASIC1—Residue Pro-365 is conserved in all the ASIC channels. It is located in the short linker connecting subdomain F to the rest of the extracellular domain (Fig. 1a); thereby it is poised to sense conformational changes that may displace subdomain F during the gating process. ASIC1 channels bearing the mutation P365A were functional but exhibited marked changes in properties; peak currents elicited by protons were small (wild type 12 ± 5 versus 1.5 ± 0.4 μA/oocyte), and kinetics of activation were slow (wild type 20 ± 5.4 versus 2.75 ± 1.2 s-1) as well as the desensitization rate (wild type 0.50 ± 0.05 versus 0.18 ± 0.08 s-1). Last, the rate of recovery from desensitization was slower than in wild type channels (Fig. 2C); indeed, recovery from desensitization was never complete but declined progressively until the currents disappeared even after increasing the interval between stimuli for a period as long as 5 min (Fig. 2F). These changes in kinetics are consistent with subdomain F being part of the transduction mechanism that translates binding of protons to opening and closure of the pore. Negatively Charged Residues in the Putative Proton Sensor Change the pH50 and Desensitization Rate of ASIC1—The residues Glu-346 and Asp-350 in subdomain F directly face Asp-238 and Glu-239 in subdomain E and together with Arg-191 in subdomain D form a cluster of charges at the surface of each subunit that was originally proposed to constitute the proton sensor (Fig. 1a). Substitutions of Glu-346 and Asp-350 by Ala maintained functional channels, but the rates of desensitization became faster (wild type 0.48 ± 0.08 s-1 versus D350A 2.3 ± 0.07 s-1), and the apparent affinity for protons decreased (wild type pH50 6.8 ± 0.5 versus D350A pH50 5.5 ± 0.6) (Fig. 4, A and B). Removal of the remaining charged residues, Asp-238, Glu-239, and Arg-191, further shifted the apparent pH50 of activation toward more acidic pH, but mutant channels still retained the property of being activated by protons. Together these results indicate that protonation of residues in the intrasubunit interface of subdomains F and D affects the conformational changes of activation and, therefore, contributes to the apparent affinity for protons. Although each of these residues plays a role in defining the functional properties of wild type ASIC1, none singly nor all five together are sufficient to confer proton sensitivity to the channel (8Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 15Paukert M. Chen X. Polleichtner G. Schindelin H. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 572-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); other residues must participate in making the “proton sensor.” This study shows that residues Tyr-72 and Trp-288 are essential for proton gating of the ASICs. As any combination of aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe, or His) when present in these two positions was able to keep ASIC responsive to protons, it is reasonable to conclude that the aromatic side chains in positions 72 and 288 interact and that the interaction is essential to preserve functional channels. All other mutants carrying nonaromatic residues, with the exception of Arg in position 72, did not open with a pH as low as 4.0, consistent with the notion that an aromatic-aromatic interaction, also termed π-π interaction, provides the lowest energy barrier between two functional states. Further evidence comes from double cycle mutant analysis conducted with channels having His in positions 72 and 288. These channels were functional but had reduced apparent affinity for protons. Of significance, the effect of the mutations on the apparent pH50 was not additive, consistent with functional interaction between residues 72 and 288. The finding that His mutants exhibited lower affinity for protons indicates that the π-π interaction comprising imidazole rings is not as favorable as when it occurs between Tyr-, Phe, or Trp. We, therefore, interpret the absence of current when other residues occupy positions 72 or 288 to be the result of a shift in the apparent pH50 toward a very acidic range (lower than pH 4.0) because of a high energy barrier between states. Such a shift prevented reaching enough low pH to open the mutant channels without damaging the oocytes. This interpretation is favored over disruption of channel structure or misfolding induced by the mutations because of robust surface expression of mutant channels, functional channels carrying arginine (Y72R) despite marked differences in properties between the side chain of arginine and aromatic amino acids, and because the corresponding mutations in ENaC, a channel structurally related to ASIC but not gated by protons, retained function. Aromatic-aromatic interactions contribute to maintaining tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins by stabilizing contacts between subdomains and between proteins within a complex. Aromatic-aromatic interactions are characterized by a competition between the stacked and the T-shaped geometries, the latter being more frequent in proteins (16Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). In the T-shape structure the planes of the ring are perpendicular to each other, and in the intermediate stacked, “edge-displaced,” the ring planes are parallel-displaced. This competition is strongly affected by polarity of the environment and the ability of the surrounding solvent to form hydrogen bonds. In the crystal structure of cASIC1, Tyr-72 and Trp-288 adopt a T-shape structure; whether this geometry changes in the open, closed, and desensitized states is not known, although the binding energy differences for Tyr/Trp pair would be in the order of 1 kcal/mol going from T-shaped to intermediate stacked and 1.6 kcal/mol to the staked geometry according to previous calculations (17Gervasio F.L. Chelli R. Procacci P. Schettino V. Proteins. 2002; 48: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These values are in the range of energy change between the open and close conformations of ASIC1. The observation that pH solutions in the range of 6.0 to 4.0 open the mutant Y72R, but not Y72K or W288R, indicates that Arg in position 72 can functionally replace one of the aromatic rings in the pair. An explanation for such an unexpected finding is that the positively charged side chain of Arg can interact with the aromatic ring in 288, replacing the π-π interaction for a cation-π interaction (18Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). In the cation-π interaction, side chains of aromatic amino acids provide a surface of negative electrostatic potential that can bind to cations through a predominantly electrostatic interaction. This is possible only when arginine is in position 72 because here the arginine side chain would point to the aromatic ring, whereas arginine in position 288 would point its side chain away from Tyr-72 (Fig. 5). The preference of arginine over lysine can be explained by the fact that the face of the guanidinium ion of arginine is to some extent hydrophobic, thereby preferred by the innately hydrophobic aromatic (19Dougherty D.A. J. Nutr. 2007; 137: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the importance of correct positioning of the aromatic rings in the Tyr-72/Trp-28 pair was provided by mutations in the loop holding Trp-288. This loop exhibits a tight bend in the crystal structure because of the presence of several conserved prolines that when mutated also abolish current, suggesting that the curvature of the loop or cis-trans isomerization of the prolines (14Lummis S.C.R. Beene D.L. Lee L.W. Lester H.A. Broadhurst R.W. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) positions the aromatic ring of amino acid 288 to allow interaction with the aromatic at position 72. The prediction that Trp-288 may move together with subdomain F during the gating process was supported indirectly by changes in apparent pH50 and kinetics induced by point mutations in sites of contact of subdomain F with the rest of the ECD; i.e. the interface of subdomains F and E; the first through carbonyl-carboxylate interactions of residues Asp-346 with Asp-238 and Asp-350 with Glu-239 and the second through Pro-365, in a hinge-like structure connecting subdomain F to the rest of the ECD. Furthermore, our findings are in agreement with the recently published molecular dynamic analysis of cASIC1 (20Shaikh S.A. Tajkhorshid E. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5153-5164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A simulation in which Ca2+ ions bound to the proton sensor were displaced by protons unveil conformational changes in subdomain F (thumb domain) that were largest in the loop containing Trp-288. Our results are somewhat reminiscent of the Cys-loop ligand-activated receptors, where the importance of the interface of the extracellular with the transmembrane domain in communicating conformational changes initiated in the ligand binding site to the gate of the pore has been demonstrated (21Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We conclude that an aromatic interaction between Tyr-72 and Trp-288 is required for conferring proton sensitivity to the ASICs, most likely by stabilizing a conformation that promotes channel opening. Residues in the putative proton sensor and in the tethers that connect subdomain F to the rest of the body of the extracellular domain contribute to move subdomain F; thereby the aromatic ring of Trp-288 is placed in a position that allows it to interact with Tyr-72. Together these findings provide experimental support for the proposal that subdomain F is involved in ASIC1 gating."
https://openalex.org/W2033032294,"Unapposed connexin hemichannels exhibit robust closure in response to membrane hyperpolarization and extracellular calcium. This form of gating, termed ""loop gating,"" is largely responsible for regulating hemichannel opening, thereby preventing cell damage through excessive flux of ions and metabolites. The molecular components and structural rearrangements underlying loop gating remain unknown. Here, using cysteine mutagenesis in Cx50, we demonstrate that residues at the TM1/E1 border undergo movement during loop gating. Replacement of Phe(43) in Cx50 with a cysteine resulted in small or no appreciable membrane currents. Bath application of dithiothreitol or TPEN (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine), reagents that exhibit strong transition metal chelating activity, led to robust currents indicating that the F43C substitution impaired hemichannel function, producing ""lock-up"" in a closed or poorly functional state due to formation of metal bridges. In support, Cd(2+) at submicromolar concentrations (50-100 nm) enhanced lock-up of F43C hemichannels. Moreover, lock-up occurred under conditions that favored closure, indicating that the sulfhydryl groups come close enough to each other or to other residues to coordinate metal ions with high affinity. In addition to F43C, metal binding was also found for G46C, and to a lesser extent, D51C substitutions, positions found to be pore-lining in the open state using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method, but not for A40C and A41C substitutions, which were not found to reside in the open pore. These results indicate that metal ions access the cysteine side chains through the open pore and that closure of the loop gate involves movement of the TM1/E1 region that results in local narrowing of the large aqueous connexin pore."

To evaluate polyamine depletion as an anti-malarial strategy, cytostasis caused by the co-inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase/ornithine decarboxylase in Plasmodium falciparum was studied with a comprehensive transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome investigation. Highly synchronized cultures were sampled just before and during cytostasis, and a novel zero time point definition was used to enable interpretation of results in lieu of the developmentally regulated control of gene expression in P. falciparum. Transcriptome analysis revealed the occurrence of a generalized transcriptional arrest just prior to the growth arrest due to polyamine depletion. However, the abundance of 538 transcripts was differentially affected and included three perturbation-specific compensatory transcriptional responses as follows: the increased abundance of the transcripts for lysine decarboxylase and ornithine aminotransferase and the decreased abundance of that for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Moreover, the latter two compensatory mechanisms were confirmed on both protein and metabolite levels confirming their biological relevance. In contrast with previous reports, the results provide evidence that P. falciparum responds to alleviate the detrimental effects of polyamine depletion via regulation of its transcriptome and subsequently the proteome and metabolome.

Polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are small organic compounds containing two or more amino groups. At physiological pH, these polycations interact electrostatically with numerous anionic macromolecules, thereby stabilizing DNA, RNA, nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP), phospholipids, and proteins (1Wallace H. Fraser A. Huges A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 2Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These interactions with polyamines can alter DNA conformation, regulate replication and transcription, strengthen membranes, regulate ion channels, and protect DNA and phospholipids from oxidative stress (1Wallace H. Fraser A. Huges A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 2Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yet polyamines are also implicated in apoptosis (5Seiler N. Raul F. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 623-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Polyamine depletion generally causes cytostasis or growth arrest, which implies that these molecules are involved in cell cycle progression and regulation, and it is speculated that polyamines regulate cyclin degradation (1Wallace H. Fraser A. Huges A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 6Heby O. Differentiation. 1981; 19: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 7Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Therefore, polyamines are essential for cellular growth, differentiation, and macromolecular synthesis and are ubiquitous components of all living cells, except two orders of Archaea (1Wallace H. Fraser A. Huges A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Polyamine metabolism is particularly important in rapidly proliferating cells and has been exploited in the treatment of cancer (1Wallace H. Fraser A. Huges A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and parasitic diseases (8Shapiro T. Goldberg D. Brunton L. Lazo J. Parker K. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 11th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2006: 1053-1055Google Scholar). Polyamine metabolism of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is also a potential target for therapeutic intervention (9Yeh I. Altman R. Mini Rev. Med.

Parasitol. 2008; 160: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Polyamine and methionine metabolism are closely connected. This is particularly evident in Plasmodium where the two rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 2The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; IDC, intraerythrocytic developmental cycle; DFMO, dl-α-difluoromethylornithine; T, drug treated; UT, untreated; hpi, hours post-invasion; LIMMA, linear models for microarray data; dcAdoMet, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; LDC, lysine decarboxylase; OAT, ornithine aminotransferase; AdoMet synthetase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; Pdx1, PLP synthase; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; LDC, lysine decarboxylase; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-feight. 2The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; IDC, intraerythrocytic developmental cycle; DFMO, dl-α-difluoromethylornithine; T, drug treated; UT, untreated; hpi, hours post-invasion; LIMMA, linear models for microarray data; dcAdoMet, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; LDC, lysine decarboxylase; OAT, ornithine aminotransferase; AdoMet synthetase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; Pdx1, PLP synthase; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; LDC, lysine decarboxylase; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-feight. and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), form a single bifunctional protein (PfAdoMetDC/ODC, PF10_0322 (11Müller S.

ODC inhibition decreases putrescine levels in P. falciparum, whereas AdoMetDC inhibition decreases the levels of both spermidine and spermine (12Wright P. Byers T. Cross-Doersen D. McCann P. Bitonti A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Das Gupta R. Krause-Ihle T. Bergmann B. Müller I. Khomutov A. Müller S. Walter R. Lüersen K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The unique bifunctional nature of this complex could lead to the selective treatment of malaria. Inhibition of either ODC or AdoMetDC of P. falciparum in vitro causes cytostatic arrest in the trophozoite stage of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but it does not cure Plasmodium berghei-infected mice in vivo (12Wright P. Byers T. Cross-Doersen D. McCann P. Bitonti A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Assaraf Y. Golenser J. Spira D. Messer G. Bachrach U. Parasitol.

This is possibly because of exogenous polyamine salvage from the host (16Reguera R. Tekwani B. Balaña-Fouce R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2005; 140: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, when ODC, AdoMetDC, and exogenous polyamine import are inhibited by the combination of bis(benzyl)polyamine analogues and dl-α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), 100% of P. berghei-infected mice were cured (17Bitonti A.

A polyamine transporter has not yet been identified in the P. falciparum genome, but a drug combination selectively inhibiting both polyamine biosynthesis and transport may provide a promising anti-malarial strategy (16Reguera R. Tekwani B. Balaña-Fouce R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2005; 140: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Transcriptional profiling can be used to assess the response of cells or organisms to environmental stress and to identify feedback mechanisms, alternative pathways, and metabolic buffering systems activated to cope with a perturbation (18Boshoff H. Manjunatha U. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Birkholtz L.-M. van Brummelen A. Clark K. Niemand J. Maréchal E. Llinas M. Louw A. Acta Trop. 2007; 105: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This approach was applied with great success in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealing transcriptional signatures specific to the mode-of-action for several antimycobacterial drugs (20Boshoff H. Myers T. Copp B. McNeil M. Wilson M. Clifton B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40174-40184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, the correlation of perturbation-specific events in the transcriptome of the malaria parasite has been limited to a few studies (21Gunasekera A. Patankar S. Schug J. Eisen G. Wirth D. Mol.

Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 537-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cautious experimental design enabled transcriptional profiling and revealed very prominent polyamine metabolism-specific compensatory responses induced in the parasite to circumvent the perturbation. Convincingly, these were subsequently confirmed by proteomic and metabolomic analyses. This study therefore indicates that perturbation-specific events can be observed in the P. falciparum transcriptome and clearly links this to regulation in the parasite proteome and metabolome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasite Cultures—Parasite culturing and sampling for the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics occurred independently, but perturbation conditions were replicated in terms of the parasite population, treatment, and sampling times. 3D7 P. falciparum parasites were cultured and synchronized (for three generations) according to established methods (31Trager W. Jensen J. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6078) Google Scholar, 32Lambros C. Vanderberg J. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2793) Google Scholar). Parasites were treated in the late schizont stage (42 h post-invasion (hpi)) with 5 mm DFMO (IC50 = 1 mm) and 5 μm 5′-{[(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino}-5′-deoxyadenosine (MDL73811, IC50 = 1 μm) to ensure complete parasite arrest to prevent parasites escaping cytostasis and causing asynchrony (14Assaraf Y. Golenser J. Spira D. Messer G. Bachrach U. Parasitol. Res. 1987; 73: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At these dosages the combined drug effect was additive and cytostatic (12Wright P. Byers T. Cross-Doersen D. McCann P. Bitonti A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Assaraf Y. Golenser J. Spira D. Messer G. Bachrach U. Parasitol. Res. 1987; 73: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but complete enzyme inhibition was confirmed with radiolabeled substrate assays (see below). DFMO was kindly provided by P. Woster (Wayne State University, MI) and MDL73811 by Sanofi-Aventis. A preceding small scale morphological study was performed to determine the exact sampling times, just before and during growth arrest. For the actual experiments treatment was performed in duplicate (i.e. two biological replicates, A and B) alongside untreated controls. Drug treated (T) and untreated (UT) cultures, at about 8-10% parasitemia and 2-3% hematocrit, were harvested at three time points within the trophozoite stage (t1 = 19 hpi, t2 = 27 hpi, and t3 = 34 hpi), based on the morphology of untreated parasites after microscopic inspection of Giemsa-stained thin smears. Culture medium (with and without drug) was replaced halfway through the time course but before the first sampling, to prevent metabolic stress of the parasites.Radiolabeled Substrate Decarboxylase Assays—To ensure complete enzyme inhibition and presumably arrest of the cultures at the specified dosages, AdoMetDC and ODC activity of DFMO/MDL73811-treated and untreated cultures sampled at t1 = 19 hpi and t3 = 34 hpi were assessed as described (33Assaraf Y. Golenser J. Spira D. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with uninfected erythrocytes as negative controls.RNA Isolation and Microarray—Total RNA was isolated from frozen phosphate-buffered saline-washed pellets from 15-ml culture samples (two biological replicates) with the Qiagen RNeasy kit, using a modified protocol including TRI Reagent® (Sigma) in the lysis step. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with DNase I (Qiagen). A reference RNA pool was prepared from all three treated and untreated time points, including both sets of biological replicates. First strand cDNA synthesis was initiated from 12 μg of total RNA with 775 pmol of random primer 9 (New England Biolabs) and 250 pmol of oligo(dT)25 by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min followed by cooling on ice for 10 min. Reverse transcription and amino-allyl incorporation were performed at 42 °C as described (34Bozdech Z. Zhu J. Joachimiak M. Cohen F. Pulliam B. DeRisi J. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the reaction was performed overnight using 480 units of SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Contaminating RNA was removed by hydrolysis with 0.5 m EDTA and 1 m NaOH at 65 °C for 15 min, and the reactions were purified with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega). The cDNA obtained was divided into aliquots of 2 μg each, and where possible two technical array replicates were performed. The 2 μg of cDNA was coupled to either Cy3 (reference pool) or Cy5 (samples) at pH 9.0 (Amersham Biosciences). Free dye was removed with DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 columns (Zymo Research). DeRisi style 70-mer oligonucleotide arrays (34Bozdech Z. Zhu J. Joachimiak M. Cohen F. Pulliam B. DeRisi J. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were spotted in-house at the Lewis-Sigler Institute Microarray Facility (Princeton University). Post-processing, overnight hybridization at 65 °C, and washing were performed as described (34Bozdech Z. Zhu J. Joachimiak M. Cohen F. Pulliam B. DeRisi J. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty arrays were scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000A scanner, and the images were analyzed with GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments).Microarray Data Analysis—The GenePix default flagging parameters were applied in combination with visual inspection to assess spot quality, and flagged values received a zero weight. Array data were stored in the Princeton University Microarray data base and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (35Edgar R. Domrachev M. Lash A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8224) Google Scholar), accession number GSE13578. Exploratory data analysis was performed using CLUSTER and TREEVIEW software (36Eisen M. Spellman P. Brown P. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13138) Google Scholar). Data were normalized, log transformed, and mean centered in Princeton University Microarray data base and ordered according to the phase of expression (37Bozdech Z. Llinás M. Pulliam B. Wong E. Zhu J. DeRisi J. PLoS Biology. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 38Llinás M. Bozdech Z. Wong E. Adai A. DeRisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated in Excel. For differential abundance analysis, data quality and normalization methods were evaluated using data diagnostic tools from the MARRAY software package (39Yang Y. Paquet A. Gentleman R. Carey V. Huber W. Irizarry R. Dudoit S. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor. 1st Ed. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2005: 49-69Crossref Google Scholar) in R on GenePix data. Background subtraction (offset = 50) and robust spline normalization were applied within each array, followed by Gquantile normalization between arrays because of the reference array design of the experiment. Differential abundance analysis was performed with linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) analysis within R (40Smyth G. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9066) Google Scholar, 41Smyth G. Gentleman R. Carey V. Dudoit S. Irizarry R. Huber W. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2005: 397-420Crossref Google Scholar). With a common reference design LIMMA is similar to ordinary analysis of variance or multiple regression except that a linear model is fitted to the data for every oligonucleotide. Significance was calculated with moderated t statistics using a simple Bayesian model to make the analyses robust even for a small number of arrays (41Smyth G. Gentleman R. Carey V. Dudoit S.

Differential abundance was calculated compared with UTt1, defined as relative time 0 (t0). Genes in at least one treated time point with transcript abundance greater than 1.7-fold (log2 ratio ≥0.75 or ≤ -0.75) in either direction compared with relative t0, and p values (adjusted for multiple comparison false discovery rate) of less than 0.05, were regarded as differentially affected. Data within these limits of transcripts represented by multiple oligonucleotides were averaged. The differentially affected transcripts were classified into functional groups using gene ontology terms obtained from DAVID (42Dennis G.J. Sherman B. Hosack D. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H. Lempicki R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PlasmoDB 5.3 (43Stoeckert C. Fischer S. Kissinger J. Heiges M. Aurrecoechea C. Gajria B. Roos D. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcript data were compared with the PlasmoDB 5.3 general feature format file to search for clusters of adjacently located genes with differentially affected transcripts, where a cluster was regarded as q4 or more genes within a window of six adjacent genes.Microarray Validation with Real Time PCR—The differential abundance analysis was validated using a LightCycler 1.5 and FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Six transcripts of interest were amplified, three transcripts with increased (PFL1885c, PFD0285c, and PFF0435w) and three with decreased (PF08_0131, PFD0830w, and PFI1090w) abundance. Starting levels across different samples were equalized relative to a putative cyclophilin (PFE0505w), which remained unchanged in the array data as well as in the IDC transcriptome (38Llinás M. Bozdech Z. Wong E. Adai A. DeRisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Protein Extraction and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Separation—Parasites for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were released with 0.05% saponin from 60-ml culture samples (two biological replicates) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline to reduce contamination with erythrocyte proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described (44Nirmalan N. Sims P. Hyde J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Two biological replicate extracts were combined to obtain enough protein for three to four replicate gels. The protein concentration was determined with a two-dimensional Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences), and 400 μg of total protein was applied to 18-cm Immobilon DryStrip gels (pH 3-10, GE Healthcare). The first dimension separation was performed with a Ettan IPGphor II isoelectric focusing system with active rehydration at 30 V for 10 h followed by a gradual step-and-hold increase to 8000 V for a total of 24,000 V h. The run was terminated after 35,000 V h. The second dimension separation was performed on 10% vertical SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a Hoefer SE 600 vertical system at 80 mA and 20 °C. The gels were fixed with 40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid overnight and stained with in Flamingo fluorescent stain (Bio-Rad). Twenty one gels were scanned with a Pharos FX Plus molecular imager at high and medium intensity (photomultiplier tube voltage), and the best three of four were selected for spot matching and differential spot analysis.Proteomics Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed with PDQuest 8.0 Advanced software (Bio-Rad). Roller-ball background subtraction, loess normalization, and automated spot detection and matching were performed. The automated spot matching was carefully checked by visual inspection and comparison for maximum consensus within each replicate group. A master image was generated, including all replicate groups to be compared. Differential protein abundance was calculated in comparison with UTt1 (relative t0). Proteins in at least one treated time point with an abundance greater than 2-fold in either direction compared with relative t0, and p values of less than 0.05 (Student's t test), were regarded as differentially affected. Correlation coefficients (R) of the regression line between replicate groups were calculated in PDQuest.Spot Excision and MALDI-MS/MS—Spots of interest were excised, purified, trypsin-digested and prepared for MALDI-MS/MS as described (44Nirmalan N. Sims P. Hyde J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), followed by peptide analysis with a QStar Elite instrument (Applied Biosystems) with a MALDI source. The instrument was calibrated with a commercially available peptide calibration standard ranging from ∼1000 to 3200 Da (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide mass finger prints and MS/MS fragments were compared with a nonredundant protein data base (Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL) using MASCOT with oxidation (methionine) and carbamidomethylation set as protein modifications, only one missed trypsin cleavage accepted and a mass tolerance of 50 ppm. The probability-based MOWSE score was used to estimate the significance of the identification with p < 0.05.Metabolite Extraction and LC-MS/MS—From 20-ml culture samples (two biological replicates), 10 ml was used for general metabolite analysis, and 10 ml was derivatized for polyamine analysis. Cultures were pelleted and serially extracted immediately thereafter, first with 4 volumes of 100% methanol at -75 °C for 15 min and then twice more with 1 volume 80:20 methanol/water at 4 °C. For the second and third extractions, the cell/methanol mixture was sonicated for 15 min on ice in a water bath sonicator. The supernatants from each extraction were pooled and centrifuged free of cell debris and protein. All samples were analyzed within 24 h of their generation and were analyzed for 167 metabolites as described (45Bajad S. Kimball E. Yuan J. Peterson C. Rabinowitz J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1125: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 46Lu W. Kimball E. Rabinowitz J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as well as putrescine, spermidine, spermine, cadaverine, and decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet). The dcAdoMet standard used for calibration was a kind gift by K. Samejima (Josai University, Japan).For polyamine analysis, 10 μl of triethylamine was added to 100 μl of cell extract and mixed. A few crystals of solid succinic anhydride were then added, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, with vortexing every 10 min. After this incubation the samples were centrifuged to pellet any remaining solid succinic anhydride, and the liquid portion of the sample was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using parameters previously determined with pure stock solutions of putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, and spermine.LC-MS/MS was performed using an LC-10A high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) and a Luna aminopropyl column (250 × 2 mm with a 5-μm particle size) from Phenomenex coupled to the mass spectrometer. The LC parameters were as follows: autosampler temperature, 4 °C; injection volume, 20 μl; column temperature, 15 °C; and flow rate, 150 μl/min. The LC solvents were solvent A (20 mm ammonium acetate + 20 mm ammonium hydroxide in 95:5 water/acetonitrile, pH 9.45) and solvent B, acetonitrile. The gradients are as follows: positive mode, t = 0, 85% B; t = 15 min, 0% B; t = 28 min, 0% B; t = 30 min, 85% B; t = 40 min, 85% B; and negative mode, t = 0, 85% B; t = 15 min, 0% B; t = 38 min, 0% B; t = 40 min, 85% B; t = 50 min, 85% B.Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp.), equipped with an ESI source. ESI spray voltage was 3200 V in positive mode and 3000 V in negative mode. Nitrogen was used as sheath gas at 30 p.s.i. and as the auxiliary gas at 10 p.s.i., and argon as the collision gas at 1.5 millitorr, with the capillary temperature 325 °C. Scan time for each single reaction monitoring event transition was 0.1 s with a scan width of 1 m/z. The LC runs were divided into time segments, with the single reaction monitoring scans within each time segment limited to those compounds eluting during that time interval. For compounds eluting at the boundaries between time segments, the single reaction monitoring scan corresponding to the compound is conducted in both time segments. The instrument control, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed by the Xcalibur software (Thermo Electron Corp., version 1.4 SR1), which also controlled the chromatography system.Metabolomics Data Analysis—Raw data peak quantitation was performed by Xcalibur software with 103 as the quantitation limit. Biological replicate data were averaged, background subtracted, and normalized"

They are synthesized by the condensation of two fatty acids, a C56-64-meromycolyl chain and a C24-26-fatty acyl chain. Meromycolates are produced via the combination of type I and type II fatty acid synthases (FAS-I and FAS-II). The β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (mtFabH) links FAS-I and FAS-II, catalyzing the condensation of FAS-I-derived acyl-CoAs with malonyl-ACP. Because mtFabH represents a potential regulatory key point of the mycolic acid pathway, we investigated the hypothesis that phosphorylation of mtFabH controls its activity. Phosphorylation of proteins by Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs) has recently emerged as a major physiological mechanism of regulation in prokaryotes. We demonstrate here that mtFabH was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by several mycobacterial STPKs, particularly by PknF and PknA, as well as in vivo in mycobacteria. Analysis of the phosphoamino acid content indicated that mtFabH was phosphorylated exclusively on threonine residues. Mass spectrometry analyses using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry identified Thr45 as the unique phosphoacceptor. This was further supported by complete loss of PknF- or PknA-dependent phosphorylation of a mtFabH mutant. Mapping Thr45 on the crystal structure of mtFabH illustrates that this residue is located at the entrance of the substrate channel, suggesting that the phosphate group may alter accessibility of the substrate and thus affect mtFabH enzymatic activity. A T45D mutant of mtFabH, designed to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, exhibited markedly decreased transacylation, malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation, and condensing activities compared with the wild-type protein or the T45A mutant. Together, these findings not only represent the first demonstration of phosphorylation of a β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III enzyme but also indicate that phosphorylation of mtFabH inhibits its enzymatic activity, which may have important consequences in regulating mycolic acid biosynthesis.

Within the infected host, Mycobacterium tuberculosis encounters numerous environmental conditions and induces or represses a number of genes for a quick adjustment to new conditions. The infection process of M. tuberculosis involves cross-talk of signals between the host and the bacterium, resulting in reprogramming of the host signaling network. Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation represent a central mechanism for distribution of signals to various parts of the cell, regulating growth, differentiation, mobility, and survival (1Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mycobacteria, a common signal transduction pathway is transmitted through membrane-embedded sensor kinases, enabling the pathogen to modify itself for survival in this hostile environment. Protein kinases can be classified into two families based on their similarities and enzymatic specification: (i) the histidine kinase superfamily, which relies on autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue and commonly occurs as part of two-component systems and (ii) the superfamily of serine, threonine, and tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, respectively (1Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T.

Although the two-component systems represent the classical prokaryotic mechanism for detection and response to environmental changes, the serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases and phosphatases are also widespread in prokaryotes. The M. tuberculosis genome contains 11 Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs) 6The abbreviations used are: STPK, Ser/Thr protein kinase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; FAS-I, eukaryotic type I fatty acid synthase; FAS-II, prokaryotic type II fatty acid synthase; PDIM, phthiocerol dimycocerosate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; KAS, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase; MS, mass spectrometry; mtFabH, M. tuberculosis β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.

This significant number of STPKs suggests that phosphorylation may influence a wide range of biological functions, such as adaptation to various environmental conditions, stress, cell wall synthesis, cell division, and pathogenicity (7Cowley S.

The cell wall of M. tuberculosis plays a critical role in the defense of this pathogen in the host, since environmental stimuli induce changes in cell wall composition and thus help M. tuberculosis to adapt during infection (15Glickman M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 477-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent studies support the view that regulation of cell wall synthesis involves Ser/Thr kinases. For instance, PknH phosphorylates the FHA-containing protein EmbR, a putative transcriptional regulator of the EmbCAB arabinosyl transferases (17Molle V. Kremer L. Girard-Blanc C. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Prost J.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15300-15309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Activation of EmbR upon phosphorylation by PknH induces transcription of the embCAB operon, leading to a higher lipoarabinomannan/lipomannan ratio (18Sharma K. Gupta M. Pathak M. Gupta N. Koul A. Sarangi S. Baweja R. Singh Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2936-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and regulates the synthesis of arabinan, an important component of arabinogalactan, essential for the structural integrity of the cell wall. Also, lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan are major cell wall-associated lipoglycans and important modulators of the immune system (19Briken V. Porcelli S.A. Besra G.S. Kremer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study has shown that PknH was able to phosphorylate other substrates, such as DacB1 (20Zheng X. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Av-Gay Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, DacB1 is a sporulation-specific protein involved in cell envelope biosynthesis. Based on homology with the B. subtilis orthologue, it has been postulated that PknH-dependent phosphorylation of M. tuberculosis DacB1 regulates the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a key component of the mycobacterial cell envelope (20Zheng X. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Av-Gay Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, MmpL7, a member of the RND (resistance, nodulation, and cell division) family of transporters that is thought to be involved in the transport of phthiocerol dimycocerosate and known to be essential for virulence (21Camacho L.R. Constant P. Raynaud C. Laneelle M.A. Triccas J.A. Gicquel B. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19845-19854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Cox J.S. Chen B. McNeil M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), has been shown to undergo phosphorylation. The last finding suggests that kinases could also play an important role in regulating the transport of cell wall components (23Perez J. Garcia R. Bach H. de Waard J.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Av-Gay Y. Bubis J. Takiff H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In view of the large repertoire of polyketides and complex lipids present in M. tuberculosis, STPKs could play an important role in regulating the metabolism of these molecules. There is now evidence to suggest that phosphorylation may also participate in the regulation of mycolic acids. The β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases KasA and KasB of the mycobacterial FAS-II system involved in fatty acid elongation represent STPKs substrates, and phosphorylation of KasA and KasB differentially modulates their condensing activity in vitro (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to address the question of whether mycolic acid synthesis in general might be influenced by STPK-dependent regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have identified mtFabH as a new substrate of the M. tuberculosis SPTKs and defined its phosphorylation state. This allowed us to address the role/contribution of phosphorylation in the enzyme activity. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-Strains used for cloning and expression of recombinant proteins were Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 25 μg/ml kanamycin when required. M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 strain was plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with OADC enrichment (Difco) and 25 μg/ml kanamycin when required or grown in Sauton’s medium containing 0.05% tyloxapol (Sigma). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of mtFabH and Mutant Proteins-The mtfabH gene was amplified by PCR using M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA as a template and the primers 5′-TAA TAG CTC ATA TGA CGG AGA TCG CCA CGA CCA GC-3′ and 5′-TAA TAG CTG CTA GCT CAA CCC TTC GGC ATT CGC AC-3′ containing an NdeI or NheI restriction site, respectively (underlined). This 1008-bp amplified product was then digested by NdeI and NheI and ligated into the pETTev plasmid, a variant of pET15b (Novagen) that includes the replacement of the thrombin site coding sequence with a tobacco etch virus protease site (25Cohen-Gonsaud M. Barthe P. Pommier F. Harris R. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. Roumestand C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 373-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), thus generating pETTev-mtfabH. Site-directed mutagenesis was directly performed on pETTev-mtfabH using inverse PCR amplification with the following self-complementary primers: 5′-CGT CCG ACG AGT GGA TCT ACG CCC GAA CCG GCA TCA AGA C-3′ and 5′-GTC TTG ATG CCG GTT CGG GCG TAG ATC CAC TCG TCG GAC G-3′ for mtFabH_T45A and 5′-CGT CCG ACG AGT GGA TCT ACGACC GAA CCG GCA TCA AGA C-3′ and 5′-GTC TTG ATG CCG GTT CGG TCG TAG ATC CAC TCG TCG GAC G-3′ for mtFabH_T45D (the corresponding substitutions are shown in boldface type). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant strains harboring the mtFabH-expressing constructs were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin, and resulting cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking until A600 reached 0.5. isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final) was added, and growth was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Purifications of mtFabH_WT, mtFabH_T45A, and mtFabH_T45D were performed as described earlier (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol.

Overexpression and Purification of mtFabH in M. bovis BCG-The M. tuberculosis H37Rv mtfabH gene was amplified using the following primers: pVV16-mtfabH-up (5′-GAT AGG ACG CAT ATG ACG GAG ATC-3′) and pVV16-mtfabH-lo (5′-AAG CTT ACC CTT CGG CAT TCG CAC CAC-3′) (containing an NdeI and HindIII site, respectively). The PCR product was cut with NdeI/HindIII, enabling direct cloning into the pVV16 expression vector cut with the same enzymes (26Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This plasmid harbors the hsp60 promoter as well as a His tag for expression of C-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins. The resulting vector, pVV16-mtfabH, was used to transform M. bovis BCG. Purification of soluble mtFabH-His6 was performed on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, as described previously (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol.

Cloning, expression, and purification of the eight recombinant GST-tagged STPKs from M. tuberculosis were described previously (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol.

Analysis of the Phosphoamino Acid Content of mtFabH-mtFabH samples phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of GST-tagged PknF (or PknA) and [γ-33P]ATP were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Analysis of the phosphoamino acid content was done as reported previously (17Molle V. Kremer L. Girard-Blanc C. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Prost J.F.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis-Purified mtFabH_WT and mtFabH_T45A proteins were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by GST-tagged PknF or PknA as described above, except that [γ-33P]ATP was replaced with 5 mm cold ATP. Subsequent mass spectrometry analyses were performed as previously described (27Fiuza M. Canova M.J. Zanella-Cleon I. Becchi M. Cozzone A.J. Mateos L.M. Kremer L. Gil J.A. Molle V. J. Biol.

Approximately 150 μg of total soluble proteins were loaded onto a 7-cm immobiline strip (Bio-Rad, pH 3.9-5.1) and electrophoresed in a Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) in the first dimension and on a 10% SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Proteins were then blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with a rabbit anti-mt-FabH antibody raised against recombinant mtFabH (1:250 dilution). The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000 dilution), and detection of the different mtFabH isoforms was carried out using the Western Lightening Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. mtFabH Condensation Assay-The condensing activity of mtFabH was assayed by mixing 50 μm holo-AcpM (mycobacterial acyl carrier protein), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 nCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol), 12.5 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 0.3 μg of mtFabD in a final volume of 40 μl. The mtFabD protein was added to generate the malonyl-AcpM substrate for the reaction in situ. A mixture of holo-AcpM containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure complete reduction of AcpM, prior to the addition of the remaining components (except mtFabH). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μg of mtFabH, held at 37 °C for 40 min, and quenched by adding 5 mg/ml NaBH4 in 100 mm K2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran. This resulted in the liberation of β-ketoacyl groups from their respective thioesters as acyl-1,3-diols, which were extracted with water-saturated toluene. The radiolabeled products were then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. mtFabH Transacylation Assay-Acyl transfer was assessed using [9,10-3H]myristoyl-CoA (specific activity 57.0 Ci/mmol) to follow the transacylation of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to the active site Cys122 of mtFabH. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), 250 pmol of [3H]myristoyl-CoA (14.6 nCi), and 4 μg of WT or mutant mtFabH (110 pmol) in a final volume of 60 μl. The reaction was held at room temperature for 15 min, and 200 μl of Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose fast flow chromatography medium (50% slurry in buffer A) was added. After a further 5 min, the slurry was diluted by adding 300 μl of buffer A, and unbound C14-CoA was then removed by filtration (cellulose nitrate, 0.45 μm). The beads were washed with 20 ml of buffer A before the filters were removed to vials for liquid scintillation counting. Malonyl-AcpM Decarboxylation Assay-The methods used by Brown et al. (28Brown A.K. Sridharan S. Kremer L. Lindenberg S. Dover L.G. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

Malonyl-AcpM was synthesized from malonyl-CoA and holo-AcpM in situ using mtFabD. The initial reaction mixture of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 12 μm AcpM, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a volume of 28 μl was held at 4 °C for 30 min. 160 nCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA and 0.3 μg of mtFabD were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of 5 μg of either mtFabH_WT or mutants. The reaction was quenched after 1.5 h at 37 °C by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C and 50 μl of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 20 min. The solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the protein pellets were washed with 900 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The pellet was dried to remove excess trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. 10 μl of 2 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) was added to form hydroxamate derivatives of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 5 μl of the resulting mixture was subjected to scintillation counting, and the remaining 45 μl was spotted on 10 × 20-cm Cellulose 300, F-254 glass-backed TLC plates (Fisher), where [14C]acetyl-hydroxamate and [14C]malonyl-hydroxamate were separated by butanol/acetic acid/water (8:2:3, v/v/v). Autoradiograms were obtained after exposing the plates for 7 days to Kodak X-Omat AR film. mtFabH Is a Substrate of Mycobacterial STPKs-The coupling of the acyl and malonyl groups to form β-ketoacyl derivatives is catalyzed by the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) components of the FAS-II system (30Kremer L.

The mtFabH enzyme has been reported to act as the pivotal link between FAS-I and FAS-II by initiating the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids used in mycolate biosynthesis (32Choi K.H.

Herein, we investigated whether mtFabH would also represent a substrate for mycobacterial kinases. STPKs of M. tuberculosis (PknA, PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknH, PknK, or PknL) were expressed as GST fusions and purified from E. coli as described previously (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S.

Recombinant mtFabH was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring the pETTev-mtfabH. The protein contained a N-terminal His tag, which was subsequently removed following cleavage with the tobacco etch virus protease. Interestingly, when the different STPKs were incubated in the presence of mtFabH and [γ-33P]ATP, phosphorylation of mtFabH was observed, although levels varied for different kinases. PknA and PknF were the most efficient kinases to phosphorylate mtFabH (Fig. 1A). PknD, PknE, and PknH, which display strong autophosphorylation activity in vitro, phosphorylated mtFabH to a lesser extent than PknA or PknF. PknB, PknK, and PknL did not phosphorylate mtFabH, which may be due, at least for PknK and PknL, to their very low autokinase activity. STPKs usually migrate as diffuse bands, reflecting the different levels of phosphorylation for each isoform, and this aberrant profile of migration of M. tuberculosis kinases has already been reported in earlier studies (17Molle V.

These results are consistent with the fact that KasA and KasB were also found to be efficiently phosphorylated by PknA and PknF (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, although PknB efficiently phosphorylates KasA and KasB, it failed to phosphorylate mtFabH in vitro (Fig. 1A). Together, these data suggest different levels of substrate specificity of the various STPKs. PknF Phosphorylates mtFabH in Vitro on Threonine Residues-To examine the nature of the mtFabH-phosphorylated residues, we analyzed the phosphoamino acid content of PknF-phosphorylated mtFabH. The mtFabH protein (3 μg) was labeled with [γ-33P]ATP in vitro, separated by SDS-PAGE, excised, and subjected to acid hydrolysis. mtFabH was exclusively phosphorylated on threonines (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when mtFabH was phosphorylated with PknA (data not shown). Understanding the potential regulatory role that phosphorylation of a given kinase substrate might play necessitates the identification of the specific sites undergoing phosphorylation. Although experimentally challenging, liquid chromatography/MS/MS mass spectrometry allowed us to decipher the different phosphorylation sites in a sequence-specific fashion. mtFabH Is Phosphorylated on a Unique Threonine Residue-To identify which of the 22 threonines of mtFabH correspond to the phosphorylated site(s), recombinant mtFabH was incubated with cold ATP in the presence of PknF and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis after tryptic digestion. ProteinPilot® data base searching software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems), using the Paragon method with phosphorylation emphasis, was used to detect and identify the phosphorylated peptides. The sequence coverage of the protein was 98%, and phosphorylation occurred only on peptide (26Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2102685605,"The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 is responsible for the initial upstroke of the action potential in cardiac tissue. Levels of intracellular calcium modulate inactivation gating of NaV1.5, in part through a C-terminal EF-hand calcium binding domain. The significance of this structure is underscored by the fact that mutations within this domain are associated with specific cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis for calcium regulation of channel function, we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal EF-hand domain using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. The structure confirms the existence of the four-helix bundle common to EF-hand domain proteins. However, the location of this domain is shifted with respect to that predicted on the basis of a consensus 12-residue EF-hand calcium binding loop in the sequence. This finding is consistent with the weak calcium affinity reported for the isolated EF-hand domain; high affinity binding is observed only in a construct with an additional 60 residues C-terminal to the EF-hand domain, including the IQ motif that is central to the calcium regulatory apparatus. The binding of an IQ motif peptide to the EF-hand domain was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The peptide binds between helices I and IV in the EF-hand domain, similar to the binding of target peptides to other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. These results suggest a molecular basis for the coupling of the intrinsic (EF-hand domain) and extrinsic (calmodulin) components of the calcium-sensing apparatus of NaV1.5."

Pulmonary surfactant consists of lipids and associated proteins that reduce surface tension at the air-liquid interface. Surfactant is required for adaptation to air breathing after birth. Lack of surfactant in preterm infants causes infantile respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome in older individuals. Likewise, mutations in genes regulating surfactant homeostasis, including SFTPB, SFTPC, and ABCA3, disrupt surfactant homeostasis causing fatal respiratory distress or chronic lung disease (1Whitsett J.A.

Although various lipids play a critical role in surfactant function, transcriptional mechanisms regulating surfactant homeostasis in the respiratory epithelium remain poorly understood. In other tissues, transcriptional mechanisms regulating lipid synthesis are known to be dependent on a number of transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; Ldlr, low density lipoprotein receptor; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; nSREBP, nuclear form of SREBP; ADFP, adipose differentiation related protein; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; Sftp, surfactant protein; Sat PC, saturated phosphatidylcholine; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ADFP, adipose differentiation-related protein; RT, reverse transcription; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; rtTA, reverse tetracycline transactivation; ATF, activating transcription factor. 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; Ldlr, low density lipoprotein receptor; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; nSREBP, nuclear form of SREBP; ADFP, adipose differentiation related protein; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; Sftp, surfactant protein; Sat PC, saturated phosphatidylcholine; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ADFP, adipose differentiation-related protein; RT, reverse transcription; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; rtTA, reverse tetracycline transactivation; ATF, activating transcription factor. isoforms, liver X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (3Eberle D.

C/EBP isoforms and SREBP-1c mRNAs are increased in the fetal rat lung during late gestation in association with increased expression of surfactant proteins (A, B, C, and D) (1Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. N. Engl. J. Med.. 2002; 347: 2141-2148Google Scholar). Induction of proteins regulating lipid synthesis and surfactant proteins occurs during perinatal lung maturation and is required for respiratory function at birth. Three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2, are synthesized as inactive precursors that are inserted into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they bind to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). In response to cholesterol depletion, SCAP transports the SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where the NH2-terminal domain of SREBP, the active form of the transcription factor, is released by proteolytic cleavage by two proteases, S2P and S2P, allowing the active SREBP to enter the nucleus where it binds and activates transcription of target genes. SREBPs regulate many aspects of lipid biosynthesis; SREBP-1a and, particularly, SREBP-1c are relatively selective for the regulation of fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 is a more potent activator of cholesterol synthesis (3Eberle D.

Although SREBP-1c regulates a number of genes that are known to influence surfactant homeostasis, lung pathology was not detected in adult Srebf-1 gene-targeted mice (13Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin.

To determine the role of the SREBP-regulating pathways in lung lipid homeostasis, we conditionally deleted the Scap gene in respiratory epithelial cells in the developing lung, thereby inactivating all three SREBP isoforms. In this study, we show that SCAP regulates both SREBPs and a number of genes controlling lipid homeostasis in the lung. Deletion of Scap altered lipid content and synthesis. Maintenance of surfactant function in Scap-deleted mice after birth was associated with compensatory lipid synthesis, accumulation, and transfer by lung lipofibroblasts.

Scapflox/flox littermates lacking either rtTA or Cre genes served as controls. Triple transgenic mice SP-C-rtTAtg/-, TetO-Cretg/-, Scapflox/flox are maintained on a mixed background issued from the FVB/N strain (SP-C-rtTAtg/-, TetO-Cretg/-) and the B6;129S6 background (Scapflox/flox). Genotypes were identified by PCR with genomic DNA from the tails of mice using the forward primer 5′-GCT CTG CGC ATC CTA TCC AAT TCC C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CAG CCG GCA AGT AAC AAG GGA TCC G-3′ for Scapflox/flox. Genotyping for SP-C-rtTA and (tetO)7CMV-Cre DNA was performed by PCR as described previously (16Perl A.K. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res.. 2002; 11: 21-29Google Scholar). Animal Husbandry and Doxycycline Administration—Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation. All animals were housed in humidity- and temperature-controlled rooms on a 12-12-h light-dark cycle. Mice were allowed food and water ad libitum. There was no serological evidence of pulmonary pathogens or bacterial infections in sentinel mice maintained within the colony. Gestation was dated by detection of the vaginal plug (as E0.5) and correlated with weight of each pup at the time of sacrifice. Dams bearing control and ScapΔ/Δ mice were maintained on doxycycline in food (625 mg/kg; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) from E6.5 to E12.5 to cause widespread deletion of Scap in progenitor cells that form the peripheral lung (18Perl A.K.

Tissue Preparation—Four- to eight-week-old mice were anesthetized by an injection of 0.25 ml of anesthetic (ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine) and then exsanguinated by severing the inferior vena cava. For fetal lung tissue analyses, dams were killed by exsanguination, and fetal lungs were dissected for analysis. Fetuses were removed from the uterine sac, weighed, and crown-to-rump lengths determined to assess developmental age (19Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development.

In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed using 35S-UTP-labeled riboprobe for Scap (a 2175-bp mouse cDNA (GenBank™ accession number GI 47564087), subcloned into pCRII, Invitrogen). In situ hybridizations were performed on lung sections at E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5 as described previously (23Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev.

Isolation of Lung Fibroblasts and Alveolar Type II Epithelial Cells—Fibroblasts and alveolar type II cells were isolated from 6-week-old control and ScapΔ/Δ mouse lung, using collagenase and differential plating as described previously (22Schultz C.J.

Cell purity for the alveolar type II cell and fibroblast fractions was determined by immunochemistry using rabbit polyclonal pro-SP-C (1:2000, Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH) and vimentin (1:600, mouse IgM, Sigma) as described below. RNA Isolation and Analysis—RNA was isolated from whole lung, isolated lung fibroblasts, or alveolar type II cells from 8-week-old mice using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with DNase at room temperature for 15 min before cDNA synthesis. RNA (4 μg) was reverse-transcribed and then analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR for using Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). A list of genes and associated primers are described in supplemental Table 1. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Mouse lung epithelial cells, MLE-15, an immortalized mouse lung epithelial cell line that maintains some morphological and functional characteristics of type II epithelial cells, were cultured in HITES medium (20Besnard V. Wert S.E. Kaestner K.H. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2005; 289: L750-L759Google Scholar, 21Besnard V. Xu Y. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2007; 293: L1395-L1405Google Scholar). The surfactant protein reporter constructs were described previously (20Besnard V. Wert S.E. Kaestner K.H. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2005; 289: L750-L759Google Scholar) and cotransfected with either empty vector pcDNA3 or pCMV-nSREBP-1c plasmid, encoding amino acids 1-436 of human nuclear (n) SREBP-1c purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) or pcDNA3-nSREBP-1a and pcDNA3-nSREBP-2 described previously (21Besnard V. Xu Y. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2007; 293: L1395-L1405Google Scholar). Forty eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was assessed and normalized for cotransfection efficiency to β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were performed in triplicate. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pCMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech) vectors were used to normalize DNA and transfection efficiency, respectively. Lung Histology, Histochemistry, and Immunostaining—Embryonic lungs were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl). Four- to eight-week-old mice lungs were inflation fixed with the same fixative at 25 cm of H2O before immersion. Lungs were fixed overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in a series of alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections using a microwave antigen-retrieval technique for detection of transcription factors (Ki-67). Sections were pretreated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for inactivation of endogenous peroxidase and then blocked in 4% normal serum for 2 h before incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used were generated to Ki-67 (1:500, M7249, rat monoclonal, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and adipose differentiation related protein (ADFP) (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal) (22Schultz C.J. Torres E. Londos C. Torday J.S. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L288-L296Google Scholar). After being rinsed, tissue sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-rat IgGs (7.5 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min and detected with an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex detection kit (Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using nickel-diaminobenzidine as a substrate. The precipitation reaction was enhanced with Tris-cobalt, and the sections were counterstained with 0.1% of nuclear fast red. All experiments shown are representative of findings from at least four independent dams, each generating at least one or two ScapΔ/Δ mice that were compared with control littermates. Oil Red O Staining—Lung sections were stained with Oil Red O to detect neutral lipids according to the manufacturer's protocol (Poly Scientific, Bayshore, NY). The number of Oil Red O-stained cells was determined by a point-counting method on 6-week-old mice (30Bolender R.P. Hyde D.M. Dehoff R.T. Am. J. Physiol.. 1993; 265: L521-L548Google Scholar, 31Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Google Scholar). Five mice of both genotypes were studied. Measurements were performed on two sections taken at intervals throughout the left, right upper, or right lower lobes. Sections were viewed and photograph using a ×20 objective, and the digital images (fields) were analyzed using Meta-Morph imaging software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). A computer-generated, 121-point lattice grid was superimposed on each field, and the number of Oil Red O-stained cells was counted manually. The density of Oil Red O stained cells was calculated by dividing the number of Oil Red O-stained cells by alveolar area (mm2). Fifteen fields per section were analyzed to gather the data. The x and y coordinates for each field measured were selected by a random number generator. Bronchioles, large vessels, and smaller arterioles and venules were excluded from the study. Saturated Phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) Measurement—Eight-week-old mice (n = 5/group) were anesthetized and killed by exsanguination. Tracheas were cannulated, and five 1-ml aliquots of 0.9% NaCl were flushed into the lungs and withdrawn by syringe three times for each aliquot. The lavaged lung tissue was removed and homogenized in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Sat PC in lipid extracts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were isolated with osmium tetroxide (25Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. Na C.L. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 6366-6371Google Scholar) followed by phosphorus measurement, as described previously (26Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). The volumes of recovered BALF from all the groups were similar. Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry of Phospholipid Molecular Species—BALF and lung tissue phospholipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol according to Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol.. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) after adding the following internal standards (nmol/107 cells): PC14:0/14:0 (15 nmol), PE14:0/14:0 (4 nmol), PG14:0/14:0 (2 nmol), and PS14:0/14:0 (2 nmol). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of phospholipids was performed as described previously (28Postle A.D. Gonzales L.W. Bernhard W. Clark G.T. Godinez M.H. Godinez R.I. Ballard P.L. J. Lipid Res.. 2006; 47: 1322-1331Google Scholar). The volumes of recovered BALF from all the groups were similar. Precursor Incorporation into Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and Secretion—After cell isolation and differential plating, fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 5% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alveolar type II cells were cultured on Matrigel matrix-rat tail collagen (70:30 v/v) in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium minus hydrocortisone plus 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor for 5 days (24Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L256-264Google Scholar) and then cultured for 48 h with the same medium supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride. After culture in the presence of the isotope, cells were washed with saline solution and replaced in culture medium without the isotope for 3 h. After 3 h of secretion, conditioned media and adherent cells were harvested separately. Lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol.. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and radioactivity in PC was counted. Percent secretion at 3 h was estimated from the amount of radioactive PC in the conditioned media divided by the sum of the radioactive PC in the conditioned media and cell extract. Cell numbers and volumes of recovered conditioned media from all the groups were similar. Lipid Uptake—After cell isolation and differential plating, fibroblasts were cultured for 24 h in medium, as described previously, supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride or 1 μCi/ml [14C]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After culture in the presence of the isotope, cells were washed with saline solution and replaced in culture medium without the isotope for 4 h. After 4 h of secretion, fibroblast-conditioned media were harvested, and radioactivity was counted and stored at -20 °C. Alveolar type II cells were cultured on Matrigel as described previously for 3 days (24Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 283: L256-264Google Scholar), washed with saline solution, and then cultured for 4 h with fibroblast-conditioned media. After 4 h in fibroblast-conditioned media, adherent cells were washed and harvested. An aliquot of the cell suspension was taken to estimate protein concentration determined by the Bradford assay, and the remaining cell suspension was extracted for lipid content with chloroform and methanol, and radioactivity in PC was counted. Percentage of uptake at 4 h was estimated from the amount of radioactive PC in the type II cells divided by the sum of the radioactive PC in the conditioned media and cell extract. Triglyceride and Cholesteryl Ester Measurements—Lipid extracts of BALF, lung tissue, alveolar type II cells, and lung fibroblasts recovered from 8-week-old mice (n = 5/group) were assayed for triglyceride and cholesteryl ester content according to the manufacturer's protocol using the triglyceride quantification kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) and the cholesterol/cholesteryl ester quantification kit (EMD Chemicals, Inc., San Diego, CA), respectively. The volumes of recovered BALF from all the groups were similar. The protein concentration in each fraction was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and was used to normalize triglyceride and cholesteryl ester contents in each fraction. Ultrastructure Studies—Lung tissue from 8-week-old ScapΔ/Δ mice and littermate controls was fixed in modified Karnovsky's fixative consisting of 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (SCB) and 0.1% calcium chloride, pH 7.3. The tissue was postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m SCB, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin (EMbed 812; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), as described previously (29Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Yan C. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn.. 1997; 210: 305-314Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were viewed in a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope, and digitized images were collected with an AMT Advantage Plus 2K × 2K digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). RNA Microarray Analysis—For Affymetrix MicroArray, E18.5 lung RNAs from ScapΔ/Δ mice and littermate controls were prepared using RNeasy Protect mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was treated with DNase at room temperature for 15 min. Lung cRNA was hybridized to the murine genome 430 2.0 array (consisting of 45,000 probe sets representing over 34,000 mouse genes; Affymetrix Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5.0 was used to scan and quantitate the gene chips using default scan settings. Normalization was performed using the Robust Multichip Average model that consists of three steps, namely background adjustment, quartile normalization, and summarization (32Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2003; 31: e15Google Scholar, 33Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics.. 2003; 4: 249-264Google Scholar). Microarray analysis was performed with the software package BRB Array Tools, developed by the Biometric Research Branch of the NCI, National Institutes of Health (linus.nci.nih.gov). Differentially expressed genes were identified using a univariate F test and permutation test (n = 100) with a significance level of 0.05. Data were prefiltered by excluding probe sets as follows: 1) whose expression differed ≤1.2 from the median in 80% of the samples, 2) whose expression data were missing in more than 50% of the samples, or 3) with more than 70% of absent calls by the Affymetrix algorithm in six samples. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were performed using the public available web-based tool David (Data base for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) (34Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol.. 2003; 4: P3Google Scholar). Gene frequency and probability in each functional category were calculated by Fisher Exact Test using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 as background control. Biological association networks were built using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Statistical Analysis—Either Mann-Whitney U test or Student's t test were used to determine the levels of difference between groups. Values for all measurements were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and p values for significance are indicated for each experiment. Conditional Deletion of the Scap Gene in the Lung Alveolar Epithelium—Srebp mRNAs were previously detected in alveolar type II cells in the murine lung, supporting their potential role in the regulation of surfactant homeostasis (10Mason R.J. Pan T. Edeen K.E. Nielsen L.D. Zhang F. Longphre M. Eckart M.R. Neben S. J. Clin. Investig.. 2003; 112: 244-255Google Scholar). To identify the role of SREBPs in alveolar type II cells, triple transgenic mice SP-C-rtTAtg/-, TetO-Cretg/tg, and Scapflox/flox were produced in which Scap was selectively and permanently deleted in the respiratory epithelium following administration of doxycycline to the dam from E6.5 to E12.5 (21Besnard V. Xu Y. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2007; 293: L1395-L1405Google Scholar). To assess the efficiency of Cre-mediated Scap gene deletion in the ScapΔ/Δ mice, in situ hybridization was performed on lung sections prepared from fetal mouse lung at E14.5 (Fig. 1, A-F). Although readily detected in control littermates (Fig. 1D), Scap mRNA was decreased or absent in the epithelial cells of developing lung tubules of the ScapΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 1E). Likewise, Scap gene deletion was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR on E18.5 fetal lung, E18.5, and adult alveolar type II cells mRNAs, demonstrating a marked decrease in Scap mRNA in ScapΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 1G). As observed in other tissues (15Matsuda M. Korn B.S. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Komuro R. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Shimomura I. Genes Dev.. 2001; 15: 1206-1216Google Scholar, 21Besnard V. Xu Y. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2007; 293: L1395-L1405Google Scholar), deletion of Scap reduced Srebp-1c and Srebp-1a mRNAs. Expression of Genes Encoding Lipogenic and Surfactant-associated Proteins in ScapΔ/Δ Mice—Previous studies demonstrated that SREBPs regulate genes playing important roles in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. To identify genes influenced by the SCAP/SREBP pathway in the lung, the expression of mRNA encoding a number of known transcriptional targets of the SREBPs were estimated by quantitative RT-PCR from E18.5 lung, adult whole lung, and alveolar type II cells isolated from ScapΔ/Δ and control littermates (Fig. 2). A marked decrease in mRNAs influencing fatty acid metabolism (Scd1, Scd2, Fasn, Fdps1, Fad1, Fabp5, and Thrsp) and cholesterol metabolism (Hmgcs1, Hmgcs2, Ldlr, Abca1, and Gpam) was observed at E18.5 in the lungs of ScapΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar Scap-dependent alterations were observed in alveolar type II cells isolated from the adult ScapΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 2, H and I). Differences in expression of these mRNAs were not observed in mRNA isolated from total adult lung, indicating the p"

Thus the polymorphism E219K has been considered protective against sporadic CJD. The corresponding mouse prion protein (PrP) polymorphism variant (mouse PrP 218K) is not converted to the abnormal isoform (PrPSc) and shows a dominant negative effect on wild-type PrP conversion. To define the conversion activity of this human molecule, we herein established knock-in mice with human PrP 219K and performed a series of transmission experiments with human prions. Surprisingly, the human PrP 219K molecule was converted to PrPSc in variant CJD infection, and the conversion occurred more efficiently than PrP 219E molecule. Notably the knock-in mice with PRNP codon 219E/K showed the least efficient conversion compared with their hemizygotes with PRNP codon 219E/0 or codon 219K/0, or homozygotes with PRNP codon 219E/E or codon 219K/K. This phenomenon indicated heterozygous inhibition. This heterozygous inhibition was observed also in knock-in mice with PRNP codon 129M/V genotype. In addition to variant CJD infection, the human PrP 219K molecule is conversion-competent in transmission experiments with sporadic CJD prions. Therefore, the protective effect of PRNP E219K against sporadic CJD might be due to heterozygous inhibition.

Therefore, the protective effect of PRNP E219K against sporadic CJD might be due to heterozygous inhibition. Human prion diseases have been classified into infectious, inherited, and sporadic forms. Infectious human prion disease was demonstrated first in Kuru (1Gajdusek D.C. Zigas V. N. Engl. J. Med.. 1957; 257: 974-978Google Scholar) and recently in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) 3The abbreviations used are: CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; vCJD, variant CJD; sCJD, sporadic CJD; PrP, prion protein; PrPC, normal cellular isoform of PrP; PrPSc, abnormal isoform of PrP; FDC, follicular dendritic cell; PRNP, human prion protein gene; prnp, murine prion protein gene. with dura mater-grafted CJD, pituitary hormone-associated CJD, and variant CJD (vCJD) (2Brown P. Brandel J.P. Preece M. Sato T. Neurology.. 2006; 67: 389-393Google Scholar, 3Will R.G. Ironside J.W. Zeidler M. Cousens S.N. Estibeiro K. Alperovitch A. Poser S. Pocchiari M. Hofman A. Smith P.G. Lancet.. 1996; 347: 921-925Google Scholar). Familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straeussler syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia are human inherited prion diseases (4Prusiner S.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc Lond. B Biol. Sci.. 1994; 343: 447-463Google Scholar). Sporadic CJD (sCJD) is of unknown etiology. These prion diseases are caused by the accumulation of an abnormal isoform (PrPSc) of prion protein (PrP), which is converted from the normal cellular isoform (PrPC) (5Prusiner S.B. Brain Pathol.. 1998; 8: 499-513Google Scholar). The human PrP contains 253 amino acids encoded by prion protein gene (PRNP), which is located on chromosome 20. Numerous point mutations or insertional mutations in the open reading frame of PRNP have been reported in inherited prion diseases. In addition, normal polymorphisms of PRNP appear to influence the susceptibility to sporadic or infectious prion diseases. Homozygosity at the polymorphic PRNP codon 129 (methionine or valine) may cause a predisposition to sporadic or iatrogenic CJD in Europeans (6Collinge J. Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Lancet.. 1991; 337: 1441-1442Google Scholar, 7Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Hughes J.T. Collinge J. Nature.. 1991; 352: 340-342Google Scholar). All cases of vCJD are homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129 (129M/M) (8Pocchiari M. Puopolo M. Croes E.A. Budka H. Gelpi E. Collins S. Lewis V. Sutcliffe T. Guilivi A. Delasnerie-Laupretre N.

Will R.G. Brain.. 2004; 127: 2348-2359Google Scholar). In 1994, we reported that glutamate to lysine substitution at codon 219 is a polymorphism occurring in the Japanese population (9Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B.. 1994; 343: 391-398Google Scholar). This is a common polymorphism (allele frequency; 6%), which was later found also in other populations in the East Asia, the South Asian subcontinent, and the Pacific region, but has not been reported in Europeans (10Jeong B.H. Lee K.H. Kim N.H. Jin J.K. Kim J.I. Carp R.I. Kim Y.S. Neurogenetics.. 2005; 6: 229-232Google Scholar, 11Yu S.L. Jin L. Sy M.S. Mei F.H. Kang S.L. Sun G.H. Tien P. Wang F.S. Xiao G.F. Eur. J. Hum.

Science.. 2003; 300: 640-643Google Scholar). It has been reported that the PRNP genotype at codon 219 influences the clinicopathological features of Gerstmann-Straeussler syndrome with a codon 102 mutation (13Furukawa H. Kitamoto T. Tanaka Y. Tateishi J. Mol. Brain Res.. 1995; 30: 385-388Google Scholar), and that the codon 219K genotype appears to have a protective effect for sCJD (14Shibuya S. Shin R.-W. Higuchi J. Tateishi J. Kitamoto T. Ann. Neurol.. 1998; 43: 826-828Google Scholar). In addition, the codon 218K variant (corresponding to the human 219K) in the murine prion protein gene (prnp) was not converted to PrPSc and also showed a dominant negative effect on wild-type PrP conversion both in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (15Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice (16Perrier V. Kaneko K. Safar J. Vergara J. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wallace A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 13079-13084Google Scholar). This dominant negative effect of the mouse PrP 218K variant was proposed at first to be mediated by protein X (15Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Google Scholar) but was also observed in in vitro fibril formation without protein X (17Lee C.I. Yang Q. Perrier V. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci.. 2007; 16: 2166-2173Google Scholar). In contrast to the murine prnp 218K variant, the human PrP 219K molecule did not prevent the onset of dura mater-grafted CJD (14Shibuya S. Shin R.-W. Higuchi J. Tateishi J. Kitamoto T. Ann. Neurol.. 1998; 43: 826-828Google Scholar) or familial CJD (18Nishida Y. Sodeyama N. Toru Y. Toru S. Kitamoto T. Mizusawa H. Neurology.. 2004; 63: 1978-1979Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the human PrP 219K molecule is conversion-competent or not. In the present study, we newly established knock-in mice expressing the human PrP 219K molecule (Ki-Hu219K/K) and compared the conversion activity with other human PrP polymorphic molecules (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar). We found that human PrP 219K is readily converted to PrPSc in vCJD infection, and also report the inhibition of PrP conversion in the heterozygous knock-in models. Production of Humanized Knock-in Mouse with Homozygous, Heterozygous, or Hemizygous Genetic Background—Knock-in mice and transgenic mice were generated as reported previously (20Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2002; 294: 280-286Google Scholar). The open reading frame was replaced with human PrP gene with lysine at codon 219 (Fig. 1A). The 5′-primer was designed to incorporate a SmaI site. The PCR fragment was ligated to the mouse sequence using the SmaI site. Consequently, after processing of the N-terminal signal peptide during post-translational modification, the resulting molecule was identical with human PrP. The knock-in mice with human PrP 129M or 129V were already established (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi A. Asano M. Mohri S. Kitamoto T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 30022-30028Google Scholar). We produced knock-in mouse crossed with the PrP knock-out mouse (20Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2002; 294: 280-286Google Scholar) to provide the hemizygous genetic background in the present study. Sources of Prion Inocula and Transmission Experiment—Human brain tissues were obtained at autopsy from CJD patients after receiving informed consent for research use. Brain homogenate was prepared from four patients with vCJD (96/02, 96/07, 96/45, or 05/02), or two cases with sCJD (MM1 and MV1). The open reading frame of PRNP was analyzed by PCR direct sequencing (22Kitamoto T. Ohta M. Doh-ura K. Hitoshi S. Terao Y. Tateishi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1993; 191: 709-714Google Scholar). Human brain homogenates (10%) were prepared as described previously (23Taguchi Y. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Muramoto T. Kitamoto T. Am. J. Pathol.. 2003; 163: 2585-2593Google Scholar). Transmission studies were performed using 20 μl of the homogenates for intracerebral inoculation or 50 μl for intraperitoneal inoculation. Mice were sacrificed at 75 days post-inoculation for follicular dendritic cell (FDC) bioassay. Our previous study showed that the level of PrPSc accumulated in the spleen of knock-in mouse expressing chimeric human/mouse PrP with 129 M/M reached a plateau at 45 days post-inoculation (20Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2002; 294: 280-286Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to perform FDC assay at 75 days post-inoculation (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar). Half of the spleen was immediately frozen for Western blotting, and the remaining half was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the immunohistochemistry. Intracerebrally inoculated mice were sacrificed after the onset of the disease or examined when postmortem. One hemisphere of the brain was immediately frozen for Western blotting, and the other hemisphere was fixed in formalin for the immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse tissues were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, and treated with 60% formic acid before embedding in paraffin. Tissue sections were processed for PrP immunohistochemistry using hydrolytic autoclaving pretreatment (24Kitamoto T. Muramoto T. Mohri S. Doh-ura K. Tateishi J. J. Virol.. 1991; 65: 6292-6295Google Scholar). The PrP-N antiserum (25Kitamoto T. Muramoto T. Hilbich C. Beyreuther K. Tateishi J. Brain Res.. 1991; 545: 319-321Google Scholar) or ChW antiserum (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar) were used as the primary antibody. A goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin polyclonal antibody labeled with a peroxidase-conjugated dextran polymer, EnVision (DakoCytomation, Denmark), was used as the secondary antibody. Western Blotting—PrPSc was extracted from either spleen or brain with collagenase treatment as previously described (26Grathwohl K.U. Horiuchi M. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. Arch. Virol.. 1996; 141: 1863-1874Google Scholar) with modifications. PrPC was measured in the membrane fractions of the brain isolated from the knock-in mice. For the quantitative analysis, samples (corresponding to 7.5 mg wet weight of spleen tissue for PrPSc, or 500 μg wet weight of brain tissue for PrPC) were subjected to 13.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. ChW antiserum or 3F4 antibody was used as the primary antibody. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse EnVision was used as the secondary antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize Western blots. The signal intensities of the Western blots were quantified with Quantity One software using an imaging device, Vasa Doc 5000 (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was repeated at least three times, and signal intensities were expressed as mean ± S.E. To check the protease resistance in each PrP polymorphism, we did the following experiment with the infected or uninfected knock-in mouse brains. Brain tissues of the Ki-Hu219K/K or Ki-Hu219E/E infected with MM1 prions or the uninfected control brain tissues were homogenized with 10 times the amount of the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to discard the nuclear fraction. The supernatants were homogenized again with a glass homogenizer adding the Sarkosyl solution at a final concentration of 2%. The homogenate was centrifuged again at 2000 × g for 10 min. The final supernatant was digested at 37°C for 60 min with Proteinase K at concentrations of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μg/ml. The digested samples were added with the equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 15 min for the Western blot analysis. Statistical Analysis—Incubation times and the signal intensities of Western blots are expressed as mean ± S.E. Knock-in Mouse as a Model to Provide the Physiological Expression Level of Recombinant PrP—In comparison with transgenic technology, knock-in mice produced by the homologous recombination technique have the advantage of providing a constant expression level (20Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2002; 294: 280-286Google Scholar, 27Bishop M.T. Hart P. Aitchison L. Baybutt H.N. Plinston C. Thomson V. Tuzi N.L. Head M.W. Ironside J.W. Will R.G. Manson J.C. Lancet Neurol.. 2006; 5: 393-398Google Scholar). Therefore, as reported previously (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar), the expression level of PrPC in the spleens of the heterozygous knock-in mice (Ki-Hu129M/V) was the same as that of the homozygous knock-in mice (Ki-Hu129M/M or Ki-Hu129V/V). It is impossible to establish a heterozygous animal model without the homologous recombination technique. However, a transgenic model with the PRNP 129M/V genotype was reported previously, but this model (Tg45/152) showed uneven expression (M:V = 1:1.5) and overexpression of the gene (4–6 fold) (28Asante E.A. Linehan J.M. Gowland I. Joiner S. Fox K. Cooper S. Osiguwa O. Gorry M. Welch J. Houghton R. Desbruslais M. Brandner S. Wadsworth J.D. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 10759-10764Google Scholar). In addition to the advantage described above, here we present that the expression levels of PrPC in the brains of the hemizygous knock-in mice (Ki-Hu129M/0 or Ki-Hu129V/0) showed almost half the intensities of those seen in the homozygous mice (Ki-Hu129M/M or Ki-Hu129V/V) (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, in this study, we can analyze two different expression levels of recombinant PrP: 1 copy of gene expression in the hemizygous knock-in mice and 2 copies of gene expression in the homozygous or heterozygous knock-in mice. Human PrP 219K Molecule Is Conversion-competent in vCJD Infection—At first, we examined the transmission experiment with vCJD prions, since a case of vCJD patient was reported in Japan (2929. Yamada, M., and the Variant CJD Working Group Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Committee, Japan (2006) Lancet, 367, 874.Google Scholar). When considering the possibility of secondary infection from human to human transmission in Japan, it is important to know whether the Japanese populations with the codon 219E/E, E/K or K/K genotype are susceptible to vCJD prions. In secondary vCJD infection, a direct intracerebral route of exposure is only likely to occur during neurosurgical procedures, whereas a peripheral route of infection via blood transfusion, tissue transplantation or general surgery is far more likely. Thus, we analyzed the susceptibility to vCJD prions using the FDC assay after the peripheral route of infection in a murine model. It was surprising that positive PrP immunolabeling was observed in the FDC of the spleens from Ki-Hu219K/K intraperitoneally inoculated with vCJD prions (Fig. 2A). To compare the conversion efficiency between PrP 219E and PrP 219K, we prepared knock-in mice with the following genotypes: Ki-Hu219E/K, Ki-Hu219E/0, Ki-Hu219K/0, Ki-Hu219E/E, and Ki-Hu219K/K. These knock-in mice were inoculated with vCJD prions from 2 different patients and were sacrificed at 75 days post-inoculation to analyze PrPSc in the FDC by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positive FDC staining in almost all knock-in mice inoculated with the vCJD prions (supplemental Fig. S1A). Although the vCJD infection was established in almost all mice irrespective of the codon 219 genotype, the numbers of positively stained FDCs differed in each knock-in mouse (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we counted the total number of lymphoid follicles and the number of positively stained FDCs in all mice. The positive rate in the FDC assay was lowest in Ki-Hu219E/K, followed by Ki-Hu219E/0, Ki-Hu219E/E and Ki-Hu219K/0, and was highest in Ki-Hu219K/K (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis showed that the quantity of PrPSc was highest in the spleens of Ki-Hu219K/K, followed by Ki-Hu219K/0, Ki-Hu219E/E and Ki-Hu219E/0, and was lowest in Ki-Hu219E/K (Fig. 2, C and D). Despite the different genotype in the knock-in mice (219K/K) and vCJD prions (219E/E), the most effective conversion was observed in Ki-Hu219K/K mice. Even the hemizygous Ki-Hu219K/0 showed more PrPSc accumulation than did Ki-Hu219E/E. This observation in Western blot was reproducible in a transmission experiment using another vCJD inoculum (vCJD96/07) (supplemental Fig. S1B). In both transmission experiments, the heterozygous model showed the lowest efficiency of conversion. Heterozygous Inhibition Is Also Observed in the PRNP Codon 129M/V Genotype—As reported previously (19Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 342: 293-299Google Scholar), Ki-Hu129M/M and Ki-Hu129M/V mice were susceptible to vCJD prions as revealed by FDC assay, but Ki-Hu129V/V mice were not. Because the human PrP 129V molecule is conversion-incompetent in vCJD infection, it was the best model to compare the amount of PrPSc between Ki-Hu129M/V and Ki-Hu129M/0 to examine the influence of heterozygosity. We prepared knock-in mice with the following genotypes: Ki-Hu129M/V, Ki-Hu129M/0, Ki-Hu129M/M (a synonym for Ki-Hu219E/E), and Ki-Hu129V/V. All of these knock-in mice had Glu at codon 219 of PRNP (Fig. 1A). These mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with vCJD prions (vCJD05/02). In Western blot analysis, Ki-Hu129M/M and Ki-Hu129M/V had PrPSc in the spleen, but Ki-Hu129V/V did not (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the amount of PrPSc in the spleens of Ki-Hu129M/V was consistently less than that in Ki-Hu129M/0. This observation in Western blot was reproducible in a transmission experiment using another vCJD inoculum (vCJD96/07) (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, the conversion-incompetent human PrP 129V molecule also appears to show an inhibitory effect on the accumulation of human PrP 129M PrPSc. Transmission Studies via the Intracerebral Administration—It was established that the human PrP 219K molecule is converted in vCJD infection, but it remains uncertain as to whether this molecule could be converted by infection with other prions. To examine the transmissibility of other prions, we performed intracerebral inoculation of 10% brain homogenates from a patient with sCJD. In the transmission experiment using sCJD prions, all Ki-Hu219K/K showed PrPSc accumulation in the brain. Compared with Ki-Hu219E/E (467 ± 24 days), Ki-Hu219K/K showed a longer incubation period (573 ± 103 days) after inoculation with sCJD-MM1 prions (129M/M, 219E/E, and type 1 PrPSc). It is significant that human PrP 219K could be converted by sCJD-MM1 or MV1 prions (129M/V, 219E/E, and type 1 PrPSc) (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis of the brains from Ki-Hu219K/K showed a similar PrPSc isoform on blot to that seen in Ki-Hu219E/E (Fig. 4B). Thus the human PrP 219K is conversion-competent also in sCJD prion infection. We also summarize the transmission data of vCJD prions with the intracerebral inoculation (Fig. 4A). In vCJD (vCJD05/02) infection, Ki-Hu219K/K mice showed PrPSc accumulation in the brain after the incubation period of 412 ± 6 days. Ki-Hu129M/M (the same mouse as Ki-Hu219E/E) showed a longer incubation period compared with Ki-Hu219K/K. In addition to these homozygous models, the Ki-Hu129M/V heterozygous mice show no clinical signs and still are alive after >740 days of incubation (Fig. 4A). Therefore, heterozygous inhibition was similarly observed as in intracerebral infections. It was not expected that the Hu219K PrP molecule was converted to the abnormal isoform. Therefore, it should be important to check the protease sensitivity in the normal isoforms and abnormal isoforms of Hu219K and Hu219E. At first, we checked the protease sensitivity of the uninfected or infected brain samples with MM1 prion (supplemental Fig. S3). The pattern in the protease sensitivity of PrPC and the protease resistance of PrPSc was almost the same in Ki-Hu219E/E and Ki-Hu219K/K. In addition to this result, the positive rate in the immunohistochemical analysis of the FDC assay infected with vCJD prions correlated to the quantitative data in the Western blot (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). In addition, Ki-Hu219K/K mice showed a shorter incubation period compared with Ki-Hu129M/M (Ki-Hu219E/E) in the central nervous system infection. Therefore, it was concluded that the Hu219K molecule is readily converted in vCJD prions compared with Hu219E. From our data, the Hu219K molecule might be more suitable as a substrate to amplify vCJD prions by the PMCA technique (30Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature.. 2001; 411: 810-813Google Scholar) compared with Hu219E (31Jones M. Peden A.H. Prowse C.V. Groner A. Manson J.C. Turner M.L. Ironside J.W. MacGregor I.R. Head M.W. J. Pathol.. 2007; 213: 21-26Google Scholar). Although many transmission studies have shown the importance of homology at the polymorphic codons between PrPC and PrPSc for efficient conversion (32Korth C. Kaneko K. Groth D. Heye N. Telling G. Mastrianni J. Parchi P. Gambetti P. Will R. Ironside J.W. Heinrich C. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 4784-4789Google Scholar), vCJD prions represent an exception as far as PRNP codon 219 is concerned. This exception can be explained by the fact that bovine PrP has a amino acid substitution of glutamine corresponding to codon 219. The structure of PrPSc with Hu219K might have a similar structure of BSE PrPSc with 219Q compared with that of Hu219E. Based on the codon 219 substitution, we can design a better PrPC substrate to amplify vCJD prions. Despite the conversion competence of the Hu219K and Hu219E PrP molecules, heterozygous inhibition was observed in Ki-Hu219E/K as well as Ki-Hu129M/V mice with conversion-competent 129M and conversion-incompetent 129V molecules. In addition to the peripheral route infection in the FDC assay, Ki-Hu129M/V mice showed heterozygous inhibition of vCJD prion infection in the central nervous system. Therefore, the heterozygous inhibition is a universal feature of prion infections both in peripheral infection and central nervous system infection. The effect of PRNP polymorphisms have been studied recently in an in vitro model (17Lee C.I. Yang Q. Perrier V. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci.. 2007; 16: 2166-2173Google Scholar, 33Tahiri-Alaoui A. Sim V.L. Caughey B. James W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Google Scholar), in which fibril formation revealed the β-oligomer state (34Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Google Scholar). It was suggested that the β-oligomer was not on the pathway to amyloid formation and that the refolding and dissociation of the β-oligomer into the α-monomer most likely preceded the fibril formation. The kinetics of dissociation of the β-oligomer was 100-fold slower in the 129M/V heterogenous β-oligomer than those in either the 129M or 129V homogenous β-oligomer (33Tahiri-Alaoui A. Sim V.L. Caughey B. James W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Google Scholar). The inhibition of amyloid formation was also reported in a fibrillization model mixed with murine wild-type PrP with 218Q and murine PrP 218K molecule (17Lee C.I. Yang Q. Perrier V. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci.. 2007; 16: 2166-2173Google Scholar). In this system, the murine PrP 218K molecule was converted into a fibril, but the conversion efficiency was lowered. It was interesting that the murine PrP 218K molecules were incorporated into fibrils as often as the wild-type molecules. In another model (35Meier P. Genoud N. Prinz M. Maissen M. Rulicke T. Zurbriggen A. Raeber A.J. Aguzzi A. Cell.. 2003; 113: 49-60Google Scholar), transgenic mice expressing conversion-incompetent PrP-Fc2 showed a reduced conversion of wild-type PrP by dimeric PrP-Fc2. Interestingly, the dimeric PrP-Fc2 was also incorporated in protease-resistant fibrils. Based on these previous findings, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the heterozygous inhibition. This mechanism is entirely based on the distinct structure of each PrPSc molecule (36Bellinger-Kawahara C.G. Kempner E. Groth D. Gabizon R. Prusiner S.B. Virology.. 1988; 164: 537-541Google Scholar, 37Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature.. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). At first, PrPC is converted to PrPSc, then the converted PrPSc is piled up into amyloid fibrils according to the nucleated polymerization hypothesis (38Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1997; 66: 385-407Google Scholar). In the homozygous and hemizygous animals, there is only one structural PrPSc. This means that the same blocks (the same structural PrPSc) are piled up into amyloid fibrils with no other influence on fibril formation and elongation. However, in the heterozygous animals, there are at least two distinct structural PrPSc composed of the Hu219E or Hu219K molecule. To form and elongate amyloid fibrils in the heterozygous animal, it takes time to pile up amyloid fibrils, because there are two types of blocks (PrPSc) with a distinct structure (Fig. 5). The two different-shaped PrPSc may act as decelerators of each other. In the FDC assay of Ki-Hu129M/V, the amyloid fibril formation of Hu129M was inhibited by the Hu129V molecule, which was conversion-incompetent. This phenomenon corresponds to the dominant negative effect as reported previously. We can explain the dominant negative phenomenon by this decelerator hypothesis if the conversion-incompetent Hu129V molecules significantly reduce the rate of Hu129M amyloid formation and elongation. The decelerator hypothesis may explain some unusual phenomena in prion infections. We propose that PrPSc molecules with different amino acid sequences act as decelerators in the process of amyloid formation. Because PrP molecules with different amino acid sequences are likely to have different conformations, we can infer that PrPSc molecules with different conformations act as decelerators in the process of amyloid formation. This decelerator hypothesis can explain the phenomenon described as interference (39Manuelidis L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 2520-2525Google Scholar), which is observed in an animal inoculated with two different prion strains. A distinct strain should have a distinct conformation of PrPSc. This PrPSc with a distinct conformation may inhibit another type of PrPSc amyloid formation. Recently, it has been reported that the prion interference is due to a reduction of the strain-specific PrPSc level (40Bartz J.C. Kramer M.L. Sheehan M.H. Hutter J.A. Ayers J.I. Bessen R.A. Kincaid A.E. J. Virol.. 2007; 81: 689-697Google Scholar). Our decelerator hypothesis can account for such prion interference. In this report, we clearly show heterozygous inhibition of PrPSc formation using a knock-in mouse model of prion infection. PRNP heterozygosity may be important in determining resistance to human prion diseases (12Mead S. Stumpf M.P. Whitfield J. Beck J.A. Poulter M. Campbell T. Uphill J.B. Goldstein D. Alpers M. Fisher E.M. Collinge J. Science.. 2003; 300: 640-643Google Scholar). Although the incubation period after the intracerebral transmission of sCJD prions in Ki-Hu219E/K remains to be determined, the present study suggests that the absence of patients with the 219E/K PRNP genotype in sCJD might be due to heterozygous inhibition, because Hu219K is conversion-competent also in sCJD prions infection.

https://openalex.org/W2093508164,"Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RGGT) catalyzes the post-translational geranylgeranyl (GG) modification of (usually) two C-terminal cysteines in Rab GTPases. Here we studied the mechanism of the Rab geranylgeranylation reaction by bisphosphonate analogs in which one phosphonate group is replaced by a carboxylate (phosphonocarboxylate, PC). The phosphonocarboxylates used were 3-PEHPC, which was previously reported, and 2-hydroxy-3-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl-2-phosphonopropionic acid ((+)-3-IPEHPC), a >25-fold more potent related compound as measured by both IC50 and Ki.(+)-3-IPEHPC behaves as a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to GG pyrophosphate (GGPP) and an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to Rab substrates. We propose that phosphonocarboxylates prevent only the second GG transfer onto Rabs based on the following evidence. First, geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins ending with a single cysteine motif such as CAAX, is not affected by the inhibitors, either in vitro or in vivo. Second, the addition of an -AAX sequence onto Rab-CC proteins protects the substrate from inhibition by the inhibitors. Third, we demonstrate directly that in the presence of (+)-3-IPEHPC, Rab-CC and Rab-CXC proteins are modified by only a single GG addition. The presence of (+)-3-IPEHPC resulted in a preference for the Rab N-terminal cysteine to be modified first, suggesting an order of cysteine geranylgeranylation in RGGT catalysis. Our results further suggest that the inhibitor binds to a site distinct from the GGPP-binding site on RGGT. We suggest that phosphonocarboxylate inhibitors bind to a GG-cysteine binding site adjacent to the active site, which is necessary to align the mono-GG-Rab for the second GG addition. These inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic approach in Rab-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2038673880,"The L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are activated under high depolarization voltages. They are vital for diverse biological events, including cell excitability, differentiation, and synaptic transmission. In retinal photoreceptors, L-VGCCs are responsible for neurotransmitter release and are under circadian influences. However, the mechanism of L-VGCC regulation in photoreceptors is not fully understood. Here, we show that retinoschisin, a highly conserved extracellular protein, interacts with the L-VGCCα1D subunit and regulates its activities in a circadian manner. Mutations in the gene encoding retinoschisin (RS1) cause retinal disorganization that leads to early onset of macular degeneration. Since ion channel activities can be modulated through interactions with extracellular proteins, disruption of these interactions can alter physiology and be the root cause of disease states. Co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that retinoschisin and the N-terminal fragment of the L-VGCCα1 subunit physically interacted with one another. The expression and secretion of retinoschisin are under circadian regulation with a peak at night and nadir during the day. Inhibition of L-type VGCCs decreased membrane-bound retinoschisin at night. Overexpression of a missense RS1 mutant gene, R141G, into chicken cone photoreceptors caused a decrease of L-type VGCC currents at night. Our findings demonstrate a novel bidirectional relationship between an ion channel and an extracellular protein; L-type VGCCs regulate the circadian rhythm of retinoschisin secretion, whereas secreted retinoschisin feeds back to regulate L-type VGCCs.

Rollenhagen A. Bosl M.R. Morellini F. Bartsch U. Dityatev A. Schachner M. J. Neurosci.. 2002; 22: 7177-7194Google Scholar). In vertebrate retinas, retinoschisin is an extracellular adhesion protein secreted primarily from photoreceptors and bipolar cells and is distributed throughout the retina (5Grayson C. Reid S.N.

Farber D.B. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 6030-6040Google Scholar). After secretion, retinoschisin localizes mainly to the surface of photoreceptors and bipolar cells in adults (9Molday R.S. Exp. Eye Res.. 2007; 84: 227-228Google Scholar). Mutations in retinoschisin (RS1) cause X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a retinal dystrophy that features disorganization of retinal cell layers, disruption of the synaptic structures and neurotransmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, and progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptor cells (7Reid S.N.

Hence, retinoschisin is believed to play an important role in the development and maintenance of retinal cytoarchitecture (7Reid S.N. Akhmedov N.B. Piriev N.I. Kozak C.A. Danciger M. Farber D.B. Gene (Amst.).. 1999; 227: 257-266Google Scholar, 8Reid S.N. Yamashita C. Farber D.B. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 6030-6040Google Scholar, 15Reid S.N. Farber D.B. Glia.. 2005; 49: 397-406Google Scholar). An interesting clinical aspect of XLRS is that it shares several quantifiable features with X-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB), which is an inherited retinal dystrophy with a mutation in the L-type VGCCα1 subunit gene (16Bech-Hansen N.T. Naylor M.J. Maybaum T.A. Pearce W.G. Koop B. Fishman G.A. Mets M. Musarella M.A. Boycott K.M. Nat. Genet.. 1998; 19: 264-267Google Scholar, 17Strom T.M. Nyakatura G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Hellebrand H. Lorenz B. Weber B.H. Wutz K. Gutwillinger N. Ruther K. Drescher B. Sauer C. Zrenner E. Meitinger T. Rosenthal A. Meindl A. Nat. Genet.. 1998; 19: 260-263Google Scholar). The electroretinogram (ERG) recordings from XLRS and XLCSNB patients are comparable, and in both cases, the cone photoreceptor responses are more severely affected than the rod responses, and synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells is severely damaged (18Bradshaw K. Allen L. Trump D. Hardcastle A. George N. Moore A. Doc. Ophthalmol.. 2004; 108: 135-145Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that molecular interactions between L-type VGCCs and retinoschisin may have an important impact in the synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Visual systems must be able to detect images despite large daily changes in ambient illumination between day and night. Biological clocks (circadian oscillators) in the retina provide a mechanism that allows the visual system to anticipate these daily changes in photon flux by modulating retinal structure and physiology (19Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Prog. Retinal Eye Res.. 1995; 14: 267-291Google Scholar, 20Green C.B. Besharse J.C. J. Biol. Rhythms.. 2004; 19: 91-102Google Scholar). Retina photoreceptors are nonspiking neurons, and the continuous release of glutamate in the dark is a result of depolarization-evoked activation of L-type VGCCs (21Barnes S. Kelly M.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.. 2002; 514: 465-476Google Scholar). In avian retina photoreceptors, the circadian rhythms in the synthesis and release of melatonin are also L-type VGCC-dependent (22Ivanova T.N. Iuvone P.M. Brain Res.. 2003; 973: 56-63Google Scholar, 23Ivanova T.N. Iuvone P.M. Brain Res.. 2003; 991: 96-103Google Scholar). There is a diurnal rhythm of L-type VGCC currents in the goldfish retina with average peak amplitudes significantly larger at midnight than at midday (24Hull C. Studholme K. Yazulla S. von Gersdorff H. J. Neurophysiol.. 2006; 96: 2025-2033Google Scholar). In chick retinas, expression of L-type VGCCα1 subunit transcripts and proteins is under circadian control, and the current amplitudes and the VGCCα1 subunit expression in cone photoreceptors are higher during the subjective night than during the subjective day (25Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 784-792Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that retinoschisin mRNA and protein expression and secretion are also under circadian control (26Ko M.L. Liu Y. Shi L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2008; 49: 1615-1621Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the rhythmic expression and secretion of retinoschisin is coincident with the circadian regulation of L-VGCCs in chick photoreceptors (25Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 784-792Google Scholar, 26Ko M.L. Liu Y. Shi L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2008; 49: 1615-1621Google Scholar), and the circadian-regulated secretion of retinoschisin is an L-type VGCC-dependent process; inhibition of L-type VGCCs dampens the circadian rhythm of retinoschisin secretion, where only night time secretion is affected (26Ko M.L. Liu Y. Shi L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2008; 49: 1615-1621Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate the molecular and functional interactions between L-VGCCα1 subunits and retinoschisin and their functional aspects. In this study, we present the first reported evidence for a novel reciprocal relationship between an ion channel and an extracellular protein; L-type VGCCs govern the circadian rhythm of retinoschisin secretion, whereas secreted retinoschisin ensures the circadian regulation of L-type VGCCs in the retina photoreceptors. The physical interactions between VGCCα1D N-terminal fragment and retinoschisin underlie a positive feedback regulation on each other. Since the N-terminal fragments among L-type VGCCα1C, -1D, and -1F are highly conserved, retinoschisin may very well interact with all three VGCCα1 subunits. Hence, physical interactions between L-VGCCα1 subunits and retinoschisin may play an important role in the membrane retention of VGCCα1 subunits and photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic transmission. Interactions between ion channels and extracellular proteins not only modulate ion channel activities, they may also dictate the physiology and function of cells, and the loss of such interactions may contribute to the cause of a disease state. We also cloned the full-length retinoschisin gene rs1 from chickens (Gallus gallus) and found that retinoschisin is highly conserved among chickens, mice, and humans, and therefore, retinoschisin may be very important in retina function and physiology across species. Cloning of Full-length Chicken rs1 Gene—Genomic comparisons between human, mouse, and chicken retinoschisin (rs1) gene loci were made through the University of California Santa Cruz genomic research program (available at the University of California Santa Cruz web site). A commercially available kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to isolate total RNA from chicken retina (E18), 1 μg of which was used for reverse transcription (Superscript II; Invitrogen). Highly conserved regions among the different species and a partial high homolog cDNA fragment from chicken eye expressed sequence tag (EST; NCBI entry AI438129) were used to design the RT-PCR primers for amplification of chicken rs1 (forward, 5′-AGGATGAGAGACTGGAGCTGTGGCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCGTCGGGGTTGGAGCAGCTGATC-3′). 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) systems (Invitrogen) were used for tracing the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene (5′-RACE, forward (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG) and reverse (5′-CTGCTCGGGGTTGGAGCAGCTGATC-3′); 3′-RACE, forward (5′-AGGATGAGAGACTGGAGCTGTGGCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′)). Amplification of gene products was achieved through 35 cycles of PCR. The PCR products were purified by the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for DNA sequencing (Gene Technologies Laboratory, Institute of Development and Molecular Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). Immunohistochemistry—Chick E18 eyes were enucleated and fixed with Zamboni's fixative (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, WI) overnight at 4 °C followed by submerging with 10, 20, and 30% sucrose-PBS (0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for cryoprotection. Whole eye sections (10 μm) were incubated with a primary antibody against retinoschisin (retinoschisin H-65 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:250 in 1% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The tissue sections were washed in PBS several times and incubated with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 488 nm goat anti-rabbit, 1:1500 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 2 h in the dark. After several washes, coverslips were mounted and stored at 4 °C for later observation on a Zeiss microscope with epifluorescence to determine the distribution of retinoschisin. Circadian Entrainment and Cell Culture—Fertilized eggs (G. gallus) were obtained from the Poultry Science Department (Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). Chick embryos from embryonic day 11 (E11) were entrained to 12 h/12 h light/dark (LD) cycles at 39 °C in ovo. Zeitgeber time 0 was designated as the time when the lights came on, and Zeitgeber time 12 was the time when the lights went off. After in ovo LD entrainment for 6 days, eggs were kept in constant darkness (DD) for another day. On the second day of DD, retinas were dissected out for biochemistry or molecular biology analysis at various circadian times (CT) of the day. In some experiments, on the last day of LD entrainment, retinal cells were dissociated, cultured in DD (39 °C, 5% CO2) as described previously (27Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron.. 2001; 29: 255-266Google Scholar, 28Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci.. 2004; 24: 1296-1304Google Scholar), and used for biochemistry assays on the second day of DD. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay and Western Blot Analysis—A commercially available cell surface biotinylation assay kit (Pierce) was used, and the manufacturer's instructions were followed to determine the relative amount of retinoschisin bound to the cell membrane as a function of circadian time. By only labeling cell surface proteins, this assay allows for independent analysis of cell surface and cytosolic fractions of proteins (29Chae K.S. Dryer S.E. J. Neurochem.. 2005; 94: 367-379Google Scholar). For this study, we also assessed retinoschisin of the whole lysate (membrane plus cytosolic fractions). Nitrendipine (Sigma) is a VGCC inhibitor and was used to partially gauge any interaction between retinoschisin and VGCCs. This drug (or control vehicle) was added to retina cultures at CT 3 and 15. After 2 h, cultured cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) and exposed to sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (2 mm) for 60 min on an ice bath inside a 4 °C refrigerator to label all cell surface proteins, followed by termination of biotinylation with 100 mm glycine-PBS for 10 min. After lysis, most of the lysate was used to determine the relative amount of plasma membrane-bound retinoschisin by incubating it with streptavidin-linked agarose beads. As a control, the agarose beads were incubated with lysates where cells were not exposed to the biotin. The beads were collected, and the amount of retinoschisin was determined by Western immunoblotting. A small portion of the whole cell lysate was used to measure retinoschisin and total Erk. The Western blotting process has been described previously (25Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 784-792Google Scholar, 26Ko M.L. Liu Y. Shi L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2008; 49: 1615-1621Google Scholar, 27Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron.. 2001; 29: 255-266Google Scholar, 28Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci.. 2004; 24: 1296-1304Google Scholar, 30Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 3145-3153Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibodies used for this part of the present study were anti-retinoschisin (generated in the Trump laboratory) (5Grayson C. Reid S.N. Ellis J.A. Rutherford A. Sowden J.C. Yates J.R. Farber D.B. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2000; 9: 1873-1879Google Scholar) and a polyclonal antibody insensitive to the phosphorylation state of Erk (total Erk, used for loading control; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and an ECL detection system (Pierce). The ratio of retinoschisin to total Erk in each sample was determined by densitometry with Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All measurements were repeated 5-6 times. Co-immunoprecipitation and Mammalian Two-hybrid Assays—To determine whether retinoschisin physically interacted with VGCCs, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed. For co-IPs, eight retinas (from either CT 5 or CT 17) were collected and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40). Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 3 h to solubilize membrane proteins. Samples were then centrifuged to remove cell debris, and a small portion of the supernatant was taken for protein assay analysis and for use in a Coomassie-stained gel. The rest of the supernatant was precleared with Protein A-agarose (GBiosciences, Maryland Heights, MO). The beads were removed, and 5 μl of antibody (anti-retinoschisin or anti-VGCCα1D) were added and incubated for 3 h. No antibody was added to the control groups. After antibody incubation, 20 μl of Protein A-agarose were added to each tube and incubated for another 1.5 h. The beads were collected and processed for Western blot analysis of retinoschisin and VGCCα1D. The supernatant was also saved and processed for Western blot analysis of total Erk. In addition to retinoschisin and total Erk antibodies, anti-VGCCα1D and anti-VGCCpanα1 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) were used for these experiments. The epitope of the anti-VGCCα1D antibody contains 17 amino acids (aa), with 12 residues homologous to the chicken VGCCα1D subunit. The anti-panα1 antibody recognizes all VGCCα1 subtypes and contains 19 amino acids with 100% homology to the chicken VGCCα1C and -α1D subunits. The anti-retinoschisin antibody used in the co-IPs was generated in the Trump laboratory (5Grayson C. Reid S.N. Ellis J.A. Rutherford A. Sowden J.C. Yates J.R. Farber D.B. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2000; 9: 1873-1879Google Scholar). Western blots were visualized as above. For some IPs, antibody preparatory and immunoprecipitation kits (Pierce) were used to remove heavy and light chain interference so that larger blot images could be shown. A commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) following the Bradford method was used to determine total protein content of the samples. All co-IPs were repeated three times. For the mammalian two-hybrid assay, N (bp 1-1481 from ATG) and C termini (bp 5100-6573 ending in TAG) of VGCCα1D (Gene ID 395895) were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from 2 μg of chicken heart total RNA. The primers for the N terminus were 5′-CGGGGATCCTGCAGCACCACCAGCAGCAGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTTCTAGACTCGGTTTCGCTGGTGGGCATGC-3′ (reverse). The primers for the C terminus were 5′-AAAGGATCCCAGACGAGGAGGAGGAAGTTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGGATCCTATAAGCTTGTAATGCATATCAT-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were purified (Qiaquick, Qiagen) and subcloned into pGEM-T-easy vectors (Promega) to confirm the sequence. The RS1 and VGCCα1D N or C termini were inserted into mammalian expression vectors pBind and pACT, respectively (Promega). The transfection reporter assay was carried out by a luciferase assay system (Promega). Briefly, three constructs, pBind or pBind-RS1, pACT or pACT-VGCCα1D, and pG5Luc (100 ng each) were cotransfected into Cos1 cells (TransIT®-COS transfection kit; Mirus, Madison, WI). After cells were harvested, 10 μl of the supernatant was mixed with luciferase substrate, and the relative luciferase activity was determined by luminosity (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All luciferase assays were repeated seven times. Biolistic Transfection and Electrophysiology—Chick retinas from E12 were dissociated, cultured, and entrained under LD cycles for 5 days and then kept in DD in the presence of 40 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 15% heat-inactivated horse serum (25Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 784-792Google Scholar, 27Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron.. 2001; 29: 255-266Google Scholar, 28Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J.

On the first day of DD, cells were transfected using a biolistic particle delivery system (Helium Gene Gun; Bio-Rad). Plasmids were precipitated onto 1.0-μm gold microcarriers according to the manufacturer's protocol. The particle delivery system generated a helium shock wave with a pressure gradient of 150 p.s.i. to accelerate the coated microcarriers onto cultured cells. After transfection, cells remained in culture under DD for another day before electrophysiological recordings were performed at CT 4-7 or 16-19 on the second day of DD. The plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) is commercially available (Vitality® hrGFP II-1 Mammalian Expression Vector, catalog number 240143; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In these experiments, single missense mutants of human RS1 genes, R141G and W92C (pCDNA3.1), were co-transfected with phrGFPII plasmid. All of these constructs use cytomegalovirus promoters. R141G and W92C were prepared in the Trump laboratory (13Wang T. Waters C.T. Rothman A.M. Jakins T.J. Romisch K. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2002; 11: 3097-3105Google Scholar, 31Wang T. Zhou A. Waters C.T. O'Connor E. Read R.J. Trump D. Br. J. Ophthalmol.. 2006; 90: 81-86Google Scholar). For electrophysiological recordings, whole-cell patch clamp configuration of L-type VGCCs was carried out in an external solution containing the following: 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm BaCl2, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 5.3 mm KCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The pipette solution was 135 mm cesium acetate, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH (32Gleason E. Mobbs P. Nuccitelli R. Wilson M. Vis. Neurosci.. 1992; 8: 315-327Google Scholar). Recordings were made from cone photoreceptors characterized morphologically as cells with elongated cell bodies with one or more prominent oil droplets. Currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Signals were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz with Digidata 1440A interface and pCLAMP 10.0 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were leak-subtracted. After gigaohm seals formed, the electrode capacitance was compensated. Current-voltage (I-V) relations were elicited from a holding potential of -65 mV in 200-ms steps (5 s between steps) to test potentials over a range of -80 to +60 mV in 10-mV increments. The membrane capacitance, series resistance, and input resistance of the recorded photoreceptors were measured by applying a 5-mV (100-ms) depolarizing voltage step from a holding potential of -65 mV. Cells with an input resistance <1 gigaohm were discarded. The membrane capacitance reading was used as the value for whole cell capacitance. The current densities of IBa2+ (Idensity) were obtained by dividing the membrane capacitances from current amplitudes. Each group contained 9-18 cells. Statistical Analysis—All of the data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test for unbalanced n was used for statistical analysis. Throughout, p < 0.05 (asterisk) was regarded as significant. Retinoschisin Is Highly Conserved from Chickens to Humans—Human RS1 and mouse rs1 cDNAs are both composed of six exons occupying 32 kb. They share 90% homology in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences (GeneID: 6247 and 20147). We chose to use chicken retinas as our model in this study because chicken retinas are cone-dominant, and the cone pathways in the ERGs from XLRS and XLCSNB patients are more severely affected than the rod responses (18Bradshaw K. Allen L. Trump D. Hardcastle A. George N. Moore A. Doc. Ophthalmol.. 2004; 108: 135-145Google Scholar). Since the full-length chicken (G. gallus) rs1 sequence was not available, we first used human RS1 cDNA as a reference to search for high homology expressed mRNA fragments in chicken expressed sequence tags for cloning chicken rs1. One candidate cDNA fragment (AI438129) was the result from an NCBI cross-species megaBlast search. This fragment contains two exons, which can be traced to chicken chromosome 1 nucleotides 123,954,233-123,954,340 and 123,957,154-123,957,236, respectively. Using wide genomic sequence comparisons among different species, we were able to align highly conserved regions in humans, mice, and chickens (University of California Santa Cruz). Based on the genomic comparisons, we first designed a pair of primers to verify the rs1 fragment (AI438129) from a chicken eye cDNA library. To clone full-length chicken rs1 cDNA, we utilized 5′- and 3′-RACE assays to amplify the upstream and downstream sequences from this chicken rs1 cDNA fragment. The PCR fragment amplified from 3′-RACE (770 bp) contained the chicken rs1 cDNA fragment, stop codon, 3′-untranslated region, and poly(A) tail. There were two bands from the 5′-RACE assay (about 1.1 kb and 330 bp). Both PCR fragments were subcloned and sequenced. The 1.1-kb fragment was nonspecific PCR amplification of ribosomal RNA. The smaller fragment included the chicken rs1 cDNA fragment (AI438129), start codon, 5′-untranslated region, and poly(G) primer sequence. The complete chicken retinoschisin sequence contained 856 nucleotides encoding 225 amino acids (Tables 1 and 2). Amino acid sequence alignment among human (Homo), mouse (Mus), and chicken (Gallus) showed that the N-terminal (first 60 aa) of chicken rs1 was only moderately homologous to the mouse and human (∼50%). The remainder of chicken rs1 (including the functional discoidin domain) showed nearly 90% homology to the human and mouse (Table 2). The full-length nucleotide sequence of chicken retinoschisin (rs1) has been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession number EU924185.TABLE 1Full-length chicken, G. gallus rs1 cDNA sequence Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Retinoschisin protein alignmentView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To further verify rs1 protein expression in the chicken retina, we used a commercially available retinoschisin antibody for immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting of E18 chick retinas (Fig. 1). The retinoschisin antibody (H-65) recognizes amino acids (aa) 126-190 of the mouse and human that is also conserved in chicken rs1. Two bands were observed from chicken whole retina lysate immunoblotting results, a major band around 24 kDa and a minor band around 28 kDa (Fig. 1B). The protein expression of retinoschisin was higher during the subjective night (CT 16) than during the subjective day (CT 4; Fig. 1B). This observation is consistent with"
https://openalex.org/W1970292066,"Shock wave attenuation rate and formation of central uplifts are not precisely constrained for moderately sized complex impact structures. The distribution of shock metamorphism in drilled basement rocks from the 10.5-kilometer-diameter Bosumtwi crater, and results of numerical modeling of inelastic rock deformation and modification processes during uplift, constrained with petrographic data, allowed reconstruction of the pre-impact position of the drilled rocks and revealed a shock attenuation by approximately 5 gigapascals in the uppermost 200 meters of the central uplift. The proportion of shocked quartz grains and the average number of planar deformation feature sets per grain provide a sensitive indication of minor changes in shock pressure. The results further imply that for moderately sized craters the rise of the central uplift is dominated by brittle failure."
https://openalex.org/W1971173911,"In pancreatic β-cells, the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts a potent insulin secretory effect via PAC1 and VPAC receptors (Rs) through the Gαs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Here, we investigated the mechanisms linking PAC1R to ERK1/2 activation in INS-1E β-cells and pancreatic islets. PACAP caused a transient (5 min) increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation via PAC1Rs and promoted nuclear translocation of a fraction of cytosolic p-ERK1/2. Both protein kinase A- and Src-dependent pathways mediated this transient ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, PACAP potentiated glucose-induced long-lasting ERK1/2 activation. Blocking Ca2+ influx abolished glucose-induced ERK1/2 activation and PACAP potentiating effect. Glucose stimulation during KCl depolarization showed that, in addition to the triggering signal (rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]), the amplifying pathway was also involved in glucose-induced sustained ERK1/2 activation and was required for PACAP potentiation. The finding that at 30 min glucose-induced p-ERK1/2 was detected in both cytosol and nucleus while the potentiating effect of PACAP was only observed in the cytosol, suggested the involvement of the scaffold protein β-arrestin. Indeed, β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) depletion (in β-arr1 knockout mouse islets or in INS-1E cells by siRNA) completely abolished PACAP potentiation of long-lasting ERK1/2 activation by glucose. Finally, PACAP potentiated glucose-induced CREB transcriptional activity and IRS-2 mRNA expression mainly via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and likewise, β-arr1 depletion reduced the PACAP potentiating effect on IRS-2 expression. These results establish for the first time that PACAP potentiates glucose-induced long-lasting ERK1/2 activation via a β-arr1-dependent pathway and thus provide new insights concerning the mechanisms of PACAP and glucose actions in pancreatic β-cells. In pancreatic β-cells, the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts a potent insulin secretory effect via PAC1 and VPAC receptors (Rs) through the Gαs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Here, we investigated the mechanisms linking PAC1R to ERK1/2 activation in INS-1E β-cells and pancreatic islets. PACAP caused a transient (5 min) increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation via PAC1Rs and promoted nuclear translocation of a fraction of cytosolic p-ERK1/2. Both protein kinase A- and Src-dependent pathways mediated this transient ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, PACAP potentiated glucose-induced long-lasting ERK1/2 activation. Blocking Ca2+ influx abolished glucose-induced ERK1/2 activation and PACAP potentiating effect. Glucose stimulation during KCl depolarization showed that, in addition to the triggering signal (rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]), the amplifying pathway was also involved in glucose-induced sustained ERK1/2 activation and was required for PACAP potentiation. The finding that at 30 min glucose-induced p-ERK1/2 was detected in both cytosol and nucleus while the potentiating effect of PACAP was only observed in the cytosol, suggested the involvement of the scaffold protein β-arrestin. Indeed, β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) depletion (in β-arr1 knockout mouse islets or in INS-1E cells by siRNA) completely abolished PACAP potentiation of long-lasting ERK1/2 activation by glucose. Finally, PACAP potentiated glucose-induced CREB transcriptional activity and IRS-2 mRNA expression mainly via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and likewise, β-arr1 depletion reduced the PACAP potentiating effect on IRS-2 expression. These results establish for the first time that PACAP potentiates glucose-induced long-lasting ERK1/2 activation via a β-arr1-dependent pathway and thus provide new insights concerning the mechanisms of PACAP and glucose actions in pancreatic β-cells.

PACAP is expressed in islet parasympathetic nerve terminals and strongly potentiates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner both in vitro (1Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F.

Metab. 1997; 82: 3093-3098PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological functions of PACAP are mediated by three receptor subtypes that belong to the class II G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors (Rs). PAC1Ris selective for PACAP, whereas VPAC1R and VPAC2R bind to PACAP and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) with equal high affinity (8Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). Class II GPCRs, which include also receptors for glucagon and the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), are coupled to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs, which stimulates the adenylate cyclase (AC), (9Harmar, A. J. (2001) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/12/reviews/3013Google Scholar). Besides its insulinotropic action, PACAP has been recently reported to exert long term beneficial effects on β-cell mass in various experimental mouse models of diabetes (10Tomimoto S. Hashimoto H.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the receptor(s) and the mechanism(s) involved in these long term effects are yet unknown. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are important effectors of GPCRs and regulate cell growth, survival, and differentiation (12Werry T.D. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, cross-talk between the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) and ERK1/2 signaling pathways has been reported (13Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol.

However, for PACAP, the receptor(s) and the mechanism(s) involved in ERK1/2 activation are yet unknown in β-cells. Depending on the receptor or the cellular context, GPCRs activate the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade through different pathways (19Luttrell L.M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that GPCRs activate ERK1/2 through G-protein-dependent and G-protein-independent pathways (19Luttrell L.M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 21Barki-Harrington L. Rockman H.A. Physiology. 2008; 23: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The G-protein-independent pathway occurs after G-protein uncoupling and results from the recruitment of scaffolding proteins, such as β-arrestins, which are cytosolic proteins initially identified for their role in GPCRs desensitization. Interestingly, G-protein- and β-arrestin-dependent activations of the ERK1/2 pathway are both temporally and spatially distincts in cells and thus modulate differently the functions of ERK1/2. Hence, whereas G-protein-dependent activation of ERK1/2 signal is transient and nuclear, ERK1/2 activation through the β-arrestin-dependent pathway is usually sustained and retained in the cytosol. Glucose is the major physiological stimulus of pancreatic β-cells. It exerts a tight control on insulin secretion through its metabolism via two major, hierarchical signaling pathways: a triggering pathway, i.e. the ATP-sensitive K+ (K+-ATP) channel-dependent pathway, and an amplifying pathway, i.e. the K+-ATP channel-independent pathway (22Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The triggering pathway results from oxidative glycolysis that increases the ATP/ADP ratio, leading to closure of K+-ATP channels, and, subsequently, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and a rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), which is the triggering signal. The amplifying pathway does not further increase [Ca2+]i, but rather enhances the response to the triggering Ca2+ signal. In pancreatic β-cells, glucose, at the physiological concentration range, stimulates ERK1/2 by a rise in [Ca2+]i (15Briaud I. Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. Wrede C.E. Rhodes C.J.

A major physiological relevance of the activation of ERK1/2 by glucose in β-cells is the stimulation of both transcription through phosphorylation of various transcriptional factors (26Khoo S.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of insulin. To further explore the role of PACAP in β-cells, we investigated the mechanisms linking PACAP receptors and ERK1/2 activation in the INS-1E cell line and mouse pancreatic islets, using pharmacological and molecular approaches. PACAP alone induces transient ERK1/2 activation via PAC1R through both PKA- and tyrosine kinase Src-dependent pathways, and promotes the nuclear translocation of a fraction of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). In contrast, in the presence of glucose, PACAP potentiates the glucose-induced long-lasting ERK1/2 activation via a β-arrestin 1-dependent pathway in both INS-1E cells and pancreatic islets. In addition, activation of ERK1/2 through the β-arrestin 1-dependent pathway is involved in PACAP-induced insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) protein expression, which is crucial for β-cell function and survival. Materials—PACAP-(1–38) and VIP were from NeoMPS (Strasbourg, France). GLP-1-(7–36)-amide was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Cell culture media with additives were from Invitrogen. AG1478, H89, PP2 and its inactive analog PP3, PD98059, U0126, Proteases Inhibitors Mixture, and Fluorsave™ reagent were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Lipofectamine™ 2000, stealth siRNA™ double-stranded duplexes, random hexamer oligonucleotides, and MoMuLV-RT were from Invitrogen. All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pharmacological inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in incubation medium to a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO. Path-Detect CRE trans-Reporting system was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Enhanced Luciferase Assay kit was from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). BCA™ Protein Assay kit was from Pierce. Anti-Phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (p-ERK1/2) (which selectively recognizes the doubly phosphorylated active forms of these kinases), anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate, anti-α/β-tubulin, anti-IRS-2, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and RNAnow reagent were from Cell Signaling Technology (Ozyme, France). Anti-β-arrestin 1 and anti-ERK1 antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG and anti-β-arrestin 2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Animals—β-Arrestin 1 knockout (β-arr1 KO) mice were generated on C57BL/6 background as previously described (29Conner D.A. Mathier M.A. Mortensen R.M. Christe M. Vatner S.F. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) littermate controls were C57BL/6 mice (5 weeks old) purchased from Charles River, France. Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets were isolated from male mice (15–18 weeks old) by hand-picking after collagenase digestion of whole pancreas (5Jamen F. Puech R. Bockaert J. Brabet P. Bertrand G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, the pancreas was filled by injection of collagenase solution, excised, digested at 37 °C, and mechanically disrupted with a 14-gauge needle in cold PBS supplemented with 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose. After selection by hand-picking under a microscope, the islets were distributed in batches of 120–150 and preincubated for 2 h in a Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing (mm): NaCl, 120; KCl, 4.7; KH2PO4, 1.2; MgSO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.5; NaHCO3, 24, and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1.1 mm glucose. Batches were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB supplemented with 16.7 mm glucose with or without PACAP as described in the figure legends. Thereafter, islets were washed with cold PBS, frozen in N2 liquid, and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin) (16Dalle S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20345-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and lysed by sonication. INS-1E Cell Line Culture—INS-1E cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (11 mm glucose) containing, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described (30Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum. INS-1E cells (passages 72–90) at ∼70% confluency, were preincubated for 2 h in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) (30Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), with or without inhibitors. Afterward, cells were incubated in KRBH supplemented with different glucose concentrations and other test agents for various times as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then washed once with cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin) as described previously (16Dalle S.

Western Blotting—Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. Equal amounts of proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, separated through 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were probed with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Autoradiographs were digitized, and the band density was analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Silencing β-Arrestin 1 Expression Using RNA Interference—Three different 25-nucleotide stealth siRNA double-stranded duplexes were designed to specifically knock down rat β-arr1 expression. These siRNAs and a non-silencing RNA duplex (control siRNA), were used in deprotected and desalted forms. INS-1E cells were transiently transfected with 40 nm siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, INS-1E cells (400,000 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well/plates in antibiotic-free culture medium 1 day before transfection. Then at ∼40–50% confluency, cells were transfected in Opti-MEM with Stealth™ RNAi-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes. Six hours after transfection, medium was replaced with complete RPMI medium. All assays were performed at least 70 h after siRNA transfection. Subcellular Fractionation—After a 2-h preincubation in KRBH without glucose, INS-1E cells plated in 15-cm dishes (70–80% confluency) were stimulated, or not, with glucose and/or PACAP for 5 or 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, Proteases Inhibitors Mixture). After 15-min incubation, cells were Dounced 40 times on ice and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing cytosol and membranes were collected for protein determination before denaturation in Laemmli buffer and Western blot analysis by SDS-PAGE. Pellets containing nuclei were Dounced 30 times in Tris-buffered saline-sucrose/EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.02% Nonidet P-40, Proteases Inhibitors Mixture), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and pellets were rinsed twice in 1 ml of TSE buffer. Finally, pellets containing pure nuclei were dissolved in Tris-buffered saline-sucrose/EDTA buffer for protein determination before Western blot analysis by SDS-PAGE. Immunostaining for p-ERK1/2 in INS-1E Cells—INS-1E cells were grown on glass coverslips for 3 days until 50% confluency. After a 2-h preincubation in KRBH without glucose, cells were stimulated, or not, with glucose and/or PACAP. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with Tris-buffered saline-Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), permeabilized in methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, and washed twice. After incubation in blocking buffer (2% Donkey serum in Tris-buffered saline-Triton buffer), cells were incubated with the mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:400) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, for p-ERK1/2 antibody detection, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgGs (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, cells were incubated 15 min in Hoechst (1:2000) for nuclear staining, and then coverslips were mounted using Fluorsave™ reagent at least 24 h before observation with a dual-photon confocal microscope (Leica SP2). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—The transcriptional activity of CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) was evaluated using the PathDetect trans-reporting system, which consists in a fusion trans-activator plasmid expressing the activation domain of CREB fused with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain (pFA2-CREB) and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a synthetic promoter with five tandem repeats of GAL4 binding sites that control expression of the luciferase gene (pFR-Luc). Transient transfections in INS-1E cells were carried out using Lipofectamine™ 2000. Briefly, INS-1E cells (250,000 cells per well) were seeded in 12-well plates with antibiotic-free culture medium 1 day before transfection. Cells at ∼50–60% confluency were transfected in Opti-MEM with the reporter (pFR-Luc) and the fusion transactivator (pFA2-CREB) plasmids. After 6-h transfection, medium was replaced with complete culture medium. The following day, after 2 h of quiescence in glucose-free KRBH buffer with or without 10 μm U0126, transfected cells were incubated for 6 h as indicated in the legend of Fig. 7A. Following the treatment, cells were washed in PBS and harvested in active reporter lysis buffer for 15 min with shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were stored at -80 °C until luciferase activity assay and protein determinations. Luciferase activity was measured using the enhanced Luciferase Assay kit and the ANALYST™ fluorometer (Molecular Devices). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA method and used to normalize luciferase activity. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from INS-1E cells was extracted using RNAnow reagent and DNase-treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA was carried out using random hexamer oligonucleotides and MoMuLV-RT for reverse transcription. Real-time PCR amplification was performed in duplicate, using the 7500 System (Applied Biosystems) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: rArrb1, TGCGCCAGTATGCAGACATC/GGGCACTTGTACTGAGCTGTGT; rArrb2, TGTGCCTTCCGCTATGGC/CGGAAAGACAGGCCCAGTAC; Irs2, GAAGGGTGGATCTTCTTTGTATCTT/GAGAAAAGGCTTTTGCAATCTGA; Tbp, GTTGACCCACCAGCAGTTCAG/AATCCAGGAAATAATTCTGGCTCATA; B2M, CGTGCTTGCCATTCAGAAAA/GGATGGCGAGAGTACACTTGAATT; and Tubb2, CAAGGCTTTCCTGCACTGGT/AACTCCATCTCGTCCATGCC. The selection of the appropriate housekeeping genes was performed using geNorm (31Vandesompele, J., De Preter, K., Pattyn, F., Poppe, B., Van Roy, N., De Paepe, A., and Speleman F. (2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/7/research/0034Google Scholar). The level of expression of each gene X was normalized to the geometric mean of the expression levels of three housekeeping genes R (B2M, Tbp, and Tubb2) according to the formula, X/geometric mean (R1, R2, and R3) = 2(Ct(X)-arithmetic mean (Ct(R1),Ct(R2),Ct(R3)), where Ct is the threshold cycle. Expression of Data and Statistics—Data were presented as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between groups were assessed by Student's t test or by analysis of variance, followed by the Newman-Keuls test in the case of multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. PACAP via PAC1R Induces a Rapid and Transient Activation of ERK1/2 and Its Nuclear Translocation—To investigate the mechanism(s) by which PACAP activates ERK1/2, we assessed ERK1/2 phosphorylation status by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize only Thr-202/Tyr-204-phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the rat pancreatic β-cell line INS-1E. We firstly analyzed the effects of PACAP alone without glucose. PACAP (100 nm) alone induced a rapid, monophasic, and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that peaked at 5 min (by ∼3.5-fold increase) and returned to basal values within 20–30 min (Fig. 1A). Based on these results, we recorded the effect of PACAP at 5 min in the subsequent experiments. PACAP binds to PAC1Rs and VPACRs. To determine which receptor(s) mediated this stimulatory effect, we compared the effects of VIP and PACAP. PACAP (1p m to 10 nm) caused a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1B) with a maximal effect between 10 and 100 nm. In contrast, VIP (1 pm to 1 mm) was ineffective, which is consistent with the involvement of PAC1R alone in ERK1/2 activation. Spatiotemporal regulation of ERK1/2 activation plays an important role in determining the functions of these kinases (32Caunt C.J. Finch A.R. Sedgley K.R. McArdle C.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate the subcellular distribution of p-ERK1/2, subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence observed by confocal microscopy analysis were performed. In quiescent INS-1E cells, the majority of ERK1/2 was in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1C). However, there was a low but detectable amount of ERK2 in the nuclear fraction. Addition of PACAP induced an accumulation of both ERK1 and ERK2 in the nucleus and also an increase in p-ERK1/2 in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions suggesting a translocation to the nucleus of a fraction of the cytosolic p-ERK1/2. No effect of PACAP was observed at 30 min (data not shown). In addition, although quiescent INS-1E cells exhibited no staining for p-ERK1/2 (Fig. 1D), we found that ∼14 ± 3% of cells were responsive to PACAP and displayed p-ERK1/2 immunofluorescence in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Thus, PACAP induces transient ERK1/2 activation in both the cytosol and nucleus. PAC1R Transiently Activates ERK1/2 through MEKs, Gs/PKA, and Src kinase—ERK1 and ERK2 are phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204 by ERK1/2 kinases (MEK1/2). To determine the intracellular mechanisms involved in PACAP activation of ERK1/2, we first evaluated the role of the upstream kinases MEK1/2 by using two selective inhibitors, PD98059 (20 μm) and U0126 (10 μm). They completely abolished the PACAP effect on ERK1/2 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), indicating the involvement of the upstream MEK1/2 in the PACAP-induced ERK1/2 activation. On the other hand, it is known that [Ca2+]i is critical to mediate ERK1/2 activation in pancreatic β-cells by physiological stimuli, i.e. glucose and GLP-1 (13Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J.

Furthermore, PACAP has been shown to increase [Ca2+]i in a glucose-dependent manner via opening of the VDCCs (1Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol.

To determine whether Ca2+ played a role in PACAP-induced ERK1/2 activation, we used the VDCCs blocker, nifedipine.

https://openalex.org/W2029756629,"Calnexin is a Ca2+-binding transmembrane chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum that recognizes Glc1Man5–9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides on folding glycoproteins as well as non-native elements of the polypeptide backbone. This latter mode of recognition enables calnexin to suppress the aggregation of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated substrates. The luminal portion of calnexin (S-Cnx) consists of two domains, a globular lectin domain and an extended arm domain. To understand the function of these domains during the interaction of calnexin with non-native protein conformers, we tested deletion mutants of S-Cnx for their abilities to suppress the aggregation of nonglycosylated firefly luciferase. The arm domain alone exhibited no capacity to suppress aggregation. However, stepwise truncation of the arm domain in S-Cnx resulted in a progressive reduction in aggregation suppression potency to the point where the globular domain alone exhibited 25% potency. To characterize the polypeptide-binding site, we used hydrophobic peptides that were competitors of the ability of S-Cnx to suppress luciferase aggregation. Direct binding experiments revealed a single site of peptide binding in the globular domain (Kd = 0.9 μm) at a location distinct from the lectin site. Progressive truncation of the arm domain in S-Cnx had no effect on the binding of small peptides but reduced the binding affinity of S-Cnx for large, non-native protein substrates. Because protein substrates exhibited no binding to the isolated arm domain, our findings support a model in which calnexin suppresses aggregation through a polypeptide-binding site in its globular domain, with the arm domain enhancing aggregation suppression by sterically constraining large substrates.

As nascent proteins are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Cnx, calnexin; Crt, calreticulin; FL, firefly luciferase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; S-Cnx, soluble luminal domain of calnexin; R-CMLA, reduced and carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin. an ensemble of enzymes catalyzes a variety of co- and post-translational modifications, whereas molecular chaperones assist in protein folding as part of the ER quality control system (1Nunnari J. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 1992; 4: 573-580Google Scholar, 2Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 1999; 15: 799-842Google Scholar, 3Meacock S.L. Greenfield J.J. High S. Essays Biochem.. 2000; 36: 1-13Google Scholar). The quality control system also detects non-native protein conformers, retaining them until folding is completed or, if proper folding cannot be achieved, marking them for ER-associated degradation (4Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2003; 4: 181-191Google Scholar, 5Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2005; 21: 435-456Google Scholar, 6Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2003; 19: 649-676Google Scholar). One of the major chaperone systems in the ER consists of the type I membrane protein calnexin (Cnx) and its soluble paralog calreticulin (Crt). The ER luminal segment of Cnx consists of two domains, a globular lectin domain and an elongated arm domain (7Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar). The lectin domain confers specific binding to glycoproteins bearing Asn-linked oligosaccharides of the form Glc1Man5–9GlcNAc2 (8Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar, 9Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar). A 140-Å hairpin loop forms the arm domain, the tip of which includes the binding site for a thiol oxidoreductase termed ERp57 (8Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar, 10Pollock S. Kozlov G. Pelletier M.F. Trempe J.F. Jansen G. Sitnikov D. Bergeron J.J. Gehring K. Ekiel I. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 1020-1029Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that the recruitment of a reduced glycoprotein to the Cnx-ERp57 complex greatly enhances oxidative folding relative to ERp57 alone (11Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Google Scholar). Both the globular and arm domains have been shown to bind Ca2+ by overlay experiments (12Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy Jr., R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Google Scholar) but the crystal structure revealed only a single bound Ca2+ within the globular domain (7Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar). Although the complete structure of Crt has not been solved, an ∼39% overall sequence identity to Cnx, combined with conserved oligosaccharide binding specificity (13Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Google Scholar), a shorter but similar arm domain structure as determined by NMR (14Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Google Scholar), and conserved ERp57 association properties (15Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar) all suggest a similar overall structure for the two chaperones. Ca2+ also binds to the globular and arm domains of Crt (16Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Google Scholar), and this ion is important for stabilizing both chaperones (17Brockmeier A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 12906-12916Google Scholar, 18Li Z. Stafford W.F. Bouvier M. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 11193-11201Google Scholar). Cnx and Crt interact with folding glycoproteins via lectin-oligosaccharide interactions as well as through polypeptide-based recognition of non-native conformers (9Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar, 19Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell.. 1999; 4: 331-341Google Scholar). The lectin-oligosaccharide interaction is regulated by the availability of the terminal glucose on the Glc1Man5–9Glc-NAc2 oligosaccharides. Such monoglucosylated oligosaccharides are formed by the sequential action of glucosidases I and II on the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide that is initially added to nascent chains. Release of the oligosaccharide from Cnx or Crt occurs in conjunction with removal of the terminal glucose residue by the further action of glucosidase II. If folding of the glycoprotein does not occur promptly, the folding sensor UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosytransferase recognizes non-native conformers and reglucosylates N-glycans, thereby allowing re-entry into the chaperone cycle (22Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 46280-46285Google Scholar, 23Ritter C. Quirin K. Kowarik M. Helenius A. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1730-1738Google Scholar, 24Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 11: 128-134Google Scholar). Terminally folding-defective glycoproteins are further processed by demannosylation that diverts them from the cycle and into the ER-associated degradation disposal pathway (25Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Google Scholar). The polypeptide-binding site on Cnx and Crt permits them to function as classical chaperones capable of recognizing non-native features of protein folding intermediates and suppressing their aggregation. This function was initially uncovered through in vitro experiments that demonstrated that both Cnx and Crt can suppress the aggregation not only of glycoproteins bearing monoglycosylated oligosaccharides but that of nonglycosylated proteins as well (21Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 331-341Google Scholar, 26Culina S. Lauvau G. Gubler B. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 54210-54215Google Scholar, 27Rizvi S.M.

Aggregation suppression ability was enhanced in the presence of physiological ER Ca2+ concentrations as well as millimolar ATP, the latter causing an increased hydrophobic surface on the chaperones (17Brockmeier A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 12906-12916Google Scholar). Recent studies have validated the existence of functional polypeptide-based interactions between either Cnx or Crt and folding glycoproteins in living cells. Lectin-deficient mutants of Cnx were shown to interact with heavy chains of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in insect cells and to prevent their rapid degradation (30Leach M.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 9072-9079Google Scholar). Similarly, lectin-deficient Crt was found not only to interact with a broad spectrum of newly synthesized proteins and dissociate with normal kinetics, but it was also able to complement all MHC class I biosynthetic defects associated with Crt deficiency (31Ireland B.S. Brockmeier U. Howe C.M. Elliott T. Williams D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 2413-2423Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies are consistent with a model wherein Cnx and Crt associate with folding glycoproteins through both lectin- and polypeptide-based interactions thereby increasing the avidity of the association relative to either interaction alone (32Stronge V.S. Saito Y. Ihara Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 39779-39787Google Scholar). Binding of Cnx or Crt serves to prevent premature release of folding intermediates from the ER and promotes proper folding by suppressing off-pathway aggregation and by providing a privileged environment in which associated ERp57 promotes thiol oxidation and isomerization reactions (11Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Google Scholar, 33High S. Lecomte F.J. Russell S.J. Abell B.M. Oliver J.D. FEBS Lett.. 2000; 476: 38-41Google Scholar). Although the lectin sites of Cnx and Crt have been well defined through structural and mutagenesis studies (7Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar, 34Kapoor M. Ellgaard L. Gopalakrishnapai J. Schirra C. Gemma E. Oscarson S. Helenius A. Surolia A. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 97-106Google Scholar, 35Thomson S.P. Williams D.B. Cell Stress Chaperones.. 2005; 10: 242-251Google Scholar), less is known about the location and substrate specificity of the polypeptide-binding sites. Deletion mutagenesis of rabbit Crt as well as dog or yeast Cnx suggested that their abilities to suppress the aggregation of nonglycosylated proteins reside primarily within their globular domains (8Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar, 36Xu X. Azakami H. Kato A. FEBS Lett.. 2004; 570: 155-160Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro binding experiments with nonglycosylated proteins such as citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase have indicated that both chaperones interact preferentially with non-native conformers, suggesting that they act as folding sensors in addition to the role provided by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosytransferase (21Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 331-341Google Scholar, 28Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Google Scholar). To characterize the specificity of the polypeptide-binding site of Crt, Houen and co-workers (37Sandhu N. Duus K. Jorgensen C.S. Hansen P.R. Bruun S.W. Pedersen L.O. Hojrup P. Houen G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1774: 701-713Google Scholar, 38Duus K. Hansen P.R. Houen G. Protein Pept. Lett.. 2008; 15: 103-107Google Scholar) examined an extensive panel of peptides for their binding to Crt using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Peptide binding required a minimum peptide length of five residues that were hydrophobic in character. In another study, a hydrophobic Crt-binding peptide was shown to compete with the ability of Crt to suppress the thermally induced aggregation of a soluble MHC class I molecule (27Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 913-923Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings are consistent with the presence of a site on Cnx and Crt that recognizes non-native protein conformers and that, in the case of Crt, exhibits specificity for hydrophobic peptide segments. However, the preceding experiments were performed either in the absence of Ca2+ or at temperatures ranging from 45 to 50 °C. Given the role for Ca2+ in stabilizing these chaperones as well as their relatively low melting temperature, Crt Tm = 46.4 °C (18Li Z. Stafford W.F. Bouvier M. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 11193-11201Google Scholar) and Cnx Tm = 49.5 °C (17Brockmeier A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 12906-12916Google Scholar), it is possible that the observed polypeptide-based interactions were influenced by partial unfolding of the chaperones. Given these limitations and the fact that there have been no reports examining the nature of the polypeptide-binding site of Cnx, we decided to investigate the location and characteristics of the polypeptide-binding function of Cnx under physiological conditions of the ER lumen. Using a recently developed assay in which the soluble ER luminal domain of Cnx (S-Cnx) suppresses the aggregation of nonglycosylated firefly luciferase at 37 °C and 0.4 mm Ca2+ (17Brockmeier A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 12906-12916Google Scholar), we show that this aggregation suppression function resides within the globular lectin domain but is enhanced by the presence of the full-length arm domain. The site in the globular domain responsible for aggregation suppression is distinct from the lectin site and is capable of binding hydrophobic peptides with micromolar affinity. Furthermore, binding studies with peptides and non-native proteins of increasing size revealed that the arm domain contributes to the aggregation suppression function of S-Cnx not through direct substrate binding but rather by sterically constraining large polypeptide chains. Materials—The 6KSGG peptide (KKKKKKSGGSGGSGGSC) with an amidated C terminus was purchased from GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). The 6KAAW peptide (KKKKKKAAWAAWAAWAA) and the KHP peptide (KHPYAYLAAAIAAEVAGTTALKLSK), corresponding to the first transmembrane helix (residues 2–24) of the Halobacterium salinarum protein Hsmr, were a generous gift from Dr. Charles Deber, SickKids, Toronto, Canada. The YSN peptide (YSNENMETM) was synthesized by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Alberta). All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. The G1M3 oligosaccharide (Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Man-OH) was purchased from the Alberta Research Council (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Mutagenesis of Calnexin cDNA—Amino acid numbering refers to the canine Cnx sequence with residue 1 corresponding to the first residue following signal cleavage. Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. The soluble ER luminal domain of canine calnexin (S-Cnx, residues 1–461) and its globular domain (residues 1–255/390–461) were each amplified in standard PCRs with primer pair S-Cnx-forward/S-Cnx-reverse using as templates the previously generated glutathione S-transferase fusion constructs, pGEX-3X S-Cnx-His6 (21Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 331-341Google Scholar) and pGEX-3X CNX 1–255/390–461 (8Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar), respectively. The latter construct contains a GSGSG linker between residues 255 and 390. The arm domain (arm, residues 256–389) was synthesized in a standard PCR with the primer pair arm-forward/arm-reverse using pET15b-Tev-S-Cnx as the template (see below). To generate two variants of S-Cnx with a truncated arm domain, Δarm1 (Δamino acids 315–334) and Δarm2 (Δamino acids 309–347), an overlap extension PCR (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.).. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) was performed. In both cases, plasmid pET15b-Tev-S-Cnx was used as the template in the first round of PCRs. For construct Δarm1, a 975- and a 420-bp DNA fragment were amplified with primer pairs S-Cnx-forward/Δarm1-reverse and Δarm1-forward/S-Cnx-reverse, respectively. For construct Δarm2, a 958- and a 381-bp DNA fragment were amplified with primer pairs S-Cnx-forward/Δarm2-reverse and Δarm2-forward/S-Cnx-reverse, respectively. After purification, the synthesized DNA fragments were used in equimolar amounts as the template in a second PCR to amplify the complete constructs using the primer pair S-Cnx-forward/S-Cnx-reverse. The mutagenic PCR primers for both the Δarm1 and Δarm2 constructs introduced a GSG linker at the site of truncation (Table 1). To generate a lectin-deficient mutant of S-Cnx (LD-S-Cnx), an overlap extension PCR was performed to introduce the amino acid exchanges Y166A, M169A, and I184A into the lectin site of S-Cnx. In the first round of PCRs, plasmid pET15b-Tev-S-Cnx was used as the template. A 577- and a 919-bp DNA fragment were amplified with primer pairs S-Cnx-forward/LD-S-Cnx-reverse and LD-S-Cnx-forward/S-Cnx-reverse, respectively. After purification, the synthesized DNA fragments were used in equimolar amounts as the template in a second PCR to amplify the complete constructs using the primer pair S-Cnx-forward/S-Cnx-reverse. All generated PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and subsequently ligated into the expression vector pET15b-Tev, a modified pET15b vector (Novagen) carrying a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site after the N-terminal His6 tag. The integrity of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyPrimerSequence 5′ → 3′ModificationsS-Cnx-forwardatatataatcatatgctgaaggacatgtgatgatatgNdeIS-Cnx-reverseatatatgatccttacccgggcgctcctagctgcctcBamHI, Stoparm-forwardatatataatcatatgatgaggacccagagaccagaagNdeIarm-reverseatatatgatccttagaatccggatttgtatcttccBamHI, StopΔarm1-forwardgtacctgtggtagtggacagatcgccaacctaagtgtGly-Ser-Gly linkerΔarm1-reverseggcgatcgtccactaccatcaggtacatttcgggttcGly-Ser-Gly linkerΔarm2-forwardgatgatgaggtagtggaggtgtctggcacgacctatgGly-Ser-Gly linkerΔarm2-reverseccagacactccactaccttcatcatctaccagccatcGly-Ser-Gly linkerLD-S-Cnx-forwardcaagaccctgccacgatgcctttggtcagataaatgtggagagactataagcttcac ttcgcctccgccacaaaaccccY166A, M169A, HindIII, I184ALD-S-Cnx-reversegtggcggaggcgaagtaagcttatagtttctccacatttatcggaccaaaggcaat cgtggcggggtcttgcgtggaactI184A, HindIII, M169A, Y166A Open table in a new tab Purification of S-Cnx and Deletion Mutants—The soluble ER luminal portion of Cnx or its various deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus cells (Stratagene) following induction with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were lysed by French press at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CaCl2 containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the hexahistidine-tagged S-Cnx construct was loaded onto a nickel-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). Subsequent washing steps and the final elution of the recombinant protein with 250 mm imidazole were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CaCl2 and subjected to further purification by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) applying a linear 200-ml NaCl gradient (0.05–1 m) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 3 mm CaCl2. S-Cnx and its deletion mutants eluted between 0.35 and 0.5 m NaCl and were judged to be greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. After a final dialysis against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The following average yields were obtained for the various S-Cnx constructs from 2 liters of bacterial culture: S-Cnx, 20 mg; Δarm1, 22 mg; Δarm2, 19 mg; globular domain, 5 mg; arm, 34 mg; LD-S-Cnx, 20 mg. Aggregation Assay—Aliquots of recombinant firefly luciferase (FL) (Promega) were stored at –70 °C at a concentration of 226 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% glycerol and were thawed only once directly before use. The various S-Cnx constructs were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2 with or without peptides (20 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. FL was then added to a final concentration of 3 μm in a total volume of 150 μl. Aggregation was measured over a period of 1 h at 37 °C by monitoring light scattering at 360 nm in a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. Absorbance readings were recorded every 6 s using a Shimadzu 1601 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence Experiments—Intrinsic fluorescence of S-Cnx constructs (0.8 μm) was measured with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of various peptides (20 μm) after an equilibration period of 1 h at 37 °C. For the titration of the various peptides against S-Cnx or the Δarm2 variant, samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min between the respective titration steps. Fluorescence spectra were recorded from 290 to 390 nm at 37 °C using a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission slit widths set to 2 and 5 nm, respectively. All fluorescence measurements were corrected by subtracting the contribution of the respective peptide to fluorescence intensity. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Reaction mixtures for CD measurements contained S-Cnx or S-Cnx deletion mutants (1.81 μm) in 2.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.4 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of various peptides (20 μm). Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 37 °C prior to measuring spectra between 200 and 260 nm. For thermal denaturation experiments, S-Cnx or its deletion mutants (7.24 μm) were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and either 1.0 or 1.4 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Thermal denaturation curves were recorded from 20 to 70 °C at 231 nm with a scan rate of 2 °C/min. Assuming a two-state transition process, the thermal denaturation data were fit to a standard equation by nonlinear least squares regression using SigmaPlot 2004 version 9.0. The calculated Tm value represents the transition midpoint temperature of the thermal unfolding. All CD experiments were measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco PTC-423S temperature controlling unit in a 1-mm path length cuvette. The results are expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity (Θ) with units of degrees cm2 dmol–1. In the case of samples containing both S-Cnx and peptide, the obtained spectra were corrected by subtracting the contribution of the peptide alone. Peptide Radioiodination and Binding Assay—KHP peptide was radioiodinated by adding 173 μm KHP peptide to 1 mCi of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 110 μm chloramine T in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 90 μl. The sample was mixed for 15 s at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 110 μl of 36 mm Na2S2O5 and 16.4 mm KI in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Thin layer chromatography and γ counting of separated peptide revealed 61% of input radioactivity incorporated into the peptide resulting in a specific activity of 39.7 mCi/μmol peptide. The radioiodination mixture was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak column (Millipore) and was washed with 25 ml of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and subsequently with 10 ml of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% acetonitrile to remove unbound Na123I. The radioiodinated peptide was eluted with 2 ml of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile, vacuum dried, and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2. To analyze the interaction between S-Cnx and KHP peptide, the various His6-tagged S-Cnx constructs (5 μm) and the 125I-KHP peptide (1 μm) were incubated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of unlabeled KHP peptide (20 μm) or G1M3 oligosaccharide (20 μm) in an 80-μl reaction volume for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then applied to Mini-Spin Columns (Pierce) containing 15 μl of nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2. Proteins were allowed to bind to the beads for 1 h at 37 °C before removing unbound peptides by centrifugation for 30 s at 730 × g. The beads were washed twice rapidly with 300 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm CaCl2, and bound proteins were eluted with 200 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, and 250 mm imidazole. The amount of radioiodinated KHP peptide that remained bound to the various S-Cnx constructs in the eluates was quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1470 γ counter. To control for nonspecific peptide binding to nickel-agarose beads, separate incubations lacking S-Cnx were performed, and radioactive peptide eluted from the beads was subtracted from the values obtained with the complete incubations. Typically, ∼130,000 cpm of peptide was specifically bound to S-Cnx. Reduction and Carboxymethylation of α-Lactalbumin—Bovine α-lactalbumin (500 μm, Sigma) was reduced and carboxymethylated (R-CMLA) as described previously except that guanidinium chloride was not included (40Bosl B. Grimminger V. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 38170-38176Google Scholar). R-CMLA was dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assays—Real time binding between S-Cnx and non-native protein conformers was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using a Biacore X instrument (Biacore AB Corp., Uppsala, Sweden). Recombinant firefly luciferase or reduced, carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin were covalently immobilized to the activated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer at 1 pH unit below the pI of the respective protein according to the standard amine coupling procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Binding of S-Cnx and deletion mutants to FL and R-CMLA were conducted at 30 and at 25 °C, respectively, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Prior to the experiment, S-Cnx constructs were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (Biacore) for 1 h at the respective temperature. Complex association was monitored for 1 min followed by a 2-min dissociation phase in the same buffer before the surface was regenerated with 50% ethylene glycol, pH 8.5. Domain Contributions to the Aggregation Suppression Function of Calnexin—To localize the polypeptide-binding site of S-Cnx within the context of its arm and globular domains, we generated the various deletion mutants depicted in Fig. 1 and compared their abilities to suppress the aggregation of FL under physiological conditions of the ER lumen. Before undertaking the aggregation suppression assays, the structural integrity of the var"

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho, contains an RGS homology (RH) domain and Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) domains and acts both as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and an effector for Gα13. However, the molecular mechanism of LARG activation upon Gα13 binding is not yet well understood. In this study, we analyzed the Gα13-LARG interaction using cellular and biochemical methods, including a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The results obtained using various LARG fragments demonstrated that active Gα13 interacts with LARG through the RH domain, DH/PH domains, and C-terminal region. However, an alanine substitution at the RH domain contact position in Gα13 resulted in a large decrease in affinity. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that binding of Gα13 proceeds with a large negative heat capacity change (ΔCp°), accompanied by a positive entropy change (ΔS°). These results likely indicate that the binding of Gα13 with the RH domain triggers conformational rearrangements between Gα13 and LARG burying an exposed hydrophobic surface to create a large complementary interface, which facilitates complex formation through both GAP and effector interfaces, and activates the RhoGEF. We propose that LARG activation is regulated by an induced-fit mechanism through the GAP interface of Gα13.

In the current model, the ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα subunits (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Upon activation, three switch regions in the Gα subunit undergo significant conformational changes, followed by dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα subunit from the Gβγ subunits. Both Gα-GTP and free Gβγ interact with diverse downstream effectors to transmit intracellular signals. The Gα subunit hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP by its intrinsic GTPase activity. This deactivation process is further accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 3Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gα-GDP dissociates from effectors and re-associates with Gβγ to terminate the signal. Although this model explains the basic concept of G protein signaling, the molecular dynamics of interactions among GPCR, G protein, RGS protein, and effector during the signaling process is not well understood. It has been suggested that the GPCR signals are integrated into the intracellular signaling network at the level of G proteins (4Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the Gα subunit acts as the core of the signaling complex at the membrane, which is formed through the transient protein-protein interactions of multiple signaling components (5Bhattacharyya R. Wedegaertner P.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 709-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wells C.D. Gutowski S. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28897-28905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the quantitative analysis of the dynamic molecular interactions in the GPCR signaling complex will be crucial to understanding various cellular processes. Gα12 and Gα13 subunits have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of Rho GTPase through RhoGEFs, which contain an N-terminal RGS homology domain (RH-RhoGEFs) (7Chen Z. Singer W.D. Sternweis P.C.

RH-RhoGEFs, which consist of p115RhoGEF/Lsc, PDZ-Rho-GEF/GTRAP48, and LARG in mammalian species, directly link the activation of GPCRs by extracellular ligands to the regulation of Rho activity in cells (10Fukuhara S.

All three RH-RhoGEFs contain an N-terminal RH domain, which specifically recognizes the active form of Gα12 or Gα13 and central DH/PH domains characteristic of GEFs for Rho GTPases. It has been demonstrated in vitro that LARG and p115RhoGEF serve as specific GAPs for Gα12/13 through their RH domains and also as their effectors to regulate Rho GTPase activation (11Hart M.J.

A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A structural study has demonstrated that the interface of the RH domain of p115RhoGEFs and a Gα13/i1 chimera is different from that of the RGS domain of RGS4 and Gαi1 (7Chen Z. Singer W.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The N-terminal small element in the RH domain, which is required for GAP activity toward Gα13, contacts the switch regions and the helical domain of the Gα13/i1 chimera. The core module of the p115RhoGEF RH domain binds to the region of Gα13/i1, which is conventionally used for effector binding. These results suggest roles for the RH domain in the stimulation of GEF activity by Gα13 in addition to GAP activity. On the other hand, several studies have also indicated that regions outside of RH domain of RH-RhoGEFs, particularly the DH/PH domains, interact directly with activated Gα13 (11Hart M.J. Jiang X.

Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated recently that p115RhoGEF interacts with distinct surfaces of Gα13 for the GAP reaction or GEF activity regulation (16Kreutz B. Hajicek N. Yau D.M. Nakamura S. Kozasa T. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of LARG activation upon Gα13 binding is not clearly understood. In this study, we have developed a quantitative method for the kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of Gα13-effector interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with sensor chips on which Gα13 was immobilized. We examined the kinetics and thermodynamics of the Gα13-LARG interaction and assessed LARG activation using both in vitro and cell-based approaches. We present evidence that, in addition to the interaction with the RH domain, the DH/PH domains and C-terminal region of LARG also interact with Gα13 to form the high affinity Gα13-LARG complex and activate RhoGEF activity. We further propose that LARG adopts the active conformation using an induced-fit mechanism through association with the GAP interface of Gα13. A similar mechanism may also be used with other Gα-effector interactions. Construction of Plasmids—Human LARG cDNA (NM 015313), mouse Gα13 cDNA (NM 010303), and human p115RhoGEF (NM004706) were used in this study. Full-length LARG (FL-LARG) (aa 1–1544), LARG-RDPC (aa 307–1544), LARG-DPC (aa 617–1544), LARG-RDP (aa 307–1146), LARG-PDZ (aa 1–188), LARG-RH (aa 318–625), LARG-DH/PH (aa 607–1146), LARG-C (aa 1305–1544), PDZ-RhoGEF, FL-p115 (aa 1–912), and p115-RH (aa 1–252) were subcloned into the pcDNA-myc vector with an N-terminal myc tag (Fig. 1A). cDNAs encoding the wild-type Gα13WT and the constitutively active Gα13Q226L (Gα13QL) mutant were subcloned into the pCMV5 vector. The Gα13K204A (Gα13KA) and Gα13K204A/Q226L (Gα13KA/QL) point mutants were generated in Gα13WT or Gα13Q226L, respectively, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described previously (Stratagene) (15Nakamura S. Kreutz B. Tanabe S. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the human V14RhoA mutant was subcloned into the pCMV5-FLAG vector and used for cell-based assays. Expression and Purification of Proteins—FL-LARG, LARG-RDPC, LARG-DPC, LARG-RDP, LARG-DH/PH, LARG-RH, LARG-C, and LARG-PDZ constructs were subcloned into the pFastBacHT transfer vector with a six-histidine tag at the N terminus (Invitrogen), and their recombinant baculoviruses were generated. Recombinant Gα13 wild-type (Gα13WT), His6-geranylgeranylated RhoA (gg-RhoA), and His6-LARG proteins were purified using the Sf9-baculovirus expression system as described before (17Tanabe S. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). His6-Gαi/13 or -Gαi/13K204A chimeric protein, with the N-terminal coding region of rat Gαi1 (residues 1–28), and the backbone of Gα13WT or Gα13K204A (residues 47–377) were purified from Sf9 cells as described (9Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This substitution of the N-terminal helix of Gαi1 for the corresponding region of Gα13 has been shown to facilitate the production of functional protein retaining the specific biochemical properties of wild-type Gα13. For SPR assays, the His6 tags of LARG, Gαi/13, and Gαi/13KA were removed by digestion with tobacco etch virus protease for 8 h at 4 °C. SPR Assays—SPR measurements were carried out using a Biacore 3000 and a Biacore T100. Gαi/13 and Gαi/13KA proteins were immobilized on parallel channels of the Biacore sensor chip CM5 using amine coupling chemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol. The coupling reactions were performed at 5 μl/min at 25 °C using Running Buffer AMF (-) (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 [micro]M AlCl3, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF). All flow cell surfaces were activated by a 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxy-succinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide for 7 min, followed by injection of Gαi/13 or Gαi/13KA diluted to 10 μg/ml in Ligand Dilution Buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) to a density of ∼4000 relative units. Residual binding sites on the surface were blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine. Kinetic binding analysis was performed at 15 °C. Immobilized Gαi/13 or Gαi/13KA on a biosensor chip, which was in an inactive form in the absence of AMF (30 μm AlCl3/10 mm MgCl2/10 mm NaF), was activated by AMF in running buffer. Samples of serially diluted LARG proteins at five to six steps were injected over the inactivated or activated Gαi/13 and Gαi/13KA surfaces using Running Buffer AMF (-) or Running Buffer AMF (+) (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 30 μm AlCl3) and reference flow cells at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 1 min followed by 2-min dissociation using KINJECT mode. The sensor surfaces were regenerated by the injection of Regeneration Buffer (1 n NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) after each binding cycle. All data were corrected for nonspecific binding and buffer shifts by double subtracting binding responses collected from a blank reference cell and a buffer injection over a Gαi/13 or Gαi/13KA immobilized flow cell. Data were fitted to a simultaneous ka/kd, 1:1 binding, and Global fitting using the BIAe-valuation program. Kinetic analyses were not performed when the responses were <1/10 compared with those with Gαi/13 in the presence of AMF. The experiments were performed more than four times. Thermodynamic experiments were done at a range of temperatures from 7 °C to 15 °C in 2° increments. Six different concentrations of LARG proteins were used for each temperature. Thermodynamic Data Analysis—At an equilibrium state, the thermodynamic parameters, ΔH° (enthalpy change), ΔS° (entropy change), ΔG° (free energy change), and ΔCp° (heat capacity change) were derived from the van't Hoff equation, which states that ΔG° =ΔH° - TΔS° = RTlnKD, by measuring the temperature dependence of KD (equilibrium constant). Such parameters determined by the van't Hoff method are demonstrated to agree with those determined directly using calorimetry (18Horn J.R. Russell D. Lewis E.A. Murphy K.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Krogsgaard M. Prado N. Adams E.J. He X.L. Chow D.C. Wilson D.B. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Mol.

If ΔH and ΔS have significant temperature dependence and ΔCp was assumed to be independent of temperature over a short temperature range, the relationship between the parameters becomes,RTInKD=ΔHT0o-TΔST0o+ΔCpo(T-T0)-TΔCpoln(T/T0)(Eq. 1) with T0 defined as the reference temperature (25 °C). The thermodynamic parameters in this study were calculated by fitting the data to Equation 1 using BiacoreT100 software. For thermodynamic analysis of a transition state, the Eyring theory was employed (21Roos H. Karlsson R. Nilshans H. Persson A. J. Mol. Recognit. 1998; 11: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar),ln(k/T)=-ΔGo†/RT+ln(kB/h¯)=ΔSo†/R-ΔHo†/RT+ln(kB/h¯)(Eq. 2) where the ‡ symbol denotes the transition state, k is the association or dissociation constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and [tserbian] is the Planck constant. According to Equation 2, the thermodynamic parameters at association and dissociation were calculated by linear fitting by measuring ka and kd at several temperatures using BiacoreT100 software. Binding of LARG Proteins with His-Gαi/13 Immobilized on Ni-NTA-Agarose—COS1 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine PLUS reagent with the indicated LARG constructs: myc-LARG-DPC (8 μg) and myc-RH (4 μg). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were lysed with 650 ml of 1.25 × lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/150 mm NaCl/1% Nonidet P-40/0.5 mm EDTA/9.8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol/10 mm β-glycerophosphate/10 mm Na3VO4/10 mm MgCl2/100 μm ATP/30 μm GDP/protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Equal amounts of supernatants were separated and incubated with 1.4 μg of His-Gαi/13 immobilized on 5 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads in 1 × lysis buffer B with or without AMF for 60 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were washed three times 1 × lysis buffer B with or without AMF. The relative amount of LARG fragments bound to the activated- or deactivated-Gαi/13 was visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc antibody. Statistical Analysis—Data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of the difference was assigned based on results of Student's t test (Figs. 2C and 3D), or analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test (Fig. 3b) (*, p < 0.05).

Direct Interaction of LARG with Gα13 through Its RH Domain, DH/PH Domains, and C-terminal Region—We first examined the ability of several deletion constructs of LARG to interact with Gα13 by co-immunoprecipitation using COS1 cells that were transiently transfected with myc-tagged LARG mutants and Gα13 (Fig. 1, A and B). As previously reported, LARG-RDPC and LARG-RH, which contain the RH domain, preferentially bound to AMF-activated Gα13, whose conformation resembles that of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (15Nakamura S. Kreutz B. Tanabe S. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Gα13 also co-immunoprecipitated with LARG constructs without the RH domain: LARG-DPC, LARG-DH/PH, and LARG-C. Although the amount of co-immunoprecipitated Gα13 was much lower than with LARG-RDPC or LARG-RH, the interaction with these LARG fragments was still dependent on activation of Gα13. We reproducibly observed a small but significant increase in the amount of precipitated Gα13 with LARG-C in response to Gα13 activation. These results suggested that LARG might also interact with activated Gα13 through the DH/PH domains and/or C-terminal region. We thus examined the direct interaction between LARG and Gα13 using an SPR method. We have recently constructed a Gαi/13 chimera by substituting the N-terminal α1 helix of Gαi1 for the corresponding region of Gα13 and demonstrated that this Gαi/13 protein purified by an Sf9-baculovirus expression system retains the same biochemical properties as wild-type Gα13 for binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides, activation of RH-RhoGEFs, and GAP response (9Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). For the SPR analysis, Gαi/13 was immobilized on the biosensor chip by amine coupling. The interaction of LARG fragments with Gαi/13 on the sensor chip was analyzed by Biacore3000. An advantage of this method is that the affinity difference of an effector for the active or inactive Gα13 can be quantitatively analyzed by the addition or exclusion of AMF in buffer on the same Gαi/13 chip. For the kinetic analysis, the concentrations of LARG fragments as analytes were different for each construct. Thus, it should be noted that we cannot evaluate the binding affinity between different LARG proteins by comparing the amplitudes of the SPR responses. Consistent with the cellular assays, the SRP assay clearly demonstrated that LARG-RH, LARG-DH/PH, and LARG-C preferentially interact with the active form of Gαi/13 (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Because FL-LARG was sensitive to degradation during the assay, we exploited LARG-RDPC instead of FL-LARG for further analysis. LARG-RDPC showed kinetic parameters similar to FL-LARG in the presence of ALF4-. For LARG-FL versus LARG-RDPC: ka (association rate constant) = 6.0 × 105 versus 4.4 × 105 m-1 s-1, kd (dissociation rate constant) = 8.1 × 10-4 versus 3.0 × 10-4 s-1, and KD (the equilibrium dissociation constant) = 1.4 × 10-9 versus 6.8 × 10-10 m.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of LARG mutants binding to Gαi/13 or Gαi/13KA ka, association rate constant; kd, dissociation rate constant; KD = kd/ka, equilibrium constant.

This suggests that the DH/PH domains and the C-terminal region of LARG may contribute to forming the high affinity Gαi/13-LARG complex together with the RH domain. In particular, the C-terminal region of LARG greatly decreased the rate of dissociation of the Gαi/13-LARG complex. In the presence of the C-terminal region, kd was reduced by >5-fold (Table 1). We have previously demonstrated that the mutation of lysine 204 to alanine in the switch I region of Gα13 significantly reduces its affinity for LARG and its sensitivity to the GAP activity of LARG (8Tesmer V.M. Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of the RH domain in the Gα13-LARG interaction, we compared the binding kinetics of LARG fragments with Gαi/13KA and Gαi/13, which are immobilized on separate channels of the same biosensor chip (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Consistent with our previous result, the binding of LARG-RH to Gαi/13 was abolished by the K204A mutation. In contrast, the interaction of LARG-DH/PH or LARG-DPC with Gαi/13 was not affected by the K204A mutation (Table 1). These results indicate the existence of an interaction between Gα13 and the DH/PH domains. It is also important to note that the KA mutation in Gα13 significantly reduced the affinity for LARG fragments containing the RH domain but did not change the affinity for LARG-DH/PH and LARG-DPC. Thus, the initial association of the RH domain with Gα13 might be necessary to induce the proper conformational change in LARG to form a high affinity complex with Gα13. Stimulation of the RhoGEF Activity of LARG through Direct Interaction between the DH/PH Domains and Gα13—We next examined whether the interaction of Gα13 with the DH/PH domains of LARG induces RhoGEF activation. First, we co-expressed LARG mutants lacking the RH domain with a constitutively active, GTPase-deficient mutant of Gα13 (Gα13Q226L) in HeLa cells and assayed SRF activation of the cell lysates as an indicator of Rho activation. The SRF activity of cell lysates expressing LARG-DH/PH or LARG-DPC was further stimulated in the presence of Gα13QL similar to LARG-RDPC (Fig. 2A). The immunoblot of the transfected cell lysates showed similar ex"

When other positively charged surface residues of TAFI (Lys-133, Lys-211, Lys-212, Arg-220, Lys-240, or Arg-275) were mutated to alanine, the catalytic efficiencies for TAFI activation with TM decreased by 1.7–2.7-fold.

TAFIa also can inactivate pro-inflammatory mediators such as the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, as well as bradykinin by hydrolysis of their C-terminal arginine, thereby reducing their pro-inflammatory effects (7Campbell W.

Although IIa at the high level generated after clotting via the factor XI-dependent pathway can activate sufficient TAFI to suppress fibrinolysis (16Wang W. Nagashima M. Schneider M. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22942-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), IIa by itself is a relatively weak activator because this activation is very inefficient (Km = 2.14 ± 0.59 μm; kcat = 0.0021 ± 0.0004 s-1) (14Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). When IIa binds to TM and forms a complex, however, the catalytic efficiency of TAFI activation increases by 1250-fold, which occurs almost exclusively through an increase in kcat (Km = 1.01 ± 0.09 μm; kcat = 1.24 ± 0.06 s-1). Thus, the IIa-TM complex is probably the physiological activator of TAFI (14Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

TM consists of 10 structural elements: a N-terminal domain homologous to the family of C-type lectins (residues 1–226), six tandem epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains joined by small interdomain peptides (residues 227–462), a serine/threonine-rich domain (residues 463–497), a transmembrane domain (residues 498–521), and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 522–559) (1Esmon C.T.

EGF 5 and part of EGF 6 bind to a cluster of lysine and arginine residues of anion-binding exosite-I on IIa. This prevents binding between IIa and its procoagulant substrates, such as fibrinogen (20Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W.

Although thrombin binds exclusively to the EGF-like domains 5 and 6, this is not sufficient to stimulate the activation of TAFI (16Wang W. Nagashima M. Schneider M. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22942-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, Schneider et al. (23Schneider M. Nagashima M. Knappe S. Zhao L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9944-9951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that the TM dependence of TAFI activation is not determined by residues occupying the P6-P3′ positions of TAFI. To further understand the structural basis for the activity of the IIa-TM complex in TAFI activation, we generated a structure model of the TAFI-IIa-TM EGF-like domains 4–5-6 complex. From this model, two positively charged surface patches on TAFI which could complement the key negatively charged residues near the N terminus of EGF-like domain 4 (Asp-341, Glu-343, and Asp-349) were identified. One region consists of residues Lys-133, Lys-211, Lys-212, and Arg-220. Further away is another positively charged surface patch comprising residues Lys-240 and Arg-275. An additional positive surface patch consists of the three-lysine residues K42/43/44 unique to the TAFI activation peptide. In this study, we constructed seven TAFI mutants in order to determine whether some or all of the positively charged residues referred to above are required in TAFI activation. We then determined the kinetics of activation by IIa for each mutant and wild-type TAFI in the presence or absence of TM. We also determined the thermal stability of TAFIa for each mutant and wild-type. The results indicate that all mutations decrease activation efficiency of TAFI, but none influence the thermal stability of TAFIa.

Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and the mammalian expression vector pNUT were kindly provided by Dr. Ross MacGillivray (University of British Columbia). Newborn calf serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) (DMEM/F-12), Opti-MEM, penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone mixture (PSF) were from Invitrogen. Methotrexate (Mayne Pharma Inc., Montreal, Canada) was purchased at Kingston General Hospital. Thrombin was prepared as described previously (24Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was a generous gift from Dr. Henning Brohmann (Paion, GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Antibodies for the TAFI ELISA were purchased from Affinity Biologicals Inc. (Ancaster, Ontario). The mouse-anti-human TAFI monoclonal antibody mAb16 was prepared as described previously (25Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse-anti-human TAFI monoclonal antibodies (MA-T12D11, MA-T3D8, and MA-T18A8) were prepared as described previously (26Gils A. Alessi M.C. Brouwers E. Peeters M. Marx P. Leurs J. Bouma B. Hendriks D. Juhan-Vague I. Declerck P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Structure Model of TAFI-IIa-TM-EGF 456 Complex-The homology model of TAFI was initially built based on the high resolution structure of human procarboxypeptidase B (CPB) (structure ID PDB1KWM, 1.6 Å), using Modeler (Accelrys, 2005). The loop involving the cleavage site between the activation peptide and catalytic domain was built based on the homologous loop of the bovine procarboxypeptidase A (CPA) structure that is in complex with chymotrypsinogen C (PDB1PYT, 2.35 Å). Based on this structural complex and the structure of IIa in complex with TM (PDB1DX5, 2.3 Å), the ternary complex of the TAFI, IIa, and the 4th to 6th EGF-like domains of TM was built. The backbone atoms of the TAFI model were initially superimposed onto those of the CPA structure from the complex, and then the catalytic triad of IIa was superimposed onto those of the chymotrypsinogen C. From this model, positively charged residues on the surface of TAFI that could complement the negatively charged residues on the C-loop of TM-EGF3 were identified for further study. Construction of TAFI Variant Plasmids-The plasmid pBluescript (SK+) vector containing full-length human TAFI cDNA (27Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was used to construct all of the TAFI mutants. Mutations were introduced into the plasmid coding for wild-type TAFI cDNA using a QuikChange Mutagenesis kit. A pair of primers was used to construct each of the 7 mutants: 1) Lys to Ala at position 133 (TAFI-K133A), 2) Lys to Ala at position 211 (TAFI-K211A), 3) Lys to Ala at position 212 (TAFI-K212A), 4) Arg to Ala at position 220 (TAFI-R220A), 5) Lys to Ala at position 240 (TAFI-K240A), 6) Arg to Ala at position 275 (TAFI-R275A), and 7) three consecutive Lys to Ala mutations at positions 42, 43, and 44 (TAFI-K42/43/44A). The triple mutant TAFI-K42/43/44A was constructed by three steps, in which single sequential mutations were made, using a new construct as the template for the next mutation. The plasmids for each mutant were verified by DNA sequencing. All of the numbers used to designate the various derivatives are based on the TAFI amino acid sequence numbering (9Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The newly constructed TAFI derivative cDNAs were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pNUT as described previously (27Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The proper orientation of the construct was confirmed by EcoRI digestion, which yielded a fragment of ∼1850 bp for the forward orientation or a fragment of ∼650 bp for the reverse orientation. Transfection and Expression of TAFI Variants-Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (NCS) in a 37 °C incubator. TAFI-pNUT plasmids expressing mutants and wild-type were transfected into BHK cells using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar, 29Wu C. Wu F. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25847-25852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Eight hours later, the cells were washed and fed with fresh DMEM/F-12 containing 5% NCS. The cells were allowed to recover overnight, and then the medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12 containing 5% NCS supplemented with 400 μm methotrexate. After 2 weeks of selection, surviving colonies were transferred into individual wells in 6-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Once the cells became confluent, the media were screened for TAFI protein production by ELISA. Clones with high TAFI expression levels were picked and seeded into triple flasks (500 cm2; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in DMEM/F-12 with 5% NCS and 100 μm methotrexate. Once the cells became confluent, the medium was changed to serum-free Opti-MEM, supplemented with 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone mixture (PSF) and 50 μm ZnCl2. Conditioned medium was collected at 48-h intervals and replaced with fresh Opti-MEM/PSF/ZnCl2. Collected medium was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 20 min and then stored at -20 °C. Purification of Recombinant TAFI-The isolation of recombinant TAFI was carried out as described previously (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (2 liters) was filtered and loaded onto a 3.0 ml of anti-TAFI mAb-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated at 4 °C in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS). The column was then washed extensively with HBS. TAFI was eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 3.0), and 1-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 1-ml aliquots of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), for a final volume of 2 ml per fraction. The mixture was pipetted up and down immediately to neutralize the eluate. All the fractions were quantified for TAFI levels by ELISA and fractions containing high TAFI were pooled, dialyzed against HBS, and concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Purified TAFI was quantified by measurement of absorbances at 280 nm and 320 nm (∈1%,280 = 26.4; Mr = 48,442) (4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The protein was then aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. The isolated TAFI derivatives were then analyzed using 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, with the Neville system (31Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used to isolate TAFI were coupled to Sepharose 4B as described previously (25Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody mAb16 was used to isolate wild-type TAFI and all of the mutants, except the triple mutant K42/43/44A, which did not bind the column. For its isolation, antibody MA-T12D11 (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used. Kinetics of Activation of TAFI Variants by the IIa-TM Complex-TAFI activation was performed as described previously (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, each TAFI variant at various concentrations (0–2.0 μm) was titrated with TM at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 nm in the presence of IIa (0.5 nm), CaCl2 (5 mm) and HBS with 0.01% Tween 80. Reaction mixtures (40 μl) were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions then were stopped by adding a solution containing PPACK (1 μm) and synthetic substrate AAFR (120 μm) to achieve a final volume of 200 μl. The samples then were monitored at 349 nm in a SpectraMax Plus Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the initial rates of hydrolysis of AAFR were determined from the slopes of the absorbance versus time relationships. TAFIa standard curves were generated as described previously (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, each TAFI variant (1 μm) was completely activated by incubating it with IIa (25 nm), TM (100 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) at 25 °C for 15 min and placing it on ice. TAFIa at varying concentrations was added into AAFR (120 μm) and PPACK (1 μm). Because TAFI zymogen also shows small activity toward AAFR (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), a TAFI standard also was made with it (1 μm). The standard curves were used to calculate two rate constants: K1, for the activity of TAFI zymogen toward AAFR and K2, for the activity of TAFIa toward AAFR. The initial rate of AAFR hydrolysis (r = dAbs/dt) is described by Equation 1.r=K1·[TAFI]+K2·[TAFIa]Eq. 1 Because the total concentration of TAFI, [TAFI]0 = [TAFI] + [TAFIa], Equation 2 can be derived from Equation 1.[TAFIa]=(r-K1·[TAFI]0)(K2-K1)Eq. 2 The TAFIa concentrations at 10 min were used to calculate the initial rates of TAFI activation, v (mol TAFIa formed/liter/s). In no instance did the TAFIa concentration at 10 min exceed 10% of the input concentration of TAFI. The activation kinetics then were analyzed by the enzyme central, parallel assembly model described previously (14Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Schneider M. Nagashima M. Knappe S. Zhao L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the enzyme (T) can interact with TM to form the T-TM complex with dissociation constant Kd1 or with TAFI to form the T-TAFI complex with dissociation constant Km1. The T-TM complex can interact with TAFI to form the T-TM-TAFI complex with Km2, or the T-TAFI complex can interact with TM to form the T-TM-TAFI complex with Kd2. The ternary T-TM-TAFI complex turns over to TAFIa with first order rate constant, kcat. The rate of the reaction is given by Equation 3.v=kcat·[T-TM-TAFI]=kcat·[T]·[TM]·[TAFI]Km2·kd1Eq. 3 The total concentration of thrombin, [T]0, is given by Equation 4, which can be rearranged to give Equations 5 and 6.[T]0=[T]+[T-TM]+[T-TAFI]+[T-TM-TAFI]Eq. 4 [T]0=[T]+[T]·[TM]Kd1+[T]·[TAFI]Km1+[T]·[TM]·[TAFI]Km2·Kd1Eq. 5 [T]0=[T]1+[TM]Kd1+[TAFI]Km1+[TM]·[TAFI]Km2·Kd1Eq. 6 The TAFI activation rate divided by the total concentration of thrombin is obtained by dividing Equation 3 by Equation 6. The result, after algebraic rearrangement, is given by Equation 7.v[T]0=kcat·[TM]·[TAFI]Km2·(Kd1+[TM])+[TAFI]·Kd1·Km2Km1+[TM]Eq. 7 All of the rate data were fit simultaneously by non-linear regression to Equation 7 with the NONLIN module of SYSTAT (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The best fit parameters were kcat, Km1, and Km2 for wild-type and each variant. Kd1 (the dissociation constant for the IIa-TM interaction) was a best fit parameter also, but its value was assumed to be the same for wild-type TAFI and the variants, because all reactions have this interaction in common. The regression analysis returned best fit values along with their asymptotic standard errors (A.S.E.). The analyses were applied to no less than four and no more than five independent experiments with wild-type TAFI and each of the variants. The mean and standard deviations for kcat, Km2, and kcat/Km2 values were calculated. Statistical analysis on the variance of catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km2) of activation of the TAFI derivatives with respect to the wild-type was performed using independent samples t test in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Kinetics of Activation of TAFI Variants by IIa in the Absence of Thrombomodulin-Each TAFI variant at various concentrations (0–2.0 μm) was incubated with IIa (50 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) in HBS with 0.01% Tween 80 at 25 °C for 20 or 30 min. All reactions were carried out, and the initial rates of hydrolysis of AAFR were measured as described above. In the absence of TM, the relationships between rates and the concentration of TAFI were linear indicating high Km values. Thus, the slopes of rate versus the concentration of TAFI were measured by linear regression. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km1) were then equated with the slopes according to Equation 8.v[E]T≈kcat·[TAFI]Km1Eq. 8 The catalytic efficiency was calculated for each TAFI mutant and compared with that of TAFI wild-type. Statistical analysis on the variance of catalytic efficiencies of activation of the TAFI derivatives with respect to the wild-type was performed using independent samples t test in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Thermal Stability Assay of TAFIa Variants-Half lives of various recombinant TAFI were determined as described previously (30Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J.

We recently demonstrated that PKA activation led to increased α1D Ca2+ channel activity in tsA201 cells by phosphorylation of the channel protein. Here we sought to identify the phosphorylated PKA consensus sites on the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel by generating GST fusion proteins of the intracellular loops, N terminus, proximal and distal C termini of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel. An in vitro PKA kinase assay was performed for the GST fusion proteins, and their phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting using either anti-PKA substrate or anti-phosphoserine antibodies. Western blotting showed that the N terminus and C terminus were phosphorylated. Serines 1743 and 1816, two PKA consensus sites, were phosphorylated by PKA and identified by mass spectrometry. Site directed mutagenesis and patch clamp studies revealed that serines 1743 and 1816 were major functional PKA consensus sites. Altogether, biochemical and functional data revealed that serines 1743 and 1816 are major functional PKA consensus sites on the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel.

The modulation of α1C Ca2+ channel by cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylation has been extensively studied, and the C terminus of α1 was identified as the site of the modulation (20De Jongh K.S.

Our group was the first to report that 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, increased α1D Ca2+ channel activity using patch clamp studies (2Qu Y. Baroudi G. Yue Y. El-Sherif N. Boutjdir M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2123-H2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about potential PKA phosphorylation consensus motifs on the α1D Ca2+ channel. We therefore hypothesized that the C terminus of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel mediates its modulation by cAMP-dependent PKA pathway. Subcloning of Intracellular Loops, N Terminus, Proximal or Distal C Terminus of the α1 Subunit of the Rat α1D Ca2+ Channel into pGEX-6P-1 Vector—pCMV6b/rat α1D plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Susumu Seino from Kobe University, Japan. Two sets of primers were used to amplify each of the intracellular loops, proximal, or distal C terminus of α1 subunit of rat α1D Ca2+ channel. Forward primer had a BamHI site and a reverse primer had a SalI site. Intracellular loop 1: forward: 5′-cgcggatccggtgtccttagtggagaattc-3′; reverse: 5′-acgcgtcgacgacagacttcacagctgc-3′. Intracellular loop 2: forward: 5′-cgcggatccctgaagctcttcttggccat-3′; reverse: 5′-acgcgtcgacgtggtggttgatgagtttgtg-3′. Intracellular loop 3: forward: 5′-cgcggatccatgaatatcttcgtgggcttcg-3′; reverse: 5′-acgcgtcgaccgaggagttcaccacgta-3′. Proximal C terminus: forward: 5′-cgcggatccgacaattttgactatctgac-3′ and reverse: 5′-acgcgtcgacaagctgctcgtctcctga-3′. Distal C terminus: forward: 5′-cgcggatccccaaccattttccgtgaag-3′, reverse: 5′-acgcgtcgacctacaaggtggtgatgcaaa-3′. For the subcloning of the N terminus of α1 subunit of rat α1D Ca2+ channel into pGEX 6P-1 vector, the forward primer had a BamHI site, and the reverse primer had an EcoRI site. Primers: forward: 5′-cgcggatcccagcatcaacggcagcagcaa-3′; reverse: 5′-ccggaattctttccaatccactatactaat-3′. All amplified fragments were then subcloned into a glutathione S-transferase (GST) bacterial expression vector pGEX-6p-1. The DH5α bacterial strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the recombinant pGEX-6P-1 vectors, and sequencing of clones with recombinant vectors were confirmed by Genemed (South San Francisco, CA). Expression of GST Fusion Proteins of Intracellular Loops, N Terminus, Proximal and Distal C Terminus of α1 Subunit of Rat α1D Ca2+ Channel—GST fusion proteins were expressed under the induction of the lactose analog isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside as described before (Handbook of GST Gene Fusion System, 18-1157-58, Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the fusion proteins was performed as previously described (23Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). All samples were run on 12% Bis-acrylamide gel under reducing conditions and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. To check the success of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, DH5α transformed with pGEX-6P-1 served as a positive control. Untransformed DH5α E. coli and uninduced cultures of the transformed DH5α E. coli served as a negative control. Western Blot with Anti-GST Antibody—Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Tween-20 TBS (TBST). The membrane was washed with 0.1% TBST, and was then probed with mouse monoclonal anti-GST at a dilution of 1:1000. The membrane was washed with 0.1% TBST before being probed with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody at 1:6000. The membrane was washed again with 0.1% TBST and was developed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak developer. In Vitro Kinase Assay for PKA—The kinase assay was performed on immobilized GST fusion proteins as described by the manufacturer (PKA assay kit, 17-134, Millipore). Briefly, immobilized GST fusion proteins were washed five times with 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Then 25 μl of kinase assay mixture was added to each tube. The mixture consisted of 5 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 2 ng of recombinant PKA catalytic subunit, 7.5 μl of double distilled water, and diluted 1:1 magnesium/ATP (PKA assay kit, 17–134, Millipore). The reaction was allowed to occur for 30 min at 30 °C in a water bath with shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 × SDS loading buffer, and boiling for 5 min. Negative controls consisted of GST fusion proteins subjected to an in vitro kinase assay without the catalytic subunits of PKA. Western Blot with Anti-PKA Substrate and Anti-phosphoserine Antibody—Equal amounts of phosphorylated GST fusion proteins or negative controls of GST fusion proteins, as outlined in the in vitro kinase assay, were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% TBST. The membrane was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-PKA substrate antibody at 1:200 for negative controls and at 1:500 for the remaining blots (PhosphoDetect™, 700 μg/ml, Calbiochem) or with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody at 1:500 for negative controls and at 1:1000 for the remaining blots (mouse ascites fluid, Sigma). The membrane was washed with 0.1% TBST before being probed with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (1:2000 or 1:4000, Sigma). Membrane was washed again with 0.1% TBST and was developed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Kodak developer. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands of GST fusion proteins for intracellular loops, N terminus, proximal and distal C terminus of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained 12% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to in-gel trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis protocol at the Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS). Negative controls, which consisted of GST fusion proteins subjected to an in vitro kinase assay without the catalytic subunits of PKA were also sent for mass spectrometric analysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMV6b/rat α1D using QuikChange TM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serine residues were replaced by alanine in all substitution mutants. The following mutations were introduced by mutagenic primers: S1743A, S1816A, and S1964A. The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing at the Laval University sequencing facility (Quebec, Canada). Transfection of the tsA201 Cell Line—Mammalian tsA201 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml, Invitrogen) from our laboratory. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The tsA201 cells were transfected using the Ca2+ phosphate method with the following modification: to identify transfected cells, 7 μg of EBO/CD8 plasmid was cotransfected with 7 μg of each of the subunits of α1D Ca2+ channel: α1, β, and α2/δ cDNAs. For patch clamp experiments, 2–3 days post-transfection cells were incubated for 2 min in a medium containing anti-CD8a-coated beads (Dynabeads, M-450 CD8a). The unattached beads were removed by washing with extracellular solution (in mm): 135 choline chloride, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES; adjusted to pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEA-OH). Cells expressing CD8a and therefore binding beads were distinguished from non-transfected cells by light microscopy. Electrophysiology—Ca2+ currents were recorded in whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (pClamp 9, Axon Instrument) (2Qu Y. Baroudi G. Yue Y. El-Sherif N. Boutjdir M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2123-H2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Baroudi G. Qu Y. Ramadan O. Chahine M. Boutjdir M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1614-H1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The internal solution contained (in mm): 135 CsCl, 4 MgCl2, 4 ATP, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 1 EDTA; adjusted to pH 7.2 with TEA-OH. Data were digitized at 5 kHz with an analog-to-digital converter. The recordings were filtered with a low-pass corner frequency of 2 kHz. For the time course, α1D Ca2+ current was continuously recorded at a test potential of 10 mV from a holding potential of 100 mV. Statistics—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Percent of inhibition was calculated as difference of the current amplitude by the intervention over the control value. When indicated, paired or unpaired Student's t test was performed. Differences were deemed significant at a p value of <0.05. Generation of GST Fusion Proteins—Scansite showed that the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel has a number of PKA consensus sites, mainly on the C terminus (Fig. 1A). To identify which of the potential PKA consensus sites is phosphorylated by PKA, constructs of GST fusion protein were designed in such a way that the GST tag was on the N terminus of different fragments of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel protein (Fig. 1B). GST fusion proteins spanning the intracellular loops, N terminus and C terminus of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel were then generated (Fig. 2A). The expected size of GST fusion proteins of N terminus, proximal and distal C terminus is 43, 69, and 68 kDa, respectively. The expected size of GST fusion proteins of intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3, is 49, 44, and 36 kDa, respectively. Coomassie Blue staining showed that GST fusion proteins of N terminus, proximal and distal C terminus were migrating at higher than 40 kDa on polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2A). Coomassie Blue stained gels also showed that GST fusion proteins of intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 were migrating at 49, close to 49 and 36 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). Western blots showed the expression of GST fusion proteins of N terminus, proximal and distal C terminus, and intracellular loops (Fig. 2, B–D, respectively).FIGURE 2Expression of GST fusion proteins. Representative Coomassie Blue staining showing GST fusion proteins. Two fragments that span the C terminus (proximal (69 kDa) and distal (68 kDa)), together with N terminus (43 kDa) and intracellular loops 1–3 (49, ∼49, and 36 kDa) of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel were subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX vector. GST fusion proteins were separated by the GST affinity pull-down assay, run on 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Blue or probed with anti-GST antibodies.

The phosphorylation status of the GST fusion proteins was tested by two antibodies. The first antibody was an anti-PKA substrate that is capable of detecting phosphorylated serines only in a PKA consensus site (arginine-arginine-x-serine, where x can be any amino acid). The second antibody was an anti-phosphoserine antibody that can detect phosphorylated serines regardless of the consensus site. Fig. 3 shows a Western blot using the two antibodies. The N terminus and proximal C terminus of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel were phosphorylated (Fig. 3, A and B). The distal C terminus of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel showed phosphorylation when probed with the anti-PKA substrate (Fig. 3A) and minimal when probed with anti-phosphoserine antibodies (Fig. 3B). These experiments were repeated four times, each giving identical results. In contrast, the intracellular loops of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel were found to be minimally phosphorylated, both with the anti-PKA substrate and with the anti-phosphoserine antibodies (Fig. 3, C and D), while GST protein (negative control) was not found to be phosphorylated (Fig. 3, E and F). Mass Spectrometry Identified Phosphorylated Sites on GST Fusion Proteins—To identify the phosphorylated PKA consensus sites on the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel, mass spectrometry was performed on GST fusion proteins phosphorylated by PKA. The phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were run on a polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the corresponding bands were excised. We performed an in-gel digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Mass spectrometry identified two PKA consensus sites phosphorylated on the proximal C terminus of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel: serines 1743 and 1816 (Fig. 4, A–C). Mass spectrometry identified three more non-PKA consensus sites not identified by scansite and these were: serine 1703, serine 1788, and threonine 1795 (Fig. 4A). Mass spectrometric analysis did not detect any phosphorylated residues on GST (Fig. 4D) in agreement with our prior findings (Fig. 3, E and F). The same approach applied for the proximal C terminus (mass spectrometry), we found that serine 1964 was phosphorylated. This residue is a PKA consensus site, phosphorylated in trypsinized digests of the distal C terminus of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel. In addition, from our mass spectrometry studies, we identified a number of non-PKA consensus sites that were phosphorylated on the N terminus and distal C terminus of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel. These included serines 1944, 2152, 2165, and threonine 2147 phosphorylated on the distal C terminus (Fig. 5A). Like-wise, we found that serines 45, 46, 52, 121, and threonine 49 were all phosphorylated on the N terminus (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that there are non-PKA consensus sites that can be phosphorylated by PKA on the N terminus and distal C terminus of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel. We also found non-PKA consensus sites on intracellular loop 1 of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, we did not detect any phosphorylated residues on double digests of the other two loops. However, we identified phosphorylated non-PKA consensus sites on trypsinized digests of intracellular loop 2 of the α1 subunit of α1D Ca2+ channel. The phosphorylated residues on intracellular loop 1 were: serines 517, 519 and threonines 443, 504. For trypsinized digests of intracellular loop 2 the phosphorylated amino acid residues were: serines 857, 923, 929, and threonines 863. Negative Controls of Intracellular Loop 1, N Terminus, Proximal and Distal C Terminus Were Not Phosphorylated—To test the antibodies and the mass spectrometric approaches, we performed an in vitro kinase assay without the catalytic subunit of PKA. No phosphorylated peptides were detected by Western blot (Fig. 6) nor by mass spectrometry. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Patch Clamp Studies Showed That Serine 1816 Is Functionally Important—Of the nine PKA sites identified by scansite, 3 were found to be phosphorylated by mass spectrometry. These were serines 1743, 1816, and 1964. To test for their functional relevance, deletion mutants, and site-directed mutagenesis combined with electrophysiology experiments were performed. We first prepared two deletion mutants of the C terminus of the α1D Ca2+ channel and expressed them in tsA201 cells. We then measured the basal current of these cells with or without the presence of 50 μm 8-Br-cAMP, which activates PKA in tsA201 cells (2Qu Y. Baroudi G. Yue Y. El-Sherif N. Boutjdir M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2123-H2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To minimize the variation of the current measurements, all current comparisons were made under similar conditions, which included using the same set of tsA201 cells, same amount of plasmids and same post transfection recording time. The first deletion mutant with a stop codon at amino acid residue 1517 of the C terminus of the α1D Ca2+ channel resulted in the abolition of α1D ICa-L (data not shown). The second deletion mutant had a stop codon at amino acid residue 1917 of the C terminus of α1D Ca2+ channel. Cells expressing this deletion mutant showed an increase of α1D ICaL in response to 50 μm 8-Br-cAMP similar to that observed in cells expressing the wild-type (WT) α1D channel. These findings further support the unique importance of the proximal region of the C terminus of α1D Ca2+ channel. We finally examined the modulation of single site mutants in response to 8-Br-cAMP (50 μm) (3Qu Y. Baroudi G. Yue Y. Boutjdir M. Circulation. 2005; 111: 3034-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While treatment of tsA201 cells expressing WT α1D Ca2+ channels with 8-Br-cAMP caused a significant increase in α1D ICa-L amplitude (43.64 ± 9.6%) (Fig. 7A), substitution of serine 1743 by alanine reduced α1D ICa-L increase by PKA activation to 22.0 ± 4.2% (Fig. 7B). However, substitution of serine 1816 by alanine almost completely abolished 8-Br-cAMP-induced current increase (10.70 ± 3.3%) (Fig. 7C). Substitution of serine 1964 by alanine did not show any alteration in 8-Br-cAMP-induced enhancement of α1D ICa-L (data not shown). Averaged data for WT α1D ICaL, α1D/S1743A and α1D/S1816A are shown in Fig. 7D. Here we provide a systematic biochemical and proteomic approach for identifying phosphorylated PKA consensus sites on the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel. We have identified serines 1743 and 1816 as two major functional PKA consensus sites. We also showed that serine 1816 has a major functional role in the α1D Ca2+ channel response to PKA as compared with serine 1743. We also showed that the distal C terminus is phosphorylated by PKA, but no functional site was identified. We found that serine 1964, a PKA consensus site identified by scansite and mass spectrometry, was not functionally relevant. Several phosphorylated non-PKA consensus sites on the proximal and distal C terminus were identified. However, we were mainly interested in characterizing PKA consensus sites identified by scansite and phosphorylated by PKA. We did not identify any PKA consensus sites on intracellular loops of the α1 subunit of the α1D Ca2+ channel. Although scansite identified several PKA consensus sites on intracellular loops 1 and 2 of α1D Ca2+ channel, none of these sites was phosphorylated by PKA. The data obtained with the site-directed mutants with S1816A and S1743A of α1D Ca2+ channel argue against the functional relevance of other PKA consensus sites present on the α1D Ca2+ channel. In fact, when serine 1816 was mutated to alanine the response of the α1D Ca2+ channel to 8-Br-cAMP was almost abolished. The weak phosphorylation seen for intracellular loop 3 on Western blots can be accounted for by the presence of serines 1263 and 1264, two non-PKA consensus sites that were not detected by mass spectrometry. This occurred because treatment of the intracellular loop 3 peptide with trypsin or chymotrypsin generates small peptides that are of low mass to be detected. For example, tryptic digestion of the intracellular loop 3 peptide results in a small peptide, KFWYVVNSS, which has a molecular mass close to the detection threshold for mass spectrometry. Chymotrypsin generates peptides that are even smaller than the tryptic peptides. Physiological Significance—The α1D Ca2+ channel has a more negative activation voltage (between -60 to -40 mV) than the α1C Ca2+ channel. This enables the channel to play an important role in phase 4 diastolic depolarization of the pacemaker (12Zhang Z. He Y. Tuteja D. Xu D. Timofeyev V. Zhang Q. Glatter K.A. Xu Y. Shin H.S. Low R.

The phosphorylation process constitutes one of the major regulatory pathways for cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels. Because the SA node is heavily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (29Randall W.C. Rinkema L.E. Jones S.B. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1984; 11: 145-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), stimulation of the SNS in response to exercise or stress insults results in a rapid and dramatic increase in heart rate. cAMP-dependent PKA is the point of convergence for the regulation of Ca2+ channels by many neurotransmitters and hormone receptors including the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors and the serotoninergic 5-HT4 receptor, all of which are present in atrial cells (27Ouadid H. Seguin J. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Nargeot J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 346-351PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nargeot J. Lory P. Richard S. Eur. Heart J. 1997; 18: A15-A26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is a serine/threonine kinase that can be stimulated by extracellular signals that elevate intracellular cAMP concentrations which, in turn, can induce phosphorylation of the α1D L-type Ca2+ channel, leading to increased channel activity (30Stiles G.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1984; 35: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Identifying consensus PKA phosphorylation sites α1D L-type Ca2+ channel is important to the understanding of cardiac rhythm regulation by the SNS. A—In summary, the present work establishes that serines 1743 and 1816, two PKA consensus sites, are phosphorylated by PKA and are functionally relevant. The present data are the first to identify serine 1816 as a PKA consensus site that can be phosphorylated by PKA and is functionally relevant. Not all PKA consensus sites are functionally relevant, i.e. phosphorylation of these sites does not alter the activity of α1D Ca2+ channel in response to PKA activation and phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2105084659,"The voltage-activated K+ channel subunit Kv2.1 can form heterotetramers with members of the Kv6 subfamily, generating channels with biophysical properties different from homomeric Kv2.1 channels. The N-terminal tetramerization domain (T1) has been shown previously to play a role in Kv channel assembly, but the mechanisms controlling specific heteromeric assembly are still unclear. In Kv6.x channels the histidine residue of the zinc ion-coordinating C3H1 motif of Kv2.1 is replaced by arginine or valine. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that substitution of the corresponding histidine 105 in Kv2.1 by valine (H105V) or arginine (H105R) disrupted the interaction of the T1 domain of Kv2.1 with the T1 domains of both Kv6.3 and Kv6.4, whereas interaction of the T1 domain of Kv2.1 with itself was unaffected by this mutation. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), interaction could be detected between the subunits Kv2.1/Kv2.1, Kv2.1/Kv6.3, and Kv2.1/Kv6.4. Reduced FRET signals were obtained after co-expression of Kv2.1H105V or Kv2.1H105R with Kv6.3 or Kv6.4. Wild-type Kv2.1 but not Kv2.1H105V could be co-immunoprecipitated with Kv6.4. Co-expression of dominant-negative mutants of Kv6.3 reduced the current produced Kv2.1, but not of Kv2.1H105R mutants. Co-expression of Kv6.3 or Kv6.4 with wt Kv2.1 but not with Kv2.1H105V or Kv2.1H105R changed the voltage dependence of activation of the channels. Our results suggest that His-105 in the T1 domain of Kv2.1 is required for functional heteromerization with members of the Kv6 subfamily. We conclude from our findings that Kv2.1 and Kv6.x subunits have complementary T1 domains that control selective heteromerization. The voltage-activated K+ channel subunit Kv2.1 can form heterotetramers with members of the Kv6 subfamily, generating channels with biophysical properties different from homomeric Kv2.1 channels. The N-terminal tetramerization domain (T1) has been shown previously to play a role in Kv channel assembly, but the mechanisms controlling specific heteromeric assembly are still unclear. In Kv6.x channels the histidine residue of the zinc ion-coordinating C3H1 motif of Kv2.1 is replaced by arginine or valine. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that substitution of the corresponding histidine 105 in Kv2.1 by valine (H105V) or arginine (H105R) disrupted the interaction of the T1 domain of Kv2.1 with the T1 domains of both Kv6.3 and Kv6.4, whereas interaction of the T1 domain of Kv2.1 with itself was unaffected by this mutation.

Co-expression of dominant-negative mutants of Kv6.3 reduced the current produced Kv2.1, but not of Kv2.1H105R mutants.

We conclude from our findings that Kv2.1 and Kv6.x subunits have complementary T1 domains that control selective heteromerization. Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv family are strongly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system, in the immune system, in muscle cells and in many other cell types. The members of the Kv channel family differ in their time courses of activation and inactivation and in their pharmacological properties. They play a key role in controlling neuronal excitability and regulate a variety of electrophysiological properties, such as the interspike membrane potential, the wave-form of the action potential and the firing frequency (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland2001: 131-167Google Scholar).

Kv channels are composed of four subunits that surround the central ion permeation pathway. Each subunit has six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a pore region containing the signature sequence GYG characteristic for potassium channels (5Barry D.M. Nerbonne J.M. Annu. Rev.

A highly conserved sequence in the cytoplasmic N terminus of Kv channels, the tetramerization domain or T1 domain, has been shown to play an important role in channel assembly (6Lu J. Robinson J.M.

The T1 domain contains some of the molecular determinants for subfamily-specific homo- or heterotetrameric assembly of Kv α-subunits (9Xu J. Yu W. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Li M. J. Biol.

The most striking difference between the T1 domains of Kv1 (Shaker) and Kv2-4 (non-Shaker) channels is the presence of intersubunit-coordinated Zn2+ ions at the assembly interface in non-Shaker channels. The Zn2+ ions are coordinated by a C3H1 motif embedded in a conserved sequence motif (HX5CX20CC) of the T1 domain, which is located near the distal end of the N terminus (12Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H.

These four amino acids are exposed on the subunit interface, with one histidine and two cysteine residues belonging to one subunit and one cysteine residue belonging to the neighboring subunit (12Bixby K.A.

The T1 domain facilitates tetrameric assembly of Kv channels. Kv subunits in which the T1 has been deleted have been reported to assemble in a promiscuous way via their transmembrane domains and to form stable, functional channels, but both the rates and the efficiency of channel assembly are significantly lower in the mutant channels as compared with their wild-type counterparts (7Deutsch C.

The voltage-activated potassium channel subunits Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 are capable of heteromeric assembly with members of the Kv6 subfamily, which generates channels with different biophysical properties compared with homomeric Kv2.1 channels (16Zhu X.R.

In the present study we used fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET), yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, live-cell imaging, and electrophysiological recordings in transfected mammalian cells and in Xenopus oocytes to study heteromerization of Kv2.1 with Kv6.3 and Kv6.4 channels. We describe a mutation in the Zn2+ ion-coordinating C3H1 motif of the T1 domain of Kv2.1 that disrupts formation of functional heteromeric channels, but does not prevent formation of homomeric channels. DNA Constructs—Full-length cDNAs of Kv6.4 (earlier name Kv6.3, GenBank™ accession number AF450108) and Kv6.3 (earlier name Kv10.1 or Kv6.4, GenBank™ accession number AF450110) were obtained by PCR on human brain cDNA (Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The coding regions of human Kv2.1 (a kind gift of Dr. R. H. Joho, South-western University, GenBank™ accession number L02840), Kv6.1 (GenBank™ accession number AF033383), Kv6.3, Kv6.4, and rat Kv1.1 (GenBank™ accession number X12589) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pIRES (Clontech), or were fused to the E(G/C/Y)FP genes by cloning into the expression vectors pE(G/C/Y)FP-C1 (Clontech). Finally, all constructs were completely sequenced. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For single amino acid replacement or deletion mutagenesis the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Oligonucleotide primers were designed with at least 12 matching nucleotides on each side of an intended nucleotide change. All mutants were completely sequenced. Direct Interaction Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The Match-maker yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to assay for protein-protein interactions. The T1 domains of rat Kv1.1 (aa 37-142) and human Kv2.1 (aa 31-148), Kv2.2 (accession number AF450111, aa 35-151), Kv6.4 (aa 58-176), and Kv6.3 (aa 11-126) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the yeast DNA-binding domain-containing vector pGBT-9 and the activation domain-containing vector pGAD-424. To check for direct interaction between two proteins 150 ng of both vectors were co-transformed into the yeast strain HF7c according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transformants were plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, and incubated for 3-4 days at 30 °C. Yeast transformed with interacting fusion proteins grow as a result of activation of the HIS3 gene. To determine the strength of the interaction, HIS3 positive clones were grown on 5-10 mm 3-aminotriazole plates and β-galactosidase assays were performed to verify interaction. Expression Analysis—Total human and rat tissue RNA was purchased from Clontech and Ambion. Total RNA from the human adrenal gland cell line NCI-H295R (21Rainey W.E. Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) or the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line A7r5 was extracted by using HighPure RNA kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), which included DNase I digestion. Total RNA (1 μg) eluates were reverse-transcribed (RT) with random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) or Omniscript RT (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Qualitative RT-PCR expression analysis in rat A7r5 cells was performed with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) using intron-spanning and gene-specific primers for rat Kv channels. The following primers were used: rKv2.1: for 5′-GCTGTGCAGAGAAGAGGAAGA-3′, rev 5′-GTGTTGAGTGACAGAGCGATG-3′; rKv2.2: for 5′-GCCCAGAGAAAAGGAAGAAAC-3′, rev 5′-TGTTGAGAGACAGAGCAATGG-3′; rKv6.3: for 5′-CGTGTCTATGGTGGTGCTGT-3′, rev for 5′-ACCAGCCTATGCAGATAGCTT-3′; rKv6.4: for 5′-CTTGCCTCTCCGTTCTCTTC-3′, rev 5′-ACACAGATGGTCTCCACCAC-3′. Qualitative RT-PCR expression analysis in NCI-H295R cells was performed with human Kv primers, which were also used for quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). All PCR products showed the expected size and were confirmed by sequencing. qPCR was performed using an ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7700 (Applied Biosystems) or an MX3000P real-time PCR system (Stratagene). Specificity of RT-PCR was checked by “no template” and “no RT” controls as well as by melting point analysis. Expression of the target gene was determined as the relative expression (rE) normalized to the house-keeping gene GAPDH (rE = 1/2ΔCt). The following primers were used for qPCR: rGAPDH: for 5′-GAGAATGGGAAGCTGGTCATCAAC-3′, rev 5′-ACTCCACGACATACTCAGCACCAG-3′; hGAPDH: for 5′-GTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTATT-3′, rev 5′-ACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAG-3′; rKv2.1: for 5′-TGCTGTGCAGAGAAGAGGAAGAAA-3′, rev 5′-ACAGGACGATGAACATGATCGAGA-3′; hKv2.1: for 5′-TACTGGAGAAGCCCAATTCCTCTG-3′, rev 5′-CTGTAGCTCAGGCAGCGTGTTG-3′; rKv6.3: for 5′-AGTCTGGATGACCGGAGCAGGTAC-3′, rev 5′-GACGATGAACCGCACGATGCAC-3′; hKv6.3: for 5′-AGCCTGGATGACCGGAGCAGGTAC-3′, rev 5′-CTCACGATGCACTCGGCAGTGAAC-3′; rKv6.4: for 5′-GACTTCAGGGCTGAGGAGGACA-3′, rev 5′-ACAGGCAAAACTCCAGGGAGAAC-3′; hKv6.4: for 5′-TCAGCCTGTGTGTCAGCACCATG-3′, rev 5′-ACGCAGATGGTCTCCACGATGAAA-3′. Heterologous Expression in HEK293 or COS-7 Cells, Fluorescence Imaging, and Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 or COS-7 cells were transfected with 1-2 μg of Kv cDNAs subcloned in the vectors pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), pIRES (Clontech) or pE(G/C/Y)FP (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation experiments COS-7 cells were harvested and lysed 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Kv2.1 antibodies (Alomone, Israel) and protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). After intensive washing the protein-antibody complexes were eluted with SDS-sample buffer, heat-denatured (100 °C) for 5 min, separated on 6 or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins of interest were visualized by immunostaining the Western blots with anti-Kv2.1 antibodies (Alomone; 1:2000 dilution) or anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam; 1:2500 dilution). The binding of the primary antibodies was detected using peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Pierce; 1:2500 dilution) and a chemiluminescent extended duration substrate (Super Signal West Dura, Pierce).

Patch clamp recordings were carried out on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 70) at room temperature (23 °C) 10-24 h after transfection. Adherent CHO-K1 cells in culture dishes, in which an insert was placed to form a low volume chamber, were superfused with the standard extracellular solution (NaCl, 140 mm; KCl, 5.4 mm; CaCl2, 2 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; glucose, 10 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Data of whole cell recordings were collected with an EPC9 or EPC10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) using the Pulse software v8.7 (HEKA). For whole cell measurements, patch pipettes made of borosilicate glass (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) and coated with R-6101 (Dow Chemical, Midland) were used. They had resistances of 2.5 to 4.0 mΩ when filled with the intracellular solution (KCl, 80 mm; potassium-glutamate, 50 mm; Mg-ATP, 2 mm; MgCl2, 2 mm; buffered at 100 nm free Ca2+ with 10 mm BAPTA; HEPES, 10 mm; titrated to pH 7.2 with KOH). In whole cell measurements, the liquid junction potentials were +8.0 mV with standard extracellular solution and +4.9 mV with the high K+ extracellular solution (KCl, 130 mm; CaCl2, 2 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; glucose, 10 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; titrated to pH 7.4 with KOH), and were corrected by the Pulse software. The osmolarity of all solutions was controlled with a vapor osmometer (Vapro 5520, Wescor Inc., Logan). The values of pipette and cell membrane capacitance were estimated with the Pulse software and corrected automatically. Series resistance compensation (70-80%) was used to limit voltage errors to less than 5 mV. Only cells with minimal leakage currents were used. The data were acquired at a sampling rate of 5 kHz after filtering at 1.67 kHz. For quantification of the time course of inactivation, the cells were held at a potential of -80 mV and three 30-s depolarizing pulses to 0 mV were applied with an interpulse interval of at least 2 min. The decay of the resulting transient outward currents was fitted with a bi-exponential function. A mono-exponential function was not sufficient to fit the data and tri-exponential functions did not provide a better fit. The activation characteristics of the Kv channels were determined in symmetrical high-K+ solution. The cells were depolarized from a holding potential of -80 mV to potentials between -70 and +40 mV (with increments of 10 mV) for 100 ms. Tail current amplitudes arising from subsequent repolarization to -80 mV were measured isochronally immediately after the depolarizing voltage steps. The data were normalized to the tail current obtained after a voltage step to +40 mV and fitted to the modified Boltzmann Equation 1, Itail/Imax = 1/(1 + exp((V1/2 - Vm)/k))(Eq. 1) where Itail is the current amplitude at membrane potential Vm, Imax is the current amplitude used for normalization, V½ is the half-activation potential, and k is the slope factor. The values obtained for V½ and k are reported as means ± S.E. To confirm the activation curves obtained from tail current measurements in high-K+ solution we performed additional experiments with standard extracellular solution (5.4 mm K+). In this case K+ outward currents were elicited by 1-s depolarizing steps from -80 mV to potentials between -70 and +80 mV applied at intervals of 22 s. The conductance was calculated from the equation: G = I/(E-EK), where I is the peak current, E is the potential and EK is the K+ equilibrium potential (-80.9 mV). The conductance was normalized to the conductance at +80 mV to give G/Gmax. Activation curves were fitted with the Boltzmann function using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in Origin software v7.5. The results obtained with the two approaches were very similar. The data presented in the results are from the measurements in high-K+ solution, which had a better signal-to-noise ratio. Heterologous Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Voltage Clamp Measurements—The coding regions of Kv2.1, Kv6.3, and Kv6.4 were subcloned in the oocyte expression vector pSGEM. cRNA transcripts were synthesized with a mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion) after vector linearization, purified by precipitation and injected into defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes at constant amounts, Kv2.1 constructs, 50 pg/oocyte; Kv6.3 constructs, 26 pg/oocyte; Kv6.4 constructs, 30 pg/oocyte. Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 46-50 h in ND96 containing (mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4-7.5), supplemented with 0.5 mm theophylline, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate. Two microelectrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed with a Turbo Tec-10C amplifier (NPI), and data were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The oocytes were placed in a small volume perfusion chamber and superfused with ND96 solution. All data were compiled from at least three different batches of oocytes. FRET Analysis—FRET measurements were carried out with an inverted epifluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus) using an oil-immersion objective (40×/1.35 NA, Olympus) and a digital video imaging system (TILL-Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) equipped with a monochromator. All FRET experiments were performed with live adherent HEK293 cells. FRET efficiencies were determined by monitoring the increase in the ECFP (FRET-donor) fluorescence emission during selective EYFP (FRET-acceptor) photobleaching. The photobleaching protocol for EYFP consisted of 35 cycles of illumination at 512 nm for 4.5 s. The detection protocol for ECFP and EYFP consisted of 45 cycles (10 before bleaching) with 50-ms illumination at 440 nm, followed by a 50-ms delay and 50-ms illumination at 500 nm. The delay between bleaching and detection was 120 ms, and the entire cycle time was 5 s. An intramolecularly fused CFP-YFP tandem protein (kindly provided by Michael Schaefer, Pharmacology, Berlin) resulted in a FRET efficiency of almost 50%. Four or more independent transfections with 3-14 single cells were used for the calculation of FRET efficiency. FRET efficiencies were only accepted when the ratio of fluorescence intensity of EYFP over ECFP was higher than 2.4 and EYFP bleach was greater than 80%. Sequence and Predicted Structure of the T1 Domain—To identify a possible T1 domain in the Kv6 channel subunits, the amino acid sequences of human Kv6 were compared with those of the well-characterized Kv2 subfamily (Fig. 1A). We found that the cytoplasmic N terminus of all Kv6 subunits contains a conserved non-Shaker T1 domain with an amino acid similarity of 54-66% to the T1 domain of Kv2.1. The T1 domain of Kv6 subunits exhibits one distinctive feature: The histidine (H) of the zinc ion-coordinating C3H1 motif is replaced by arginine (R) (Kv6.1-6.3) or valine (V) (Kv6.4). This substitution of the histidine appears to be characteristic for the Kv6 subfamily. The phylogenetic tree revealed that the Kv2 subfamily is more closely related to the Kv6 subfamily than the to the Kv5, Kv8, and Kv9 subfamilies (Fig. 1B). However, unlike the Kv6 subfamily, the Kv5, Kv8, and Kv9 subfamilies harbor a histidine residue in the C3H1 motif, indicating a potential functional relevance of the histidine substitution. Gene Expression Analysis—Expression profiles of the Kv2.1, Kv6.3, and Kv6.4 channel subunits were examined by quantitative RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from different human and rat tissues (Fig. 2A, upper and lower panel). Robust expression of Kv2.1 could be detected in all tissues examined. Kv2.1 was co-expressed with Kv6.3 and Kv6.4 in human and rat brain and in the adrenal gland. In addition, we found marked co-expression of Kv2.1 with Kv6.3 in human and rat lung, colon, and kidney, and co-expression of Kv2.1 with Kv6.4 in rat heart, lung, liver, colon, and kidney. We also examined the expression Kv2.1 and Kv6.x subunits in eight different brain regions by qPCR (Fig. 2B). Again, a strong expression of Kv2.1 as well as co-expression of Kv6.3 and Kv6.4 could be detected in all brain regions examined. Co-expression of Kv2.1 and Kv6.4 subunits was found in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line A7r5 (Fig. 2C, upper panel) and co-expression of Kv2.1 and Kv6.3 was found in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Co-expression of Kv6 with Kv2.1 Subunits—Kv6.x and/or Kv2.1 subunits were expressed in CHO-K1 cells and the amplitude and kinetics of the resulting currents were analyzed with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Expression of Kv6.1, Kv6.3, or Kv6.4 subunits alone did not produce any voltage-dependent K+ current (not illustrated), confirming that these subunits are silent (18Sano Y. Mochizuki S. Miyake A. Kitada C. Inamura K. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Ottschytsch N. Raes A. Van Hoorick D. Snyders D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7986-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Post M.A. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test for possible formation of heteromeric Kv6.x/Kv2.1 channels we then co-expressed Kv6.1, Kv6.3, or Kv6.4 subunits with Kv2.1 using an IRES-based expression vector in which the transcription of both channel subunits was under the control of the same promoter. This vector induced the translation of two open reading frames from one mRNA transcript. However, the translation of the second open reading frame (Kv2.1) was about 10-fold lower than that of the first one (Kv6), which minimized the formation of homomeric Kv2.1 channels. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the time course of inactivation of the heteromeric channels was much slower than that of homotetrameric Kv2.1 channels. The inactivation could be described by two time constants (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fast time constant was very similar for homomeric Kv2.1 and for heteromeric channels; it had a mean value of about 2.8 s (Fig. 3B, see left bars). However, the slow time constant of inactivation was significantly different: 7.2 ± 0.6 s for homomeric Kv2.1 channels, 10.2 ± 0.6 s for heteromeric Kv6.1/Kv2.1, 13.5 ± 1.6 s for Kv6.3/Kv2.1 and 21.6 ± 1.0 s for Kv6.4/Kv2.1 channels (Fig. 3B, right bars). Residue His-105 of Kv2.1 Is Important for Interaction of the T1 Domains—Because the replacement of the histidine residue in the C3H1 motif is a distinctive property of the Kv6 subfamily, we analyzed whether replacing histidine 105 of Kv2.1 by valine (H105V) would affect the interaction between the T1 domains. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis was used to study the interaction between T1 domains of Kv2.1, Kv2.2, Kv6.3, and Kv6.4; the T1 domains analyzed consisted of about 120 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the Kv subunits (underlined in Fig. 1A). As a negative control, we used the T1 domain of Kv1.1, which does not contain a C3H1 motif. The latter T1 domain interacted exclusively with itself but not with the T1 domains of Kv2 or Kv6 members (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with several other studies (10Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 763-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As expected, T1 domains of wild-type (wt) Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 interacted with themselves and also with the T1 domains of Kv6.3 and Kv6.4 (Fig. 4, A and B, left panel). An interaction between Kv6.3 and Kv6.4, and interaction of these domains with themselves, could not be detected. However, mutant Kv2.1H105V T1 domains were found to interact with themselves and with wt Kv2.1-T1 domains. Interestingly, co-transformation of mutant Kv2.1H105V with wt Kv6.3 or Kv6.4 T1 domains resulted in loss of interaction (Fig. 4, A and B, right panel). These findings suggest that histidine-105 in Kv2.1 is an important determinant for heteromeric assembly of Kv2.1 with the channel subunits Kv6.3 or Kv6.4 but not for homomeric assembly. Another interesting finding is that replacement of valine 138 in Kv6.4 by histidine resulted in a weak interaction with wt Kv6.4 or mutant Kv6.4V138H T1 domains (Fig. 4A) while the analogous mutation in Kv6.3 (Kv6.3R84H) showed no interaction (data not illustrated). Replacement of Histidine 105 in Kv2.1 Prevents Heterotetrameric Assembly—Because the Y2H direct interaction assays were performed with the detached T1 domains of the Kv channels we tested whether replacement of histidine 105 would also prevent the interaction between the full-length Kv2.1 with Kv6.4 subunits. To address this question we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Kv2.1, Kv2.1H105V, and EGFP-tagged Kv6.4 were heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells and the Kv2.1/Kv6.4 complexes were precipitated from the cell lysates with anti-Kv2.1 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2035732298,"A signaling pathway involving ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP76 has been regarded as essential for receptor-driven T cell development and activation. Consistent with this model, mice deficient in SLP76 have a complete block at the double negative 3 stage of T cell development. Recently, however, it has been reported that inactivation of Cbl, a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, partially rescues T cell development in SLP76-deficient mice. To probe the influence of Cbl on domain-specific SLP76 functions, we reconstituted SLP76(-/-) Cbl(-/-) mice with Slp76 transgenes bearing mutations in each of three functional domains of SLP76 as follows: Y3F, in which the amino-terminal tyrosine residues of SLP76 were mutated, eliminating sites of SLP76 interaction with Vav, Nck, and Itk; Delta20, in which 20 amino acids in the proline-rich region of SLP76 were deleted, removing a binding site for Gads; and RK, in which arginine 448 of SLP76 was replaced by lysine, abolishing function of the Src homology 2 domain. Although each of these transgenes has been shown to partially rescue T cell development in SLP76(-/-) mice, we report here that Cbl inactivation completely reverses the severe double negative 3 developmental block that occurs in SLP76-deficient mice expressing the Y3F transgene (Y3F mice) and partially rescues the defect in positive selection in T cell receptor transgenic Y3F mice, but in contrast fails to rescue thymic development of SLP76-deficient mice expressing the Delta20 or RK transgene. Rescue in SLP76(-/-)Cbl(-/-)Y3F double-positive thymocytes is associated with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules, including Lck, Vav, PLC-gamma1, and ERKs, but not Itk, in response to T cell receptor stimulation. Thus, our data demonstrate that Cbl suppresses activation of a bypass signaling pathway and thereby enforces SLP76 dependence of early T cell development."
