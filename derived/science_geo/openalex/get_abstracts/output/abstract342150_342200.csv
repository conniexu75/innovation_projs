https://openalex.org/W1986733300,"For the past three decades the quantity of petroleum (both oil and oil plus gas) found per foot of drilling effort in the United States for any given year can be expressed as a secular decrease of about 2 percent per year combined with an inverse function of drilling effort for that year. Extrapolation of energy costs and gains from petroleum drilling and extraction indicates that drilling for domestic petroleum could cease to be a net source of energy by about 2004 at low drilling rates and by 2000 or sooner at high drilling rates, and that the net yield will be less at higher drilling rates."
https://openalex.org/W2065724402,"The successful synthesis of a pentagonal dodecahedrane molecule has been achieved. Obtained by a sequence of 20 stereochemically controlled steps beginning with the readily available cyclopentadienide anion, the 1,16-dimethyl derivative has D(3d) symmetry and unusual physical properties. The x-ray crystal structure shows that the alkyl groups cause only small distortions from pure dodecahedral symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W1974629685,"A submillimeter heterodyne radiometer, developed for astronomical applications, uses an optically pumped laser local oscillator and a quasi-optical Schottky diode mixer. The resultant telescope-mounted system, which has a noise temperature less than 4000 K (double sideband) and high frequency and spatial resolution, has been used to detect the J= 6 â†’ 5 rotational transition of carbon monoxide at 434 micrometers in the Orion molecular cloud. The measurements, when compared with previous millimeter-wave data, indicate that the broad carbon monoxide emission feature is produced by an optically thin gas whose temperature exceeds 180 K."
