https://openalex.org/W2152881839,"Biofuels derived from low-input high-diversity (LIHD) mixtures of native grassland perennials can provide more usable energy, greater greenhouse gas reductions, and less agrichemical pollution per hectare than can corn grain ethanol or soybean biodiesel. High-diversity grasslands had increasingly higher bioenergy yields that were 238% greater than monoculture yields after a decade. LIHD biofuels are carbon negative because net ecosystem carbon dioxide sequestration (4.4 megagram hectare –1 year –1 of carbon dioxide in soil and roots) exceeds fossil carbon dioxide release during biofuel production (0.32 megagram hectare –1 year –1 ). Moreover, LIHD biofuels can be produced on agriculturally degraded lands and thus need to neither displace food production nor cause loss of biodiversity via habitat destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1964928696,"Biological organisms perform complex information processing and control tasks using sophisticated biochemical circuits, yet the engineering of such circuits remains ineffective compared with that of electronic circuits. To systematically create complex yet reliable circuits, electrical engineers use digital logic, wherein gates and subcircuits are composed modularly and signal restoration prevents signal degradation. We report the design and experimental implementation of DNA-based digital logic circuits. We demonstrate AND, OR, and NOT gates, signal restoration, amplification, feedback, and cascading. Gate design and circuit construction is modular. The gates use single-stranded nucleic acids as inputs and outputs, and the mechanism relies exclusively on sequence recognition and strand displacement. Biological nucleic acids such as microRNAs can serve as inputs, suggesting applications in biotechnology and bioengineering."

https://openalex.org/W1994160943,"Because animals require oxygen, an increase in late-Neoproterozoic oxygen concentrations has been suggested as a stimulus for their evolution. The iron content of deep-sea sediments shows that the deep ocean was anoxic and ferruginous before and during the Gaskiers glaciation 580 million years ago and that it became oxic afterward. The first known members of the Ediacara biota arose shortly after the Gaskiers glaciation, suggesting a causal link between their evolution and this oxygenation event. A prolonged stable oxic environment may have permitted the emergence of bilateral motile animals some 25 million years later."
https://openalex.org/W2080537888,"Global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) is an approach for reprogramming gene transcription to elicit cellular phenotypes important for technological applications. Here we show the application of gTME to Saccharomyces cerevisiae for improved glucose/ethanol tolerance, a key trait for many biofuels programs. Mutagenesis of the transcription factor Spt15p and selection led to dominant mutations that conferred increased tolerance and more efficient glucose conversion to ethanol. The desired phenotype results from the combined effect of three separate mutations in the SPT15 gene [serine substituted for phenylalanine (Phe 177 Ser) and, similarly, Tyr 195 His, and Lys 218 Arg]. Thus, gTME can provide a route to complex phenotypes that are not readily accessible by traditional methods."

https://openalex.org/W1978005636,"Vapor deposition has been used to create glassy materials with extraordinary thermodynamic and kinetic stability and high density. For glasses prepared from indomethacin or 1,3-bis-(1-naphthyl)-5-(2-naphthyl)benzene, stability is optimized when deposition occurs on substrates at a temperature of 50 K below the conventional glass transition temperature. We attribute the substantial improvement in thermodynamic and kinetic properties to enhanced mobility within a few nanometers of the glass surface during deposition. This technique provides an efficient means of producing glassy materials that are low on the energy landscape and could affect technologies such as amorphous pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W1985523694,"A long-standing question is whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) vary like Galactic black hole systems when appropriately scaled up by mass (refs 1-3). If so, we can then determine how AGN should behave on cosmological timescales by studying the brighter and much faster varying Galactic systems. As X-ray emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale, which potentially could tell us about the mass of the black hole, is found in the X-ray variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes (refs 1-6), but whether it is physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned (ref 7). Here we report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines in AGN whose widths (in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1 galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really are just scaled-up Galactic black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2062414996,"Humans behave altruistically in natural settings and experiments. A possible explanation-that groups with more altruists survive when groups compete-has long been judged untenable on empirical grounds for most species. But there have been no empirical tests of this explanation for humans. My empirical estimates show that genetic differences between early human groups are likely to have been great enough so that lethal intergroup competition could account for the evolution of altruism. Crucial to this process were distinctive human practices such as sharing food beyond the immediate family, monogamy, and other forms of reproductive leveling. These culturally transmitted practices presuppose advanced cognitive and linguistic capacities, possibly accounting for the distinctive forms of altruism found in our species."
https://openalex.org/W2041807499,"The Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera has acquired data that establish the present-day impact cratering rate and document new deposits formed by downslope movement of material in mid-latitude gullies on Mars. Twenty impacts created craters 2 to 150 meters in diameter within an area of 21.5 × 10 6 square kilometers between May 1999 and March 2006. The values predicted by models that scale the lunar cratering rate to Mars are close to the observed rate, implying that surfaces devoid of craters are truly young and that as yet unrecognized processes of denudation must be operating. The new gully deposits, formed since August 1999, are light toned and exhibit attributes expected from emplacement aided by a fluid with the properties of liquid water: relatively long, extended, digitate distal and marginal branches, diversion around obstacles, and low relief. The observations suggest that liquid water flowed on the surface of Mars during the past decade."

https://openalex.org/W1994333367,"Mounting evidence has revealed pathological interactions between HIV and malaria in dually infected patients, but the public health implications of the interplay have remained unclear. A transient almost one-log elevation in HIV viral load occurs during febrile malaria episodes; in addition, susceptibility to malaria is enhanced in HIV-infected patients. A mathematical model applied to a setting in Kenya with an adult population of roughly 200,000 estimated that, since 1980, the disease interaction may have been responsible for 8,500 excess HIV infections and 980,000 excess malaria episodes. Co-infection might also have facilitated the geographic expansion of malaria in areas where HIV prevalence is high. Hence, transient and repeated increases in HIV viral load resulting from recurrent co-infection with malaria may be an important factor in promoting the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa."

https://openalex.org/W2052709694,"Over the past decade, the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV) has repeatedly emerged in Gabon and Congo. Each human outbreak has been accompanied by reports of gorilla and chimpanzee carcasses in neighboring forests, but both the extent of ape mortality and the causal role of ZEBOV have been hotly debated. Here, we present data suggesting that in 2002 and 2003 ZEBOV killed about 5000 gorillas in our study area. The lag between neighboring gorilla groups in mortality onset was close to the ZEBOV disease cycle length, evidence that group-to-group transmission has amplified gorilla die-offs."
https://openalex.org/W1998384937,"We previously identified mutations in the Lpin1 gene, encoding lipin-1, as the underlying cause of lipodystrophy in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mutant mouse. Lipin-1 is normally expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and deficiency in the fld mouse causes impaired adipose tissue development, insulin resistance, and altered energy expenditure. We also identified two additional lipin protein family members of unknown function, lipin-2 and lipin-3. Han et al. (Han, G. S., Wu, W. I., and Carman, G. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 9210–9218) recently demonstrated that the single lipin homolog in yeast, Smp2, exhibits phosphatidate phosphatase type-1 (PAP1) activity, which has a key role in glycerolipid synthesis. Here we demonstrate that lipin-1 accounts for all of the PAP1 activity in white and brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. However, livers of lipin-1-deficient mice exhibited normal PAP1 activity, indicating that other members of the lipin protein family could have PAP1 activity. Consistent with this possibility, recombinant lipin-2 and lipin-3 possess PAP1 activity. Each of the three lipin family members showed Mg2+-dependent activity that was specific for phosphatidate under the conditions employed. The different lipins showed distinct tissue expression patterns. Our results establish the three mammalian lipin proteins as PAP1 enzymes and explain the biochemical basis for lipodystrophy in the lipin-1-deficient fld mouse.

Triacylglycerol (TAG) 3The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerol; C1P, ceramide 1-phosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatase (the NEM and Mg2+-insensitive PAP2 activities); NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PA, phosphatidate; PAP1, Mg2+-dependent and NEM inhibitable phosphatidate phosphatases (lipins); PC, phosphatidylcholine; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; wt, wild-type; RT, reverse transcription. plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis, serving as the major energy storage molecule that allows organisms to survive periods of food deprivation. The regulation of TAG storage is important in human disease because both excessive and inadequate fat storage is associated with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes (reviewed in Refs. 1Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Med. 2006; 119: S10-S16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 2Reue K. Phan J. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab.

Physiol. 2005; 289: R663-R669Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We previously characterized the fatty liver dystrophy mouse, a model of generalized lipodystrophy with impaired TAG storage in adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (4Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Reue K. Donkor J. Future Lipidol. 2006; 1: 91-101Crossref Google Scholar). Lipodystrophy in the fld mouse results from mutation in the Lpin1 (lipin-1) gene, the founding member of a family of three genes of previously unknown function (6Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Genes for lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3 occur in mammals and other vertebrates, whereas a single lipin gene ortholog can be detected in evolutionarily distant organisms including fruit fly, nematode, plants, and yeast (6Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This suggests a fundamental function for lipin that is conserved from single celled eukaryotes to mammals. In the mouse, lipin-1 is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, consistent with a role in lipid metabolism in these tissues. Indeed, adipocytes in lipin-1-deficient mice fail to accumulate TAG and do not develop mature adipocyte function (7Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By contrast, transgenic mice with enhanced lipin-1 expression in adipocytes accumulate more TAG per cell and are prone to obesity (7Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32883-32889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipin-1 expression levels are reduced in adipose tissue of human lipodystrophic patients concomitantly with reduced fat mass (10Lindegaard B. Larsen L.F. Hansen A.B. Gerstoft J. Pedersen B.K. Reue K. Int. J. Obes. (Lond.). 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A role for lipin-1 in muscle metabolism is suggested by increased energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation in the muscle of lipin-1-deficient mice and the opposite effects in muscle-specific lipin-1 transgenic mice (8Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, alterations in lipin-1 expression levels in either adipose tissue or skeletal muscle produce important physiological effects on energy storage and expenditure. In mammalian cells, the de novo biosynthesis of TAG, PC, and phosphatidylethanolamine is catalyzed mainly through the glycerol phosphate pathway (11Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Several enzymes in this pathway have been characterized, but not all of these have been identified at the molecular level. Among those for which a gene has not been isolated is the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (phosphatase) type-1 that converts the PA formed from glycerol phosphate and lysoPA to DAG (12Brindley D.N. Phosphatidate Phosphohydrolase: Its Role in Glycerolipid Synthesis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 21-77Google Scholar). There are two main types of PA phosphatase. The first is the type-1 activity (PAP1) that is characterized by its inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and a complete dependence on Mg2+ (12Brindley D.N. Phosphatidate Phosphohydrolase: Its Role in Glycerolipid Synthesis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 21-77Google Scholar, 13Jamal Z. Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the second activity (PAP2) is neither inhibited by NEM nor is it stimulated by Mg2+. There are three PAP2 enzymes that are integral membrane proteins (14Brindley D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). They catalyze the hydrolysis of a variety of lipid phosphate esters including lysoPA, C1P, S1P, and DAG pyrophosphate in addition to PA. Because of this and the uncertainty of the physiological substrates for these enzymes, the three PAP2 enzymes were renamed lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) (15Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These enzymes control signal transduction by the bioactive lipid phosphates compared with their dephosphorylated products (14Brindley D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the lipin-1-deficient fld mouse is consistent with a defect in TAG synthesis, raising the possibility that lipin-1 may perform a role in glycerolipid biosynthesis. Recently, Han et al. (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) reported a breakthrough in the identification of the Mg2+-dependent PAP1 activity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through protein sequencing, the yeast PAP1 is shown to be identical to Smp2, the yeast ortholog of mammalian lipin. Recombinant human lipin-1 expressed in Escherichia coli also shows PAP1 activity (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). However, the extrapolation of studies on yeast lipin to its role in mammals is complicated by the fact that mammals possess three lipin genes. Furthermore, alternative mRNA splicing of the mouse and human lipin-1 gene gives rise to two protein isoforms, lipin-1A and lipin-1B, which have distinct properties in adipocytes (9Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32883-32889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Specifically, the addition of 33 internal amino acids to the lipin-1B isoform leads to different expression dynamics during adipocyte differentiation, altered subcellular localization, and functional differences in induction of gene expression during adipocyte differentiation (5Reue K. Donkor J. Future Lipidol. 2006; 1: 91-101Crossref Google Scholar, 9Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32883-32889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here we utilize the fld mouse to establish the physiological role of lipin-1 as the sole PAP1 enzyme in adipose tissue and muscle, largely explaining the biochemical basis for lipodystrophy in these mice. We also determine that all known mammalian lipin family members and isoforms exhibit PAP1 activity that is specific for phosphatidate. The different lipins exhibit distinct tissue expression patterns, suggesting unique physiological roles for each in glycerolipid synthesis. Animals—C57BL/6J and BALB/cByJ-Lpin1+/fld mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The latter were bred to generate homozygous mutant (fld/fld) and wild-type (+/+) animals for studies. All mice were fed Purina 5001 mouse chow and were maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. Tissues were collected in the first 2 h of the light cycle. Animal studies were performed under approval of the UCLA animal care committee. Preparation of Labeled Lipid Phosphates—PA labeled with [3H]palmitate was prepared as described by Martin et al. (17Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). S1P plus lysoPA and C1P were labeled with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP and homogenates from Rat2 fibroblasts that overexpressed sphingosine kinase-1 and DAG kinase from E. coli, respectively. The labeled lipids were extracted and purified as described previously (18Waggoner D.W. Gómez-Muñoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These lipids were then added to preparations of the equivalent unlabeled lipids to obtain the desired specific radioactivity. RNA Quantitation by Real-time RT-PCR—A mouse tissue expression panel was produced from tissues of three C57BL/6J mice. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and cDNA synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the iCycler (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR reagents (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized to housekeeping genes, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and β-2 microglobulin. Expression in human tissues was performed using panels of normalized, first strand cDNA preparations (Human MTC Panel I and Digestive System MTC Panel) and from a pooled human adipose tissue sample (Clontech). Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. Lipin Expression Constructs—Expression vectors for lipin-1A, lipin-1B, lipin-2, and Lipin-3 were generated by PCR amplification of the coding region and subcloning into the pcDNA 3.1/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen) between the EcoRI/NotI restriction enzyme sites for lipin-1A, lipin-1B, and lipin-3 and the EcoRV/NotI restriction enzyme sites for lipin-2. Sequences for lipin cDNAs were as follows: lipin-1A, GenBank accession no. NM_172950; lipin-1B, NM_015763; lipin-2, NM_022882; lipin-3, NM_022883. All expression constructs were verified by sequencing. Primers used for PCR amplification are provided in supplemental Table S2. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed for PAP1 activity as described below. Measurement of PAP1 and PAP2 (LPP) Activities—Mouse tissues were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 2 mm dithiothreitol (to stabilize PAP1 activity), protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich). 293T cells were harvested in the same medium to which 0.15% Tween 20 was added to lyse the cells and internal membranes and ensure complete release of PAP1 activity. We showed previously that Tween 20 stabilizes and stimulates PAP1 activity (19Butterwith S.C. Hopewell R. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We designed an optimum assay (0.1 ml final volume) for PAP1 using 100 mm Tris/maleate buffer, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml fatty acid-poor bovine serum albumin and 0.6 mm PA labeled with [3H]palmitate (about 1 × 105 dpm/assay), which was dispersed in 0.4 mm PC and 1 mm EDTA that was used to prepare the lipid substrate (13Jamal Z. Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When Tween 20 was added to the cell extracts, its final concentration in the assay was adjusted to 0.05%. Reactions were stopped after incubation at 37 °C with 2.2 ml of chloroform containing 0.08% olive oil as carrier for neutral lipids. Then 0.8 g of basic alumina was added to adsorb the PA and any [3H]palmitate formed by phospholipase A type activities (17Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The tubes were centrifuged and 1 ml of chloroform, which contained the [3H]DAG product, was dried and quantitated by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations (measured by the Bradford method) and the times of incubation (normally 30 min) were adjusted so that <15% of the PA was consumed during the incubation. Total PAP activities were calculated from measurements at three different protein concentrations to ensure the proportionality of the assay. The dilution of the samples in the assay was adjusted to ensure that vanadate concentrations from the phosphatase inhibitor mixture were <500 μm so as not to inhibit PAP1 activity. Parallel incubations were performed in the presence of excess (5 mm) NEM to inhibit PAP1 and to compensate for any PAP2 (LPP) activity in this assay. This latter value was normally <10% of the total activity from which it was subtracted to give true PAP1 activity. More detailed kinetic analysis of the PAP1 activities for the different lipins was obtained using a surface dilution kinetic model essentially as described by Han et al. (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For this, we used lysates from the 293 cells that were diluted such that the final concentration of Tween 20 present in the assays was <1.22 μm. Each assay contained in a final volume of 0.1 ml: 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml fatty acid poor bovine serum albumin, and the appropriate concentrations of PA containing about 1.2 × 105 dpm. DAG formation was measured as described above; values obtained in the presence of 5 mm NEM were subtracted from those in its absence to obtain PAP1 activity. The level of PAP1 measured for the untransfected cells was negligible under these conditions such that the PAP1 reflected that of the overexpressed lipins. NEM-inhibited phosphatase activity against 8 mol % of PA was also compared against that obtained with equivalent concentrations of 32P-labeled lysoPA, S1P, or C1P (about 1 × 105 dpm/assay). Phosphatase activity was measured after the extraction of the inorganic [32P]phosphate as described previously (20Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the PAP1 activities was performed using the EZ-FIT enzyme model fitting program (21Perrella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). LPP activities were measured in the absence of a contribution from PAP1 by using assays with [3H]PA in micelles in Triton X-100 (20Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The incubations contained no PC or Mg2+, and excess (5 mm) NEM was added. The proportionality of the assay and purification and quantitation of [3H]DAG were achieved as described for PAP1. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Similar amounts of protein were elecrophoresed in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to an Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence at 700 nm was detected with the Odyssey infrared imaging system and quantified with Odyssey software. Mouse tissue Western blots were prepared from wild-type and fld tissue extracts and detected with a primary rabbit anti-lipin antibody (raised against the peptide SKTDSPSRKKDKRSRHLGADG) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare). Mammalian Lipins Possess the DXDXT Motif Characteristic of Mg2+-dependent Phosphatases—The yeast PAH1 protein sequence contains a haloacid dehalogenase domain, which includes a DXDXT motif found in a superfamily of Mg2+-dependent phosphatases (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This motif is also present in lipin proteins from other species, including mouse and human (data not shown). It occurs within the previously defined C-LIP domain (6Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and has the invariant sequence DIDGT in lipin-1 orthologs found in mammals, chicken, fish, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Ciona, and S. cerevisiae (www.ensembl.org). The DIDGT motif is also present in mammalian lipin-2 and -3 (data not shown) suggesting that all lipin proteins may exhibit PAP1 activity. Lipin-1 Is Responsible for PAP1 Activity in Adipose Tissue and Skeletal Muscle—The impaired TAG storage in adipose tissue and muscle of lipin-1-deficient fld mice suggested that lipin-1 could be the critical PAP1 enzyme in these tissues. To investigate this, we assayed several tissues from fld mice for PAP1 activity. As a control, we also determined the LPP activity, which is catalyzed by three enzymes that are unrelated in structure to the lipins. As shown in Fig. 1A, no significant PAP1 activity was detected in gonadal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue, in intrascapular brown adipose tissue, or in skeletal muscle of the fld mouse compared with the tissues from wild-type mice. Nor did we detect significant additional PAP activity in adipose tissue of the fld mice when we used the PAP1 assay in the presence or absence of NEM and with reduced (1 mm) or absent Mg2+ (results not shown). The specific activity (based upon cell protein) of PAP1 was 6–8-fold higher in white and brown adipose tissues of the control mice compared with that in liver and muscle. LPP activity was similar in tissues from control and fld mice, aside from slightly increased activity in the subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue depot (Fig. 1B). As described above, the specific activity of PAP1 in the liver of wild-type mice was much lower than that in adipose tissue. Consistent with the lower PAP1 activity levels, lipin-1 protein levels in wild-type liver were also much lower than those in adipose tissue (Fig. 2A). As expected, no lipin-1 protein was detected in tissues from the fld mouse; however, as shown in Fig. 1A, PAP1 activity in fld liver is comparable with wild-type. This raised the possibility that lipin-2 and/or lipin-3 may compensate for the absence of lipin-1 in fld liver. To investigate this possibility, we quantitated lipin-2 and lipin-3 mRNA levels in wild-type and fld liver. We found that both genes are expressed in liver, and that lipin-3 expression is increased 4-fold in fld compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that lipin-1 deficiency leads to an up-regulation of hepatic lipin-3 expression, which may account for the normal levels of total PAP1 activity in the liver of fld mice. To support this possibility, we investigated whether lipin-2 and lipin-3 also possess PAP1 enzyme activity. Lipin-2 and Lipin-3 Exhibit PAP1 Activity—The conservation of the Mg2+-dependent phosphatase motif in lipin-2 and lipin-3 suggested that these family members also have PAP1 activity. In addition, the existence of two lipin-1 protein isoforms derived from alternative mRNA splicing (lipin-1A and lipin-1B) raised the question of whether both lipin-1 isoforms exhibited PAP1 activity. The 33 amino acid difference between lipin-1A and lipin-1B isoforms does not affect the phosphatase active site motif, suggesting that both isoforms could exhibit PAP1 activity (9Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32883-32889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recombinant lipin proteins were expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 3A), and relative PAP1 activities were determined by normalization to the amount of lipin protein expressed as determined by the detection of a V5 epitope present at the C terminus of each recombinant protein (Fig. 3B). We found that both lipin-1 isoforms exhibited PAP1 activity (Fig. 3B). However, the B isoform consistently exhibited about 1.7-fold higher PAP1 activity when normalized to the V5 epitope. Lipin-2 and lipin-3 also had PAP1 activity, although at about one-fourth the relative specific activity of lipin-1A. These results were obtained under conditions where PAP1 activity was proportional to the amount of each lipin added to the assays, and they establish that all mammalian lipins have PAP1 activity. To investigate further the kinetics of the PAP1 activities of the three lipin proteins, we employed a surface dilution kinetic model using micelles of Triton X-100 (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, the activity of PAP1 in the control 293 cells was negligible, and all PAP1 activity was accounted for by the overexpressed lipin. The relative Vmax values calculated for the PAP1 activities of the lipins again showed that the activity for lipin-1B was greater than lipin-1A (Fig. 4A, Table 1). In this Triton X-100 micelle assay, the calculated Vmax for the PAP1 activity of lipin-2 was similar to that for lipin-1A, with lipin-3 showing lower relative activity. Each lipin exhibited a strong positive cooperativity for PA as demonstrated by the apparent Hill coefficient (Table 1). The apparent K50 values for the four lipins ranged from 7 to 9 mol %. Each of the lipins showed strong Mg2+-dependence (Fig. 4, B and C). These results confirm that all of the mammalian lipins possess PAP1 activity. However, the measurements were made with cell homogenates, and we cannot be certain that the kinetic constants reported will accurately reflect those of purified lipins. Furthermore, the PAP1 activities of the overexpressed lipins were extremely labile as measured by this assay.TABLE 1Apparent kinetic values for the PAP1 activity of mammalian lipinsLipin-1ALipin-1BLipin-2Lipin-3K508.7 ± 0.257.0 ± 0.187.0 ± 0.446.9 ± 0.6Vmax25 ± 1.930.5 ± 1.324.6 ± 2.18.7 ± 1Hill no.10 ± 2.35.9 ± 0.73.7 ± 0.54.3 ± 1 Open table in a new tab We also tested lysoPA, C1P, and S1P as substrates for the different lipins. Under the conditions used to study PA hydrolysis in the same experiment, we observed no significant Mg2+-dependent phosphatase activity with C1P, S1P, and lysoPA for any of the overexpressed lipins (results not shown). Mouse and Human Lipin-1, -2, and -3 Genes Exhibit Distinct Tissue expression Patterns—Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the three lipin family members exhibit unique, but overlapping, tissue distributions. Mouse lipin-1 was most prominent in skeletal muscle, with lower levels in adipose tissue depots, brain, and liver (Fig. 5A). These results differ from our previous observation that lipin-1 is expressed at equally high levels in mouse adipose tissue and muscle (6Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and may reflect a strain difference (C57BL/6J here versus BALB/cByJ in previous studies). In humans, lipin-1 mRNA was most abundant in adipose tissue followed by skeletal muscle, with lower expression detected in some portions of the digestive tract (Fig. 5B). Mouse and human lipin-2 were expressed at substantial levels in liver and brain, with human lipin-2 also exhibiting unexpectedly high expression in adipose tissue (Fig. 5, C and D). Lipin-3 showed a very distinct pattern, with significant expression primarily in intestine and other regions of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus, the tissue patterns observed in mouse and human are similar, aside from the high expression of lipin-2 detected in human, but not mouse, adipose tissue. The basis for this discrepancy may be a true biological difference. Alternatively, it may represent a peculiarity of the human pooled adipose tissue sample that was available. This came from unknown donors and unspecified adipose tissue depots. It should also be emphasized that different primer sets were used for the different lipins. Therefore, the relative expression values for mRNA can be compared for each lipin but not among the lipins. Overall, these results suggest that each of the lipin family members may perform similar biochemical functions but may act in a tissue-specific manner. Our results demonstrate for the first time that all three members of the mammalian lipin protein family exhibit NEM-inhibitable PAP1 activity. The lipin activities were specific for PA, and they depended upon Mg2+. The lipins exhibit strong cooperativity toward PA concentrations, which resembles the results of Han et al. (16Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) for yeast PAP1 (Pah1p) activity. No significant phosphatase activity was detected under the conditions used for the mammalian lipins against lysoPA, C1P, and S1P. Our results demonstrate that the mammalian lipins are distinct Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatases, which, unlike the LPPs (14Brindley D.N. J. Cell.

Whereas for bosonic particles the correlated noise observed for e.g. photons or bosonic neutral atoms can still be explained within a classical field description with fluctuating phases, the anticorrelations in the detection of fermionic particles have no classical analogue. The observation of such fermionic antibunching is so far scarce and has been confined to electrons and neutrons. Here we report on the first direct observation of antibunching of neutral fermionic atoms. Through an analysis of the atomic shot noise in a set of standard absorption images, of a gas of fermionic 40K atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced correlations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped atoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to characterise the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice. Moreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental fermionic many-body quantum phases in periodic potentials, which are at the focus of current research."

The permeation pathway exhibits an inward-facing conformation, in contrast to the outward-facing state previously observed for the homologous vitamin B 12 importer BtuCD. Although the structures of both HI1470/1 and BtuCD have been solved in nucleotide-free states, the pairs of ABC subunits in these two structures differ by a translational shift in the plane of the membrane that coincides with a repositioning of the membrane-spanning subunits. The differences observed between these ABC transporters involve relatively modest rearrangements and may serve as structural models for inward- and outward-facing conformations relevant to the alternating access mechanism of substrate translocation."

The excitatory phase promotes neuronal growth and integration into circuits. We show here that spontaneous nicotinic cholinergic activity is responsible for terminating GABAergic excitation and initiating inhibition. It does so by changing chloride transporter levels, shifting the driving force on GABA-induced currents. The timing of the transition is critical, because the two phases of GABAergic signaling provide contrasting developmental instructions. Synergistic with nicotinic excitation, GABAergic inhibition constrains neuronal morphology and innervation.

Here we report that the mechanism of 6 S RNA inhibition of transcription is through specific, stable interactions with the active site of Escherichia coli RNAP that exclude promoter DNA binding. In fact, the DNA-dependent RNAP uses bound 6 S RNA as a template for RNA synthesis, producing 14-to 20-nucleotide RNA products (pRNA). These results demonstrate that 6 S RNA is functionally engaged in the active site of RNAP. Synthesis of pRNA destabilizes 6 S RNA–RNAP complexes leading to release of the pRNA-6 S RNA hybrid. In vivo, 6 S RNA–directed RNA synthesis occurs during outgrowth from the stationary phase and likely is responsible for liberating RNAP from 6 S RNA in response to nutrient availability."

However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, membrane-associated <i>N</i>-acyltransferase (NAT) responsible for this reaction has not yet been cloned. In this study, on the basis of the functional similarity of NAT to lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), we examined a possible PE <i>N</i>-acylation activity in two rat LRAT homologous proteins. Upon overexpression in COS-7 cells, one protein, named rat LRAT-like protein (RLP)-1, catalyzed transfer of a radioactive acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to PE, resulting in the formation of radioactive NAPE. However, the RLP-1 activity was detected mainly in the cytosolic rather than membrane fraction and was little stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, RLP-1 did not show selectivity with respect to the <i>sn</i>-1 and <i>sn</i>-2 positions of PC as an acyl donor and therefore could generate <i>N</i>-arachidonoyl-PE (anandamide precursor) from 2-arachidonoyl-PC and PE. In contrast, under the same assay conditions, partially purified NAT from rat brain was highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, membrane-associated, and specific for the <i>sn</i>-1-acyl group of PC. RLP-1 mRNA was expressed predominantly in testis among various rat tissues, and the testis cytosol exhibited an RLP-1-like activity.

Bats famously orientate at night by echolocation1, but this works over only a short range, and little is known about how they navigate over longer distances2. Here we show that the homing behaviour of Eptesicus fuscus, known as the big brown bat, can be altered by artificially shifting the Earth's magnetic field, indicating that these bats rely on a magnetic compass to return to their home roost.

This surge in PhoP activity is due to PhoP positively activating its own transcription, because a strain constitutively expressing the PhoP protein attained steady-state levels of activation asymptotically, without the surge. The strain constitutively expressing the PhoP protein was attenuated for virulence in mice, demonstrating that the surge conferred by PhoP's positive feedback loop is necessary to jump-start Salmonella's virulence program."
https://openalex.org/W2025281291,"Recent work has demonstrated that some actively transcribed genes closely associate with nuclear pore complexes (NPC) at the nuclear periphery. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mlp1 and Mlp2 proteins are components of the inner nuclear basket of the nuclear pore that mediate interactions with these active genes. To investigate the physical link between the NPC and active loci, we identified proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of Mlp1 by tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry. This analysis led to the identification of several components of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) histone acetyltransferase complex, Gcn5, Ada2, and Spt7. We utilized co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays to confirm the interaction between the Mlp proteins and SAGA components. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Mlp1 and SAGA components associate with the same region of the GAL promoters. Critically, this Mlp-promoter interaction depends on the integrity of the SAGA complex.

We focused on the two Mlp proteins as they are localized to the nuclear basket of the NPC (15Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J.

The two evolutionarily conserved Mlp proteins, Mlp1 and Mlp2, are large (218 and 195 kDa, respectively), coiled-coil domain proteins localized to the nuclear side of the NPC where they are hypothesized to form the intranuclear filaments of the inner basket of the NPC (15Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Mlp proteins, which are 66% similar, consist of extensive NH2-terminal coiled-coil domains and globular acidic carboxyl-terminal domains (15Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the latter of which have been implicated in mRNA export and quality control via interactions with mRNA export factors (16Green D.M.

Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2004; 116: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). First, Mlp1 and Mlp2 interact with highly transcribed loci in genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (5Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Komili S. West J. Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In fact, a recent study demonstrated a requirement for Mlp1 in GAL locus recruitment to the nuclear periphery (14Dieppois G. Iglesias N. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7858-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Second, Mlp1 has been indirectly linked to the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) histone acetyltransferase complex through interactions between the Sac3-Thp1 mRNA export complex and the Sus1 component of SAGA (19Lei E.P.

Finally, the Drosophila Mlp homolog, Mtor, was found to be required for proper localization of the MSL histone acetyltransferase complex to the male X chromosome for transcription up-regulation of X-linked genes on the single copy of the male X chromosome (12Mendjan S. Taipale M. Kind J. Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Busciano A. Duncan K. Mueller J. Wilm M. Stunnenberg H.G. Saumweber H. Akhtar A. Mol.

In this study, we expressed the COOH-terminal globular domain of Mlp1 as a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged protein in yeast, purified the associated proteins, and identified these proteins via mass spectroscopy. With this approach, we identified three components of the evolutionarily conserved SAGA complex, a histone acetyltransferase complex that regulates transcription of ∼10% of the yeast genome (21Lee T.I.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). SAGA interacts with gene-specific transcriptional activators that recruit SAGA and additional transcription machinery to the promoters of target genes (26Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the case of the GAL genes, SAGA is recruited to the GAL upstream activating sequence (UAS) by the constitutively bound Gal4 protein when cells are grown in the absence of glucose and presence of galactose (27Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1301-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The SAGA complex then facilitates recruitment of the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (27Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1301-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As the SAGA complex regulates transcription of the GAL genes (23Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the GAL genes relocalize to the nuclear periphery upon transcriptional activation (5Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Komili S. West J. Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a physical interaction between Mlp proteins and the SAGA complex might mediate the recruitment of the GAL genes to the NPC. We verified the interaction between the Mlp proteins and SAGA components, and we found that both Mlp1 and Mlp2 interact with the GAL UAS, the region of the GAL genes that interacts with the SAGA complex. This interaction between the Mlp proteins and the GAL UAS only occurs in the presence of galactose, when the GAL genes are active, and depends upon the integrity of the SAGA complex. These results suggest that the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex at the GAL UAS may help to direct active GAL genes to the NPC, lending support to a model where chromatin modifying complexes facilitate interactions between the NPC and actively transcribed genes. Strains, Plasmids, and Chemicals—All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Second Edition.

The tandem affinity purification method was adapted from established protocols (30Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotech. 1999; 171030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 31Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Two-liter cultures of cells expressing TAP-tagged Mlp1 were grown to late log phase, and the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of extract buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF). Lysate was prepared using a French press at a pressure of 1200 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by spinning the lysate at 5000 × g for 15 min, followed by ultracentrifugation for 1 h. Protein collected in the supernatant fraction was dialyzed (4 h, 4 °C) against dialysis buffer (20 mm K-HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 20% glycerol). This clarified lysate was used to bind TAP-tagged proteins to IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were incubated with clarified lysate for 3 h at 4 °C, and TEV cleavage was performed with 30 units of TEV for 4 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h at 18 °C. Subsequent elution and purification was performed as described (31Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry identification was performed by the Emory University Microchemical and Proteomics Core Facility. Co-purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids expressing fusion proteins (GST-CT-Mlp1 and GST-CT-Mlp2), or control vector (GST alone). Cultures were grown to log phase on 2% galactose minimal media and then harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Cells were lysed in PBSMT (PBS, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF, 3 ng/ml pepstatin A, leupeptin, aproptinin, and chymostatin). GST-tagged proteins were purified from protein extracts by incubation overnight at 4 °C with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). The bound faction was washed 3 times and eluted from beads with loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 250 mm dithiothreitol, 5% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol). Lysate (25 μg of protein) and bound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting according to standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TAP-tagged proteins were detected with PAP antibody (Sigma). For experiments where nuclease treatment was used, lysate prepared from a common culture was divided into four aliquots and aliquots were treated with RNase (10 units/ml), DNase (10 units/ml), both nucleases, or left untreated (control) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by incubation at 4 °C for 50 min. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Cell lysate preparation and the purification of recombinant proteins were performed as recommended by the resin manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli by standard isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, and lysate was prepared from log phase cultures. GST and GST fusion proteins were purified from lysate by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. His6-tagged Gcn5 (His-Gcn5) was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose. In Vitro Binding Assay—For in vitro binding assays, 5 μg of GST or GST-fused protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose in PBS buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. After three washes with 1 ml of PBS buffer, 1 μg of purified, recombinant His-Gcn5 fusion protein was added to a volume of 1 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100). The mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound fractions were collected and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. The bound fraction was eluted by incubation with SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Bound and unbound fractions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST (Sigma) or anti-His (Santa Cruz) antibodies. ChIP Analysis—ChIP was performed essentially as described (32Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-ml cultures were grown to log phase (A600 ∼0.8–0.9). Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% for 20 min. Cross-linking was quenched by addition of 270 mm glycine for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with chilled TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and once with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors mixture (0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A)). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and cells were lysed using glass beads. Chromatin was collected in the supernatant fraction and sheared by sonication to ∼200-bp fragments. The chromatin solution was bound to prewashed, IgG beads for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from beads by heating for 10 min at 65 °C in elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). To reverse cross-linking, samples were incubated with proteinase K for 1 h at 42 °C followed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. Samples were purified using Qiagen columns and analyzed by quantitative PCR using gene-specific primer pairs. The fraction of immunoprecipitated material for a specific fragment was calculated by dividing the amount of PCR product obtained from immunoprecipitated DNA by the amount obtained from total DNA (IP/Input). RNA Isolation—Cells grown in 10-ml cultures of glucose or galactose were pelleted and washed twice with chilled diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of LET buffer (100 mm LiCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA), and then 200 μl of phenol and 100 μl of glass beads were added to the resuspension. Cells were subjected to a brief heat shock at 65 °C and lysed by bead beating for 4 min with 2-min intervals on ice. Debris was removed by brief centrifugation. The aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh tube containing 200 μl of phenol, vortexed, and centrifuged for 5 min. RNA was isolated from the aqueous layer by chloroform extraction and was precipitated at -80 °C for 30 min using 40 μl of 3 m NaOAc and 1 ml of EtOH. The RNA pellet was collected by spinning the mixture at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 70% EtOH and dried on ice, then resuspended in RNase-free water for further analysis. RT-PCR—Synthesis of cDNA from samples grown in glucose and galactose was performed with an Invitrogen SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit. Amplification reactions to detect relative cDNA levels included 1 μl of cDNA and 300 nm gene-specific forward and reverse primers. Samples were amplified with 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). Each PCR was performed in triplicate and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative Real Time PCR—GAL transcript lev"

In mice and humans, mutations in either of the corresponding genes lead to defects in vascular development. The present work is aimed at defining the sequence determinants of binding specificity between Norrin and the Fz4 amino-terminal ligand-binding domain (the “cysteine-rich domain” (CRD)). The principal conclusions are as follows: 1) Norrin binds to the Fz4 CRD and does not detectably bind to the 14 other mammalian Frizzled and secreted Frizzled-related protein CRDs; 2) Norrin and Xenopus Wnt8 recognize largely overlapping regions of the Fz4 CRD; 3) surface determinants on the Fz4 and Fz8 CRDs that allow Norrin to distinguish between these two CRDs reside within several small regions on one face of the CRD; 4) Norrin function depends critically on three pairs of cysteines that form the highly conserved trio of disulfide bonds shared among all cystine knot proteins, but the remaining two putative disulfide bonds are less important; 5) Norrin-CRD binding depends on a largely contiguous group of amino acids in the extended β-sheet domain of Norrin that are predicted to face away from the interface between the two monomers in the Norrin homodimer; 6) Norrin-CRD binding is strongly modulated by interactions involving charged amino acid side chains; and 7) Norrin-CRD binding is enhanced ∼10-fold by the addition of heparin. These observations are discussed in the context of Frizzled signaling and the structure and function of other cystine knot proteins.

The Frizzled family of cell surface receptors is present throughout the animal kingdom, with 10, four, and three family members encoded in the genomes of mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively. The Frizzleds play an essential role in processes as diverse as embryonic segment polarity, midgut development, and bristle orientation in Drosophila, and axon guidance, retinal vascular development, and hair follicle orientation in mice (1Gubb D.

Like Wnts, Norrin associates with the extracellular matrix, which limits its range of action to those target cells immediately surrounding its site of synthesis. Thus, Norrin appears to function in many respects like a Wnt despite a complete absence of primary sequence homology with the Wnt family. In this paper, we have addressed several questions raised by the discovery that Norrin and Fz4 constitute a ligand-receptor pair. First, how selective is the binding of Norrin to the Fz4 CRD as compared with other Frizzled and sFRP CRDs? Second, which regions of the Fz4 CRD are responsible for Norrin binding, and what is the relationship of these regions to those responsible for Wnt binding? Finally, which regions of Norrin are involved in Fz4 binding and canonical pathway activation? As described below, Norrin has the ability to discriminate between the Fz4 CRD and the 14 other mammalian Frizzled and sFRP CRDs, and by site-directed mutagenesis we delimit the regions on both Norrin and Fz4 responsible for this recognition. These results have implications for other ligand-receptor families in which closely related proteins exhibit differential recognition of potential binding partners. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were constructed by tandem PCR. All DNA segments derived from PCR were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to rule out spurious mutations. Production of Xenopus Wnt8 (Xwnt8), Norrin, and Fz4 CRD Fusion Proteins—AP-3Myc-Norrin was secreted from transiently transfected 293 cells using a vector with a cytomegalovirus immediate early gene enhancer and promotor; the AP-3Myc-Norrin was collected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10% calf serum and stored at 4 °C. Xwnt8-Myc-AP was produced under the control of a metallothionein promotor in stably transfected hygromycin-resistant Drosophila S2 cells. The secreted fusion protein was collected in Schneider Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10% calf serum, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 0.5 mm CuSO4 and stored at 4 °C. To produce Fz CRD-IgG fusion proteins, the CRD (i.e. the 114-amino acid region extending from the first to the tenth conserved CRD cysteine) was inserted between MluI and ApaI sites in a vector that contains a cytomegalovirus immediate early gene enhancer and promotor, followed by DNA coding for the mouse Fz8 signal peptide, the site for CRD insertion, 25 amino acids of Fz8 “linker” sequence immediately COOH-terminal to the Fz8 CRD, and the constant region of human IgG. CRD-IgG fusion proteins were secreted from transiently transfected 293 cells, collected in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing penicillin/streptomycin, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Binding to Cell Surface CRD-Myc-GPI—To display CRDs at the cell surface, each CRD was inserted between MluI and ApaI sites in a vector that contains a cytomegalovirus immediate early gene enhancer and promotor followed by DNA coding for the mouse Fz8 signal peptide, the site of CRD insertion, 25 amino acids of Fz8 “linker” sequence immediately COOH-terminal to the Fz8 CRD, a Myc epitope, and the COOH-terminal GPI-anchoring peptide from decay activating factor (10Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The CRD-Myc-GPI vectors were transiently transfected with Fugene 6 into COS cells that were grown on uncoated circular glass coverslips in 24-well trays in 293 cell medium as described above. Two days after transfection, the coverslips were incubated in fresh growth medium lacking bicarbonate and containing Xwnt8-Myc-AP conditioned medium (diluted 1:2) or AP-3Myc-Norrin conditioned medium (diluted 1:5) or in fresh growth medium lacking bicarbonate and containing 0.1% calf serum with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (ascites diluted 1:1,000). After gentle rocking at 4 °C for 2 h, the coverslips were washed four times with PBS supplemented with 1 mm calcium and 1 mm magnesium (PBS/Ca/Mg), fixed in 0.5% gluteraldehyde in PBS/Ca/Mg at room temperature for 15 min, washed twice with PBS/Ca/Mg, and heated in a water bath at 65 °C for 90 min to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase (AP). Immobilized AP was visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Quantitative Binding to CRD-IgG Fusion Proteins—The wells of a 96-well plate carrying immobilized protein A (Reacti-Bind plates; Pierce) were coated with CRD-IgG fusion proteins by incubating overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of a 1:5 dilution of CRD-IgG in serum-free conditioned medium, an amount of CRD-IgG that appears to saturate the binding capacity of the wells. The wells were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 3 h at room temperature; washed three times with PBS/Ca/Mg, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; and incubated with serial 2-fold dilutions of Xwnt8-Myc-AP, AP-3Myc-Norrin, or AP-conjugated anti-human IgG. After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times in PBS/Ca/Mg, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and once in PBS/Ca/Mg, and the bound AP activity was measured using a soluble 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/tetrazolium enzyme assay (Blue-Phos; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). For comparisons of Fz4 CRD-IgG binding between wild type (WT) AP-3Myc-Norrin and the various AP-3Myc-Norrin mutants, the relative concentration of AP in the conditioned medium was determined for each construct using the BluePhos substrate. The relative efficiency of binding was determined by comparing the binding signal at the interpolated midpoint of the WT AP-3Myc-Norrin dilution series (i.e. between dilutions of 1:2 and 1:4; geometric mean, 1:2.8) with the binding signal at the interpolated point along the dilution series of each mutant AP-3Myc-Norrin, corresponding to an AP concentration in the conditioned medium equivalent to the 1:2.8 dilution of the WT AP-3Myc-Norrin. By performing all of the binding assays with a dilution series of the AP fusion protein, quantitative comparisons with the WT could be made despite ∼3-fold variations in AP yield between the different AP-3Myc-Norrin conditioned media. Two independent preparations of AP-3Myc-Norrin conditioned medium were tested for each Norrin mutant. Heparin Binding—For heparin affinity purification of AP-3Myc-Norrin, 0.25 ml of heparin-Sepharose (Sigma) was washed three times with PBS/calcium/magnesium and then incubated with 5 ml of AP-3Myc-Norrin in complete conditioned medium (described above) at room temperature for 3 h with gentle end-over-end rotation. The resin was transferred to a column and washed with PBS/calcium/magnesium, and the AP-3Myc-Norrin was eluted with PBS/calcium/magnesium containing 1 m NaCl. The partially purified AP-3Myc-Norrin was diluted with 7 volumes 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, calcium/magnesium supplemented with 0.01% bovine serum albumin (to reduce the final NaCl concentration to 150 mm) and stored at 4 °C. Binding to Fz4 CRD-IgG that had been captured onto protein A microwells was performed in the presence of various concentrations of porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma). Luciferase Assays—For a typical luciferase assay, a G418-resistant stable 293 cell line (STF cells) (7Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J. Cell. 2004; 116: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) carrying the Super Top Flash firefly luciferase reporter of canonical Wnt signaling (a construct with seven tandem LEF/TCF binding sites) was transfected in triplicate in a 24-well tray using Fugene 6 with the following quantities of expression plasmid DNA per well: Norrin, 50 ng; Fz4, 50 ng; Lrp6, 50 ng; Renilla luciferase, 1 ng. Two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and assayed using the Promega dual luciferase assay reagents. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the co-expressed Renilla luciferase activity, and the average of the triplicate samples was determined. Modeling Fz4 CRD and Norrin Structures—The locations of different amino acid side chains on the Fz4 CRD surface were modeled by highlighting the corresponding residues in the high resolution Fz8 CRD crystal structure (11Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) using the program PyMol (available on the World Wide Web at pymol.sourceforge.net/). The amino acid sequences of the Fz4 and Fz8 CRDs align without recourse to insertion or deletion. To model the three-dimensional structure of Norrin, we first superimposed the structures of TGF-β family members TGF-β2 (Protein Data Bank code 2TGI) (27Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), TGF-β3 (Protein Data Bank code 1TGJ) (28Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), BMP7 (Protein Data Bank code 1BMP) (29Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and BMP2 (Protein Data Bank code 2GOO) (30Allendorph G.P. Vale W.W. Choe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7643-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) using the program CCP4mg (31Potterton E. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Cowtan K. Noble M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2002; 58: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This superposition was then used to align the amino acid sequences of these proteins. The subunits of TGF-β family dimers consist of two extended β-hairpins separated by an α-helical region. Each of the four β strands that make up the two hairpins contains cysteines that are conserved between TGF-β family members and Norrin and anchor alignment of the β-strand regions of Norrin with the TGF-β/BMP sequences. Branching out from these cysteines, a conserved pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues is evident between Norrin and the TGF-β family members in conserved secondary structure elements, which enabled reliable alignment of these regions of Norrin and TGF-β sequences (see Fig. 6). This sequence alignment was then used to identify sites on the BMP2 structure homologous to positions in the Norrin amino acid sequence. Since no TGF-β family member stands out as more related to Norrin, BMP2 was chosen for modeling because there is a relatively high resolution structure (2.2 Å), and a structure of BMP2 complexed with both types of TGF-β receptor allows comparison of these sites with interaction sites identified on Norrin. Norrin Binds Only to the Fz4 CRD—To assess Norrin and Wnt binding to various CRD targets, we employed AP fusion proteins as probes. For Xwnt8, a fusion with a Myc epitope and AP at the COOH terminus was produced in soluble form from stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells (10Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); for human Norrin, a fusion with AP and three Myc epitopes at the NH2 terminus was produced in soluble form from transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Both AP fusion proteins were collected in medium containing 10% serum and, unless otherwise noted, were used for binding assays without further purification. Signaling assays were performed with a β-catenin-responsive luciferase reporter in stably transfected 293 cells transiently expressing Fz4, Lrp6, and human Norrin carrying a COOH-terminal rhodopsin tag (Fig. 1A). For binding assays, the CRD targets were presented in two formats (Fig. 1). In the first format, the CRD was displayed as a Myc-tagged and GPI-anchored protein on the surface of transfected COS cells, and binding was performed with live cells. Cell surface localization and accessibility of the CRD was confirmed for each CRD construct by incubating live cells with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. In this format, the assay measures binding in the context of plasma membrane lipids, glycoconjugates, and cell-associated extracellular matrix molecules. Cell surface binding was scored qualitatively based on the average AP intensity per cell (Fig. 1B). In the second format, the CRD was expressed as a fusion to the constant region of human IgG, which was then immobilized in protein A-coated microwells. Binding in this context occurs free of cell-associated molecules and was scored quantitatively (Fig. 1, C and D). To systematically assess the specificity of Norrin-Fz4 binding, each of the 10 Frizzled and five sFRP CRDs encoded in the mouse genome was displayed on the surface of transfected COS cells and probed with anti-Myc, AP-3Myc-Norrin, or Xwnt8-Myc-AP. As seen in Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1, all 15 CRDs accumulate at the cell surface, and four of them (from Fz4, Fz5, Fz7, and Fz8) efficiently bind Xwnt8-Myc-AP. In previous work, we had assayed the CRDs of Fz2-Fz8 for AP-Myc-Norrin binding and observed binding only to the Fz4 CRD (7Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J. Cell. 2004; 116: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Here we extend this analysis to the complete set of mammalian CRDs and observe that only the Fz4 CRD shows detectable AP-3Myc-Norrin binding. A dendrogram showing the related-ness of the 15 mouse CRD sequences does not place the Fz4 CRD sequence on an outlying branch within this family, implying that relatively modest sequence differences between Fz4 and the other 14 CRDs are responsible for the ability of Norrin to uniquely recognize Fz4. Identifying CRD Sequences Involved in Norrin Binding—To define sequences within the Fz4 CRD responsible for its selective recognition by Norrin, we first used the high resolution x-ray structure of the Fz8 CRD to predict which Fz4 CRD amino acids are likely to be exposed at the protein surface. Since the Fz4 and Fz8 CRD sequences align without insertion or deletion and are identical at 46 of the 114 positions, including the 10 conserved cysteines, it is likely that the α-carbon positions of the Fz4 CRD closely match those of the Fz8 CRD (Fig. 3B). By way of comparison, the Fz8 and sFRP3 CRDs are identical at 52 of 114 positions with two insertions/deletions, and their x-ray structures show nearly identical tertiary structures with a root mean square deviation of 0.97 Å for 101 of 122 α-carbons (11Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Three strategies were used to create Fz4 CRD sequence variants for binding assays. In the first, amino acids predicted to reside on the surface of the Fz4 CRD were mutated to alanine in 12 groups of 2-5 residues/group (Fz4 alanine scanning; Fig. 3, A, D, and E). In the second strategy, analogous block substitutions were generated, but in this case only those amino acids that differed between Fz4 and Fz8 and were predicted to reside on the surface were mutated; at each position, the Fz8 amino acid was inserted in place of its counterpart in Fz4 (Fz8 blocks into Fz4; Fig. 3, A and C). In the third strategy, nine chimeras between Fz4 and Fz8 CRDs were generated, such that each had only a single junction between Fz4 and Fz8 sequences (i.e. the NH2-terminal region was derived from Fz4 and the COOH-terminal region from Fz8 or the reverse; Fz4/Fz8 chimeras or Fz8/Fz4 chimeras, respectively; Fig. 3A). In all of these strategies, the cysteines were left unaltered. Because both Fz4 and Fz8 CRDs bind to Xwnt8-Myc-AP but only the Fz4 CRD binds to AP-3Myc-Norrin, we would predict that all correctly folded CRD constructs generated with the second and third strategies would retain Xwnt8-Myc-AP binding, and, among these, differences in AP-3Myc-Norrin binding would reflect sequence differences between Fz4 and Fz8 that are relevant to the specific recognition of Fz4 by Norrin. CRDs generated with each of the three strategies were expressed as Myc-GPI-anchored proteins and tested for binding to anti-Myc, Xwnt8-Myc-AP, and AP-3Myc-Norrin (Table 1 and Fig. 3E). All of the CRD constructs accumulate at the cell surface, and approximately half show binding to both Xwnt8-Myc-AP and AP-3Myc-Norrin that is comparable with the WT Fz4 CRD. For this subset of mutants, we can conclude that the CRD tertiary structure is largely unperturbed and that the mutated surface region is unlikely to be critically involved in AP-3Myc-Norrin or Xwnt8-Myc-AP binding. For the remaining CRD mutants that are variably defective in binding, the defects in Xwnt8-Myc-AP and AP-3Myc-Norrin binding are closely correlated (Table 1 and Fig. 3E). Although these data cannot distinguish between binding defects due to a distortion of tertiary structure and those due to defects in residues that have direct contact with the ligand, the surface locations of the alanine scanning and Fz8 block substitutions argue for the latter as the more likely explanation. We infer, therefore, that AP-3Myc-Norrin and Xwnt8-Myc-AP bind to largely overlapping sites on the CRD. The surface regions defined here for Xwnt8-Myc-AP binding are in good agreement with the regions defined by earlier mutagenesis studies using the Fz8 and Drosophila Fz2 CRDs (10Hsieh J.C. Rattner A.

https://openalex.org/W2022422465,"A long-standing and unverified prediction of binary star evolution theory is the existence of a population of white dwarfs accreting from substellar donor stars. Such systems ought to be common, but the difficulty of finding them, combined with the challenge of detecting the donor against the light from accretion, means that no donor star to date has a measured mass below the hydrogen burning limit. We applied a technique that allowed us to reliably measure the mass of the unseen donor star in eclipsing systems. We were able to identify a brown dwarf donor star, with a mass of 0.052 +/- 0.002 solar mass. The relatively high mass of the donor star for its orbital period suggests that current evolutionary models may underestimate the radii of brown dwarfs."
https://openalex.org/W2045421142,"Cross-talks among intracellular signaling pathways are important for the regulation of cell fate decisions and cellular responses to extracellular signals. Both the Notch pathway and the MAPK pathways play important roles in many biological processes, and the Notch pathway has been shown to interact with the ERK-type MAPK pathway. However, its interaction with the other MAPK pathways is unknown. Here we show that Notch signaling activation in C2C12 cells suppresses the activity of p38 MAPK to inhibit myogenesis. Our results show that Notch specifically induces expression of MKP-1, a member of the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase, which directly inactivates p38 to negatively regulate C2C12 myogenesis. The Notch-induced expression of MKP-1 is shown to depend on RBP-J. Moreover, inhibition of MKP-1 expression by short interfering RNA suppresses p38 inactivation and partially rescues the negative regulation of myogenesis. These results reveal a novel cross-talk between the Notch pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway that is mediated by Notch induction of MKP-1.

Our results show that Notch specifically induces expression of MKP-1, a member of the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase, which directly inactivates p38 to negatively regulate C2C12 myogenesis. The Notch-induced expression of MKP-1 is shown to depend on RBP-J. Moreover, inhibition of MKP-1 expression by short interfering RNA suppresses p38 inactivation and partially rescues the negative regulation of myogenesis. These results reveal a novel cross-talk between the Notch pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway that is mediated by Notch induction of MKP-1. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; MHC, myosin heavy chain; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DM, differentiation medium. pathways regulate a vast array of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Extracellular stimuli induce the activating phosphorylation of MAPKs, and activated MAPKs phosphorylate downstream targets, such as transcription factors, and modulate their function. To date, at least four subfamily members of the MAPK family have been identified as follows: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38, and ERK5 (1Chang L.

Phosphorylated and activated MAPKs are dephosphorylated and inactivated by serine/threonine phosphatases, tyrosine phosphatases, and/or MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), a subfamily member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family. MKPs inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating both threonine and tyrosine residues within the activation motif of MAPKs. In mammals, 10 members of the MKPs have been reported, and they share sequence homology and are highly specific for MAPKs but differ in the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli (5Camps M.

The Notch pathway also regulates a wide variety of cellular responses, including cell differentiation and cell fate decision. Notch protein, a single transmembrane receptor, is activated by ligands, such as Delta and Jagged. Once activated, Notch is cleaved, and the cleaved Notch intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to RBP-J (also called CBF-1), a DNA-binding protein, and mastermind (MAM), a chromatin modification protein. This complex then acts as a transcription factor and activates the transcription of many target genes, such as the Hes family (9Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

However, cross-talks between the Notch pathway and the MAPK pathways have remained unclear. Skeletal muscle differentiation, termed myogenesis, is an ideal model system to examine possible cross-talks between the MAPK pathways and the Notch pathway, because it has been reported that both signaling pathways play an important role in the process. During myogenesis, muscle precursors exit from the cell cycle, differentiate, and fuse into large multinucleated myotubes. p38, a member of the MAPK family, promotes myogenesis (14Cuenda A. Cohen P.

Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERK5, the other member of the MAPK family, also positively regulates myogenesis (20Dinev D. Jordan B.W. Neufeld B. Lee J.D. Lindemann D. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of the Notch pathway inhibits myogenesis (13Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T.

However, the interaction of the Notch pathway with the MAPK pathways has been unknown in myogenesis. In this study, we have addressed the possibility of a cross-talk between the MAPK pathways and the Notch pathway, and we found that the Notch pathway suppresses p38 MAPK activity by specifically inducing MKP-1, a member of the MKP family. Our results show that MKP-1 up-regulation inhibits myogenesis and contributes to the Notch inhibition of myogenesis. These findings identify a novel cross-talk between the Notch pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway. Cell Culture—C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (growth medium). To induce differentiation, growth medium was replaced with DMEM containing 3% horse serum (differentiation medium; DM) when cells were 90% confluent. Plasmids and Transfection—The cDNA encoding an intracellular domain of mouse Notch was a kind gift from M. Nakafuku. The cDNA of RBP-J was isolated by PCR from C2C12 cells, and the cDNA of mouse RBP-J (R218H) was then prepared by mutagenesis. The cDNA encoding human CL100/MKP-1 was kindly provided by S. Keyse. All cDNAs were subcloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector or a pCA-MCS adenoviral construction vector (26Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 2963-2971PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for the mouse Mkp-1 promoter was isolated by PCR from the mouse brain genome library and ligated into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Plasmids were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA and Transfection—RNA oligonucleotides (21 nucleotides) homologous to mouse MKP-1 were designed as follows: forward, 5′-CUA GAA ACU UCA UGC UUG ATT-3′; reverse; 5′-UCA AGC AUG AAG UUU CUA GTT-3′. Control siRNA and RBP-J siRNA were purchased from Ambion. siRNA was transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of Recombinant Adenovirus—AdV-CA-lacZ, adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase driven by the CAG promoter, was a kind gift from S. Takada. Construction of recombinant viruses was performed according to the methods described previously (27Moriyoshi K. Richards L.J. Akazawa C. O'Leary D.D. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In brief, recombinant adenoviruses were obtained by homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells, which were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 containing with 10% FBS. HEK 293 cells cultured in 6-well plates were co-transfected with viral genome fragments and linearized adenoviral shuttle vector plasmids (pCA-MCS) using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Generation of the recombinant adenovirus was screened by immunostaining and immunoblotting. The recombinant adenoviruses were amplified and purified by CsCl2 step-gradient centrifugation. Viral titer was measured by using Adeno-X rapid titer kit (Clontech). For viral infection, the purified adenoviruses (2 × 107 ifu/ml) were added to the medium. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 17 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm vanadate, and 1% Triton-X). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Antibodies specific for α-tubulin (Sigma), myogenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MHC (MF20), MKP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (Sigma), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling), p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-JNK (Promega), JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ERK5 (Sigma) were used. In some cases, the intensity of the immunoblotting bands was quantified, and the amount of phosphorylated p38 was evaluated by normalizing the intensity of immunoblotting data for phospho-p38 to that for p38. RT-PCR Analysis—Whole-cell RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Total RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligonucleotide random hexamers. Prepared cDNA was purified and subjected to quantitative PCR analysis by using Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics) with the SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The primers for the PCR analysis were as follows: for MKP-1, 5′-CTCCAAGGAGGATATGAAGCG-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGCATCCTTGATGGAGTC-3′; for MKP-2, 5′-GTGGAAATCCTCCCTTTCCTCTAC-3′ and 5′-GATGTCGGCCTTGTGGTTGTCTTC-3′; for MKP-3, 5′-GCCCAATCTGTTTGAGAATGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTTCGAAGTCAAGCAGCTGG-3′; for MKP-4, 5′-CATCCTTCCCTGTCCAGATCCTG-3′ and 5′-CGGAGATGGGGATCTGCTTGTAG-3′; for MKP-5, 5′-CTCGAGCATGCTACCTCAGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTGAGCTTCCTCGATGAAC-3′; for MKP-7, 5′-GGTGGCTTTGCTGAGTTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCCATTGGAGGCTTTTGC-3′; for PAC-1, 5′-CCCTCCTGAATGTCTCTTCAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCCATGAAGCTGAAGTTG-3′; for M3/6, 5′-CTGTGAGAGCCGTTTCATGCGT-3′ and 5′-CCAAGTGAGGTCCATCAGTCTG-3′; for Pyst-2, 5′-GTGAGACTAACGTGGACAGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GCCAAGTACATCCAGGTTGGTAG-3′; for B23, 5′-GTGGATGTGAAGCCCACCTCAC-3′ and 5′-CACGGGGATCCACTTGTAGTGTAG-3′; for myogenin, 5′-CAACCAGCGGCTGCCTAAAGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCTCCTGGGTTGGGACCGAACTCC-3′; for RBP-J, 5′-GAATGTACTTGTGCCTTTCTCAAGAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTAAGTTCAAGGATTGCTACGTCCCC-3′; and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CATCCACTGGTGCTGCCAAGGCTGT-3′ and 5′-ACAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGCCCA-3′. Luciferase Assay—Cells split onto 12-well dishes were harvested for assay 24 h after transfection. The luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega). To determine the transfection efficiency, the co-expressed β-galactosidase activity was measured, and the data were normalized for β-galactosidase activities. mRNA Stability Assay—Cells were treated with actinomycin D(5 μg/ml) and harvested 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after treatment. The rate of the decrease of MKP-1 mRNA was examined by RT-PCR. To investigate the possible cross-talk between the Notch pathway and the MAPK pathways during myogenesis, we used the C2C12 myogenic cell line. When C2C12 cells are cultured in differentiation medium (DM) for 2–3 days, they differentiate to multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1A) and express muscle lineage-specific genes such as myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MHC) (Fig. 1B). Expression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which activates the Notch signaling pathway, in C2C12 cells inhibited the formation of myotubes (Fig. 1A) and abolished the expression of myogenin and MHC completely (Fig. 1B), indicating that Notch signaling activation inhibits C2C12 myogenesis, as reported previously (13Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4133-4141PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined whether activation of the Notch pathway affects the activities of MAPKs during myogenesis. We expressed NICD with adenovirus in C2C12 cells and cultured the cells in DM for several days, and we examined the phosphorylation states of MAPKs by immunoblotting. Among the four MAPK family members, the amount of phosphorylated p38 was decreased when NICD was expressed (Fig. 1C), suggesting that p38 activity is suppressed by NICD expression. The phosphorylation states of ERK1/2, JNK, and ERK5 were not affected (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the Notch pathway specifically inhibits the p38 pathway in myogenesis. As p38 plays an important role in myogenesis, the inhibition of p38 activity is likely to be an important factor for Notch inhibition of myogenesis. We hypothesized that a member of the MKP family is responsible for p38 inactivation induced by the Notch pathway. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of NICD expression on the mRNA level of each MKP in C2C12 cells. Among the MKP members, an expression level of MKP-1 mRNA was elevated markedly by NICD expression (Fig. 2A). The amount of MKP-1 mRNA started to increase within 5 h after infection of adenovirus containing NICD and almost attained the plateau level within 24 h (Fig. 2A, inset). Accordingly, the amount of MKP-1 protein was also increased by NICD expression (Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate that Notch signaling induces up-regulation of MKP-1 expression in C2C12 cells. As MKP-1 mRNA was not induced by NICD in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), this induction of MKP-1 may be cell type-specific. Because it has been reported that MKP-1 preferentially dephosphorylates p38 and JNK (28Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), it is likely that induction of MKP-1 expression mediates, at least in part, Notch-induced inactivation of p38 (see below). Recently, it has been reported that during Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development, lin-12 (C. elegans Notch) up-regulates lip-1, a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian MKP-3, and negatively regulates mpk-1 (C. elegans ERK1/2) (29Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, because MKP-3, unlike MKP-1, acts preferentially on ERK1/2, the Notch pathway interacts with the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in this C. elegans system. Therefore, it is attractive to hypothesize that Notch induction of MKP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, and the difference in the target MAPK pathway with which the Notch pathway interacts may be caused by the difference in the induced MKP. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the Notch pathway induces up-regulation of MKP-1 mRNA in C2C12 cells. The stability of MKP-1 mRNA was not significantly affected by expression of NICD (data not shown), suggesting that the Notch pathway increases the MKP-1 mRNA transcription. To determine whether Notch could enhance the transcription from the Mkp-1 promoter, we generated four luciferase reporter constructs containing parts of the Mkp-1 promoter region. MKP1A-Luc, MKP1B-Luc, MKP1C-Luc, and MKP-1D Luc contain the Mkp-1 promoter region from -902 to +0, from -2005 to -903, from -5015 to -2006, and from -5015 to +0, respectively (Fig. 3A). Although NICD expression did not increase the luciferase activities of MKP1A-Luc and MKP1B-Luc, it caused 4- and 3-fold increases of the luciferase activity of MKP1C-Luc and MKP1D-Luc, respectively (Fig. 3A). This result shows that the Notch pathway increases the transcription of MKP-1 and suggests that the region responsible for induction by Notch is mapped between -5015 and -2006 bp upstream from the transcription start site of the MKP-1. There are RBP-J-dependent and -independent pathways in Notch signaling (30Martinez Arias A. Zecchini V. Brennan K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and both pathways are suggested to contribute to Notch inhibition of myogenesis (25Ordentlich P. Lin A. Shen C.P. Blaumueller C. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Nofziger D. Miyamoto A. Lyons K.M. Weinmaster G. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1689-1702PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether Notch induction of MKP-1 was dependent on RBP-J. We used RBP-J(R218H), which is unable to bind to DNA and acts as a dominant negative form (13Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4133-4141PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter assay has shown that RBP-J(R218H) suppresses the NICD-induced increase of the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The transcription of control plasmid was not affected by RBP-J(R218H) (Fig. 3B, inset). We then examined whether down-regulation of RBP-J expression by siRNA affects the Notch-induced MKP-1 expression. Our RBP-J siRNA treatment suppressed the RBP-J expression by about 40% at the mRNA level (Fig. 3C, left) and also suppressed NICD-induced MKP-1 expression by about 40% (Fig. 3C, right), suggesting that RBP-J is necessary for the NICD-induced MKP-1 expression. Therefore, it is likely that Notch induction of MKP-1 is dependent on RBP-J. Interestingly, overexpression of Hes1, a direct target of the RBP-J-dependent Notch pathway, did not affect the NICD-induced luciferase activity in this assay (data not shown), suggesting that Notch induction of MKP-1 is Hes1-independent. Because it has been reported that MKP-1 expression is also induced after serum stimulation (33Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar), we then examined whether NICD expression and serum treatment use different mechanisms to induce MKP-1. The amount of MKP-1 mRNA induced by serum stimulation was nearly equal to that induced by NICD expression (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, serum treatment and NICD expression synergistically increased MKP-1 mRNA (Fig. 3D), suggesting that these stimuli use different pathways to induce MKP-1 expression. We then examined whether MKP-1 expression alone suppresses p38 activity and myogenesis. In agreement with a previous report showing that stable MKP-1 expression inhibits myotube formation (34Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), transient expression of MKP-1 markedly reduced the number of myotubes, although a few myotubes were detected at day 3 (Fig. 4A). The expression level of MHC was decreased, and the expression of myogenin was almost completely suppressed in cells expressing MKP-1 (Fig. 4B). This observation is apparently inconsistent with the previous study showing that MKP-1 expression does not affect the expression of myogenin and MHC (34Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The difference may result from a higher expression level of MKP-1 in our transient expression protocol. MKP-1 expression under our conditions almost completely abolished p38 activity (Fig. 4C) and markedly suppressed the activities of ERK1/2 and JNK (Fig. 4D). It should be noted that inhibition of p38 activity by the pharmacological p38 inhibitor, SB203580, decreased the expression of myogenin and MHC (Fig. 4E), as reported previously (14Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 15Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and that the inhibitory effect of SB203580 treatment on myogenesis was similar to the effect of MKP-1 expression. Therefore, our results suggest that MKP-1 expression suppresses p38 activity and myogenesis. However, when compared with NICD expression (see Fig. 1), the ability of MKP-1 expression to inhibit myogenesis is rather weak. We then inhibited endogenous MKP-1 expression by siRNA. Our MKP-1 siRNA treatment suppressed the MKP-1 expression by about 70% at the mRNA level in both the presence and absence of NICD (Fig. 5A, left) and reduced the amount of MKP-1 protein induced in the presence of NICD by about 70% (Fig. 5A, right). We then examined the effect of MKP-1 siRNA on C2C12 differentiation. Down-regulation of MKP-1 by siRNA enhanced the activity of p38 throughout differentiation (Fig. 5B), suggesting that MKP-1 negatively regulates p38 during differentiation. Moreover, down-regulation of MKP-1 by siRNA enhanced the expression of myogenin at both the protein and the mRNA levels (Fig. 5, C and D), suggesting that endogenous MKP-1 negatively regulates myogenesis. It should be noted that MKP-1 siRNA treatment did not robustly enhance the expression of MHC (Fig. 5D). This result was consistent with the result that the overexpression of MKP-1 did not completely abolish MHC expression (Fig. 4B), and suggests that myogenin expression and MHC expression may have different modes of regulatory mechanisms during myogenesis, and MKP-1 may be more directly involved in the regulation of myogenin expression. Interestingly, the enhancement of myogenin and MHC expression by MKP-1 siRNA was inhibited by the treatment with SB203580, suggesting that MKP-1 acts on p38 during myogenesis (Fig. 5D). Finally, we down-regulated MKP-1 by siRNA during Notch inhibition of C2C12 myogenesis to examine whether the Notch pathway requires MKP-1 induction to inhibit myogenesis. MKP-1 siRNA treatment enhanced the p38 activity in the presence of NICD (Fig. 5E), and the p38 activity in MKP-1 siRNA-treated cells expressing NICD was roughly equal to that in control siRNA-treated cells expressing GFP in all time points (Fig. 5E), indicating that down-regulation of p38 activity by NICD is mediated by MKP-1 expression. When NICD was expressed in C2C12 cells, myotubes were not apparent even in the presence of MKP-1 siRNA (data not shown), and the expression of myogenin or MHC was not detected in immunoblotting (data not shown). We then examined whether myogenin mRNA levels in the presence of NICD are affected by the down-regulation of MKP-1. Although the amount of myogenin mRNA was increased even in the presence of NICD (Fig. 5F), the protein level was very low because we could not detect myogenin protein by immunoblotting. The expression level of myogenin mRNA in C2C12 cells in the presence of NICD was increased by MKP-1 siRNA treatment after 3 days (Fig. 5F), indicating that the differentiation is enhanced by MKP-1 siRNA treatment even in the presence of NICD. Furthermore, the increase in myogenin expression by MKP-1 siRNA was inhibited by SB203580 treatment (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the effect of MKP-1 siRNA on myogenesis is through p38 activation. Thus, it is likely that MKP-1 mainly acts on p38 during Notch inhibition of myogenesis. Although p38 activity is affected at day 1, myogenin expression was not affected until day 3. This may imply that the long term activation of p38 seems to be required to overcome the Notch inhibition of myogenesis. Therefore, these results also suggest that the increase of p38 activity could partially cancel the inhibitory effect of the Notch pathway on myogenesis. This partial effect of down-regulation of MKP-1 on myogenesis is consistent with the recent finding that the p38 pathway seems to modulate the activity of MyoD at a restricted subset of promoters rather than to act globally on all MyoD-regulated genes (35Bergstrom D.A.

Thus, we can conclude that Notch induction of MKP-1 plays an important role in Notch regulation of myogenesis. It also should be noted that SB203580 treatment with NICD expression inhibited myogenin expression more robustly than NICD expression alone did (Fig. 5F). This difference suggests the possibility that NICD-induced MKP-1 does not inhibit p38 activity completely. Our results have identified MKP-1 as a key molecule that links the Notch pathway to the p38 MAPK pathway. In C2C12 myogenesis, Notch induces MKP-1, which inhibits p38 activity that promotes myogenesis (Fig. 5F). It should be noted that our results are the first to show a cross-talk between the Notch pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway. Our results show that Notch induction of MKP-1 depends on an RBP-J-dependent mechanism. However, it remains to be determined whether the Notch-RBP-J complex induces MKP-1 mRNA directly or indirectly. It is still unclear whether the p38 pathway and the Notch pathway are important for muscle development in vivo. However, it has been shown that the p38 pathway and the Notch pathway play an opposite role in adult muscle regeneration processes, and although p38 promotes activation and differentiation of muscle satellite cells (36Jones N.C.

Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Therefore, there might be a cross-talk between the p38 pathway and the Notch pathway via induction of MKP-1 during satellite cell activation. Moreover, future studies would reveal the role of the identified interaction of the Notch pathway with the p38 MAPK pathway in other biological processes. We are grateful to Y. Yamaguchi and S.

RGS9-2 is specifically expressed in striatal neurons where it forms complexes with its newly discovered partner, R7BP (R7 family binding protein). Interaction with R7BP is important for the subcellular targeting of RGS9-2, which in native neurons is found in plasma membrane and its specializations, postsynaptic densities. Here we report that R7BP plays an additional important role in determining proteolytic stability of RGS9-2. We have found that co-expression with R7BP dramatically elevates the levels of RGS9-2 and its constitutive subunit, Gβ5. Measurement of the RGS9-2 degradation kinetics in cells indicates that R7BP markedly reduces the rate of RGS9-2·Gβ5 proteolysis. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference knockdown of the R7BP expression in native striatal neurons results in the corresponding decrease in RGS9-2 protein levels. Analysis of the molecular determinants that mediate R7BP/RGS9-2 binding to result in proteolytic protection have identified that the binding site for R7BP in RGS proteins is formed by pairing of the DEP (Disheveled, EGL-10, Pleckstrin) domain with the R7H (R7 homology), a domain of previously unknown function that interacts with four putative α-helices of the R7BP core.

RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins comprise a large family of proteins that control the duration of signal transduction through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor(s); DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gβ5, type 5 G protein β subunit; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor(s); DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gβ5, type 5 G protein β subunit; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). RGS proteins act to accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis on G protein α subunits, thus facilitating G protein inactivation and the subsequent termination of signaling through GPCRs (reviewed in Ref. 3.Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2005; 1: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A mounting body of evidence from clinical studies and genetic animal models indicate that the action of RGS proteins is essential for the normal functioning of almost all systems in the organism (4.Huang X.

In the nervous system, many critical neuronal processes appear to be regulated by the R7 RGS proteins, a subfamily conserved in a variety of animals from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (2.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 7.Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In mammals, the R7 subfamily consists of four highly homologous proteins: RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11, all of which are expressed predominantly in the nervous system (8.Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arguably the best studied member of this group is RGS9. It exists in two splice isoforms, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, which regulate vision and reward behavior, respectively (9.Burns M.E. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 2003; 38: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although the role of RGS9-1 in vertebrate phototransduction has been well established (reviewed in Ref. 10.Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms that regulate RGS9-2 function. Previous studies have found that RGS9-2 in the striatum is involved in the modulation of μ-opoid (11.Garzon J. Rodriguez-Diaz M. Lopez-Fando A. Sanchez-Blazquez P. Eur. J.

Interestingly, drug administration has been shown to modulate the protein expression levels of RGS9-2, suggesting a possible mechanism for the adaptive changes in G protein signaling observed in addiction and tolerance (12.Zachariou V.

RGS9, as well as other members of the R7 subfamily, is a multidomain modular protein that exists in vivo as a constitutive heterodimer with the type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) (16.Witherow D.S. Slepak V.Z. Recept. Chan. 2003; 9: 205-212PubMed Google Scholar). This association is critical because genetic ablation of Gβ5 results in almost complete elimination of RGS9 protein, as well as all other R7 RGS proteins, presumably because of their proteolytic destabilization (17.Chen C.K. Eversole-Cire P. Zhang H.K. Mancino V. Chen Y.J. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6604-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In photoreceptors, the stability of the RGS9-1/Gβ5 complex is further dependent upon its association with R9AP (RGS9 anchor protein) (18.Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Knockout of R9AP leads to a profound reduction in both RGS9-1 and Gβ5 protein levels (19.Keresztes G. Martemyanov K.A. Krispel C.M.

Neuron. 2006; 51: 409-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In mammals, R9AP is expressed only in photoreceptors, but we have recently found that in striatum, RGS9-2 forms a complex with a novel R9AP homolog that we named R7BP (R7-binding protein) (21.Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Unlike R9AP, which is available for binding only to RGS9-1, R7BP interacts with all four members of the R7 RGS protein family (21.Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

Studies by us and others indicate that, depending on its palmitoylation status, R7BP can target R7 RGS proteins to the plasma membrane, nucleus, and postsynaptic densities (22.Drenan R.M.

Furthermore, R7BP binding to RGS7 can potentiate its ability to terminate G protein signaling (22.Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J.

In this study we report that an additional role for R7BP is to regulate the proteolytic stability of the RGS9-2·Gβ5 complex. We have found that co-transfection of RGS9-2·Gβ5 with R7BP increases the expression level of the complex and increases the half-time of its degradation in neuronal cell lines. Using lentivirus-mediated RNAi knockdown of R7BP expression in primary striatal cultures, we demonstrate that decreases in R7BP levels lead to corresponding reductions in the levels of RGS9-2. We have further employed site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric approaches to dissect the molecular determinants that mediate the binding of R7 RGS proteins to R7BP to result in the observed stabilization of the complex.

RGS7, and RGS9-1 and their chimeric constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector according to the manufacturer’s specifications. RGS7/RGS9 chimeric constructs were generated to create fusion proteins of the following amino acid compositions: R7/9-1 (RGS9 1–115, RGS7 123–469); R7/9-2 (RGS7 1–122, RGS9 116–484); R7/9-3 (RGS9 1–209, RGS7 218–469); R7/9-4 (RGS7 1–297, RGS9 332–484); R7/9-5 (RGS9 1–297, RGS7 332–469); and R7/9-6 (RGS7 1–331, RGS9 298–484). All of the constructs were propagated into E. coli Top-10 strain (Invitrogen), isolated using Maxiprep kits (Qiagen), and sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfections−NG108-15 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm sodium hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm, thymidine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. 293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 4 mm l-glutamine. NG108-15 and 293 FT cells were transfected at ∼70% confluency, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The ratio of Lipofectamine to DNA used was 4 μl:2.5 μg/4 cm2 of cell surface. The cells were grown for 24–48 h post-transfection. Primary cultures of striatal neurons were essentially prepared as developed by Ivkovic and Ehrlich (29.Ivkovic S. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5409-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the striata were dissected from Swiss Webster mice at postnatal day 1. After dissection, the tissues were treated by papain (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), triturated, and plated on 12- or 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Denmark) coated with poly-d-lysine (20 μg/ml; BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA). The cultures were maintained in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with B27 (both from Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. The cells were plated at a density of 2000 viable cells (e.g. excluded trypan blue)/1 mm2 of well square for Western blot analysis and at 500–700 cells/mm2 for immunostaining. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. One-half of the medium was replaced with the fresh medium every 72 h. From days 4 to 7, the cultures were transduced by lentiviral constructs, incubated for 7–10 days, washed with PBS, and lysed in SDS sample buffer. RNA Interference and Generation of Lentiviruses−R7BP expression was down-regulated by short interfering RNA duplexes. Target regions in R7BP were identified by BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer Program (Invitrogen). Two sequences were used to generate RNAi molecules that target either 248–268 coding region of R7BP gene (RNAi 248, sequence CTCTGCGAGCTGAAATGCACA) or to the 483–583 region (RNAi 483, sequence AGCGAAGAATTTGGACAGCAA). These sequences were synthesized as DNA oligonucleotides and in addition contained complementary sequences joined by the GTTTTGGCCACTGACTGAC loop. Synthetic duplexes were cloned into the pcDNA6.2GW/EmGFP vector in the middle of the micro RNA 155 (miR155) sequence supplied as a part of the BLOCK-iT Lentiviral Pol II miR RNAi expression system kit (Invitrogen). In the pcDNA6.2GW/EmGFP vector the chimeric miR155-R7BP sequence is located under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter co-cistronically with EmGFP. Upon processing in the cells by the endogenous machinery, the construct is used to produce anti-R7BP RNA duplex (miRNA-αR7BP). The control construct (miRNA-CTR) was created by cloning a scrambled sequence AAATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGAC into the miR155 environment identically as described for miRNA-αR7BP. The expression cassette was transferred to the lentiviral shuttle vector pLenti6/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) by Gateway recombination following the kit instructions. For the generation of infectious lentiviral particles, pLenti6/V5-DEST vectors containing miRNA-αR7BP or miRNA-CTR cassettes were co-transfected with ViraPower™ packaging plasmid mixture: pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSV-G (Invitrogen) into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Ten T75 flasks were used to produce each batch of lentiviruses. Virus containing media was collected 60–65 h after transfection, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 6 min and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore), and viral particles were concentrated as described by Coleman et al. (30.Coleman J.E. Huentelman M.J. Kasparov S. Metcalfe B.L. Paton J.F. Katovich M.J. Semple-Rowland S.L. Raizada M.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 12: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Virus-containing supernatants were carefully loaded on 60% OptiPrep (Sigma) cushion (150–200 μl) in 30-ml conical-bottomed polyallomer centrifuge tubes (Beckman) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor SW-28 (Beckman). The medium just above the media/OptiPrep interface was carefully removed and discarded. The residual medium containing OptiPrep and viruses (∼500 μlin each tube) were mixed gently by shaking and pooled into 3-ml conical-bottomed centrifuge tubes (Beckman), centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 4.5 h at 4 °C using Beckman SW-50.1 swinging bucket rotor. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining viral pellet was resuspended in 50–100 μl of PBS by gentle pipetting, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C until use. Infectious titers of viruses were determined by blasticidine selection method. For this, 293FT cells in 6-well plate (5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with serial dilutions of the viral stock in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Invitrogen). Infected cells were selected in medium containing 5 μg/ml blasticidin. The number of transducing units was determined by multiplying the estimated number of colonies by dilution factor. Our preparations of concentrated lentiviral stocks consistently yielded titers of 2–10 × 106 transducing units/ml. The titers of all viral stocks were equalized by adjusting the concentration of viral particles to 2 × 106/ml. Primary neurons cultured in 12-well plates at ∼3 × 105 cells/well were infected by 30 μl of either miRNA-αR7BP or miRNA-CTR viruses. Immunoprecipitation−Immunoprecipitation of R7BP and R9AP was performed essentially as described previously (21.Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the precipitation of proteins expressed in the 293 cells, the cells were lysed in PBS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cellular lysates were clarified by 30 min of centrifugation at 20,000 × g and incubated with 5 μg of anti-R7BP or anti-R9AP antibodies cross-linked to 10 μl of protein G beads (GE Healthcare) with Bis(Sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with ice-cold binding buffer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2%SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by 4–20% PAGE (Cambrex). Immunoprecipitation of purified recombinant RGS9-2·Gβ5 complexes with R7BP and R9AP was performed identically with the exception that the RGS9-2CT antibodies used in the assay were not covalently cross-linked to the protein G beads. The specificity of the immunoprecipitations was controlled by using equal amounts of nonimmune IgG fraction. GST Pulldown Assays−The assays were performed as previously described (21.Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified recombinant GST fusion proteins (100 pmol) were attached to 10 μl of glutathione agarose beads (GE Healthcare) by incubating in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% n-dodecanoylsucrose, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h on ice. The beads were washed with binding buffer twice and incubated with 1 pmol of purified RGS·Gβ5 complexes for 10 min, followed by three washes. The proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, and RGS proteins retained by the beads were detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Pulse-Chase Degradation Experiments−NG108-15 cells grown in T-25 flasks were co-transfected with RGS9 and Gβ5 constructs with or without R7BP or R9AP plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and placed into 5 ml of starvation medium (10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), DMEM without l-Methionine or l-Cysteine (21013–024, Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. After this starvation period, newly synthesizing proteins were labeled by adding 30 mCi of radiolabeled [35S]methionine and cysteine (NEG772; Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) per flask to the starvation medium and incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 40 min. After labeling, the cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of DMEM and incubated with 5 ml of fully supplemented medium supplemented by additional 2 mm l-methionine and 2 mm l-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for the indicated incubation times. At the end of the incubation, the cells were scraped into 5 ml of ice-chilled PBS pelleted by centrifugation at 3,200 × g for 1 min and resuspended in 900 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). The cells were allowed to lyse by incubating them at 4 °C for 20 min with gentle shaking. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of protein G beads and 3 μg of RGS9-2 CT antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and immunoprecipitated RGS9 proteins were eluted from the beads by 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. 25 μl of the samples were run on the SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was air-dried and incubated on a phorphorimaging screen overnight. This screen was then scanned using a STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics), and the bands were quantified using ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Co-expression with R7BP Increases RGS9 Levels−It is well established in the literature that R7 RGS proteins are susceptible to degradation and require association with Gβ5 for their increased stability and high expression levels (17.Chen C.K. Eversole-Cire P. Zhang H.K. Mancino V. Chen Y.J. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6604-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31.Witherow D.S. Wang Q.

Previous studies by us and others indicate that R7 RGS proteins bound to Gβ5 can readily form complexes with their partner R7BP when co-transfected into cultured cell lines (22.Drenan R.M.

Here, we investigated how expression levels of R7 RGS·Gβ5 complexes are affected by their co-expression with R7BP. For these experiments we chose to use complexes of Gβ5 with RGS9 as model R7 RGS protein because of its documented instability in vivo (19.Keresztes G. Martemyanov K.A. Krispel C.M. Mutai H. Yoo P.J.

The use of RGS9 also allowed us to compare potential effect of R7BP to the effects produced by R9AP, a protein known to stabilize the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex in photoreceptors (18.Hu"
https://openalex.org/W2028243845,"Histidine triad nucleotide binding proteins (Hints) are the most ancient members of the histidine triad protein superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases and hydrolyases. Protein-protein interaction studies have found that complexes of the transcription factors MITF or USF2 and lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) are associated with human Hint1. Therefore, we hypothesized that lysyl-AMP or the LysRS·lysyl-AMP may be a native substrate for Hints. To explore the biochemical relationship between Hint1 and LysRS, a series of catalytic radiolabeling, mutagenesis, and kinetic experiments was conducted with purified LysRSs and Hints from human and Escherichia coli. After incubation of the E. coli or human LysRS with Hints and [α-32P]ATP, but not [α-32P]GTP, 32P-labeled Hints were observed. By varying time and the concentrations of lysine, Mg2+, or LysRS, the adenylation of Hint was found to be dependent on the formation of lysyl-AMP. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the active site histidine triad revealed that Hint labeling could be abolished by substitution of either His-101 of E. coli hinT or His-112 of human Hint1 by either alanine or glycine. Ap4A, believed to be synthesized by LysRS in vivo, and Zn2+ were shown to inhibit the formation of Hint-AMP with an IC50 value in the low micromolar range. Consistent with pyrophosphate being an inhibitor for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, incubations in the presence of pyrophosphatase resulted in enhanced formation of Hint-AMP. These results demonstrate that the lysyl-AMP intermediate formed by LysRS is a natural substrate for Hints and suggests a potential highly conserved regulatory role for Hints on LysRS and possibly other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). HIT enzymes are a ubiquitous superfamily consisting primarily of nucleoside phosphoramidases, dinucleotide hydrolyases, and nucleotidyltransferases (1.Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Five distinct branches of HIT superfamily have been recently classified by a phylogenetic study of HIT proteins (2.Kijas A.W. Harris J.L. Harris J.M. Lavin M.F. J. Biol.

Additionally, Hint1 knock out mice have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to the induction of ovarian and mammary tumors by the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene and to spontaneous tumors (11.Li H. Zhang Y. Su T. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Hint1 and the significantly reduced in vivo tumorigenicity of 5-aza-dC-treated non-small-cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H522 suggested that hHint1 might be a tumor suppressor (12.Yuan B.Z. Jefferson A.M. Popescu N.C. Reynolds S.H. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 412-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, Weiske and Huber (13.Weiske J. Huber O. J. Biol.

Human Hint2, which is 61% identical to Hint1, has recently been shown to be a mitochondrial apoptotic sensitizer that is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (14.Martin J. Magnino F.

Although Hints are efficient hydrolases of purine nucleoside phosphoramidates, cellular function and biochemical relevance of the enzymatic phosphoramidase activity has not been determined. The Fhit (fragile histidine triad) branch of the HIT superfamily is only found in eukaryotes. Like Hint, Fhit is also a homodimer with tumor suppressor activity (15.Ohta M. Inoue H. Cotticelli M.G.

Human Fhit is a diadenosine P1,P3-triphosphate (Ap3A) hydrolyase as well as phosphoramidase (16.Huang K. Arabshahi A. Wei Y. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7637-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17.Huang K. Arabshahi A. Frey P.A. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 2005: 5198-5206Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of action by which it affects tumor development is not well understood, although site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that the Fhit tumor suppressor function is likely not dependent on its Ap3A hydrolase activity (18.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to the first two branches, the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase branch has been shown to be the second enzyme in the Leloir pathway necessary for galactose utilization (19.Frey P.A. Wong L.J. Sheu K.F. Yang S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20.Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is a homodimer with little overall sequence homology with Hint1 or Fhit, it does share some tertiary structure similarity (21.Brenner C.

The fourth family is aprataxin, which is mutated in ataxia-oculomotor apraxia1 (22.Moreira M.C. Barbot C. Tachi N. Kozuka N. Uchida E. Gibson T. Mendonca P. Costa M. Barros J. Yanagisawa T.

The last family is the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme, DcpS/DCS-1, a 7-methyl-GpppG hydrolase (24.Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M.

Recently, hHint1 has been isolated from complexes with lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and MITF or USF2 transcription factors (9.Lee Y.N. Nechushtan H. Figov N. Razin E. Immunity. 2004; 20: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10.Lee Y.N. Razin E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8904-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To elucidate the biochemical connection between LysRS and Hint1, both E. coli LysRS (ecLysU) and human LysRS (hLysRS) were purified and shown to label echinT and hHint1 with [α-32P]ATP but not with [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]GTP, or [γ-32P]GTP. This was found to be consistent with chemical degradation and mutagenic experiments revealing that the Hint-AMP intermediate formed upon interaction with LysRS contained a phosphoramidate linkage between AMP and a strictly conserved and catalytically essential active site histidine (His-112 of hHint1, Fig. 1). Furthermore, by varying individual components in the aminoacylation reaction, the formation of the Hint-AMP intermediate was found to be dependent on the formation of the lysyl-AMP intermediate. Hence, Hints may function in part to regulate the catalytic activity of LysRS by providing a possible new mechanism of pre-transfer editing or by scavenging highly reactive inappropriately released aminoacyl-adenylates. Moreover, the interaction of Hint1 with transcription factors such as USF2 and MITF may be mediated by the adenylation of Hint1 by LysRS. Protein Purification−The E. coli BS68 strain harboring the pBAS39 (derived from pET3a) plasmid for expressing ecLysU as a C-terminal His6-tag fusion protein was a gift from Dr. Paul Schimmel (The Scripps Research Institute) (26.Steer B.A. Schimmel P.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer (4×,5 μl, Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was boiled for 10 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Labeled proteins were visualized by subjecting dried polyvinylidene difluoride membranes to autoradiography with a storage phosphor screen for 12 h followed by scanning with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager.

E. coli LysU (1 μm) was added to the reaction mixture containing ATP (250 μm), lysine (200 μm), [α-32P]ATP (7.5 μm) in buffer B (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 unit/μl inorganic pyrophosphatase) at 23 °C. Aliquots (2 μl) were with-drawn and quenched in ice-cold sodium acetate solution (200 mm, pH 5.0). After 10 or 30 min, echinT (2.5 μm) was added to the remaining reaction mixture, and AMP formation was monitored for an additional 10 min. Aliquots of quenched reactions (1 μl) were spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (20 × 10 cm, Selecto Scientific) pre-developed with water. The air-dried TLC plate was developed in ammonium acetate (100 mm), 5% acetic acid solution. The 32P signal was detected and quantitated as described above. The Chimeric Mutant of hHint1 and echinT−Human Hint1 and echinT shared 50% sequence identity over 107 alignable amino acids, but their C termini are distinct. The C terminus may play an important role on determining substrate specificity. Homology modeling studies revealed that the C termini of echinT are likely to reside in a similar location to that of the hHint1. 3T.-F. Chou, Y. Y. Sham, and C. R. Wagner, unpublished data. To address this possibility, a human/E. coli chimera was created by replacing the C terminus of hHint1 (Gln-120 to Gly-126) with the C terminus of echinT (Pro-109 to Leu-119). Nucleotidylation of Hints by ecLysU−Adenylation but not guanylation of Hints was observed after incubation with ecLysU (Fig. 2A), whereas the control experiments without ecLysU (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 5, and 8) revealed negligible labeling of Hints. Adenylation of echinT (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, 13 kDa), hHint1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7, 14 kDa), and the chimera mutant (Fig. 2A: lanes 9 and 10, 14 kDa) was compared which demonstrate that labeling of echinT and the chimera was more intense than the labeling of hHint1, indicating the potential role of the C-terminal loop in facilitating labeling. In contrast to adenylation, incubation of ecLysU with [α-32P]-GTP revealed weak labeling of ecLysU (59 kDa) after the addition of hHint1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and the chimera (Fig. 2B, lane 4) but no labeling with only buffer A (Fig. 2B, lane 1) or echinT (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Enhanced Adenylation of Hint by ecLysU by the Addition of Lysine−To first investigate whether the lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity associated with ecLysU was responsible for the adenylation of Hints, the effect of lysine on Hint-AMP formation was evaluated. Incubation of ecLysU (0.22 μm) was carried out at 23 °C for 10 min with [α-32P]ATP (0.38 μm) in buffer A followed by the addition of echinT (0.28 or 2.8 μm) for 10 min (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4) and in buffer A containing lysine (2.2 μm) followed by the addition of echinT (0.28 or 2.8 μm) for 10 min (lanes 3 and 5). The addition of lysine (2.2μm) enhanced Hint-AMP formation by 11-fold, when the ecLysU (0.22 μm) and echinT (0.28 μm) were comparable in concentration. Consistent with a saturable process, when the amount of echinT was increased by 10-fold, only a 5-fold increase in labeling was observed. Because the small amount of Hint-AMP was observed in the absence of added lysine (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4), it is highly likely that a small amount of contaminating lysine or lysyl-AMP bound with ecLysU is present with the purified enzyme. In addition, at the higher echinT concentration, we do observe small amounts of labeled ecLysU (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5, 59 kDa), possibly indicating that at high enough concentrations of Hint, adenylation of ecLysU can be observed. Time Dependence of Hint Adenylation by ecLysU−To evaluate the rate of adenylate-Hint formation, after preincubation of ecLysU (0.022 μm), lysine (2.2 μm), and [α-32P]ATP (0.38 μm) for 1 min, excess echinT (1.4 μm) was added to initiate the reaction; the reaction was carried out for an additional 8 min with aliquots removed and quenched at 1-min intervals. As shown in Fig. 4, maximal Hint-AMP formation was observed between 1 and 3 min after initiation. Consistent with rapid consumption of ATP by ecLysU and turnover of the Hint-AMP intermediate, over the course of the next 5 min, a 6-fold decrease in the intensity of echinT labeling was observed. In subsequent experiments, the labeling of echinT was carried out for maximum of 1 min. Adenylation of ecLysU by echinT−Incubation of ecLysU (0.022 μm) with lysine and [α-32P]-ATP for 1 min followed by the addition of various concentrations of echinT (0.056–14 μm) revealed that the intensity of the Hint-AMP was proportional to the added amount of echinT, reaching a plateau between 1.4 and 2.8 μm. Moreover, labeling of ecLysU was noticeable when incubations were carried out with at least a 56-fold excess of echinT. The prevalence of an additional higher Mr band, consistent in size with covalently linked ecLysU and echinT, was observed at the highest echinT concentration (14 μm) (Fig. 5). The possibility that this band may result from the labeling of LysRS at multiple sites cannot be ruled out. Labeling of the high Mr band and ecLysU is likely to suppress the amount of observed echinT-AMP. Adenylation of Hint Is Dependent on the Concentration of Lysine and Mg2+−Because lysine is one of the substrates and Mg2+ is absolutely required for lysyl-AMP formation (30.Desogus G. Todone F. Brick P. Onesti S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8418-8425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is of interest to determine the effect of both molecules on adenylation of echinT in more detail. Hence, various concentrations of lysine (0.025–2500 μm) were examined to reveal a saturation-type behavior with respect to the amount of lysine; under these conditions maximal intensity was observed at 25 μm lysine (Fig. 6A). In addition, labeling was observed only when Mg2+ was present in the reaction mixture, with maximal intensity reached at a concentration of 1500 μm (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the observed reliance of echinT adenylation on lysine and Mg2+ is consistent with a labeling reaction dependent on the formation of lysyl-AMP by ecLysU. Inhibition of Hint Adenylation by Zn2+,Ap4A, and Ap3A− Divalent Zn2+ has been shown to stimulate Ap4A formation by ecLysU. The mechanism has been shown to rely on the ability of Zn2+ to stimulate nucleophilic attack by the γ-phosphate of ATP on lysyl-AMP (31.Theoclitou M.E. Wittung E.L. Hindley A.D. El-Thaher T.S.H. Miller A.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1996; 16: 123-125Google Scholar). In addition, Zn2+, but not Ap4A, has been shown to inhibit Hint activity with an IC50 of (9.5 ± 2.1) μm. 4T.-F. Chou and C. R. Wagner, unpublished data. Therefore, we chose to test the effect of Zn2+, Ap4A, and other nucleotides on the formation of Hint-AMP. As shown in Fig. 7, Zn2+ (15 μm) inhibited Hint-AMP formation by 80%, and Ap4A inhibited Hint-AMP formation with an IC50 of 15 μm. Moreover, about 70–90% inhibition was observed for incubations with 150 μm Ap4A, Ap3A, or ATP. Consistent with the preference of LysRS for ATP and not GTP, incubations with 150 μm GTP decreased Hint-AMP by only 50%, whereas inhibition by either AMP or GMP was not observed (supplemental Fig. 1). These results provided additional evidence that lysyl-AMP is required for adenylation of echinT. Dependence of Hint Adenylation on the Concentration of echinT and ecLysU−To examine the concentration effect of echinT and ecLysU on Hint-AMP intermediate formation, we first fixed the ecLysU concentration (0.025 μm) and varied the concentration of echinT from 0.05 to 12.5 μm. A plateau in the amount of echinT labeling was observed over the concentration range 2.5–12.5 μm echinT (Fig. 8A). When the ecLysU concentration was varied from 0.025 to 14 μm with a fixed echinT concentration (6.25 μm), the intensity of Hint-AMP was found to increase with increasing amounts of ecLysU (Fig. 8B). Effect of Inorganic Pyrophosphate (PPi) on Hint-AMP Formation−Yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, which hydrolyzes PPi, has been used to enhance the catalytic activity of LysRS by reducing product inhibition by PPi (32.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8088-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The addition of inorganic pyrophosphatase to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase reaction mixtures has been suggested to more closely mimic the in vivo conditions for aminoacylation (33.Khvorova A. Motorin Y. Wolfson A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34.Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, adenylation of echinT was also carried out with and without inorganic pyrophosphatase to evaluate the effect of PPi on Hint-AMP formation. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase-enhanced Hint-AMP formation was observed (3-fold). Effect of Hint on AMP Formation by ecLysU−To further establish th"

https://openalex.org/W2036495154,"Transport into the nucleus is critical for regulation of gene transcription and other intranuclear events. Passage of molecules into the nucleus depends in part upon their size and the presence of appropriate targeting sequences. However, little is known about the effects of hormones or their second messengers on transport across the nuclear envelope. We used localized, two-photon activation of a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein to investigate whether hormones, via their second messengers, could alter nuclear permeability. Vasopressin and other hormones that increase cytosolic Ca2+ and activate protein kinase C increased permeability across the nuclear membrane of SKHep1 liver cells in a rapid unidirectional manner. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Furthermore, localized photorelease of caged Ca2+ near the nuclear envelope resulted in a local increase in nuclear permeability. Neither activation nor inhibition of protein kinase C affected nuclear permeability. These findings provide evidence that hormones linking to certain G protein-coupled receptors increase nuclear permeability via cytosolic Ca2+. Short term regulation of nuclear permeability may provide a novel mechanism by which such hormones permit transcription factors and other regulatory molecules to enter the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription in target cells."

As a consequence, the isolated subunits were found to be much less stable (ΔG ≈3 kcal/mol). The addition of methoxyarachidonyl fluorophosphonate, an irreversible inhibitor of FAAH activity, enhanced the stability of the dimer by ≈2 kcal/mol, toward denaturant- and pressure-induced unfolding. FAAH inhibition by methoxyarachidonyl fluorophosphonate also reduced the ability of the protein to bind to the membranes.

Cravatt B.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). These fatty acid amides (FAAs), collectively termed “endocannabinoids,” modulate several aspects of mammalian pathophysiology, both at central and peripheral level (3Bari M. Battista N. Fezza F. Gasperi V. Maccarrone M. Mini-Rev. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is now widely recognized that the biological activity of FAAs depends on the “metabolic control” of their endogenous tone (3Bari M. Battista N. Fezza F. Gasperi V. Maccarrone M. Mini-Rev. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and in the last few years evidence has accumulated that points to FAAH as the key regulator of FAAs concentration in vivo (4Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 5Cravatt B.F.

Therefore, this enzyme is becoming the subject of intense investigation, and the design of ad hoc inhibitors able to tune its catalytic activity is a hot spot in medicinal chemistry (for a recent review see Ref. 6Maccarrone M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact, FAAH inhibitors might represent next-generation therapeutics for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse (7Sipe J.C. Chiang K. Gerber A.L. Beutler E. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Res. 2004; 1: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) diseases. In addition, interest toward FAAH was boosted by the fact that this enzyme is the first and, to date, the only characterized mammalian member of a large group, referred to as the “amidase signature” (AS) family (13Chebrou H. Bigey F. Arnaud A. Galzy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More than 100 members of this class have been reported in the literature, mostly from bacteria or fungi. Despite its quite remarkable size, structural and mechanistic details of the AS family are still rather scant. Therefore, insights into the structural features of FAAH offer the opportunity to better understand the catalytic properties of this group. Interestingly, AS enzymes show a novel serine-serinelysine catalytic triad, and that of FAAH (Ser241–Ser217–Lys142) enables the hydrolysis of either amides or esters (2McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In addition, FAAH is unusual among AS enzymes, because it is integrated into membranes. Deletion of the first 30 amino acids of FAAH, containing a N-terminal transmembrane domain, yields a catalytically active mutant (ΔTM-FAAH) still able to bind to the membranes (14Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The crystallographic analysis of ΔTM-FAAH, at 2.8 Å resolution and in a complex with the active site-directed inhibitor methoxyarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), has demonstrated that FAAH crystallizes as a homodimeric enzyme (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Each subunit is characterized by a central twisted β-core, surrounded by a large number (28) of α-helices (Fig. 1, top). The active site pocket is located in each subunit below the β-core, next to a large hydrophobic portion that allows the bottom of the enzyme to dip into the membrane lipid bilayer. Two tryptophans are buried within this functional area. The first residue, Trp531, is located at one end of the channel leading from the protein-membrane interface to the cytosolic port located at the opposite side. The second residue, Trp445, belongs to the other subunit and blocks another potential route for substrates. The position of the seven tryptophan residues present in each subunit is shown in Fig. 1, top, together with their respective solvent-exposed area (Fig. 1, bottom). On this basis, we attempted herein to investigate the structural features that determine FAAH activity and its membrane binding properties by spectroscopic techniques (i.e. circular dichroism, steady-state, and dynamic fluorescence) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of FAAH bound to synthetic vesicles. Reversible dissociation into stable monomers was obtained by high pressure. The data provide strong evidence that the protein quaternary structure is needed to achieve stability, by shielding from solvent not only the residues at the dimeric interface but also those buried inside each subunit. Not surprisingly, this folding strategy appears to be optimal to match the functional requirements of FAAH. Materials, Antibodies, and Enzymes—MAFP was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) was from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies (15Maccarrone M. Bari M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol.

The solubilized protein was purified by a combination of metal affinity, heparin, and gel filtration chromatography (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and the purified enzyme was used throughout the investigation. This mutant is referred to as “FAAH.” Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the release of [14C]ethanolamine from [14C]anandamide (5 mCi/mmol; ARC, St. Louis, MO), using liquid scintillation counting (16Fontana A. Di Marzo V. Cadas H. Piomelli D. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Membrane Binding Assays—Negatively charged, unsaturated phosphatidylcholine liposomes were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline using the liposome kit (Sigma) as reported (17Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. Van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The size of the vesicles was ∼2 μm, as determined under the microscope by comparison with the size (10 ± 0.5 μm) of Mono Q beads (Amersham Biosciences). The binding of FAAH to liposomes was determined essentially as reported (17Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. Van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that incubation of liposome suspensions corresponding to 1 μmol of phosphatidylcholine (50 μl) with 100 pmol of FAAH (corresponding to 2 μm) for 0–60 min at 25 °C yielded the highest amount of bound FAAH (i.e. 28 ± 3 pmol) after 30 min, without further increase in the following 30 min. Therefore, in the first set of experiments 2 μm FAAH was incubated for 30 min with liposome suspensions, before or after 30 min of incubation with various amounts of MAFP (0–100 μm range). In another set of experiments, 2 μm FAAH was incubated with 100 μm MAFP for different periods of time (0–60 min) and then with liposome suspensions for 30 min. The enzyme-liposome complexes were separated by flotation on a linear sucrose density gradient (18May C. Hohne M. Gnau P. Schwennesen K. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and then an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by coating the plate with enzyme-liposome complexes (50 μl/well). Specific anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies (15Maccarrone M. Bari M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32726-32732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), diluted 1:400, were used as first antibody, and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:2000, as second antibody. Color development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 405 nm, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Controls included wells coated with nonimmune rabbit serum (Primm) or with different amounts of bovine serum albumin. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was calibrated using different amounts of FAAH (0–100 pmol/well), in the presence of liposomes (1 μmol of phosphatidylcholine/well). The absorbance values at 405 nm (A405) of unknown samples were within the linearity range of the calibration curve. Spectroscopic Assays—Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a photon counting spectrofluorometer (ISS, model K2, Champaign, IL). Dynamic fluorescence measurements were carried out using the phase-shift and demodulation technique (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 3-14Google Scholar). The light source of the dynamic fluorometer (ISS, model Koala, Champaign, IL) was a laser diode, whose emission wavelength was 300 ± 6 nm. Steady-state and dynamic fluorescence at high pressure were measured with the same instruments, using the high pressure ISS cell, equipped with an external bath circulator. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco-710 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C, using a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette. Equilibrium Unfolding Measurements—Protein denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride (GdmHCl) was obtained after a 12-h incubation at 4 °C in the presence of different amounts of denaturant. Refolding of unfolded FAAH samples was achieved by diluting the denaturant with buffer. The transition was monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. Data analysis was performed according to Scheme 1, N2K1↔2MK2↔2U(Eq. 1) where N, M, and U represent the native, intermediate, and unfolded protein species, and K1 and K2 are linked to the mole fraction of each species, fN, fM, and fU (fN + fM + fU = 1) according to Equation 1, fU=-K1K21+K2+K1K221+K22+4N0K1K222N0fM=fUK2fN=fU2N0K1K22(Eq. 2) where [N0] represents the initial dimer concentration. The experimental data, Y, have been fitted using the linear combination as shown in Equation 2, Y=fNYN+fMYM+fUYU(Eq. 3) where YN, YM, and YU are free parameters that correspond to the spectroscopic properties of each state. For both transitions, the free energy change has been assumed to be linearly dependent on the denaturant concentration (20Thomson J.A. Shirley B.A. Grimsley G.R. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), according to Equation 3, ΔGi=1,2=ΔGi0-miGdHCl(Eq. 4) where each ΔG0 represents the free energy change in the absence of denaturant, and m values are the derivative of the change in stabilization free energy upon the addition of denaturant. Pressure-induced dissociation curves were analyzed as described elsewhere (21Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 50: 245-252Google Scholar), assuming that a simple monomer/dimer equilibrium was taking place. The dependence on pressure of the equilibrium constant of dissociation was calculated according to Equation 4, K(P)=K0exp(PΔV/RT)(Eq. 5) Equation 4 has been used to obtain the values of volume (ΔV) and free energy changes at atmospheric pressure (ΔG0 =-RT ln K0). An independent estimation of ΔV was also obtained performing the experiment at two different protein concentrations (C1 and C2), and using Equation 5, ΔP1/2=(RT/ΔV)lnC2/C1(Eq. 6) where ΔP1/2 is the displacement (at 50% of the signal) of the normalized plots along the pressure axis. Data Analysis and Statistics—Statistical analysis of the liposome binding data were performed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, using the InStat 3 program (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The analysis of dynamic fluorescence data were performed using the Vinci Software (ISS, Champaign, IL). The fitting curves of equilibrium unfolding measurements were obtained inserting the equations described above in the KaleidaGraph minimization routine (Synergy Software, version 3.6). All experimental assays were repeated at least three times, and the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviation associated with each point. GdmHCl-induced Unfolding of FAAH—The stability of FAAH has been studied by equilibrium unfolding measurements, following the change in intrinsic fluorescence. In particular, the red shift of the spectrum has been recorded as a function of GdmHCl concentration (Fig. 2). The transition from native to unfolded state is complex and suggests the presence of at least one intermediate species (Fig. 2). In order to ascertain whether dissociation into monomers was taking place, the measurements were performed at different protein concentrations. The data, reported in Fig. 2, demonstrate that the transition is concentration-dependent in the range 0–1 m GdmHCl, consistently with the occurrence of a monomerization process. The data have therefore been fitted according to a two-step denaturation pathway, including a monomeric intermediate species (see “Experimental Procedures”). The best fitting parameters obtained with this model are shown in Table 1. The corresponding changes in the solvent-accessible surface area (ΔASA) have been also evaluated from the m1 and m2 values, according to Myers et al. (22Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar) and are reported in Table 1. In a parallel experiment, circular dichroism spectra have been recorded in the peptidic region (200–250 nm), in order to monitor the loss of secondary structure. The normalized signal intensity at 220 nm is reported in the inset of Fig. 2. The data have been fitted as above for the fluorescence measurements, and the results are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters characterizing the unfolding of FAAHSampleΔG10aFree energy change in absence of denaturantΔG20aFree energy change in absence of denaturantm1bCooperativity index of each transition (see “Experimental Procedures”)m2bCooperativity index of each transition (see “Experimental Procedures”)ΔASA1cChange in the solvent-accessible surface area upon denaturationΔASA2cChange in the solvent-accessible surface area upon denaturationkcal/molÅ20.2 μm FAAH (fluorescence)12.9 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.27.0 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.114,000 ± 2006100 ± 4000.02 μm FAAH (fluorescence)11.7 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.37.2 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.314,400 ± 4007000 ± 10000.2 μm FAAH (CD)12.2 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.312,000 ± 20005000 ± 10000.02 μm FAAH (CD)12.4 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.56.0 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.112,000 ± 11005000 ± 4000.2 μm FAAH + 4 μm MAFP (fluorescence)14.5 ± 0.53.1 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.112,800 ± 4003800 ± 400a Free energy change in absence of denaturantb Cooperativity index of each transition (see “Experimental Procedures”)c Change in the solvent-accessible surface area upon denaturation Open table in a new tab Pressure-induced Dissociation of FAAH—The existence of partially folded monomers along the unfolding landscape of FAAH allows the study of the oligomerization process in more detail, by means of high pressure denaturation measurements. The process is concentration-dependent (Fig. 3), and the analysis of the transition curves yields a free energy change similar to that obtained in the first GdmHCl-induced denaturation step (compare Tables 1 and 2). The volume change occurring during the dissociation process is in the range -120–130 ml/mol, in line with the values reported in the literature for other dimeric proteins (21Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 50: 245-252Google Scholar). Using the shift of the midpoint dissociation curves reported in Fig. 3, it is possible to obtain an independent estimation of ΔV (≈-120 ml/mol), as described under “Experimental Procedures.”TABLE 2Physical parameters characterizing the dissociation of FAAH at high pressureSampleΔGaΔG indicates free energy changeΔVbΔV indicates volume changekcal/molml/mol0.2 μm FAAH12.2 ± 0.2–119 ± 90.02 μm FAAH11.6 ± 0.1–130 ± 70.2 μm FAAH + 4 μm MAFP13.7 ± 0.4–138 ± 9a ΔG indicates free energy changeb ΔV indicates volume change Open table in a new tab The coincidence within the experimental error of this ΔV value with those reported in Table 2 demonstrates that the equilibrium follows a stochastic behavior, unlike the dissociation process observed for larger structures and aggregates (21Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 50: 245-252Google Scholar). A comparison between the effects of low GdmHCl concentrations (≈0.6 m) and high pressure (≈2500 bars) on the protein fluorescence is shown in Fig. 4. The two spectra are superimposable, suggesting that a similar intermediate species is produced, independently of the method of perturbation used. In both cases, the broader profile obtained indicates the solvation of some tryptophan residues as a consequence of dissociation. From the crystallographic analysis (Fig. 1), it is tempting to speculate that this effect is due only to Trp445 and Trp556, which are located at the dimeric interface. The spectrum of the fully unfolded enzyme (in 3 m GdmHCl) supports this hypothesis because it exhibits more drastic changes, such as a more redshifted position and the appearance of a shoulder at 320 nm. The latter effect is likely because of the contribution of tyrosines, which generally occurs at ≈305 nm (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 3-14Google Scholar) and becomes detectable only in the unfolded protein. In fact, in this case the nonradiative energy transfer to tryptophan is negligible because of the mean larger distances among donors and acceptors. MAFP Reduces the Binding of FAAH to Synthetic Vesicles— MAFP is an irreversible inhibitor of FAAH that has recently allowed crystallization and three-dimensional analysis of the enzyme at 2.8 Å resolution (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Before studying the influence of MAFP on protein structure and stability, we have checked whether it was able to modify the interaction of FAAH with membranes. In the first set of experiments, 2 μm FAAH was preincubated with different concentrations of MAFP for 30 min and then with liposome suspensions for a further 30 min. The FAAH inhibitor was able to reduce dose-dependently the amount of FAAH bound to artificial membranes, with a significant effect at 10 μm MAFP and a maximum effect at 100 μm MAFP, corresponding to FAAH/MAFP molar ratios of 1:5 and 1:50, respectively (Fig. 5A). Under the latter conditions, only ≈40% of FAAH was bound to liposomes compared with controls (i.e. 12 ± 2 versus 28 ± 3 pmol). Instead, the addition of MAFP after incubation of FAAH with liposomes under the same experimental conditions did not significantly affect enzyme binding to the vesicles (Fig. 5A). In another set of experiments, 2 μm FAAH was preincubated with 100 μm MAFP for different periods of time (0–60 min) and then with liposomes for 30 min. These experiments showed that already after 5 min MAFP reduced to ≈40% of the controls FAAH binding to liposomes, without any further reduction in the following 55 min (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, 10 μm MAFP added to 2 μm FAAH for 5 min, before or after incubation with liposomes for 30 min, fully and irreversibly inhibited enzyme activity, which decreased from 820 ± 50 nm/min of controls to undetectable levels in MAFP-treated samples. Taken together, these data suggest that MAFP rapidly (within 5 min) modifies the surface of FAAH, thus reducing its membrane binding ability; however, the MAFP-induced modification does not occur when FAAH is already bound to artificial membranes. MAFP Enhances the Stability of FAAH—The observation that MAFP-treated FAAH binds to a lesser extent with synthetic membranes suggests that MAFP induces conformational changes to the enzyme. We have therefore re-investigated the fluorescence properties of FAAH as a function of GdmHCl and pressure in the presence of MAFP. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the transition curves are shifted toward higher denaturant concentrations and pressure values, respectively, and the best fits of the data yielded a larger ΔG, as reported in Tables 1 and 2. Instead, the stability of the monomeric species (ΔG2) was not affected by MAFP (Table 1). The smaller m1 and m2 values obtained in the presence of MAFP (Table 1) suggest that a stiffer hydrophobic region is formed around the ligand-binding site. This effect is in line with the slight difference observed in the fluorescence spectrum, both at high denaturant concentrations and at high pressure. In particular, the asymptotic center of mass values at 3 m GdmHCl or 2300 bars, with or without MAFP, were less than 2 nm apart (Figs. 2 and 3), a finding that is diagnostic of a reduced solvation of the tryptophan residues in the presence of the ligand. Effects of MAFP Binding on FAAH Dynamic Fluorescence— The effects of MAFP binding to FAAH have been monitored by circular dichroism, steady-state, and dynamic fluorescence measurements. The CD spectra in the peptidic region (Fig. 6a) show a small change (≈-5%) at 222 nm suggesting that minor changes are induced at the secondary structure level. A more significant effect (≈-9%) is observed in the fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 6b), indicating that some modifications of the enzyme tertiary structure take place upon the addition of MAFP. This effect has been studied in more detail, by assessing the dependence of the FAAH fluorescence on MAFP concentration and excitation wavelength. The fluorescence decay of FAAH, measured by phase and modulation techniques (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 3-14Google Scholar), is rather heterogeneous and is characterized by a double, continuous distribution of lifetimes (Fig. 7a). Such a complex decay depends on the presence of both solvent-exposed and fully buried tryptophan residues (Fig. 1) that give different contributions (i.e. at longer and shorter wavelengths, respectively) to the total fluorescence signal. This is confirmed by the biphasic trend of the fluorescence spectrum position at increasing excitation wavelengths; the center of mass is in fact shifted from ≈345 to 360 nm, as a consequence of the photoselection of the more red-emitting species at longer excitation wavelengths (Fig. 7b). This effect is considerably reduced in the presence of MAFP (Fig. 7b), indicating that some partially exposed tryptophan residues became shielded upon ligand binding and were embedded in a more hydrophobic environment. This hypothesis would imply a reduced heterogeneity in the fluorescence dynamics, which has been indeed observed by measuring the lifetimes as a function of MAFP concentration (Fig. 7a). FAAH Stability Is Strongly Dependent on Its Quaternary Structure—Dimeric proteins represent an effective paradigm of the hierarchical organization that characterizes the complexity of biological macromolecules. For instance, their quaternary structure can be regarded as the simplest case of protein-protein interaction. Moreover, proteins can gain new structural and functional properties upon association of subunits, which are often unstable when separated (23Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 24Mei G. Di Venere A. Rosato N. Finazzi-Agrò A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fully folded monomeric intermediates are in fact an exception rather than a rule; in most cases they are only partially folded prior to association, resembling the so-called molten globule state, because of their loose tertiary structure. Thus, a possible rationale for subunit association into dimeric structures may reside in the enhanced stability gained by a better shielding of the hydrophobic regions from the solvent molecules. In line with this, the unfolding experiments indicate that most of the free energy change occurs during the first transition, i.e. when the two subunits are taken apart (Tables 1 and 2). This process is also accompanied by a considerable change in the accessible surface area, as deduced from the m1 values reported in Table 1. It is noteworthy that such a change (ΔASA ≈14,000 Å2) is 3–4 times larger than that estimated from the crystallographic data (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) if only a dissociation into fully unfolded monomers had taken place (i.e. 1600 Å2 × 2 = 3200 Å2). Thus, it can be inferred that the protein quaternary structure protects not only the residues at the dimeric interface from solvation but also a part of those buried inside each subunit. This hypothesis is in line with the loss (-15%) of the CD signal at 222 nm (Fig. 2, inset), diagnostic of a conformational change possibly associated with a partial loosening also of the protein secondary structure. According to high pressure measurements, the substantial volume decrease at 2300 bars (Table 2) would also point to the same direction, i.e. to water penetration into the protein core upon dissociation. Pressure is known to physically force the solvent to fill cavities inside a protein matrix, thus perturbing the native conformation. In fact, negative ΔV values such as that calculated here for FAAH have been found in the vast majority of pressure-induced dissociation and unfolding studies (21Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 50: 245-252Google Scholar, 25Royer C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1595: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The mutual protection from solvent molecules upon subunit association appears to be a well designed folding strategy to match the functional requirements of FAAH. Indeed the enzyme has to deal with hydrophobic substrates requiring an appropriate environment to be bound and processed. Such an environment, which includes a series of channels interconnected through the protein structure (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 5Cravatt B.F. Lichtman A.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), is probably the “Achille's heel” of the monomers, being more easily flooded by water when the two subunits are taken apart. Insights into Structural Changes Induced by MAFP Binding— As shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 5 and in Tables 1 and 2, the binding of MAFP by FAAH has two important consequences as follows: (i) ≈40% decrease in the ability of the protein to stick to the liposomes; (ii) ≈12% increase in the stabilization of free energy. These features suggest that some kind of conformational change is occurring upon MAFP binding, which involves the protein domain that interacts with the surface of lipid bilayers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the trimmed enzyme (ΔTM-FAAH) is still active and able to bind to membranes, despite the lack of the 1–29 amino acid trans-membrane tail (14Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The putative region of ΔTM-FAAH still interacting with the lipid leaflets has been identified to be the α-helices 18 and 19, located in the lower part of the protein structure (Fig. 1a), quite close to the substrate entrance gate to the active site from the membrane side (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The CD spectra with or without MAFP (Fig. 6a) indicate that MAFP binding does not produce major modifications in the protein secondary structure, whereas significant effects are seen in the FAAH tertiary structure, as shown by steady-state (Figs. 6b and 7b) and dynamic fluorescence (Fig. 7a). The data demonstrate that MAFP binding effects are greater at longer excitation wavelengths, i.e. where the contribution of the “blue emitting” species (phenylalanines, tyrosines, and fully buried tryptophans) is negligible because of photoselection. Looking at the location of the seven tryptophans per subunit of FAAH (Fig. 1, a and b), it is evident that five of them belong to two quite distinct classes, i.e. solventexposed (Trp413, Trp208, and Trp105) and fully buried (Trp445 and Trp462). The remaining two tryptophan residues (Trp556 and Trp531) are instead only partially buried, the first one within the dimeric interface, and the second one between the active site and the membrane binding domain. The latter seems to be the best candidate to probe changes in the FAAH fluorescence dynamics upon MAFP binding, because of its peculiar location. In fact, the heterogeneity of the fast emission decay (Fig. 7a) is dramatically affected by binding of the inhibitor, which suggests an increased rigidity in the domain surrounding Trp531.In addition, Fig. 8 shows that the dynamics of this residue is constrained by the presence of the MAFP molecule. Also phenylalanine 432 cooperates with MAFP in the immobilization of the tryptophan 531 side chain. The lack of local mobility of Trp531 is in line with the reduced relaxation at λex ≈300 nm, as reported in Fig. 7. The occurrence of larger structural changes upon MAFP binding may not be excluded, even if they cannot be detected by tryptophan fluorescence. As a matter of fact, these structural changes could be relevant, as demonstrated by the loss of the membrane binding ability (Fig. 5). In the same line, a tighter structure of the region around Trp531 might also indirectly affect the residues at the protein surface and, most notably, arginine 486 and aspartic acid 403 (Fig. 8). These two residues face the lipid bilayer when FAAH is bound to membranes and delineate the internal channel that crosses each subunit and contains the active site. Furthermore, it is important to note that the above-mentioned phenylalanine 432 belongs to one of the two α-helices (α19) which constitute the FAAH-membrane binding cap. It is therefore tempting to speculate that even a small displacement occurring in this portion of the protein might weaken the interaction with liposomes (Fig. 5). The correlation between the presence of MAFP and the enhanced protein stability is more difficult to explain. One possibility is that upon ligand binding the two subunits can penetrate each other a little further, so that dissociation is more difficult (Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 2 and 3). This hypothesis is also supported by the behavior of thermophilic enzymes. Their increased rigidity protects against unfolding and preserves the catalytically active structure at elevated temperature (26Li W.F. Zhou X.X. Lu P. Biotechnol. Adv. 2005; 23: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Quite interestingly, one peculiar FAAH region that can be involved in this process is the area around Trp445. This residue is in fact protruding in each partner monomer, making the surrounding patch particularly rich in contacts between two monomers. The proximity of Trp445 to the ligand-binding site of the partner chain makes this hypothesis extremely attractive, because it could provide new clues on the structure-to-function relationship of FAAH and, in particular, on the possible link between its quaternary interactions and the mechanism of substrate binding and release. In conclusion, this is the first detailed investigation of the stability of FAAH under chemical or physical denaturation. The present findings suggest that local conformational changes at or near the active site might help to tighten the interaction between the two subunits of FAAH, affecting not only its activity but also its interaction with biological membranes.

(2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 14509-14514). The Ap2A isomer P24, containing an unusual C1′-N3 N-glycosidic bond, is shown here to affect mitochondrial function through (i) opening of the permeability transition pore complex (and consequent proton gradient dissipation) and (ii) inhibition of Complex I of the respiratory chain. Whereas proton gradient dissipation is dependent upon the extracellular Ca2+ influx triggered by P24, the effect on oxygen consumption is Ca2+ independent. The proton gradient dissipation induces apoptosis in HeLa cells and thus appears to be responsible for the already described potent cytotoxic effect of P24 on several human cell types. The other products of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, Ap2A and cADPR, antagonize P24-induced proton gradient dissipation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that the relative concentration of P24, cADPR, and Ap2A in cyclase-positive cells may affect the balance between cell life and death.

The Ca2+-active products of ADPRCs known so far include cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), ADP-ribose (ADPR), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+), and the ADP-ribose dimer (ADPR2). cADPR is produced from NAD+ by means of the reaction typical of the ADPRC family that removes the nicotinamide moiety and creates an unusual C1′-N1 bond that cyclizes the ADPR molecule (4.Lee H.C.

Recently, ADPRCs from Porifera, molluscs, and mammals have been shown to catalyze an additional reaction on cADPR, introducing adenine into the C1′-N1 bond of the cyclic nucleotide and generating three new adenine homodinucleotides, called P18, P24, and P31 from their high pressure liquid chromatography retention times (16.Basile G.

P18 and P24 are two isomers of Ap2A, each containing an unusual N-glycosidic bond between the newly introduced adenine and one ribose, C1′-NI in P18 and C1′-N3 in P24 (16.Basile G.

Through different mechanisms, Ap2A and its isomers all affect the [Ca2+]i when applied extracellularly to intact cells at micromolar (1 μm) concentrations; P18 induces a decrease of the [Ca2+]i, P24 conversely induces an increase of the [Ca2+]i through extracellular calcium influx, and Ap2A synergizes with cADPR in releasing Ca2+ from ryanodine receptor (16.Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Not unexpectedly, all three dinucleotides affect cell proliferation (a typically Ca2+-controlled cell function) in human cell lines and in hemopoietic progenitors. Specifically, P18 and P24 both show a potent cytotoxic effect on cell lines and an even more severe growth inhibitory effect on hemopoietic progenitor colony growth (with IC50 values of 1.0 and 0.18 μm, respectively). Ap2A conversely stimulates hemopoietic progenitor colony growth and synergizes with cADPR, recently demonstrated to behave as a hemopoietic growth factor (20.Podesta` M. Benvenuto F. Pitto A. Figari O. Bacigalupo A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Paleari L. Bodrato N. Usai C. De Flora A. Zocchi E. J. Biol.

These results prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of P18 and of P24, also in view of their potential use as novel antileukemic pharmaceuticals in clinical hematology. Results obtained demonstrate that mitochondria are a major target of P24 toxicity, with micromolar concentrations of the dinucleotide inducing (i) dissipation of the mitochondrial proton gradient (ΔΨm) in intact cells through opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and (ii) inhibition of the respiratory chain in isolated mitochondria, acting on Complex I. Conversely, P18 and Ap2A do not show significant effects on any of these functions, indicating the absolute requirement for a C1′-N3 bond in the adenine dinucleotide to exert its mitochondrial effects. Whereas dissipation of ΔΨm is dependent upon the [Ca2+]i increase, inhibition of Complex I is Ca2+ independent. These results identify P24 as a novel endogenous regulator of mitochondrial function in mammalian cells, thus extending the physiological functions of the family of ADPRC products to include control of cell respiration. Interestingly, cADPR and Ap2A partially antagonize P24-induced cytotoxicity and proton gradient dissipation, suggesting that the relative intracellular concentrations of these ADPRC products may affect cell life and death. Materials−P18 and P24 were produced and purified as described (16.Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E.

Cyclosporin A (CsA), carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), rotenone, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), propidium iodide (PI), and Hoechst 33258 were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin H was obtained from Axxora (San Diego, CA). Microscopical Evaluation of Necrosis and Apoptosis−HeLa cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified medium, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum plus 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded into 24-well plates and exposed to either P18 or P24 at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. Cells were then incubated with 10 μm Hoechst 33258 and 1 μm PI for 5 min to estimate the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells, respectively, as described in Ref. 22.Ormerod M.G. Sun X.M. Brown D. Snowden R.T. Cohen G.M. Acta Oncol. 1993; 32: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. After washing with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), stained cells were identified under a fluorescence microscope using excitation/emission wavelengths of 340/440 ± 25 and 568/585 ± 25 nm for Hoechst 33258 and PI, respectively. Three randomly selected fields were acquired from each treatment. The corresponding bright field images were also acquired, and the three channels were overlaid using the appropriate function of the Metamorph software. At least 100 cells were counted for each treatment, and the percentage of apoptotic or necrotic cells was determined. Swelling and Oxygen Consumption of Isolated Mitochondria−Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from albino Wistar rats by standard centrifugation techniques as described (23.Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in standard medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 μm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 5/2.5 mm glutamate/malate or 5 mm succinate as substrates. Mitochondrial swelling was followed as the change of 90° light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension at 540 nm in a PerkinElmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer (24.Scorrano L.

All assays were performed at 25 °C on instruments equipped with thermostatic control and magnetic stirring. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Intact Cells−For measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were washed and incubated in HBSS and 10 mm HEPES in the presence of 10 nm TMRM and 1.6 μm cyclosporin H at 37 °C for the times indicated in Fig. 2. Treatment of control cells with cyclosporin H is necessary because the extent of cell, and hence of mitochondrial, loading with potentiometric probes is affected by the activity of the plasma membrane multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, which is inhibited by cyclosporin H (25.Ryffel B. Woerly G. Rodriguez C. Foxwell B.M. J. Recept. Res. 1991; 11: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica TCS SL confocal microscope, equipped with a HCX PL APO CS 63.0 × 1.40 oil objective, at 1-min intervals. Cell Calcium Measurements−For cytosolic Ca2+ measurements, adherent HeLa cells (2 × 104/well in 96-well plates) were incubated in complete medium with Fluo 3-AM (10 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice in HBSS, and cell fluorescence was monitored at 1-min intervals on a Fluostar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) at λex 485 nm and λem 520 nm after addition of the various dinucleotides as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5A. For mitochondrial Ca2+ measurements, adherent HeLa cells in complete medium (105/well, in LabTek chambers; Nalge Nunc Int. Corp., Naperville, IL) were co-incubated with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Rho 2-AM (4.5 μm) and the mitochondrial tracer Mitofluor green (20 nm) for 30 min at 22 °C. Cells were washed twice in HBSS, and images of the regions of probe colocalization (4-5/cell, ≥10 cells/field) were acquired at 1-min intervals on a Leica TCS SL confocal microscope. Cytotoxicity Assays−HeLa cells were seeded in triplicate (104/well) in 96-well plates and exposed to the various treatments described in the legends to Figs. 4 and 6. After 24 h of culture, cells were washed twice in HBSS and incubated for 20 min in the presence of calcein green (2.5 mg/ml). A standard curve of cells, freshly seeded at increasing density (0.5-2.0 × 104/well), was prepared and stained in parallel. Cells were washed three times in HBSS, and the fluorescence was measured with a FluoStar Optima microplate reader at λex 485 and λem 520 nm. The number of viable cells was estimated by comparison of sample fluorescence with the linear standard curve.FIGURE 6Effect of P18, cADPR, and Ap2A on P24 cytotoxicity. HeLa cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of P24 at increasing concentrations (5-20 μm) without (rhombus) or with the addition of a 5-fold excess of P18 (square) or cADPR (triangle) or Ap2A (circle). The number of viable cells was estimated with calcein green (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Indeed, HeLa cell viabilitywasseverelyreducedbyP24inatime-andconcentrationdependent manner; the IC50 of P24 was 10 μm after 24 h of incubation, similar to that already reported (16.Basile G.

A. 2005; 102: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the same concentrations and for the same duration of exposure, P18 was ineffective, in agreement with the reported IC50 value of P18 in HeLa cells, which is 1 log higher than that of P24 (16.Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The occurrence of necrosis and/or apoptosis was investigated by assessing the staining of nuclei with PI and Hoechst 33258, respectively. Fig. 1A shows representative images of HeLa cells incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of 10 μm P24 for 24 h. The P24-treated cultures showed a marked decrease of the cell number and an increase of the proportion of blue, i.e. apoptotic, cells. The percentage of necrotic and apoptotic cells in P24- and P18-treated cultures was determined, and results are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. An incubation time shorter than 24 h was chosen to avoid loss of adherent cells due to cell death. The decrease of cell viability in P24-incubated cultures occurred mostly because of apoptosis, although at higher P24 concentrations a significant proportion of cell death was due to necrosis. Conversely, at the same concentrations, P18 did not significantly modify the percentage of necrotic and apoptotic cells as compared with untreated controls. P24 Dissipates the Mitochondrial Proton Gradient in Intact Cells−Because mitochondrial alterations are known to play a major role in determining cell death, we investigated the effect of P24 on mitochondrial functions to elucidate the mechanisms underlying its cytotoxicity. Thus, intact cells were incubated in the presence of P24 and ΔΨm was measured with the fluorescent probe TMRM. As shown in Fig. 2, A (blue trace) and C, P24 induced a progressive decrease in TMRM fluorescence, reflecting a fall of ΔΨm. The slight decrease in fluorescence obtained upon addition of the uncoupler FCCP indicated that ΔΨm was already almost completely abolished after incubation of the cells for 30 min with 20 μm P24. The effect of P24 on ΔΨm was concentration dependent, with as low as 50 nm P24 dissipating ∼30% of the TMRM fluorescence after 2 h of incubation of the cells (not shown). Under physiological conditions, ΔΨm is maintained by the proton pumping activity of the respiratory chain complexes. However, when the electron flow is hampered, ΔΨm maintenance is allowed by the proton pumping activity of the F0F1-ATPase, powered by ATP hydrolysis. The contribution of respiratory chain or ATP hydrolysis to ΔΨm maintenance can be assessed by using selective inhibitors. Addition of oligomycin, an inhibitor of F0F1-ATPase, did not affect ΔΨm (Fig. 2, A (black trace) and C), indicating that in the absence of any impairment of the respiratory chain ATP hydrolysis does not contribute to the generation of mitochondrial membrane potential, as expected. Conversely, the addition of oligomycin to P24-treated cells caused an abrupt fall of ΔΨm (Fig. 2, A (red trace) and C). On the one hand, this result suggests an inhibitory effect of P24 on the respiratory chain. On the other hand, the effect elicited by oligomycin rules out the possibility that adenylate translocase or F0F1-ATPase are also severely affected by P24, as oligomycin would have been without further effect if ATP uptake or hydrolysis were already inhibited. The addition of rotenone alone, an inhibitor of Complex I, resulted in only a slight decrease of the ΔΨm (Fig. 2, A (purple trace) and C) due to the progressive consumption of ATP for proton pumping by the F0F1-ATPase. The addition of rotenone to P24-treated cells, however, induced a faster and greater decrease of ΔΨm (Fig. 2, A (green trace) and C) than either that of P24 (blue trace) or of rotenone (purple trace) alone, suggesting that a mechanism other than respiratory chain inhibition is primarily responsible for ΔΨm dissipation triggered by P24. P24 has been shown to induce an increase of the [Ca2+]i through extracellular Ca2+ influx (16.Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cells for 1 h with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA-AM (0.5 mm) prior to exposure to P24 prevented ΔΨm dissipation (Fig. 2, B (red trace) and C), as did presence of EDTA (not shown), demonstrating a causal role of the [Ca2+]i increase in mediating the effect of P24 on ΔΨm. P18, cADPR, and Ap2A, at concentrations ranging between 1.0 and 10 μm, did not significantly affect ΔΨm (not shown). P24 Affects Oxygen Consumption of Isolated Rat Liver Mitochondria−To verify an inhibitory effect of P24 on the respiratory chain and to identify the site of inhibition, experiments were carried out on isolated rat liver mitochondria. Oxygen consumption was measured in the presence of CsA to avoid possible interference of the mitochondrial PTP. In fact, PTP opening can affect oxygen consumption due to its uncoupling-like effect and to the release of pyridine nucleotides (26.Di Lisa F. Menabo` R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 27.Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the presence of the NAD+-dependent substrates glutamate/malate, the increase over basal values of the oxygen consumption stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP was reduced by 86% after preincubation of mitochondria with 10 μm P24 for 10 min (Table 1). Conversely, P24 did not affect the utilization of succinate in the presence of rotenone (Table 1). Therefore, P24 inhibits electron transfer at the level of Complex I, but not of Complex II. P24 also inhibited ADP-stimulated respiration (State 3) in the presence of the Complex I substrates glutamate/malate (Table 1) nearly as efficiently as it inhibited the uncoupler-induced respiration (88 versus 86%). The fact that P24 failed to inhibit the ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption in the presence of the Complex II substrate succinate unequivocally demonstrates that P24 does not affect F0F1-ATPase or adenine nucleotide translocase as their inhibition would have affected also the activity of Complex II.TABLE 1Effect of P24 on oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondriaSubstratesState 4State 3 O2 consumptionFCCPnanoatoms O2/min/mgGlutamate/malateControl8.90 ± 1.0318.21 ± 2.2124.57 ± 3.68P2410.73 ± 1.29*11.80 ± 1.93*12.90 ± 1.82**Succinate/rotenoneControl24.14 ± 2.7873.76 ± 8.1196.11 ± 8.65P2433.21 ± 4.04**76.46 ± 9.18100.49 ± 12.06 Open table in a new tab Basal oxygen consumption (State 4) was significantly higher in P24-treated mitochondria, compared with controls, in the presence of substrates of either Complex I (20% increase) or Complex II (37% increase) (Table 1). Thus, P24 behaves as a mild uncoupler, in line with the decrease of the ΔΨm described in the previous paragraph. The effect of P24 on uncoupled respiration displayed a dose dependence, because oxygen consumption was inhibited by 20 and 40% in the presence of 0.1 and 1.0 μm P24, respectively. Similar results as those described above were obtained in the presence of EGTA, indicating that the effects of P24 on respiration were not Ca2+-dependent. P18, cADPR, and Ap2A, at concentrations ranging between 1.0 and 10 μm, did not significantly affect oxygen consumption (not shown). P24 Induces Mitochondrial Swelling by Opening the Permeability Transition Pore−The fact that P24 and rotenone together induced a larger dissipation of ΔΨm than that caused by either compound alone (Fig. 2, A and C) suggested presence of an additional mechanism of ΔΨm dissipation triggered by P24, besides inhibition of the respiratory chain. Because neither F0F1-ATPase nor adenylate translocase was inhibited by P24, we investigated whether P24 induced the opening of the mitochondrial PTP, which could account for the observed decrease of ΔΨm (27.Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Swelling of the mitochondrial matrix was monitored as decrease in absorbance at 540 nm, reflecting a decrease in light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension. Intact mitochondria were suspended in the presence of the highest Ca2+ concentration insufficient per se to trigger mitochondrial swelling, yet necessary to ensure PTP opening in response to specific stimuli (28.Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Indeed, P24 at 5 μm caused mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 3), which could be attributed to PTP opening based on the significant (75%) inhibition exerted by CsA (29.Halestrap A.P. Connern C.P. Griffiths E.J. Kerr P.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The fact that CsA also significantly reduced (by ∼70%) the drop of TMRM fluorescence by P24 (Fig. 2, B (green trace) and C) indicates a causal role of PTP opening in ΔΨm"

Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) is a ubiquitously expressed GAP for Rac1 and Cdc42. In this study, we set out to identify CdGAP-binding partners and, using a yeast two-hybrid approach, glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK-3α) was identified as a partner for CdGAP. GSK-3 exists in two isoforms, α and β, and is involved in regulating many cellular functions from insulin response to tumorigenesis. We show that GSK-3α and -β interact with CdGAP in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP both in vitro and in vivo on Thr-776, which we have previously shown to be an ERK 1/2 phosphorylation site involved in CdGAP regulation. We report that the mRNA and protein levels of CdGAP are increased upon serum stimulation and that GSK-3 activity is necessary for the up-regulation of the protein levels of CdGAP but not for the increase in mRNA. We conclude that GSK-3 is an important regulator of CdGAP and that regulation of CdGAP protein levels by serum presents a novel mechanism for cells to control Cdc42/Rac1 GTPase signaling pathways.

GSK-3 exists in two isoforms, α and β, and is involved in regulating many cellular functions from insulin response to tumorigenesis. We show that GSK-3α and -β interact with CdGAP in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP both in vitro and in vivo on Thr-776, which we have previously shown to be an ERK 1/2 phosphorylation site involved in CdGAP regulation. We report that the mRNA and protein levels of CdGAP are increased upon serum stimulation and that GSK-3 activity is necessary for the up-regulation of the protein levels of CdGAP but not for the increase in mRNA. We conclude that GSK-3 is an important regulator of CdGAP and that regulation of CdGAP protein levels by serum presents a novel mechanism for cells to control Cdc42/Rac1 GTPase signaling pathways. The Rho subfamily of small GTPases controls a wide variety of cellular functions. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the best known members of this family, and they are most often associated with their roles as regulators of cytoskeleton remodeling and as key mediators of the activation of transcription of genes downstream of growth factor receptors (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Much evidence exists linking Rho GTPases to transformation of cells; however, contrary to the Ras gene, activating mutations in Rho genes are rarely found in human cancers (2Benitah S.A. Valeron P.F. van Aelst L. Marshall C.J. Lacal J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1705: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gomez del Pulgar T. Benitah S.A. Valeron P.F. Espina C. Lacal J.C. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It seems instead that the expression of Rho GTPases and expression and function of regulators of the Rho subfamily of GTPases are altered during cellular transformation (2Benitah S.A. Valeron P.F. van Aelst L. Marshall C.J. Lacal J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1705: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gomez del Pulgar T. Benitah S.A. Valeron P.F. Espina C. Lacal J.C. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases act in a cycle as molecular switches with an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). The GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 5The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CdGAP, Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein; CdGAP-l, CdGAP long isoform; CdGAP-s, CdGAP short isoform; PRD, proline-rich domain; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; ActD, actinomycin D; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside; MBP, myelin basic protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. negatively regulate the GTPases by enhancing the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). To date, ∼70 human genes are predicted to encode for potential RhoGAP proteins (4Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar), which is roughly triple the number of Rho GTPases (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). This lends weight to the notion that regulators like the RhoGAPs tightly control Rho GTPases and lend context-dependent specificity to their processes. Thus, the activity of RhoGAPs must be highly regulated in both spatial and temporal fashions. RhoGAPs are regulated at the protein level by a variety of mechanisms ranging from protein-protein interactions to phosphorylation, lipid interactions, and proteolytic degradation (5Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) has been shown to regulate both Cdc42 and Rac1 in vitro and in vivo and exists in two main isoforms: a short form of 820 amino acids containing an N-terminal RhoGAP domain, a central region, and a C-terminal proline-rich region (PRD) (6Jenna S.

Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that CdGAP activity is negatively controlled by protein-protein interactions via the endocytic protein intersectin (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and by phosphorylation within its PRD (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to look for binding partners for the PRD of CdGAP and found glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) as an interacting partner. GSK-3α and its closely related isoform GSK-3β are serine/threonine protein kinases initially identified as key enzymes in the regulation of glycogen metabolism by insulin and are now known to be implicated in many diverse cellular processes including tumorigenesis, cell survival, and developmental patterning (9Ali A. Hoeflich K.P. Woodgett J.R. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2527-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that GSK-3β can also bind CdGAP. We further report that GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP in vivo under serum-starved conditions where GSK-3 is most active. GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP both in vitro and in vivo at Thr-776, which we have previously shown to be an ERK1/2 phosphorylation site involved in CdGAP regulation (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the mRNA and protein levels of CdGAP are up-regulated in response to serum in a transcriptionally mediated manner and that GSK-3 activity is critical in the up-regulation of protein levels but not mRNA levels. Reagents and Antibodies—Lithium chloride, AR-A014418, SB 415286, actinomycin D (ActD), and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB) were purchased from Sigma Canada, and sodium chloride was from Fisher. Anti-GSK-3α antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GSK-3β antibody was from Cell Signaling Technologies, anti-GSK3 (both α and β) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-phospho-GSK-3 antibody, anti-phospho-Ser-641 glycogen synthase, and anti-glycogen synthase antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (3,000 μCi/ml) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant GSK-3α and -β and phospho-glycogen synthase peptide were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-CdGAP antibodies were produced and purified as described previously (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Tcherkezian J. Triki I. Stenne R. Danek E.I. Lamarche-Vane N. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Thr-776 of CdGAP were produced by immunizing rabbits with a peptide CXPPPPT*PLEEEPE (T* represents phosphorylated threonine, and X represents hexanoic acid spacer). Serum from the immunized rabbits was taken and affinity-purified against the same peptide. This fraction was taken and run through a column containing a non-phosphorylated peptide CXPPPPTPLEEEPE, and the flow-through (antibody unable to bind the non-phosphorylated residue) was kept. Myc-tagged proteins were detected by using the 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, which was kindly provided by Dr. Nicole Beauchemin (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). DNA Constructs—CdGAP constructs were as described previously (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 98: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GSK-3α was obtained as a full clone in the pACTII vector (see “Yeast Two-hybrid Screen”). It was subcloned into pRK5 vector using the XhoI/EcoRI restriction sites. GSK-3β cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. James Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The PRD of CdGAP (amino acids 516–820) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (using a pYTH6 vector) and stably integrated into the genome of the Y190 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was used to screen a library of human brain cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain (pACTII vector) (a kind gift from Dr. Alan Hall, Sloan-Kettering, New York, NY) (12Driessens M.H. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as described previously (13Aspenstrom P. Olson M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Approximately 6 × 106 clones were screened for their ability to grow on selective medium containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The 80 fastest growing clones were replated, and plasmids were isolated using the Wizard clean-up kit (Promega) and retransformed into the CdGAP-PRD yeast strain. The clones growing on selective medium and positive for β-galactosidase activity were sequenced. Six clones corresponded to the entire coding sequence of GSK-3α. Cell Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—HEK-293, NIH 3T3, and U2OS cells (the latter kindly provided by Dr. Christopher E. Turner, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and maintained at an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK-293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2 μg total of DNA (1 μg of either GSK-3α or GSK-3β along with 1 μg of empty vector, pRK5myc-CdGAP-s, pRK5myc-CdGAP-l, or pRK5myc-CdGAP-PRD) was transfected per 60-mm dish. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 1,000 × g. Then, 1 mg of the resulting postnuclear supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-Myc antibodies and 25 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Myc, anti-GSK-3α, or anti-GSK-3β antibodies. NIH 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, cells were serum-starved for 20 h followed by stimulation with 15% serum for various periods of time. The cells were lysed as described above, and the amount of protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA kit. Equal amounts of total protein from the various stimulation conditions were submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. U2OS cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, cells were serum-starved for 20 h followed by a 4-h stimulation with GSK-3 inhibitors. The cells were lysed as described above, and the amount of protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA kit. Equal amounts of total protein were submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vivo [32P]orthophosphate Labeling—NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight. The cells were either left untreated or were treated with 50 mm LiCl, 50 mm NaCl, or 0.1% Me2SO or with 100 μm SB 415286 or AR-A014418 for 1 h. This was followed by a 1-h incubation in either phosphate-free medium or phosphate-free medium treated with the above-mentioned compounds for 1 h. Cells were then incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml, with or without treatment with the above mentioned compounds. The cells were lysed, and CdGAP was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-CdGAP antibodies (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. The samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and then autoradiography and Western blotting against CdGAP. In Vitro Kinase Assay and Phospho-Amino Acid Analysis—Hexahistidine fusion proteins—CdGAP-PRD or CdGAP-PRD-T776A were produced and purified as described previously (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). His-tagged CdGAP-PRD or CdGAP-PRD-T776A were incubated with 10 ng of active GSK-3α or GSK-3β (Upstate Biotechnology) in 8 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 200 nm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. A range of CdGAP-PRD concentrations from 18.2 nm to 9.32 μm were used to estimate the Km value using the Lineweaver-Burk equation (14Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1988: 187-191Google Scholar). Phospho-amino acid analysis was performed as described previously (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight. The cells were either left untreated or treated with 15% serum or with 15% serum with transcriptional or GSK-3 inhibitors for various times. Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). mRNA was reverse-transcribed using enzymes from Invitrogen. The cDNA was then run in a quantitative real-time PCR reaction using a Roche Applied Science Lightcycler, Qiagen Quantitect Sybr green reagents, and CdGAP primers obtained from Geneglobe. 18 S ribosomal subunit primers (a kind gift from Dr. Simon Wing, McGill University) were used as a loading control. The PRD of CdGAP harbors five consensus SH3-binding motifs and is known to be necessary in the regulation of CdGAP activity (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To identify target proteins that interact with CdGAP through this region of the protein, we used the PRD (amino acids 516–820) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a human brain cDNA library. GSK-3α was isolated as a positive clone growing on selective medium (Fig. 1A) and expressing β-galactosidase (Fig. 1B). To examine whether CdGAP interacts with both GSK-3α and GSK-3β in mammalian cells, Myc-tagged CdGAP-long (CdGAP-l), short (CdGAP-s), or PRD (CdGAP-PRD) and GSK-3α (Fig. 2A) or GSK-3β (Fig. 2B) were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and CdGAP-s, CdGAP-l, and CdGAP-PRD were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both GSK-3α and GSK-3β co-immunoprecipitated with CdGAP-s and -l, as well as with the PRD of CdGAP in mammalian cells. Taken together, these data indicate that CdGAP interacts with both GSK-3α and GSK-3β.FIGURE 2CdGAP interacts with GSK-3 in mammalian cells. GSK-3α (A) and GSK-3β (B) were co-transfected with either pRK5myc vector or pRK5myc vector containing CdGAP-s, CdGAP-l, or CdGAP-PRD into HEK 293 cells. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were performed against the Myc epitope tag and GSK-3α (A) or GSK-3β (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that both CdGAP-s and CdGAP-l are highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in fibroblasts (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Tcherkezian J. Triki I. Stenne R. Danek E.I. Lamarche-Vane N. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated that CdGAP-l is in vivo phosphorylated at a basal level in serum-starved conditions where GSK-3 is mostly active (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), and further phosphorylation is stimulated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in response to serum (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate whether endogenous CdGAP phosphorylation is mediated by GSK-3, NIH 3T3 cells endogenously expressing the long isoform of CdGAP (CdGAP-l) were serum-starved overnight and were then left untreated or were treated with the GSK-3 inhibitors LiCl (9Ali A. Hoeflich K.P. Woodgett J.R. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2527-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), SB 415286 (16Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C.

Markgren P.O. Borgegard T. Nylof M. Gimenez-Cassina A. Hernandez F. Lucas J.J. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45937-45945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) for 1 h prior to incubation in phosphate-free medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate. As expected, GSK-3 activity was inhibited as indicated by Western blotting for phospho-Ser-641 of glycogen synthase, a known GSK-3 substrate (18Picton C. Woodgett J. Hemmings B. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Additionally, inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl is indicated by the increase in phospho-serine 9 of GSK-3, a site whose phosphorylation is affected by LiCl but not the SB 415286 or AR-A014418 inhibitors (19Lochhead P.A. Coghlan M. Rice S.Q. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). CdGAP-l was phosphorylated under serum-starved conditions where GSK-3 was active, as well as when sodium chloride and Me2SO were present as negative controls; however, its phosphorylation was significantly reduced by the three GSK-3 inhibitors (Fig. 3A). Therefore, these results show that CdGAP-l is in vivo phosphorylated by GSK-3 in NIH 3T3 cells. We next tested whether GSK-3 phosphorylates CdGAP in vitro. Since we know that most of the phosphorylation of CdGAP is in the PRD (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we performed in vitro kinase assays with recombinant His-tagged CdGAP-PRD incubated with activated GSK-3α or -β. As shown in Fig. 4A, both GSK-3α and GSK-3β were able to phosphorylate CdGAP-PRD in vitro. Using a range of CdGAP-PRD concentrations from 18.2 nm to 9.32 μm, we estimated a Km value of 0.5 μm, showing that CdGAP-PRD is a very good substrate for GSK-3 (Fig. 4B). To determine which types of residues are phosphorylated by GSK-3, CdGAP-PRD phosphorylated in vitro by GSK-3α was used to perform a phospho-amino acid analysis. We found that CdGAP-PRD is mainly phosphorylated on threonine residues (Fig. 4C). The predicted consensus phosphorylation motif for GSK-3 consists of (S/T)XXX(pS/pT) (20Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), in which a proline is a preferred residue adjacent to the phosphorylation site, and in most cases, a “primed” phosphorylation site is required at the +4 position prior to GSK-3 phosphorylation of its substrates (20Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, several targets of GSK-3 bypass the need for the +4 phosphorylation by substituting a charged residue at this site (21Eldar-Finkelman H. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Trivedi N. Marsh P. Goold R.G. Wood-Kaczmar A. Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest since GSK-3 efficiently phosphorylates CdGAP-PRD in vitro, whereas targets of GSK-3 that need priming generally make poor in vitro substrates of GSK-3, indicating that it may not need to be primed. CdGAP contains one atypical motif, within the proline-rich domain, 776TPLEE780. We mutated Thr-776 to alanine and determined by in vitro kinase assays that its phosphorylation by GSK-3α and -β was significantly reduced when compared with wild-type CdGAP-PRD (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that Thr-776 is a target site of ERK1/2 and acts as an important regulatory site of CdGAP activity in vivo (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We then developed a polyclonal antibody against CdGAP phospho-Thr-776. This antibody was able by Western blotting to recognize Myc-tagged CdGAP-s protein overexpressed in COS-7 fibroblasts but was unable to recognize both Myc-tagged CdGAP-s T776A and recombinant CdGAP-PRD expressed in Escherichia coli (data not shown). When Myc-tagged CdGAP-s was expressed in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, we found that CdGAP-s was phosphorylated on Thr-776 (Fig. 5, A and B). However, when these cells were incubated with LiCl for 5 h, the level of CdGAP-s with phosphorylated Thr-776 was markedly decreased relative to both serum-starved conditions, as well as cells that were incubated with NaCl for 5 h (Fig. 5, A and B). Likewise, when cells were incubated with the GSK-3 inhibitor SB 415286 (16Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) for 5 h, the level of phospho-Thr-776 CdGAP-s was markedly decreased relative to both serum-starved conditions and cells that were incubated instead with Me2SO (Fig. 5, A and B). To examine whether Thr-776 of endogenous CdGAP is phosphorylated in vivo by GSK-3, U2OS osteosarcoma cells endogenously expressing the short isoform of CdGAP (23LaLonde D.P. Grubinger M. Lamarche-Vane N. Turner C.E. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1375-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were serum-starved overnight and then left untreated or were treated with the GSK-3 inhibitors SB 415286 or AR-A014418. We found that CdGAP-s was phosphorylated on Thr-776 under serum-starved conditions; however, CdGAP-s from cells that were incubated with the GSK-3 inhibitors showed a dramatic decrease in phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 5, C and D). As expected, the decrease in the levels of phospho-Ser-641 glycogen synthase relative to total glycogen synthase confirmed that GSK-3 activity was inhibited (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results indicate that GSK-3 phosphorylates in vivo the residue Thr-776 of CdGAP-s. GSK-3 regulates a great deal of cellular functions, including gene expression and protein stability (10Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). To determine whether GSK-3 affects CdGAP protein levels, we first examined the levels of endogenous CdGAP-l proteins in subconfluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stimulated with serum for various periods of time. Interestingly, we observed that CdGAP-l protein levels were significantly augmented in response to serum (Fig. 6, A and B). This induction occurred as early as 1 h after stimulation and showed a 3.7-fold increase in CdGAP protein levels after 5 h of serum stimulation (Fig. 6B). It has been reported that GSK-3 is only transiently inhibited by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and FGF-1, with GSK-3 regaining activity in as little as 20 min after stimulation (24Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Hashimoto M. Sagara Y. Langford D. Everall I.P. Mallory M. Everson A. Digicaylioglu M. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32985-32991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, after 5 h of stimulation with serum, the levels of total GSK-3 were unchanged, and inactive GSK-3 phosphorylated on Ser-9 was barely detectable (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 2). Under these conditions, we found that inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl did not alter the levels of CdGAP in serum-starved cells (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 2 and 6, and 6E); however, when GSK-3 activity was inhibited in cells stimulated with serum, the increase in CdGAP protein levels was blocked (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 1 and 5, and 6E). NaCl was used as a negative control and had a slight effect on the levels of CdGAP in either serum-stimulated or serum-starved cells (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2, and 6E). Consistent with the results obtained with LiCl inhibition of GSK-3, we found that both AR-A014418 and SB 415286 inhibited the increase in the levels of CdGAP proteins in response to serum (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus, these findings demonstrate that GSK-3 activity is necessary to regulate the levels of CdGAP proteins in response to serum. To address whether the change in the levels of CdGAP protein resulted from a change in mRNA levels, we determined the mRNA levels of CdGAP in serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7A, the mRNA levels of CdGAP-l increased over a period of 30 min to 5 h of serum stimulation, with a peak at 4 h (Fig. 7A). To determine whether this increase in CdGAP mRNA was mediated transcriptionally, serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were pretreated with either ActD or DRB prior to serum stimulation. These compounds inhibit transcription of RNA (26Ljungman M. Zhang F. Chen F. Rainbow A.J. McKay B.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In serum-starved cells treated with ActD or DRB, the mRNA levels of CdGAP appeared to be reduced when compared with control cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 7). Following serum stimulation, a slight increase in the levels of CdGAP mRNA was observed in the presence of ActD, whereas there was no increase in CdGAP mRNA levels in DRB-treated cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 6 and 8). This demonstrates that transcription is involved in the process of up-regulation of mRNA levels; however, it does not exclude the possibility that there may be some alternative mechanisms, such as mRNA stabilization. To determine whether GSK-3 affects the levels of CdGAP mRNA, serum-starved cells were treated with LiCl or NaCl while being stimulated with serum. As shown in Fig. 7C, the mRNA levels of CdGAP showed a 4-fold increase following a 5-h stimulation with serum, similar to the increase in protein levels (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the LiCl GSK-3 inhibitor did not inhibit the increase in CdGAP mRNA levels induced by serum (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these findings indicate that CdGAP expression is up-regulated by serum and that GSK-3 activity is necessary to regulate the levels of CdGAP proteins post-transcriptionally. To gain insight into the cellular function of CdGAP, we undertook a search for binding partners for the proline-rich domain of CdGAP, a region known to be important for the regulation of CdGAP activity (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Through a yeast-two hybrid screen, we identified GSK-3α as a binding partner for CdGAP-PRD and then determined that both GSK-3α and GSK-3β are able to interact with the short and long isoforms of CdGAP in mammalian cells. This, coupled with our knowledge of CdGAP phosphorylation within the PRD, led us to examine whether CdGAP is a physiological substrate for GSK-3. We found that inhibiting GSK-3 activity greatly attenuated the phosphorylation of endogenous CdGAP in both NIH 3T3 (Fig. 3) and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). Subsequent analysis in vitro led us to discover that GSK-3 can phosphorylate CdGAP on Thr-776 within the proline-rich domain of CdGAP. Using a polyclonal antibody that recognized the phosphorylated residue Thr-776 of CdGAP, we demonstrated that this residue is an in vivo target site of GSK-3 in both NIH 3T3 cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. The identification of Thr-776 as a GSK-3 phosphorylation site is of great interest for at least two reasons. First, this site is an atypical GSK-3 phosphorylation site. The motif 776TPLEE780 does not contain the usual +4 priming phospho-serine or phospho-threonine site that is typical for many GSK-3 substrates (21Eldar-Finkelman H. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Instead, it contains a negatively charged glutamic acid residue that can mimic the priming phosphorylation event required for the subsequent phosphorylation by GSK-3 (22Trivedi N. Marsh P. Goold R.G. Wood-Kaczmar A. Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This may in part explain why GSK-3 efficiently phosphorylates recombinant CdGAP-PRD in vitro as it would not require this substrate to be primed by another kinase. Of note, however, is that amino acid substitution of Thr-776 to alanine did not completely eliminate GSK-3 phosphorylation of CdGAP in vitro, suggesting that other residues are phosphorylated by GSK-3. Second is the fact that this residue is an ERK 1 phosphorylation site important in the negative regulation of the GAP activity of CdGAP (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although there are not many examples of substrate sites that function for both ERK and GSK-3, it has been reported that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β, and myelin basic protein (MBP) are phosphorylated at a consensus ERK/GSK-3 site (27Park B.H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 28Yu J.S. Yang S.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of CCAT/enhancer binding protein β, it appears that its phosphorylation at a GSK-3/ERK consensus site is required for the induction of adiponectin gene expression during differentiation of mouse fibroblasts into adipocytes (27Park B.H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For MBP, it is unclear what is the role of the consensus ERK/GSK-3 phosphorylation site, but this site is thought to play a role in changing the conformation of the protein, leading to changes in the interaction of MBP with the lipid bilayer in brain myelin (28Yu J.S. Yang S.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, our findings strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Thr-776 in the proline-rich domain of CdGAP is a consensus ERK-1/GSK-3 site required for a tight regulation of CdGAP activity under different cellular conditions. This study also demonstrates that the cellular protein levels of CdGAP are serum-responsive. Five hours after stimulation with serum, the protein levels of CdGAP within the cells are elevated, and we have shown that this is concomitant with an increase in the amount of CdGAP mRNA. The inhibition of CdGAP mRNA increase by ActD or DRB suggests that this process is transcriptionally mediated; however, it does not rule out the possibility that there may also be other mechanisms such as stabilization of the mRNA that contribute to this process as well. Interestingly, we found that GSK-3 activity is required for the serum-dependent increase in the cellular protein levels of CdGAP but not the mRNA levels. Thus, these findings indicate that GSK-3 is acting post-transcriptionally to regulate the protein levels of CdGAP. It remains to be determined whether GSK-3 stimulates CdGAP protein synthesis or regulates its stability. Although more studies have reported the converse situation, where GSK-3 phosphorylation leads to protein instability, there are a few examples of proteins being stabilized after phosphorylation by GSK-3, namely the retinoblastoma-related pocket protein RBL2/p130 (29Litovchick L. Chestukhin A. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8970-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα, a negative component of the circadian clock (30Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and axin, a component of the ternary complex including β-catenin and APC (31Yamamoto H.

As reported earlier by many studies, RhoGAPs are regulated post-translationally via various molecular mechanisms such as lipid interaction (32Ligeti E. Settleman J. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), protein-protein interaction (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J.

Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Clearly, CdGAP utilizes at least two of these mechanisms of regulation, including phosphorylation (8Tcherkezian J. Danek E.I. Jenna S. Triki I. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6314-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and protein-protein interactions (6Jenna S. Hussain N.K. Danek E.I. Triki I. Wasiak S. McPherson P.S. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to control its GAP activity. Here, we report for the first time the regulation of a RhoGAP protein at the transcriptional level in response to serum. The induction in mRNA levels occurred early (1 h) and peaked at 4 h, suggesting that CdGAP expression may represent a novel mitogen-inducible early gene (35Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to determine the molecular pathways necessary to activate CdGAP gene expression and their consequences on cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In conclusion, we have identified CdGAP as a novel GSK-3 substrate, and stimulation of the cellular protein and mRNA levels of CdGAP by serum provides a novel mechanism to control Cdc42/Rac1 GTPase signaling pathways.

Much less is known about the mechanisms of substrate recognition including the protein subunits and substrate determinants that distinguish pre-edited (pre-) mRNAs from other transcripts and DNA in mitochondria. We recently reported the first observations of direct editing complex interactions with a functional site for full-round U deletion, showed preferential association with the editing substrate, and provided evidence for one of the interacting subunits corresponding to KREPA2 (Ref. 35.Sacharidou A.

However, editing complex interactions at insertion sites have not been reported. Other recent reports showed that bacterially expressed recombinant versions of the subunits KREPA3 and KREPA4 bind RNA (36.Brecht M. Niemann M. Schluter E. Muller U.F. Stuart K. Goringer H.U. Mol.

Interestingly, efficient deletion and insertion editing have distinct requirements for a proposed pre-mRNA/gRNA ligation bridge (42.Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A. Rusche L. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell.

De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The above observations suggest that the editing complex recognitions in and near an ES may also differ between the two editing types. Our interconversion of functional ESs from deletion to insertion and vice versa experimentally demonstrated that the basic determinants that commit editing complexes into full-cycle deletion or insertion reside within the internal loop containing the targeted ES (41.Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Sacharidou A. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, additional features proximal and/or distal to an ES may modulate the efficiency of editosome assembly and catalysis. For example, discrete sequence changes affecting the pairing potential of residues adjoining an ES can significantly impact the specificity and efficacy of full-round and partial (“pre-cleaved”) editing (43.Igo Jr., R.P.

The current model of trypanosome RNA editing postulates that natural sites should be flanked by a proximal upstream duplex between a purine-rich pre-mRNA sequence and a gRNA 3′ poly-U tail (9.Blum B.

Mutational analysis of the gRNA 3′ region that stabilizes the upstream duplex can significantly enhance full-round editing in vitro (42.Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A. Rusche L. Sollner-Webb B. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8447-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In Leishmania tarentolae, an upstream duplex was used in model U-insertion substrates by one group (48.Kapushoc S.T. Simpson L.

RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The latter group proposed that pre-mRNA purine sequences have a role in editing that is independent of base-pairing with gRNA (48.Kapushoc S.T. Simpson L. RNA. 1999; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49.Kabb A.L. Oppegard L.M. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2575-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a CYb pre-mRNA substrate, a 34-nt A/U element appeared to modulate gRNA-directed and gRNA-independent insertion (51.Oppegard L.M. Kabb A.L. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33911-33919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and a discrete 5′ determinant near an editing site in a ND7 substrate was proposed (49.Kabb A.L.

Cell. 2002; 1: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), are based on natural purine-rich pre-mRNA fragments. We showed in A6 constructs that natural pre-mRNA extensions protruding from the upstream and downstream duplexes could be replaced by unnatural stretches without significant effects on editing. In one such construct, about half of a 5′ polypurine run proposed to stimulate editing in vitro (10.Kable M.L. Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Science. 1996; 273: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was substituted by pyrimidines (41.Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Sacharidou A. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, whether or not a specific pre-mRNA (or gRNA) sequence or its natural base composition modulates editing remains unclear. Previous structural studies in solutions of different natural-like mRNA/gRNA pairs have proposed that a common secondary structure may be important for editing complex recognition (53.Yu L.E. Koslowsky D.J. RNA. 2006; 12: 1050-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but this has not been tested in functional in vitro systems. Here we performed systematic sequence mutagenesis and ribose 2′-deoxynucleoside substitutions of a minimal A6 pre-mRNA/gRNA substrate to define functional determinants for both full-round U insertion and editing complex interactions at the targeted ES2. Our competition analyses of editing and RNA-protein interactions showed evidence of preferential association of editing complexes with the hybrid substrate. We observed that the requirement for the duplexes flanking the internal loop is sequence-independent, and artificial helices spanning a single turn support efficient editing. We also found that specific ribose 2′-hydroxyls in both strands of the downstream helix and, surprisingly, in the gRNA loop region strongly stimulate both pre-mRNA cleavage and editing complex interactions at the targeted insertion site. Moreover, 2′ deoxy substitution of the downstream helix affected scissile bond selectivity, whereas the tested modifications in either pre-mRNA or gRNA strand had relatively moderate effects. Notably, the 2′-hydroxyl moiety adjoining the scissile bond is an essential determinant of insertion, potentially involved in cleavage catalysis. The current studies of trypanosome full-round insertion editing provide significant insights on the relevance of the substrate secondary structure rather than its specific sequence and suggest that specific pre-mRNA and gRNA riboses significantly affect both pre-mRNA cleavage and editing complex interactions at the targeted bond. The starting substrate in these studies was the minimized ATPase 6 (A6) 45-nt pre-mRNA (41.Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Sacharidou A. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) paired with a variant of the enhanced gRNA gA6[14]USD-3A (47.Igo Jr., R.P. Palazzo S.S. Burgess M.L. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8447-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This substrate directs full-round insertion of 3Us at ES2 and uses pre-edited ES1 to increase the stability of the downstream duplex. RNAs were transcribed from a DNA template as described by Milligan et al. (54.Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C.

For Pair-25′ the donor piece was (4-ThioU)rArUrUrUrUGGAGTTATAGArA, #567). The acceptor pieces were synthesized by IDT®, and the thiolated donors were synthesized by Dharmacon®. The donor pieces were radiolabeled to high specific activity with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (MPBiomedicals) using a 1:2 molar ratio of ends:ATP, gel-purified, and ligated to the acceptor piece as described (35.Sacharidou A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Hernandez A. Dangott L.J. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J.

Procyclic T. brucei strain TREU667 was grown in Cunningham media, and mitochondrial extracts were prepared as described (56.Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Editing complexes were enriched by Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography and further purified by DNA-cellulose affinity chromatography as reported (5.Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J.

RNA. 2006; 12: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Additional enrichment can be achieved by using another step of Q-Sepharose; however, both editing and cross-linking activities were equivalent in the minimal substrate for full-round insertion (41.Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Sacharidou A. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) by complexes from the two-step and three-step purifications (see Fig. 7 and data not shown). Fractions with the peak of editing activity were used for all the experiments. Full-round U insertion was performed as described (39.Cruz-Reyes J. Rusche L.N. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-μl mixture with pre-annealed 3′-end-labeled pre-mRNA (∼10 fmol) and gRNA (1.2 pmol) was completed to 20 μl with 10 mm MRB buffer (10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 5% glycerol), 150 μm UTP, 3 μm ATP, and 2 μl of peak editing fraction. The reaction was incubated at 26 °C for 60 min, deproteinized, and resolved in 9% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Editing complexes were pretreated with 10 mm PPi to score total cleavage in absence of RNA ligase activity (22.Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. Huang C.E. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4652-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neither ATP nor UTP were added to this assay, and the cleavage products were resolved in 15% PAGE with 7 m urea. Ribonuclease T1 and hydroxyl ladders were used to confirm the cleavage at ES2 (not shown). All pre-mRNAs for editing were 3′-end-radiolabeled with [32P]cytidine 3′,5′-diphosphate except for the 2′-F-modified transcript (Pair-17), which had to be made with a 3′-terminal deoxynucleoside (Dharmacon). Such a terminus prevents radiolabeling with T4 RNA ligase (57.Nandakumar J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so this transcript was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Data were visualized by phosphorimaging and/or x-ray autoradiography, and quantitation was performed using a STORM PhosphorImager (ImageQuant 5.0, GE Healthcare).
