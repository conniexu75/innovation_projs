https://openalex.org/W2119006714,"Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow (<1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk."

Heart-regenerative therapy that uses pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is a potentially promising strategy for patients with heart disease, but the inability to generate highly purified cardiomyocytes in sufficient quantities has been a barrier to realizing this potential. Here, we report a nongenetic method for mass-producing cardiomyocytes from mouse and human PSC derivatives that is based on the marked biochemical differences in glucose and lactate metabolism between cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes, including undifferentiated cells. We cultured PSC derivatives with glucose-depleted culture medium containing abundant lactate and found that only cardiomyocytes survived. Using this approach, we obtained cardiomyocytes of up to 99% purity that did not form tumors after transplantation. We believe that our technological method broadens the range of potential applications for purified PSC-derived cardiomyocytes and could facilitate progress toward PSC-based cardiac regenerative therapy.

Integrated “omic” analyses reveal metabolic hallmarks in ESCs and cardiomyocytes Glucose depletion and lactate supplementation can purify PSC-derived cardiomyocytes Cardiomyocytes can use lactate efficiently for energy metabolism Transplanted purified human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes do not form tumors Heart disease is a common and deadly disease, and heart-regenerative therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for some patients (Passier et al., 2008Passier R. van Laake L.W.

However, none of these methods are ideal for the therapeutic application of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes because of drawbacks including insufficient purity, genotoxicity, and the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and/or antibodies. Glucose is the main source of energy and anabolic precursors in various mammalian cells. It is converted by glycolysis into pyruvate and/or lactate via glucose-6-phosphate (G6P; a source of nucleotides) and 3-phosphoglycerate (a source of some amino acids) for generation of two ATP molecules without the need for oxygen. Pyruvate is further utilized in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for production of 36 ATP molecules via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Cardiomyocytes efficiently produce energy from several substrates including glucose, fatty acids, and lactate via OXPHOS. Interestingly, there are marked changes between energy substrate utilization by cardiomyocytes before and after birth. The fetal heart has a higher capacity for lactate uptake than the adult heart (Fisher et al., 1981Fisher D.J. Heymann M.A. Rudolph A.M. Myocardial consumption of oxygen and carbohydrates in newborn sheep.Pediatr. Res. 1981; 15: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and uses lactate as a major energy source (Neely and Morgan, 1974Neely J.R. Morgan H.E.

Jones Jr., M.D. Simmons M.A. Makowski E.L. Meschia G. Battaglia F.C. Placental production and foetal utilisation of lactate and pyruvate.Nature. 1975; 254: 710-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of the unique metabolic properties of cardiomyocytes to develop an efficient and noninvasive environmental approach for their purification from PSC cultures. To find metabolism-related genes that are differentially expressed between undifferentiated stem cells and cardiomyocytes, we performed comparative transcriptome analyses of undifferentiated mouse ESCs and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes purified by the “mitochondrial method”(Hattori et al., 2010Hattori F. Chen H. Yamashita H. Tohyama S. Satoh Y.S. Yuasa S. Li W. Yamakawa H. Tanaka T. Onitsuka T. et al.Nongenetic method for purifying stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B available online). The results for cardiomyocytes revealed markedly higher expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the TCA cycle than the undifferentiated ESCs and, in turn, lower expression of genes involved in the pentose phosphate, amino acid synthesis, and lipid synthesis pathways (Figure 1A and Table S1). Next, we conducted a fluxome analysis (Kinoshita et al., 2007Kinoshita A. Tsukada K. Soga T. Hishiki T. Ueno Y. Nakayama Y. Tomita M. Suematsu M. Roles of hemoglobin Allostery in hypoxia-induced metabolic alterations in erythrocytes: simulation and its verification by metabolome analysis.J. Biol.

Sakuragawa T. et al.Cystathionine beta-synthase as a carbon monoxide-sensitive regulator of bile excretion.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to trace a range of metabolites derived from [13C]-labeled glucose in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, mouse ESCs, a hepatocyte cell line (HepG2), and a skeletal myoblast cell line (C2C12). [13C]-labeled intermediate metabolites of the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and amino acid synthesis pathways were subsequently found at higher levels in ESCs, HepG2, and C2C12 cells than in cardiomyocytes (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1C and Table S1). ESCs, HepG2, and C2C12 cells also discarded more lactate than cardiomyocytes did (Figure 1C and Figure S1D). In contrast, cardiomyocytes took up pyruvate into mitochondria, and most [13C]-labeled intermediate metabolites of the TCA cycle were significantly higher in cardiomyocytes than in ESCs (Figure 1A). These transcriptome and fluxome analyses highlighted a dynamic difference in the metabolic fates of lactate between cell types (Figure S1E). More specifically, lactate was discarded by noncardiomyocytes but preferentially used in TCA metabolism by cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that cells mainly dependent on glycolysis might not be able to survive under glucose-depleted and lactate-abundant conditions, whereas cardiomyocytes would survive by using lactate as an alternative energy source. To test our hypothesis, we exposed neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, mouse ESCs, primary peripheral lymphatic cells, primary fetal neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), C2C12 cells (myoblasts and myotubes), hepatocytes (HepG2), and renal cells (HEK293) to glucose-depleted conditions with and without various concentrations of lactate. Every type of cell died within 96 hr in the glucose-depleted conditions, and as expected, supplementation with lactate only prolonged the survival of cardiomyocytes (Figures 2A, 2B, 2C and S2). We named this special culture condition for the growth of cardiomyocytes the “lactate method.” We next applied the lactate method to purifying human PSC-derived cardiomyocytes. First, we optimized the time course of the method for human ESC (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Using time-lapse imaging, we observed that 7 days’ exposure of hESC- and human iPSC (hiPSC)-derived attached embryoid bodies (EBs) to glucose-free conditions supplemented with 4 mM lactate selectively enriched for beating cells (Movie S1). Second, we confirmed that days 7–8 of culture were the best time points for harvesting the cells, as shown in Figure 3A. To optimize the lactate concentration, we measured the viability of purified hESC-derived cardiomyocytes exposed to glucose-depleted conditions with various concentrations of lactate for 6 days; we found the lowest numbers of dead cells in 4 mM lactate (Figure S3A). We further tested for the ideal period of differentiation using the lactate method and found that 20–30 days of differentiation produced the highest reproducibility, purity, and yield of cardiomyocytes. To determine why this period is optimal, we investigated the proliferative activity of EBs on various differentiation days (days 14–60) using a 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay. The percentage of EdU-incorporated cells markedly decreased after day 30 (Figure S3B), implying that proliferating cells are sensitive to the lactate method. The optimized condition efficiently enriched for globally contracting aggregates in a time-dependent manner (Figure S3C and Movie S2). Concomitantly, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the cardiomyocyte-related gene MYH6 increased, while that of the pluripotency-related gene POU5F1 (Figure S3D) decreased abruptly. In addition, the mRNAs for noncardiac genes (NANOG, MYOD, AFP, and MAP2) were completely eliminated, and those for other cardiomyocyte-related genes (ACTC1 and NKX2.5) were significantly enriched (Figures S3E and S3F). We also observed clumps of purified cardiomyocytes in the adhered condition (Figures 3B and 3C). We dispersed the clumps and cultured the cells therein and then evaluated their purity before and after metabolic selection. The percentages of α-actinin-positive cells before and after metabolic selection were 8.1 ± 2.9% (n = 10) and 98.3 ± 0.9% (n = 10), respectively (Figures 3D and 3E). We also confirmed the efficacy of the lactate method using other hESC (KhES-3) and hiPSC (201B7 and 253G4) lines. As shown in Figures 3D and 3E, the purities were determined as 98.9 ± 0.3, 95.5 ± 1.3, and 96.5 ± 2.0%, respectively. To identify selective events in KhES-2 and iPSCs (253G4 and 201B7), we obtained global gene-expression patterns for the PSC-derived EBs and purified hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. We categorized the expressed genes following the gene ontology consortium and found both similarities and differences among EBs derived from three cell lines (Ashburner et al., 2000Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. et al.The Gene Ontology ConsortiumGene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27005) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the differences is that the derived EBs contain various types of cells that are eventually eliminated by the lactate-purification method (Figures S3G and S3H). In our system, 4.0 × 106 hESCs differentiated into 6.2 ± 2.5 × 106 (n = 5) cells containing 6.3 ± 2.3 × 105 (n = 5) α-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes, and 4.7 ± 1.8 × 105 (n = 5) α-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were finally purified via the lactate method. Therefore, the yield-based efficiency of our lactate method for hESCs was 74.4 ± 12.1% (Figure 3F). To directly compare the yield-based efficiencies between the lactate method and our previous mitochondrial method, we evaluated the yield and found 52.9 ± 12.8% recovery of cardiomyocytes in our previous mitochondrial method (Figure S3I). To determine the types of noncardiomyocyte cells remaining after metabolic selection, we performed immunocytochemical screening and found that most of the cells were smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive (Figure S3J). Interestingly, α-actinin- and SMA-double-positive cells were also found (data not shown), consistent with a previous report that immature cardiomyocytes express SMA (Clément et al., 2007Clément S. Stouffs M. Bettiol E. Kampf S. Krause K.H. Chaponnier C. Jaconi M. Expression and function of alpha-smooth muscle actin during embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We then applied the lactate method to mouse ESCs using lactate concentrations and timings optimized through similar preliminary experiments for mouse cells. EBs attached to the dishes were exposed to glucose-depleted and 1 mM lactate-supplemented conditions. After 7 days of selection, we recovered the surviving cells by collagenase digestion and transferred them into new fibronectin-coated plates (Movie S3). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that most of the surviving cells were positive for the cardiac markers α-actinin and GATA4 (99.4 ± 0.6% purity, n = 5) (Figure S3K). Why do only cardiomyocytes survive under the lactate-method condition? To address this question, we first compared the [14C]-lactate uptake activity of neonatal rat and human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes, ESCs, MEFs, and noncontracting EBs, and found that both cardiomyocyte populations showed higher levels of activity than the other cells (Figures 4A and 4C ). We then measured the changes in intracellular ATP levels in cardiomyocytes and other cells under lactate-method conditions and found that the levels in mouse ESCs, MEFs, and noncontracting EBs fell abruptly, whereas those in neonatal rat and purified human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes were sustained for significantly longer (Figures 4B and 4D). These results indicated that cardiomyocytes, but not noncardiomyocytes, can effectively uptake and use lactate to maintain ATP levels. Lactate supplementation has the potential to cause acidification either intracellularly or in the medium, which could lead to cellular damage. We therefore investigated whether 4 mM lactate supplementation affects extra- and intracellular pH values. The extracellular pH values were stable at 7.5 following 1 hr of incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator (Figure S4A). The intracellular pH values of cardiomyocytes, mouse ESCs, MEFs, and C2C12 myoblasts were not affected by supplementation with 4 mM lactate, but all were significantly decreased by the addition of 20 mM lactate (Figures S4B and S4C). Lactate can be transported by monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCTs), of which subtype 1 is abundantly expressed in muscle cells and localizes at both the plasma and mitochondrial inner membrane (Hashimoto et al., 2006Hashimoto T. Hussien R. Brooks G.A. Colocalization of MCT1, CD147, and LDH in mitochondrial inner membrane of L6 muscle cells: evidence of a mitochondrial lactate oxidation complex.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1237-E1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For investigation of the significance of MCT1 expression for lactate uptake in cardiomyocytes, the cells were treated with MCT1 inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (α-CHC) (Sonveaux et al., 2008Sonveaux P. Végran F. Schroeder T. Wergin M.C. Verrax J. Rabbani Z.N. De Saedeleer C.J. Kennedy K.M. Diepart C. Jordan B.F. et al.Targeting lactate-fueled respiration selectively kills hypoxic tumor cells in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3930-3942PubMed Google Scholar) under glucose-free and lactate-rich conditions. The lactate-induced prolonged survival of cardiomyocytes under glucose-free conditions was largely abolished by the MCT1 inhibitor, despite the lack of α-CHC toxicity, suggesting that lactate uptake via MCT1 plays a major role in the long-term survival of cardiomyocytes under metabolic selection (Figure 4E). To investigate why cardiomyocytes can effectively take up lactate, we checked the expression levels of MCT1 in cardiomyocytes and ESCs but could not find a marked difference between the two (Table S1). We then performed electron microscopy on the hESCs and their derivative cardiomyocytes, as well as mitochondrial staining of hESC-derived cells. The cardiomyocytes showed substantially higher numbers of mitochondria than ESCs and other noncardiomyocytes (Figures S4D and S4E). Because MCTs are passive transporters, we suggest that a major mechanism underlying the enhanced lactate uptake in cardiomyocytes could be the concentration gradients generated by effective lactate consumption via the highly active TCA cycle. We further investigated how lactate is metabolized in various types of cells. We performed lactate fluxome analysis in mouse ESCs, hESC-derived EBs, MEFs, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes under glucose-depleted conditions for short (30 min) periods. As expected, high levels of [2,4,5-13C]-citrate, [3,4-13C]-succinate, and [2,3,4-13C]-malate were detected in cardiomyocytes, whereas the ESCs, hESC-derived EBs, and MEFs showed only small amounts of these metabolites, suggesting that exogenous lactate is more efficiently metabolized via the TCA cycle in cardiomyocytes than in noncardiomyocytes, including ESCs (Figure 5 and Figure S5). To our surprise, [13C]-labeled glycolytic intermediates including G6P were observed in both cardiomyocytes and ESCs. These were eventually consumed in the pentose phosphate pathway for production of inosine, guanosine, and adenosine monophosphates. Long-period (24 hr) fluxome analysis in viable cardiomyocytes also detected [5-13C]-labeled reduced (GSH) and [4,5,6,7,8,10-13C]-labeled oxidized glutathione (GSSG), indicating that glutamate, glycine, and/or cysteine were also synthesized from the lactate (Figure 5 and Table S2). We next investigated the proliferative capacity of mouse and human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes purified using metabolic selection. Some of the purified cardiomyocytes expressed Ki67 antigen (Figure 6A) and showed EdU-incorporation activities (Figure 6B). For directly assessing the rate of karyokinesis and cytokinesis after metabolic selection, the purified hESC-derived aggregates were completely dissociated and then seeded sparsely onto the MEF-layered dishes. Counting of immunocytochemically α-actinin-positive cells after 2, 4, 6, and 8 days revealed that the purified cardiomyocytes could proliferate up to 2.5-fold in 8 days, and the fraction of multinuclear cardiomyocytes increased over time compared with the second day (Figure 6C). Action-potential recording using glass microelectrodes revealed that the purified hESC-derived cardiomyocytes had nodal- (14 of 76), atrial- (23 of 76), or ventricular-like (39 of 76) action potentials (Figure 6D and Figure S6A). We next evaluated their chronotropic response to the β-agonist isoproterenol and muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine using the multielectrode array (MEA) system; the former agent increased the beating frequency, whereas the latter decreased it, both in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6E). We also found that beat frequency could be modulated by temperature (Figure S6B), and intracellular [Ca2+] recording using Fluo-4 dye also revealed that the purified hESC-derived cardiomyocytes showed spontaneous and synchronized Ca2+ oscillations (Figure S6C). Finally, for investigation of the potential tumorigenicity of the purified cardiomyocyte populations, 1,000 undifferentiated hESCs, 2.0 × 105 nonpurified hESC-derived cardiomyocytes, or the same number of purified cells were transplanted into the testes of immunocompromised nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Two months later, 9 of 10 (90%), 8 of 20 (40%), and 0 of 20 mice developed tumors, respectively (Figure 6F and Figure S6D). For further verification of the absence of residual undifferentiated cells, nonpurified and purified dispersed hESC-derived cells (2.0 × 105) were cultured on MEFs under PSC maintenance culture conditions (colony formation assay) for 4 days. Nonpurified hESC-derived cells formed Oct3/4- or Tra1-60-positive piled-up colonies, but the purified cardiomyocytes formed no colonies (Figure 6G and Figure S6E). To demonstrate the PSC-elimination capacity of the lactate method, we used a commercially available kit based on magnetic-beads-activated cell sorting with a Tra1-60 antibody. This experiment confirmed the apparent superiority of the lactate method in eliminating stem cells compared to the tested method (Figure S6F). There are several approaches available for obtaining enriched cardiomyocyte populations from human PSCs. Ma et al., 2011Ma J. Guo L. Fiene S.J. Anson B.D. Thomson J.A. Kamp T.J. Kolaja K.L.

SIRPA is a specific cell-surface marker for isolating cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar used a surface protein, signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA), as a cardiac-specific marker in hiPSC derivatives prepared through a highly cardiogenic differentiation procedure. They purified cardiomyocytes (up to 98% purity) via FACS from sources comprising 40%–50% cardiomyocytes. The method we report here is a simple medium-exchanging procedure that enabled cardiomyocyte purification of up to 99% from a cell source comprising only 10% cardiomyocytes, with an estimated recovery of cardiomyocytes of 74.4 ± 12.1%, based on direct cell count before and after purification. Previously we reported a mitochondrial method for purifying cardiomyocytes to >99% purity via FACS. Our direct comparison of these two methods revealed a higher cardiomyocyte-yield-based efficiency for the lactate method than for the mitochondrial method. The lactate method has quantitative and economic advantages relative to other existing cardiomyocyte-purification methods by virtue of its simplicity and ease of application. One question that arose from our studies is why ESCs die within a few hours under the lactate method but cardiomyocytes survive for much longer, even though both cell types use lactate for biomass synthesis. Through our investigations, we eliminated the possibility that lactate supplementation caused toxic extracellular or intracellular acidification. We propose that these differing properties may be a result of (1) the retrospective glycolytic pathway consuming two ATP molecules during conversion of a lactate molecule to G6P, and (2) ESCs not being able to effectively obtain ATP from glycolysis nor from OXPHOS under glucose-depleted conditions. Therefore, activation of the retrospective glycolytic pathway may accelerate a catastrophic balance of ATP supply and demand in ESCs, whereas cardiomyocytes can maintain cellular ATP homeostasis by producing more ATP via a highly active OXPHOS mechanism (Hattori et al., 2010Hattori F. Chen H. Yamashita H. Tohyama S. Satoh Y.S. Yuasa S. Li W. Yamakawa H. Tanaka T. Onitsuka T. et al.Nongenetic method for purifying stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A patient would theoretically require about 109 cardiomyocytes in therapeutic applications of purified cardiomyocytes. In this study, we obtained approximately 5 × 105 purified human cardiomyocytes per 177 cm2 dish. Taking into account their postpurification proliferative capacities, rough estimates therefore suggest that 1 × 109 cardiomyocytes could be obtained from 800 dishes (14.13 m2). This scale is close to the capacity of commercially available automatic large-scale culture systems and suggests that combining more sophisticated differentiation methods with our lactate method could facilitate realistic application of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes to human therapy.

Recordings performed under anaesthesia have invariably described neural activity in the visual cortex as the product of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents, and this relationship is thought to determine the selectivity of neurons to visual features. Matteo Carandini and colleagues now compare intracellular measurements of primary visual cortex made in anaesthetized and awake, behaving mice. They find that under anaesthesia, excitation and inhibition are balanced, but in the awake state, inhibition is stronger and occurs for a broader spatial range of stimuli. They conclude that during wakefulness, visual responses are dominated by inhibition, and that this shapes visual selectivity by restricting the temporal and spatial extent of responses. The activity of the cerebral cortex is thought to depend on the precise relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition1,2,3,4. In the visual cortex, in particular, intracellular measurements have related response selectivity to coordinated increases in excitation and inhibition5,6,7,8,9. These measurements, however, have all been made during anaesthesia, which strongly influences cortical state10 and therefore sensory processing7,11,12,13,14,15. The synaptic activity that is evoked by visual stimulation during wakefulness is unknown. Here we measured visually evoked responses—and the underlying synaptic conductances—in the visual cortex of anaesthetized and awake mice. Under anaesthesia, responses could be elicited from a large region of visual space16 and were prolonged. During wakefulness, responses were more spatially selective and much briefer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic conductances5,17 showed a difference in synaptic inhibition between the two conditions. Under anaesthesia, inhibition tracked excitation in amplitude and spatial selectivity. By contrast, during wakefulness, inhibition was much stronger than excitation and had extremely broad spatial selectivity. We conclude that during wakefulness, cortical responses to visual stimulation are dominated by synaptic inhibition, restricting the spatial spread and temporal persistence of neural activity. These results provide a direct glimpse of synaptic mechanisms that control sensory responses in the awake cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2154164675,"Mitochondria have a central role in ageing. They are considered to be both a target of the ageing process and a contributor to it. Alterations in mitochondrial structure and function are evident during ageing in most eukaryotes, but how this occurs is poorly understood. Here we identify a functional link between the lysosome-like vacuole and mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that mitochondrial dysfunction in replicatively aged yeast arises from altered vacuolar pH. We found that vacuolar acidity declines during the early asymmetric divisions of a mother cell, and that preventing this decline suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and extends lifespan. Surprisingly, changes in vacuolar pH do not limit mitochondrial function by disrupting vacuolar protein degradation, but rather by reducing pH-dependent amino acid storage in the vacuolar lumen. We also found that calorie restriction promotes lifespan extension at least in part by increasing vacuolar acidity via conserved nutrient-sensing pathways. Interestingly, although vacuolar acidity is reduced in aged mother cells, acidic vacuoles are regenerated in newborn daughters, coinciding with daughter cells having a renewed lifespan potential. Overall, our results identify vacuolar pH as a critical regulator of ageing and mitochondrial function, and outline a potentially conserved mechanism by which calorie restriction delays the ageing process. Because the functions of the vacuole are highly conserved throughout evolution, we propose that lysosomal pH may modulate mitochondrial function and lifespan in other eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048862315,"Hyperconnectivity of neuronal circuits due to increased synaptic protein synthesis is thought to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes."

These tumor-resident MSCs are known to affect tumor growth, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that MSCs isolated from spontaneous lymphomas in mouse (L-MSCs) strikingly enhanced tumor growth in comparison to bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). L-MSCs contributed to greater recruitment of CD11b(+)Ly6C(+) monocytes, F4/80(+) macrophages, and CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) neutrophils to the tumor. Depletion of monocytes/macrophages, but not neutrophils, completely abolished tumor promotion of L-MSCs. Furthermore, L-MSCs expressed high levels of CCR2 ligands, and monocyte/macrophage accumulation and L-MSC-mediated tumor promotion were largely abolished in CCR2(-/-) mice. Intriguingly, TNFα-pretreated BM-MSCs mimicked L-MSCs in their chemokine production profile and ability to promote tumorigenesis of lymphoma, melanoma, and breast carcinoma. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that, in an inflammatory environment, tumor-resident MSCs promote tumor growth by recruiting monocytes/macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2059225708,"Diverse sensory organs, including mammalian taste buds and insect chemosensory sensilla, show a marked compartmentalization of receptor cells; however, the functional impact of this organization remains unclear. Here we show that compartmentalized Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) communicate with each other directly. The sustained response of one ORN is inhibited by the transient activation of a neighbouring ORN. Mechanistically, such lateral inhibition does not depend on synapses and is probably mediated by ephaptic coupling. Moreover, lateral inhibition in the periphery can modulate olfactory behaviour. Together, the results show that integration of olfactory information can occur via lateral interactions between ORNs. Inhibition of a sustained response by a transient response may provide a means of encoding salience. Finally, a CO2-sensitive ORN in the malaria mosquito Anopheles can also be inhibited by excitation of an adjacent ORN, suggesting a broad occurrence of lateral inhibition in insects and possible applications in insect control. Olfactory receptor neurons of fruitflies are shown to communicate with one another through ephaptic interactions with significant impact on olfactory behaviour; the results indicate that ephaptic effects may be more widespread than previously appreciated. It has been suggested that the electrical activity of one neuron can influence that of its unlinked neighbour, but this so-called ephaptic effect is widely assumed to be weak and has been relatively little studied. Here, John Carlson and colleagues demonstrate that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of fruitflies communicate with one another through large ephaptic signals with significant impact on olfactory behaviour. The sustained response of one ORN is inhibited by the transient activation of its neighbour. The authors also demonstrate that a CO2-sensitive ORN in the malaria mosquito Anopheles can be inhibited by excitation of an adjacent ORN and that lateral inhibition of a CO2 neuron in Drosophila can reduce a behavioural response to CO2. As CO2 is a key cue used by mosquitoes to find human hosts, this work suggests a novel means of insect control. These findings suggest that ephaptic effects may be more widespread than previously appreciated, particularly among neurons housed in confined peripheral sensory compartments such as taste buds."

https://openalex.org/W2047405998,"Background Poor sleep is a frequent symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sleep may be influenced by MS-related symptoms and adverse effects from immunotherapy and symptomatic medications. We aimed to study the prevalence of poor sleep and the influence of socio-demographic and clinical factors on sleep quality in MS- patients. Methods A total of 90 MS patients and 108 sex-and age- matched controls were included in a questionnaire survey. Sleep complaints were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a global PSQI score was used to separate good sleepers (≤5) from poor sleepers (>5). Excessive daytime sleepiness, the use of immunotherapy and antidepressant drugs, symptoms of pain, depression, fatigue and MS-specific health related quality of life were registered. Results were compared between patients and controls and between good and poor sleepers among MS patients. Results MS patients reported a higher mean global PSQI score than controls (8.6 vs. 6.3, p = 0.001), and 67.1% of the MS patients compared to 43.9% of the controls (p = 0.002) were poor sleepers. Pain (p = 0.02), fatigue (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.01) and female gender (p = 0.04) were associated with sleep disturbance. Multivariate analyses showed that female gender (p = 0.02), use of immunotherapy (p = 005) and a high psychological burden of MS (p = 0.001) were associated with poor sleep among MS patients. Conclusions Poor sleep is common in patients with MS. Early identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors may improve sleep and quality of life in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2046372462,"TRPM7 is a novel magnesium-nucleotide-regulated metal current (MagNuM) channel that is regulated by serum Mg(2+) concentrations. Changes in Mg(2+) concentration have been shown to alter cell proliferation in various cells; however, the mechanism and the ion channel(s) involved have not yet been identified. Here we demonstrate that TRPM7 is expressed in control and prostate cancer cells. Supplementation of intracellular Mg-ATP or addition of external 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate inhibited MagNuM currents. Furthermore, silencing of TRPM7 inhibited whereas overexpression of TRPM7 increased endogenous MagNuM currents, suggesting that these currents are dependent on TRPM7. Importantly, although an increase in the serum Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio facilitated Ca(2+) influx in both control and prostate cancer cells, a significantly higher Ca(2+) influx was observed in prostate cancer cells. TRPM7 expression was also increased in cancer cells, but its expression was not dependent on the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio per se. Additionally, an increase in the extracellular Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio led to a significant increase in cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells when compared with control cells. Consistent with these results, age-matched prostate cancer patients also showed a subsequent increase in the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio and TRPM7 expression. Altogether, we provide evidence that the TRPM7 channel has an important role in prostate cancer and have identified that the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio could be essential for the initiation/progression of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2132696767,"Objective We conducted a mixed-methods study to examine serodiscordant and seroconcordant (HIV-positive/HIV-positive) male couples' PrEP awareness, concerns regarding health care providers offering PrEP to the community, and correlates of PrEP uptake by the HIV-negative member of the couple. Design Qualitative sub-study included one-on-one interviews to gain a deeper understanding of participants' awareness of and experiences with PrEP and concerns regarding health care providers offering PrEP to men who have sex with men (MSM). Quantitative analyses consisted of a cross-sectional study in which participants were asked about the likelihood of PrEP uptake by the HIV-negative member of the couple and level of agreement with health care providers offering PrEP to anyone requesting it. Methods We used multivariable regression to examine associations between PrEP questions and covariates of interest and employed an inductive approach to identify key qualitative themes. Results Among 328 men (164 couples), 62% had heard about PrEP, but approximately one-quarter were mistaking it with post-exposure prophylaxis. The majority of participants had low endorsement of PrEP uptake and 40% were uncertain if health care providers should offer PrEP to anyone requesting it. Qualitative interviews with 32 men suggest that this uncertainty likely stems from concerns regarding increased risk compensation. Likelihood of future PrEP uptake by the HIV-negative member of the couple was positively associated with unprotected insertive anal intercourse but negatively correlated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Conclusions Findings suggest that those at greatest risk may not be receptive of PrEP. Those who engage in moderate risk express more interest in PrEP; however, many voice concerns of increased risk behavior in tandem with PrEP use. Results indicate a need for further education of MSM communities and the need to determine appropriate populations in which PrEP can have the highest impact."
https://openalex.org/W2017036697,"The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit proton pump, has come into focus as an attractive target in cancer invasion. However, little is known about the role of V-ATPase in cell death, and especially the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unknown. We used the myxobacterial macrolide archazolid B, a potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase, as an experimental drug as well as a chemical tool to decipher V-ATPase-related cell death signaling. We found that archazolid induced apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations which was executed by the mitochondrial pathway. Prior to apoptosis induction archazolid led to the activation of a cellular stress response including activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) and autophagy. Autophagy, which was demonstrated by degradation of p62 or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, was induced at low concentrations of archazolid that not yet increase pH in lysosomes. HIF1α was induced due to energy stress shown by a decline of the ATP level and followed by a shutdown of energy-consuming processes. As silencing HIF1α increases apoptosis, the cellular stress response was suggested to be a survival mechanism. We conclude that archazolid leads to energy stress which activates adaptive mechanisms like autophagy mediated by HIF1α and finally leads to apoptosis. We propose V-ATPase as a promising drugable target in cancer therapy caught up at the interplay of apoptosis, autophagy, and cellular/metabolic stress."

Three patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Physical disability, time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and volumetric MRI data were recorded for 2 years.Patients reaching clinically definite multiple sclerosis showed impaired recovery of neurological function, faster decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area, higher T2 lesion volume and more contrast-enhancing lesions. Six-month decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area (≥ 1%) and baseline T2 lesion volume (≥ 5 cm(3)) predicted clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years (hazard ratios 2.5 and 1.8, respectively). Of 22 patients fulfilling both predictive criteria, 83% reached clinically definite multiple sclerosis (hazard ratio 6.5). More relapses were associated with poorer recovery of neurological function and accelerated brain atrophy.Neurological impairment is more permanent, brain atrophy is accelerated and focal inflammatory activity is greater in patients converting to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Six-month corpus callosum atrophy and baseline T2 lesion volume jointly help predict individual risk of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Early relapses contribute to permanent damage of the central nervous system."

Sequencing of the D. citri metagenome has been initiated to gain better understanding of the biology of this organism and the potential roles of its bacterial endosymbionts. To corroborate candidate endosymbionts previously identified by rDNA amplification, raw reads from the D. citri metagenome sequence were mapped to reference genome sequences. Results of the read mapping provided the most support for Wolbachia and an enteric bacterium most similar to Salmonella. Wolbachia-derived reads were extracted using the complete genome sequences for four Wolbachia strains. Reads were assembled into a draft genome sequence, and the annotation assessed for the presence of features potentially involved in host interaction. Genome alignment with the complete sequences reveals membership of Wolbachia wDi in supergroup B, further supported by phylogenetic analysis of FtsZ. FtsZ and Wsp phylogenies additionally indicate that the Wolbachia strain in the Florida D. citri isolate falls into a sub-clade of supergroup B, distinct from Wolbachia present in Chinese D. citri isolates, supporting the hypothesis that the D. citri introduced into Florida did not originate from China."
https://openalex.org/W2033615443,"Alterations in lipid homeostasis are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, although the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. We evaluated the impact of cholesterol accumulation, induced by U18666A, quinacrine or mutations in the cholesterol transporting Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) protein, on lysosomal stability and sensitivity to lysosome-mediated cell death. We found that neurons with lysosomal cholesterol accumulation were protected from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In addition, human fibroblasts with cholesterol-loaded lysosomes showed higher lysosomal membrane stability than controls. Previous studies have shown that cholesterol accumulation is accompanied by the storage of lipids such as sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids and sphingosine and an up regulation of lysosomal associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), which may also influence lysosomal stability. However, in this study the use of myriocin and LAMP deficient fibroblasts excluded these factors as responsible for the rescuing effect and instead suggested that primarily lysosomal cholesterol content determineD the cellular sensitivity to toxic insults. Further strengthening this concept, depletion of cholesterol using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased the stability of lysosomes and cells became more prone to undergo apoptosis. In conclusion, cholesterol content regulated lysosomal membrane permeabilization and thereby influenced cell death sensitivity. Our data suggests that lysosomal cholesterol modulation might be used as a therapeutic strategy for conditions associated with accelerated or repressed apoptosis."

Our hypothesis states that CS-associated oxidative stress interferes with oxidative protein folding in the ER and elicits ERSR. We investigated ERSR induction following acute CS exposure and delineated mechanisms of CS-induced ERSR. Lung lysates from mice exposed or not to one cigarette were tested for activation of the ERSR. Up to 4-fold increase in phosphorylation of eIF2α and nuclear form of ATF6 was detected in CS-exposed animals. CS affected the formation of disulfide bonds through excessive posttranslational oxidation of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Increased amounts of complexes between PDI and its client proteins persisted in CS-exposed samples. BiP was not a constituent of these complexes, demonstrating the specificity of the early effects of CS exposure on ER. Disturbances in protein folding were accompanied by changes in the organization of ER network and ER exit sites. Our results provide evidence that ERSR is induced early in response to CS exposure and identifies the first known ER-resident target of CS PDI, demonstrating that CS affects oxidative protein folding.—Kenche, H., Baty, C.

https://openalex.org/W2150751366,"To study the individual functions of hyaluronan interacting proteins in prostate cancer (PCa) motility through connective tissues, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel assay that provides a flexible, quantifiable, and physiologically relevant alternative to current methods. Invasion in this system reflects the prevalence of HA in connective tissues and its role in the promotion of cancer cell motility and tissue invasion, making the system ideal to study invasion through bone marrow or other HA-rich connective tissues. The bio-compatible cross-linking process we used allows for direct encapsulation of cancer cells within the gel where they adopt a distinct, cluster-like morphology. Metastatic PCa cells in these hydrogels develop fingerlike structures, ""invadopodia"", consistent with their invasive properties. The number of invadopodia, as well as cluster size, shape, and convergence, can provide a quantifiable measure of invasive potential. Among candidate hyaluronan interacting proteins that could be responsible for the behavior we observed, we found that culture in the HA hydrogel triggers invasive PCa cells to differentially express and localize receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM)/CD168 which, in the absence of CD44, appears to contribute to PCa motility and invasion by interacting with the HA hydrogel components. PCa cell invasion through the HA hydrogel also was found to depend on the activity of hyaluronidases. Studies shown here reveal that while hyaluronidase activity is necessary for invadopodia and inter-connecting cluster formation, activity alone is not sufficient for acquisition of invasiveness to occur. We therefore suggest that development of invasive behavior in 3D HA-based systems requires development of additional cellular features, such as activation of motility associated pathways that regulate formation of invadopodia. Thus, we report development of a 3D system amenable to dissection of biological processes associated with cancer cell motility through HA-rich connective tissues."

The endosymbiotic bacterium has recently been shown to cause a life-shortening effect as well as inhibiting replication of arboviruses in Aedes aegypti; although the molecular mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been determined to have a wide range of roles in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. A recent study showed that several A. aegypti mosquito miRNAs are differentially expressed when infected with Wolbachia.Based on the prior knowledge that one of these miRNAs, aae-miR-12, is differentially expressed in mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, we aimed to determine any significance of this mediation. We also set out to characterize the target genes of this miRNA in the A. aegpyti genome. Bioinformatic approaches predicted a list of potential target genes and subsequent functional analyses confirmed that two of these, DNA replication licensing (MCM6) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1), are under the regulative control of aae-miR-12. We also demonstrated that aae-miR-12 is critical in the persistence of Wolbachia in the host cell.Our study has identified two target genes of aae-miR-12, a differentially expressed mosquito miRNA in Wolbachia-infected cells, and determined that the miRNA affects Wolbachia density in the host cells."

Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was used to investigate the independent effects of the first HIV-1 load measurement after introduction of the Taqman RT-PCR assay (time-point 0 [T0]), pre-T0 viral loads, CD4 T cell count, race/ethnicity, gender, age and NNRTI use on risk of a confirmed VL >50, >200, >400 and >1000 copies/mL at 22 months follow-up in analyses of all patients and propensity-matched baseline cohorts. 778 patients had a viral load that was either not detected by RT-PCR (N = 596) or detectable, but below the limit of quantification (N = 182) at T0. Detectable viremia, lower T0 CD4 count, decreased age, and having detectable or unknown VL within a year prior to T0 were each associated with viral rebound to >50, >200 and >400 copies/mL. Overall failure rates were low and <5.5% of all patients had confirmed VL >1000 copies/mL. A majority of patients with rebound >200 copies/mL subsequently re-suppressed (28 of 53).

https://openalex.org/W2071757408,"Ocean acidification (OA) can have adverse effects on marine calcifiers. Yet, phototrophic marine calcifiers elevate their external oxygen and pH microenvironment in daylight, through the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by photosynthesis. We studied to which extent pH elevation within their microenvironments in daylight can counteract ambient seawater pH reductions, i.e. OA conditions. We measured the O(2) and pH microenvironment of four photosymbiotic and two symbiont-free benthic tropical foraminiferal species at three different OA treatments (~432, 1141 and 2151 µatm pCO(2)). The O(2) concentration difference between the seawater and the test surface (ΔO(2)) was taken as a measure for the photosynthetic rate. Our results showed that O(2) and pH levels were significantly higher on photosymbiotic foraminiferal surfaces in light than in dark conditions, and than on surfaces of symbiont-free foraminifera. Rates of photosynthesis at saturated light conditions did not change significantly between OA treatments (except in individuals that exhibited symbiont loss, i.e. bleaching, at elevated pCO(2)). The pH at the cell surface decreased during incubations at elevated pCO(2), also during light incubations. Photosynthesis increased the surface pH but this increase was insufficient to compensate for ambient seawater pH decreases. We thus conclude that photosynthesis does only partly protect symbiont bearing foraminifera against OA."
https://openalex.org/W2154521232,"With the development of protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), the topic of faithful propagation of prion strain-specific structures has been constantly debated. Here we show that by subjecting brain material of a synthetic strain consisting of a mixture of self-replicating states to PMCAb, selective amplification of PrP(Sc) could be achieved, and that PMCAb mimicked the evolutionary trend observed during serial transmission in animals. On the other hand, using modified PMCAb conditions that employ partially deglycosylated PrP(C) (dgPMCAb), an alternative transmissible state referred to as atypical protease-resistant form of the prion protein (atypical PrPres) was selectively amplified from a mixture. Surprisingly, when hamster-adapted strains (263K and Hyper) were subjected to dgPMCAb, their proteinase K digestion profile underwent a dramatic transformation, suggesting that a mixture of atypical PrPres and PrP(Sc) might be present in brain-derived materials. However, detailed analysis revealed that the proteinase K-resistant profile of PrP(Sc) changed in response to dgPMCAb. Despite these changes, the 263K strain-specific disease phenotype was preserved after passage through dgPMCAb. This study revealed that the change in PrP(Sc) biochemical phenotype does not always represent an irreversible transformation of a strain, but rather demonstrated the existence of a wide range of variation for strain-specific physical features in response to a change in prion replication environment. The current work introduced a new PMCA technique for amplification of atypical PrPres and raised a number of questions about the need for a clever distinction between actual strain mutation and variation of strain-specific features in response to a change in the replication environment."
https://openalex.org/W1572750670,"Complement C3 is a pivotal component of three cascades of complement activation. The liver is the main source of C3 in circulation and expression and secretion of C3 by hepatocytes is increased during acute inflammation. However, the mechanism of the regulation of the C3 gene in hepatocytes is not well elucidated. We showed that the C3 gene is the direct target for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and mouse liver. Using PPARα siRNA and synthetic PPARα agonist WY-14643 and antagonist MK886 we showed that activation of PPARα results in up-regulation of C3 gene expression and protein secretion by HepG2 cells. The PPAR response element (PPRE), which is able to bind PPARα in vitro and in vivo, was found in the human C3 promoter. PPRE is conserved between human and mouse, and WY-14643 stimulates mouse C3 expression in the liver. TNFα increases C3 gene via NF-κB and, to a lesser extent, MEK1/2 signaling pathways, whereas TNFα-mediated stimulation of C3 protein secretion depends on activation of MEK1/2, p38, and JNK in HepG2 cells. Activation of PPARα abolishes TNFα-mediated up-regulation of C3 gene expression and protein secretion due to interference with NF-κB via PPRE-dependent mechanism in HepG2 cells. TNFα decreases PPARα protein content via NF-κB and MEK1/2 signaling pathways and inhibits PPARα binding with the human C3 promoter in HepG2 cells. These results suggest novel mechanism controlling C3 expression in hepatocytes during acute phase inflammation and demonstrate a crosstalk between PPARα and TNFα in the regulation of complement system."
https://openalex.org/W1964788284,"We present a systematic and quantitative model of huddling penguins. In this mathematical model, each individual penguin in the huddle seeks only to reduce its own heat loss. Consequently, penguins on the boundary of the huddle that are most exposed to the wind move downwind to more sheltered locations along the boundary. In contrast, penguins in the interior of the huddle neither have the space to move nor experience a significant heat loss, and they therefore remain stationary. Through these individual movements, the entire huddle experiences a robust cumulative effect that we identify, describe, and quantify. This mathematical model requires a calculation of the wind flowing around the huddle and of the resulting temperature distribution. Both of these must be recomputed each time an individual penguin moves since the huddle shape changes. Using our simulation results, we find that the key parameters affecting the huddle dynamics are the number of penguins in the huddle, the wind strength, and the amount of uncertainty in the movement of the penguins. Moreover, we find that the lone assumption of individual penguins minimizing their own heat loss results in all penguins having approximately equal access to the warmth of the huddle."

Performing microarray analyses, we have recently identified activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) as an inflammation-induced gene in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). ALCAM belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and engages in homophilic as well as heterophilic interactions. In this study, we found ALCAM to be expressed at the protein level in human and murine lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in the vasculature of human and murine tissues in vivo. Functional in vitro experiments revealed that ALCAM mediates adhesive interactions, migration, and tube formation in LECs, suggesting a role for ALCAM in lymphatic vessel (LV) stability and in lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, ALCAM supported dendritic cell (DC) adhesion to lymphatic endothelium. In agreement with these findings, experiments performed in ALCAM mice detected reduced LEC numbers in various tissues and defects in the formation of an organized LV network. Moreover, DC migration from lung to draining lymph nodes was compromised in ALCAM mice. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for ALCAM in stabilizing LEC-LEC interactions and in the organization and function of the LV network."
https://openalex.org/W2006774451,"There is an inverse secular trend between the incidence of obesity and gastric colonization with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that can affect the secretion of gastric hormones that relate to energy homeostasis. H. pylori strains that carry the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) interact more intimately with gastric epithelial cells and trigger more extensive host responses than cag(-) strains. We hypothesized that gastric colonization with H. pylori strains differing in cag PAI status exert distinct effects on metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes.To test this hypothesis, we examined metabolic and inflammatory markers in db/db mice and mice with diet-induced obesity experimentally infected with isogenic forms of H. pylori strain 26695: the cag PAI wild-type and its cag PAI mutant strain 99-305. H. pylori colonization decreased fasting blood glucose levels, increased levels of leptin, improved glucose tolerance, and suppressed weight gain. A response found in both wild-type and mutant H. pylori strain-infected mice included decreased white adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) and increased adipose tissue regulatory T cells (Treg) cells. Gene expression analyses demonstrated upregulation of gastric PPAR γ-responsive genes (i.e., CD36 and FABP4) in H. pylori-infected mice. The loss of PPAR γ in immune and epithelial cells in mice impaired the ability of H. pylori to favorably modulate glucose homeostasis and ATM infiltration during high fat feeding.Gastric infection with some commensal strains of H. pylori ameliorates glucose homeostasis in mice through a PPAR γ-dependent mechanism and modulates macrophage and Treg cell infiltration into the abdominal white adipose tissue."

However, research showing that various intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence metal accumulation, raises doubts about the basis for using seaweeds in biomonitoring programmes. The thallus of brown seaweeds of the order Laminariales (kelps) is morphologically complex but there is limited information about the variation in metal accumulation between the different parts, which might result in erroneous conclusions being drawn if not accounted for in the biomonitoring protocol. To assess patterns of individual metals in the differentiated parts of the thallus (blade, stipe, holdfast), concentrations of a wide range of essential and non-essential metals (Fe, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni and Al) were measured in the kelp Lessonia trabeculata. Seaweeds were collected from three sampling stations located at 5, 30 and 60 m from an illegal sewage outfall close to Ventanas, Chile and from a pristine location at Faro Curaumilla. For the majority of metals the highest concentrations in bottom sediment and seaweed samples were found at the site closest to the outfall, with concentrations decreasing with distance from the outfall and at control stations; the exception was Cd, concentrations of which were higher at control stations. The patterns of metal concentrations in different thallus parts were metal specific and independent of sampling station. These results and the available literature suggest that biomonitoring of metals using seaweeds must take account of differences in the accumulation of metals in thallus parts of complex seaweeds."
https://openalex.org/W2089376965,"Neuroblastoma resistance to apoptosis may contribute to the aggressive behavior of this tumor. Therefore, it would be relevant to activate endogenous cellular death mechanisms as a way to improve neuroblastoma therapy. We used the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line as a model to study the mechanisms involved in acetaminophen (AAP)-mediated toxicity by measuring CYP2E1 enzymatic activity, NFkB p65 subunit activation and translocation to the nucleus, Bax accumulation into the mitochondria, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. AAP activates the intrinsic death pathway in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. AAP metabolism is partially responsible for this activation, because blockade of the cytochrome CYP2E1 significantly reduced but did not totally prevent, AAP-induced SH-SY5Y cell death. AAP also induced NFkB p65 activation by phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus, where NFkB p65 increased IL-1β production. This increase contributed to neuroblastoma cell death through a mechanism involving Bax accumulation into the mitochondria, cytochrome c release and caspase3 activation. Blockade of NFkB translocation to the nucleus by the peptide SN50 prevented AAP-mediated cell death and IL-1β production. Moreover, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL did not decrease AAP-mediated IL-1β production, but prevented both AAP and IL-1β-mediated cell death. We also confirmed the AAP toxic actions on SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and U87MG glioblastoma cell lines. The results presented here suggest that AAP activates the intrinsic death pathway in neuroblastoma cells through a mechanism involving NFkB and IL-1β."
https://openalex.org/W2040835952,"Poor fetal growth, also known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), is a worldwide health concern. IUGR is commonly associated with both an increased risk in perinatal mortality and a higher prevalence of developing chronic metabolic diseases later in life. Obesity, type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome could result from noxious ""metabolic programming."" In order to better understand early alterations involved in metabolic programming, we modeled IUGR rat pups through either prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoid (dams infused with dexamethasone 100 µg/kg/day, DEX) or prenatal undernutrition (dams feeding restricted to 30% of ad libitum intake, UN). Physiological (glucose and insulin tolerance), morphometric (automated tissue image analysis) and transcriptomic (quantitative PCR) approaches were combined during early life of these IUGR pups with a special focus on their endocrine pancreas and adipose tissue development. In the absence of catch-up growth before weaning, DEX and UN IUGR pups both presented basal hyperglycaemia, decreased glucose tolerance, and pancreatic islet atrophy. Other early metabolic defects were model-specific: DEX pups presented decreased insulin sensitivity whereas UN pups exhibited lowered glucose-induced insulin secretion and more marked alterations in gene expression of pancreatic islet and adipose tissue development regulators. In conclusion, these results show that before any catch-up growth, IUGR rats present early physiologic, morphologic and transcriptomic defects, which can be considered as initial mechanistic basis of metabolic programming."
https://openalex.org/W1966262209,"Topo II poisons, which target topoisomerase II (topo II) to generate enzyme mediated DNA damage, have been commonly used for anti-cancer treatment. While clinical evidence demonstrate a capability of topo II poisons in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, accumulating evidence also show that topo II poison treatment frequently results in cell cycle arrest in cancer cells, which was associated with subsequent resistance to these treatments. Results in this report indicate that treatment of MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells with topo II poisons resulted in an increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and an subsequent induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 activation using specific inhibitors markedly attenuated the topo II poison-induced G2/M arrest and diminished the topo II poison-induced activation of ATR and Chk1 kinases. Moreover, decreased expression of ATR by specific shRNA diminished topo II poison-induced G2/M arrest but had no effect on topo II poison-induced ERK1/2 activation. In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling had little, if any, effect on topo II poison-induced ATM activation. In addition, ATM inhibition by either incubation of cells with ATM specific inhibitor or transfection of cells with ATM specific siRNA did not block topo II poison-induced G2/M arrest. Ultimately, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling greatly enhanced topo II poison-induced apoptosis. These results implicate a critical role for ERK1/2 signaling in the activation of G2/M checkpoint response following topo II poison treatment, which protects cells from topo II poison-induced apoptosis."

This study was designed to determine the roles of H(2)S in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in modulating sympathetic activity and cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) in chronic heart failure (CHF).CHF was induced by left descending coronary artery ligation in rats. Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and MAP were recorded under anesthesia. CSAR was evaluated by the RSNA and MAP responses to epicardial application of capsaicin. PVN microinjection of low doses of a H(2)S donor, GYY4137 (0.01 and 0.1 nmol), had no significant effects on RSNA, MAP and CSAR. High doses of GYY4137 (1, 2 and 4 nmol) increased baseline RSNA, MAP and heart rate (HR), and enhanced CSAR. The effects were greater in CHF rats than sham-operated rats. A cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) inhibitor, hydroxylamine (HA) in PVN had no significant effect on the RSNA, MAP and CSAR. CBS activity and H(2)S level in the PVN were decreased in CHF rats. No significant difference in CBS level in PVN was found between sham-operated rats and CHF rats. Stimulation of cardiac sympathetic afferents with capsaicin decreased CBS activity and H(2)S level in the PVN in both sham-operated rats and CHF rats.Exogenous H(2)S in PVN increases RSNA, MAP and HR, and enhances CSAR. The effects are greater in CHF rats than those in sham-operated rats. Endogenous H(2)S in PVN is not responsible for the sympathetic activation and enhanced CSAR in CHF rats."
https://openalex.org/W2046976756,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the circadian clock is closely associated with metabolic regulation. However, whether an impaired circadian clock is a direct cause of metabolic dysregulation such as body weight gain is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that body weight gain in mice is not significantly changed by restricting feeding period to daytime or nighttime. The expression of peripheral circadian clock genes was altered by feeding period restriction, while the expression of light-regulated hypothalamic circadian clock genes was unaffected by either a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). In the liver, the expression pattern of circadian clock genes, including Bmal1, Clock, and Per2, was changed by different feeding period restrictions. Moreover, the expression of lipogenic genes, gluconeogenic genes, and fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver was also altered by feeding period restriction. Given that feeding period restriction does not affect body weight gain with a NCD or HFD, it is likely that the amount of food consumed might be a crucial factor in determining body weight. Collectively, these data suggest that feeding period restriction modulates the expression of peripheral circadian clock genes, which is uncoupled from light-sensitive hypothalamic circadian clock genes."
https://openalex.org/W1990409845,"Fibril formation by mutational variants of human lysozyme is associated with a fatal form of hereditary non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis. Defining the mechanistic details of lysozyme aggregation is of crucial importance for understanding the origin and progression of this disease and related misfolding conditions. In this study, we show that a biotin moiety can be introduced site-specifically at Lys33 of human lysozyme. We demonstrate, using biophysical techniques, that the structure and stability of the native-state of the protein are not detectably altered by this modification, and that the ability to form amyloid fibrils is unchanged. By taking advantage of biotin-avidin interactions, we show that super-resolution fluorescence microscopy can generate detailed images of the mature fibrils. This methodology can readily enable the introduction of additional probes into the protein, thereby providing the means through which to understand, in detail, the nature of the aggregation process of lysozyme and its variants under a variety of conditions."

Here we show that a spin model for the k-coloring of large dense random graphs can be field tuned so that its acceptance ratio diverges during Monte Carlo quantum annealing, until a ground state is reached. We also find that simulations exhibiting such a diverging acceptance ratio are generally more effective than those tuned to the more conventional pattern of a declining and/or stagnating acceptance ratio. This observation facilitates the discovery of solutions to several well-known benchmark k-coloring instances, some of which have been open for almost two decades."

It remains unclear how distinct intracellular Gli activity is generated. Here, we demonstrate that Sufu acts universally as a negative regulator of Hh signaling, whereas Kif7 inhibits Gli activity in cooperation with, and independent of, Sufu. Together, they deter naïve precursors from acquiring increasingly ventral identity. We show that Kif7 is also required to establish high intracellular Gli activity by antagonizing the Sufu-inhibition of Gli2. Strikingly, by abolishing the negative regulatory action of Sufu, diverse ventral cell fates can be specified in the absence of extracellular Hh signaling. These data suggest that Sufu is the primary regulator of graded Hh signaling and establish that the antagonistic and cooperative actions of Kif7 and Sufu are responsible for setting up distinct Gli activity in ventral cell fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2053872754,"Biogenic amines, particularly serotonin, are recognised to play an important role in controlling the aggression of invertebrates, whereas the effect of neurohormones is still underexplored. The crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (cHH) is a multifunctional member of the eyestalk neuropeptide family. We expect that this neuropeptide influences aggression either directly, by controlling its expression, or indirectly, by mobilizing the energetic stores needed for the increased activity of an animal. Our study aims at testing such an influence and the possible reversion of hierarchies in the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, as a model organism. Three types of pairs of similarly sized males were formed: (1) ‘control pairs’ (CP, n = 8): both individuals were injected with a phosphate saline solution (PBS); (2) ‘reinforced pairs’ (RP, n = 9): the alpha alone was injected with native cHH, and the beta with PBS; (3) ‘inverted pairs’ (IP, n = 9): the opposite of (2). We found that, independently of the crayfish’s prior social experience, cHH injections induced (i) the expression of dominance behaviour, (ii) higher glycemic levels, and (iii) lower time spent motionless. In CP and RP, fight intensity decreased with the establishment of dominance. On the contrary, in IP, betas became increasingly likely to initiate and escalate fights and, consequently, increased their dominance till a temporary reversal of the hierarchy. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that, similarly to serotonin, cHH enhances individual aggression, up to reverse, although transitorily, the hierarchical rank. New research perspectives are thus opened in our intriguing effort of understanding the role of cHH in the modulation of agonistic behaviour in crustaceans."

This was functional and resulted in exaggerated migratory response of cells against PGD2. Nasal challenge of AR patients resulted in a significant increase of VIP contents in nasal secretion (ELISA), and the immunohistochemical studies of allergic nasal tissues showed significant expression of VIP in association with intense eosinophil recruitment.

Nano-LC-MS analysis showed that the lysine residues of almost all identified VWF peptides were not differentially modified upon incubation of VWF with FVIII or activated FVIII. However, Lys-773 of peptide Ser-766–Leu-774 was protected from chemical modification in the presence of FVIII.

https://openalex.org/W2046631083,"FATP1 is involved in lipid transport into cells and in intracellular lipid metabolism. We showed previously that this protein interacts with and inhibits the limiting-step isomerase of the visual cycle RPE65. Here, we aimed to analyze the effect of Fatp1-deficiency in vivo on the visual cycle, structure and function, and on retinal aging. Among the Fatp family members, we observed that only Fatp1 and 4 are expressed in the control retina, in both the neuroretina and the retinal pigment epithelium. In the neuroretina, Fatp1 is mostly expressed in photoreceptors. In young adult Fatp1(-/-) mice, Fatp4 expression was unchanged in retinal pigment epithelium and reduced two-fold in the neuroretina as compared to Fatp1(+/+) mice. The Fatp1(-/-) mice had a preserved retinal structure but a decreased electroretinogram response to light. These mice also displayed a delayed recovery of the b-wave amplitude after bleaching, however, visual cycle speed was unchanged, and both retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors presented the same fatty acid pattern compared to controls. In 2 year-old Fatp1(-/-) mice, transmission electron microscopy studies showed specific abnormalities in the retinas comprising choroid vascularization anomalies and thickening of the Bruch membrane with material deposits, and sometimes local disorganization of the photoreceptor outer segments. These anomalies lead us to speculate that the absence of FATP1 accelerates the aging process."

In the first experiment, complete MCA occlusion and reproducible hypoperfusion were obtained in 85% of animals during the first hour after stroke onset. In the second experiment, 80% of animals showed partial to complete reperfusion during a three-hour follow-up.

Tacrolimus (FK506) has been shown to have functions on inducing immunosuppression and augmenting apoptosis of pathologic T cells in autoimmune disease. Here we examined the therapeutic effect of DNA vaccine in conjunction with FK506 on EAE. Methodology/Principal Findings After EAE induction, C57BL/6 mice were treated with DNA vaccine in conjunction with FK506. Functional Treg cells were induced in treated EAE mice and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cell responses. Infiltrated CD4 T cells were reduced while Treg cells were induced in spinal cords of treated EAE mice. Remarkably, the activated CD4 T cells augmented apoptosis, but the induced Treg cells resisted apoptosis in treated EAE mice, resulting in alleviation of clinical EAE severity. Conclusions/Significance DNA vaccine in conjunction with FK506 treatment ameliorates EAE by enhancing apoptosis of CD4 T cells and resisting apoptosis of induced Treg cells. Our findings implicate the potential of tolerogenic DNA vaccines for treating MS."
https://openalex.org/W1970728065,"Replicating the genome prior to each somatic cell division not only requires precise duplication of the genetic information, but also accurately reestablishing the epigenetic signatures that instruct how the genetic material is to be interpreted in the daughter cells.

While much is known about the early stages of X chromosome inactivation, much less is understood with regards to retaining the Xi chromatin through somatic cell division. Here we report that the WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex (WICH) associates with the Xi during late S-phase as the Xi DNA is replicated. Elevated levels of WICH at the Xi is restricted to late S-phase and appears before BRCA1 and γ-H2A.X.

https://openalex.org/W2144467754,"Retinoid x receptor α (RXRα) is abundantly expressed in the liver and is essential for the function of other nuclear receptors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and mRNA profiling data generated from wild type and RXRα-null mouse livers, the current study identifies the bona-fide hepatic RXRα targets and biological pathways. In addition, based on binding and motif analysis, the molecular mechanism by which RXRα regulates hepatic genes is elucidated in a high-throughput manner.Close to 80% of hepatic expressed genes were bound by RXRα, while 16% were expressed in an RXRα-dependent manner. Motif analysis predicted direct repeat with a spacer of one nucleotide as the most prevalent RXRα binding site. Many of the 500 strongest binding motifs overlapped with the binding motif of specific protein 1. Biological functional analysis of RXRα-dependent genes revealed that hepatic RXRα deficiency mainly resulted in up-regulation of steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes and down-regulation of translation- as well as anti-apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, RXRα bound to many genes that encode nuclear receptors and their cofactors suggesting the central role of RXRα in regulating nuclear receptor-mediated pathways.This study establishes the relationship between RXRα DNA binding and hepatic gene expression. RXRα binds extensively to the mouse genome. However, DNA binding does not necessarily affect the basal mRNA level. In addition to metabolism, RXRα dictates the expression of genes that regulate RNA processing, translation, and protein folding illustrating the novel roles of hepatic RXRα in post-transcriptional regulation."

In this study, the authors evaluate the association of a prescription diet drug (Letigen) containing ephedrine (20 mg) and caffeine (200 mg) with spontaneous abortion (SAB) in the Danish National Birth Cohort. Methods Women were recruited during their first prenatal visit from 1996–2002. Pre-conception and early pregnancy medication use was reported on the enrollment form, and pregnancy outcome was determined by linking the mother's Civil Registration Number to the Medical Birth Registry and the National Hospital Discharge Register. Of 97,903 eligible pregnancies, 4,443 ended in SAB between 5 and 20 completed gestational weeks, inclusive. Letigen use was reported for 565 pregnancies. Cox regression models accounting for left truncation were fit to estimate the effect of pre-conception and early pregnancy Letigen use on SAB. Principal Findings The estimated maternal age-adjusted hazard ratio for SAB was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.8–1.6) for any periconceptional Letigen use compared to no periconceptional use. Conclusions Although Letigen has high levels of caffeine (the recommended 3 pills/day are approximately equivalent to caffeine from 6 cups of coffee), periconceptional use does not appear to be associated with an appreciably increased hazard of clinically recognized SAB."
https://openalex.org/W1975783449,"Genetic analysis of TP63 implicates ΔNp63 isoforms in preservation of replicative capacity and cellular lifespan within adult stem cells. ΔNp63α is also an oncogene and survival factor that mediates therapeutic resistance in squamous carcinomas. These diverse activities are the result of genetic and functional interactions between TP63 and an array of morphogenic and morphostatic signals that govern tissue and tumor stasis, mitotic polarity, and cell fate; however the cellular signals that account for specific functions of TP63 are incompletely understood. To address this we sought to identify signaling pathways that regulate expression, stability or activity of ΔNp63α. An siRNA-based screen of the human kinome identified the Type 1 TGFβ receptor, ALK5, as the kinase required for phosphorylation of ΔNp63α at Serine 66/68 (S66/68). This activity is TGFβ-dependent and sensitive to either ALK5-directed siRNA or the ALK5 kinase inhibitor A83-01. Mechanistic studies support a model in which ALK5 is proteolytically cleaved at the internal juxtamembrane region resulting in the translocation of the C-terminal ALK5-intracellular kinase domain (ALK5(IKD)). In this study, we demonstrate that ALK5-mediated phosphorylation of ΔNp63α is required for the anti-clonogenic effects of TGFΒ and ectopic expression of ALK5(IKD) mimics these effects. Finally, we present evidence that ultraviolet irradiation-mediated phosphorylation of ΔNp63α is sensitive to ALK5 inhibitors. These findings identify a non-canonical TGFβ-signaling pathway that mediates the anti-clonogenic effects of TGFβ and the effects of cellular stress via ΔNp63α phosphorylation."

As most phosphoproteome studies are based on optimized in-vitro cell culture studies new methods are in need to improve de novo identification and characterization of phosphoproteins in extracts from tissues. Here, we describe a rapid and reliable method for the detection of phosphoproteins in tissue extract based on an experimental strategy that employs 1D and 2D SDS PAGE, Western immunoblotting of phosphoproteins, in-gel protease digestion and enrichment of phosphorpeptides using metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). Subsequently, phosphoproteins are identified by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS with the CHCA-TL or DHB ML sample matrix preparation method and further characterized by various bioinformatic software tools to search for candidate kinases and phosphorylation-dependent binding motifs. The method was applied to mouse lung tissue extracts and resulted in an identification of 160 unique phosphoproteins. Notably, TiO2 enrichment of pulmonary protein extracts resulted in an identification of additional 17 phosphoproteins and 20 phosphorylation sites. By use of MOAC, new phosphorylation sites were identified as evidenced for the advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor. So far this protein was unknown to be phosphorylated in lung tissue of mice. Overall the developed methodology allowed efficient and rapid screening of phosphorylated proteins and can be employed as a general experimental strategy for an identification of phosphoproteins in tissue extracts."
