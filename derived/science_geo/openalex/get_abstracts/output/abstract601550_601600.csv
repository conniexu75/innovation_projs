https://openalex.org/W2777024363,"This research is motivated by one of our survey studies to assess the potential influence of introducing zebra mussels to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. One research question in this study is to investigate the association between the boating activity type and the awareness of zebra mussels. A chi-squared test is often used for testing independence between two factors with nominal levels. When the null hypothesis of independence between two factors is rejected, we are often left wondering where does the significance come from. Cell residuals, including standardized residuals and adjusted residuals, are traditionally used in testing for cell significance, which is often known as a post hoc test after a statistically significant chi-squared test. In practice, the limiting distributions of these residuals are utilized for statistical inference. However, they may lead to different conclusions based on the calculated p-values, and their p-values could be over- o6r under-estimated due to the unsatisfactory performance of asymptotic approaches with regards to type I error control. In this article, we propose new exact p-values by using Fisher’s approach based on three commonly used test statistics to order the sample space. We theoretically prove that the proposed new exact p-values based on these test statistics are the same. Based on our extensive simulation studies, we show that the existing asymptotic approach based on adjusted residual is often more likely to reject the null hypothesis as compared to the exact approach due to the inflated family-wise error rates as observed. We would recommend the proposed exact p-value for use in practice as a valuable post hoc analysis technique for chi-squared analysis."

This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing wearable technology to collect data from multiple sensors during the daily lives of PD patients. The Parkinson@home study is an observational, two-cohort (North America, NAM; The Netherlands, NL) study. To recruit participants, different strategies were used between sites. Main enrolment criteria were self-reported diagnosis of PD, possession of a smartphone and age≥18 years. Participants used the Fox Wearable Companion app on a smartwatch and smartphone for a minimum of 6 weeks (NAM) or 13 weeks (NL). Sensor-derived measures estimated information about movement. Additionally, medication intake and symptoms were collected via self-reports in the app. A total of 953 participants were included (NL: 304, NAM: 649). Enrolment rate was 88% in the NL (n = 304) and 51% (n = 649) in NAM. Overall, 84% (n = 805) of participants contributed sensor data. Participants were compliant for 68% (16.3 hours/participant/day) of the study period in NL and for 62% (14.8 hours/participant/day) in NAM. Daily accelerometer data collection decreased 23% in the NL after 13 weeks, and 27% in NAM after 6 weeks. Data contribution was not affected by demographics, clinical characteristics or attitude towards technology, but was by the platform usability score in the NL (χ2 (2) = 32.014, p<0.001), and self-reported depression in NAM (χ2(2) = 6.397, p = .04). The Parkinson@home study shows that it is feasible to collect objective data using multiple wearable sensors in PD during daily life in a large cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2777904489,"The current perspective of increasing global temperature makes heat stress as a major threat to wheat production worldwide. In order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with heat tolerance, 251 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between HD2808 (heat tolerant) and HUW510 (heat susceptible) were evaluated under timely sown (normal) and late sown (heat stress) conditions for two consecutive crop seasons; 2013-14 and 2014-15. Grain yield (GY) and its components namely, grain weight/spike (GWS), grain number/spike (GNS), thousand grain weight (TGW), grain filling rate (GFR) and grain filling duration (GFD) were recorded for both conditions and years. The data collected for both timely and late sown conditions and heat susceptibility index (HSI) of these traits were used as phenotypic data for QTL identification. The frequency distribution of HSI for all the studied traits was continuous during both the years and also included transgressive segregants. Composite interval mapping identified total 24 QTLs viz., 9 (timely sown traits), 6 (late sown traits) and 9 (HSI of traits) mapped on linkage groups 2A, 2B, and 6D during both the crop seasons 2013-14 and 2014-15. The QTLs were detected for GWS (6), GNS (6), GFR (4), TGW (3), GY (3) and GFD (2). The LOD score of identified QTLs varied from 3.03 (Qtgns.iiwbr-6D) to 21.01 (Qhsitgw.iiwbr-2A) during 2014-15, explaining 11.2 and 30.6% phenotypic variance, respectively. Maximum no of QTLs were detected in chromosome 2A followed by 6D and 2B. All the QTL detected under late sown and HSI traits were identified on chromosome 2A except for QTLs associated with GFD. Fifteen out of 17 QTL detected on chromosome 2A were clustered within the marker interval between gwm448 and wmc296 and showed tight linkage with gwm122 and these were localized in 49-52 cM region of Somers consensus map of chromosome 2A i.e. within 18-59.56 cM region of chromosome 2A where no QTL related to heat stress were reported earlier. Besides, three consistent QTLs, Qgws.iiwbr-2A, Qgns.iiwbr-2A and Qgns.iiwbr-2A were also detected in all the environments in this region. The nearest QTL detected in earlier studies, QFv/Fm.cgb-2A was approximately 6cM below the presently identified QTLs region, respectively Additionally, QTLs for physiological and phenological traits and plant height under late sown and HSI of these traits were also detected on chromosome 2A. QTL for HSI of plant height and physiological maturity were located in the same genomic region of chromosome 2Awhereas QTLs for physiological and phonological traits under late sown were located 8cM and 33.5 cM below the genomic location associated with grain traits, respectively in consensus map of Somers. This QTL hot-spot region with consistent QTLs could be used to improve heat tolerance after validation."
https://openalex.org/W2780840915,"Following their introduction, the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed in Asia for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Few contemporary data are available on temporal trends in antithrombotic therapy use in Asian countries, in the era of NOACs.Using the National Health Insurance Service database of the entire Korean adult AF population, the use of aspirin, vitamin K antagonist, and NOACs between 2008 and 2015 were analyzed (n = 276,246 in 2015). Most of the included cohort had CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (78.2% in 2008 and 83.2% in 2015), yet approximately 17% were prescribed no antithrombotic therapy throughout the study period. Aspirin prescription consistently decreased (from 48.2% to 31.5%) over time, while OAC prescription significantly increased from 34.7% to 50.6%. NOAC prescriptions accounted for 50% of total OAC prescription in 2015. Similar trends in antithrombotic therapy were found both in men and in women, but women were more likely to be undertreated with OAC. Female gender, presence of vascular disease and prior intracranial hemorrhage were associated with OAC underuse.Between 2008 and 2015, a greater proportion of AF patients received OAC treatment with increasing NOAC prescription trends in the recent 3 years. A substantial proportion (approx. 50%) of Korean patients with AF still remain undertreated."
https://openalex.org/W2778310395,"The social determinants of health framework has brought a recognition of the primary importance of social forces in determining population health. Research using this framework to understand the health and mortality impact of social, economic, and political conditions, however, has rarely included religious institutions and ties. We investigate a well-measured set of social and economic determinants along with several measures of religious participation as predictors of adult mortality. Respondents (N = 18,370) aged 50 and older to the Health and Retirement Study were interviewed in 2004 and followed for all-cause mortality to 2014. Exposure variables were religious attendance, importance, and affiliation. Other social determinants of health included gender, race/ethnicity, education, household income, and net worth measured at baseline. Confounders included physical and mental health. Health behaviors and social ties were included as potential explanatory variables. Cox proportional hazards regressions were adjusted for complex sample design. After adjustment for confounders, attendance at religious services had a dose-response relationship with mortality, such that respondents who attended frequently had a 40% lower hazard of mortality (HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.53-0.68) compared with those who never attended. Those for whom religion was ""very important"" had a 4% higher hazard (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07); religious affiliation was not associated with risk of mortality. Higher income and net worth were associated with a reduced hazard of mortality as were female gender, Latino ethnicity, and native birth. Religious participation is multi-faceted and shows both lower and higher hazards of mortality in an adult US sample in the context of a comprehensive set of other social and economic determinants of health."
https://openalex.org/W2778221344,"Background Stunting is a well-established risk marker of poor child development. Globally in 2017, 155 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted. While different activities are being done to reduce the burden of stunted growth, the problem is overwhelming in Africa; it was increased by 24%. Therefore, identifying determinants of stunting among children aged 6–59 would help to set priorities for action and to the design of stunting reduction plan at a grassroots level. Methods The unmatched case-control study was conducted in randomly selected 8 rural kebeles of Kindo Didaye woreda, Ethiopia from February to April, 2016 to identify the determinants of stunting among children aged 6–59 months. The sampling frame was identified by enumeration of 6–59 months of age children in the entire households of the study area. From which 155 as cases and 310 as controls were chosen using anthropometric measurement based on the median of WHO 2006 reference population. The anthropometric data were analyzed by WHO Anthro 2010 software to generate Z-score values. Odds Ratio along with 95% confidence interval was estimated to identify determinants of stunting using the multivariable logistic regression. Results Drinking water from unsafe source (AOR = 7.06, 95% CI; 4.40–20.42),occasionally eating animal source food (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI; 0.02–0.68), ARI in the past two weeks (AOR = 3.04, (95% CI; 1.04–13.35), late initiation of breastfeeding after one hours after birth (AOR = 5.16, 95% CI; 2.24–15.90) and lack of vaccination (AOR = 6.38, 95% CI; 2.54–17.10)were significantly associated with stunting. Conclusions Factors like exposure to diarrhea disease, exposure to acute respiratory infection, late initiation of breast milk after child breath, squeeze out of 1st breast milk, lack of vaccination, animal source of food, and unsafe source of water for drinking could be used to set priorities for action and to the design of Kindo Didaye woreda plan for stunting reduction down to grassroots level. Therefore, zonal health department and Kindo Didaye woreda health office should promote the importance of colostrums feeding. Drinking water should be decontaminated. Expansion of vaccination program to enhance herd immunity at the community level is important."
https://openalex.org/W2778341431,"Objectives Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks specific drug targets and remains challenging. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. Method MDA-MB-453, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Results Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown. Conclusion Our study provided a preclinical rationale in selecting patients who might have therapeutic benefit from combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AR antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2776239178,"Background Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that statins could exhibit anticancer properties in ovarian cancer. Similar effects have also been reported in observational studies but their results remain inconsistent and could be impaired by methodological limitations. This study aimed to investigate whether statin use is associated with improved survival in ovarian cancer patients at the Belgian population-level. Methods All patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 were identified from the Belgian Cancer Registry. Vital statuses were obtained from the Crossroads Bank for Social Security and ovarian cancer-specific deaths were identified from death certificates provided by regional administrations. Information on cancer treatments and statin use were retrieved from health insurance databases. Statin use was modelled as a time-varying covariate in Cox regression models to calculate adjusted hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the association between postdiagnostic exposure to statins and overall- or ovarian cancer-specific mortality within three years after diagnosis. Adjustments were made for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, comorbidities, cancer stage, and cancer treatments. Results A total of 5,416 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer met the inclusion criteria. Of these 1,255 (23%) had at least one statin prescription within three years after diagnosis. Postdiagnostic use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality (adjusted HR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.72–0.90, p<0.001). In analyses by statin type, this association was only significant for simvastatin (adjusted HR = 0.86, 95%CI:0.74–0.99, p = 0.05) or rosuvastatin (adjusted HR = 0.71, 95%CI:0.55–0.92, p = 0.01). In subgroup analyses by statin prediagnostic use, the protective association for postdiagnostic statin use was only observed in patients who were also using statins before diagnosis (adjusted HR = 0.73, 95%CI:0.64–0.83, p<0.001). Similar results were observed for ovarian cancer-specific mortality. Conclusion In this large nation-wide cohort of ovarian cancer patients postdiagnostic use of statins was associated with improved survival."
https://openalex.org/W2781325153,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of daily top-dressing (individually feeding on the top of the total mixed ration) with rumen-protected methionine (RPM) from 30 ± 3 until 126 ± 3 Days in milk on productive and reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows. A total of 309 lactating dairy Holstein cows (138 primiparous and 171 multiparous) were randomly assigned to treatment diets containing either RPM (21.2 g of RPM + 38.8 g of dried distillers grain; 2.34% Methionine [Met] of metabolizable protein [MP]) or Control (CON; 60 g of dried distillers grain; 1.87% Met of MP). Plasma amino acids were evaluated at the time of artificial insemination (AI) and near pregnancy diagnosis. Milk production and milk composition were evaluated monthly. Pregnancy was diagnosed on Day 28 (by Pregnancy-specific protein B [PSPB]), 32, 47, and 61 (by ultrasound) and sizes of embryonic and amniotic vesicle were determined by ultrasound on Day 33 after AI. Feeding RPM increased plasma Met at 6, 9, 12, and 18 hours after top-dressing with a peak at 12 hours (52.4 vs 26.0 μM; P < 0.001) and returned to basal by 24 hours. Cows fed RPM had a small increase in milk protein percentage (3.08 vs 3.00%; P = 0.04) with no differences on milk yield and milk protein yield. Additionally, in multiparous cows, RPM feeding increased milk protein (3.03 vs 2.95%; P = 0.05) and fat (3.45 vs 3.14%; P = 0.01) percentages, although no effects were observed in primiparous cows. In multiparous cows fed RPM, pregnancy loss was lower between Days 28 to 61 (19.6 [10/51] vs. 6.1% [3/49]; P = 0.03) or between Days 32 to 61 (8.9 [4/45] vs. 0 [0/0] %; P = 0.03), although, there was no effect of treatment on pregnancy loss in primiparous cows. Consistent with data on pregnancy loss, RPM feeding increased embryonic abdominal diameter (P = 0.01) and volume (P = 0.009) and amniotic vesicle volume (P = 0.04) on Day 33 of pregnancy in multiparous cows but had no effect on embryonic size in primiparous cows. Thus, the increase in plasma Met concentrations after feeding RPM was sufficient to produce a small increase in milk protein percentage and to improve embryonic size and pregnancy maintenance in multiparous cows. Further studies are needed to confirm these responses and understand the biological mechanisms that underlie these responses as well as the timing and concentrations of circulating Met that are needed to produce this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2778273162,"Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are some of the common environmental pollutants originating mainly from oil and gas industries, which are toxic to human as well as other living organisms in the ecosystem. Here we investigate photocatalytic degradation of BTEX under visible light irradiation using supported zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods grown on glass substrates using a microwave assisted hydrothermal method. ZnO nanorods were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area, UV/visible absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Visible light photocatalytic degradation products of BTEX are studied for individual components using gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). ZnO nanorods with significant amount of electronic defect states, due to the fast crystallization of the nanorods under microwave irradiation, exhibited efficient degradation of BTEX under visible light, degrading more than 80% of the individual BTEX components in 180 minutes. Effect of initial concentration of BTEX as individual components is also probed and the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO nanorods in different conditions is explored. Formation of intermediate byproducts such as phenol, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid were confirmed by our HPLC analysis which could be due to the photocatalytic degradation of BTEX. Carbon dioxide was evaluated and showed an increasing pattern over time indicating the mineralization process confirming the conversion of toxic organic compounds into benign products."
https://openalex.org/W2780844125,"A major issue of machinery fault diagnosis using vibration signals is that it is over-reliant on personnel knowledge and experience in interpreting the signal. Thus, machine learning has been adapted for machinery fault diagnosis. The quantity and quality of the input features, however, influence the fault classification performance. Feature selection plays a vital role in selecting the most representative feature subset for the machine learning algorithm. In contrast, the trade-off relationship between capability when selecting the best feature subset and computational effort is inevitable in the wrapper-based feature selection (WFS) method. This paper proposes an improved WFS technique before integration with a support vector machine (SVM) model classifier as a complete fault diagnosis system for a rolling element bearing case study. The bearing vibration dataset made available by the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Centre was executed using the proposed WFS and its performance has been analysed and discussed. The results reveal that the proposed WFS secures the best feature subset with a lower computational effort by eliminating the redundancy of re-evaluation. The proposed WFS has therefore been found to be capable and efficient to carry out feature selection tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2778148852,"Understanding chronic ionizing radiation (CIR) effects is of utmost importance to protecting human health and the environment. Diverse bacteria and fungi inhabiting extremely radioactive waste and disaster sites (e.g. Hanford, Chernobyl, Fukushima) represent new targets of CIR research. We show that many microorganisms can grow under intense gamma-CIR dose rates of 13–126 Gy/h, with fungi identified as a particularly CIR-resistant group of eukaryotes: among 145 phylogenetically diverse strains tested, 78 grew under 36 Gy/h. Importantly, we demonstrate that CIR resistance can depend on cell concentration and that certain resistant microbial cells protect their neighbors (not only conspecifics, but even radiosensitive species from a different phylum), from high-level CIR. We apply a mechanistically-motivated mathematical model of CIR effects, based on accumulation/removal kinetics of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, in bacteria (3 Escherichia coli strains and Deinococcus radiodurans) and in fungi (Candida parapsilosis, Kazachstania exigua, Pichia kudriavzevii, Rhodotorula lysinophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon mucoides). We also show that correlations between responses to CIR and acute ionizing radiation (AIR) among studied microorganisms are weak. For example, in D. radiodurans, the best molecular correlate for CIR resistance is the antioxidant enzyme catalase, which is dispensable for AIR resistance; and numerous CIR-resistant fungi are not AIR-resistant. Our experimental findings and quantitative modeling thus demonstrate the importance of investigating CIR responses directly, rather than extrapolating from AIR. Protection of radiosensitive cell-types by radioresistant ones under high-level CIR is a potentially important new tool for bioremediation of radioactive sites and development of CIR-resistant microbiota as radioprotectors."
https://openalex.org/W2779908024,"Background The association between Cryptosporidium and human colon cancer has been reported in different populations. However, this association has not been well studied. In order to add new strong arguments for a probable link between cryptosporidiosis and colon human cancer, the aim of this study was to determine prevalence and to identify species of Cryptosporidium among Lebanese patients. Methodology and principal findings Overall, 218 digestive biopsies were collected in Tripoli, Lebanon, from three groups of patients: (i) patients with recently diagnosed colon intraepithelial neoplasia/adenocarcinoma before any treatment (n = 72); (ii) patients with recently diagnosed stomach intraepithelial neoplasia/adenocarcinoma before any treatment (n = 21); and (iii) patients without digestive intraepithelial neoplasia/adenocarcinoma but with persistent digestive symptoms (n = 125). DNA extraction was performed from paraffin-embedded tissue. The presence of the parasite in tissues was confirmed by PCR, microscopic observation and immunofluorescence analysis. We identified a high rate (21%) of Cryptosporidium presence in biopsies from Lebanese patients with recently diagnosed colonic neoplasia/adenocarcinoma before any treatment. This prevalence was significantly higher compared to 7% of Cryptosporidium prevalence among patients without colon neoplasia but with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (OR: 4, CI: 1.65–9.6, P = 0.001). When the comparison was done against normal biopsies, the risk of infection increased 11-fold in the group of patients with colon adenocarcinoma (OR: 11.315, CI: 1.44–89.02, P = 0.003). Conclusions This is the first study performed in Lebanon reporting the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among patients with digestive cancer. These results show that Cryptosporidium is strongly associated with human colon cancer being maybe a potential etiological agent of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2778274599,"Grapevine trunk diseases: Eutypa dieback, esca and Botryosphaeria dieback, which incidence has increased recently, are associated with several symptoms finally leading to the plant death. In the absence of efficient treatments, these diseases are a major problem for the viticulture; however, the factors involved in disease progression are not still fully identified. In order to get a better understanding of Botryosphaeria dieback development in grapevine, we have investigated different factors involved in Botryosphaeriaceae fungi aggressiveness. We first evaluated the activity of the wood-degrading enzymes of different isolates of Neofusicoccum parvum and Diplodia seriata, two major fungi associated with Botryosphaeria dieback. We further examinated the ability of these fungi to metabolize major grapevine phytoalexins: resveratrol and δ-viniferin. Our results demonstrate that Botryosphaeriaceae were characterized by differential wood decay enzymatic activities and have the capacity to rapidly degrade stilbenes. N. parvum is able to degrade parietal polysaccharides, whereas D. seriata has a better capacity to degrade lignin. Growth of both fungi exhibited a low sensitivity to resveratrol, whereas δ-viniferin has a fungistatic effect, especially on N. parvum Bourgogne S-116. We further show that Botryosphaeriaceae are able to metabolize rapidly resveratrol and δ-viniferin. The best stilbene metabolizing activity was measured for D. seriata. In conclusion, the different Botryosphaeriaceae isolates are characterized by a specific aggressiveness repertory. Wood and phenolic compound decay enzymatic activities could enable Botryosphaeriaceae to bypass chemical and physical barriers of the grapevine plant. The specific signature of Botryosphaeriaceae aggressiveness factors could explain the importance of fungi complexes in synergistic activity in order to fully colonize the host."
https://openalex.org/W2778564600,"Background Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) coverage and uptake remains challenging. Point-of-care (POC) testing may improve access and turn-around-times, but, while several POC technologies are in development there are few data on their implementation in the field. Methods We conducted an implementation study of the Alere q Detect POC system for EID at two public sector health facilities in Cape Town. HIV-exposed neonates undergoing routine EID testing at a large maternity hospital and a primary care clinic received both laboratory-based HIV PCR testing per local protocols and a POC test. We analysed the performance of POC versus laboratory testing, and conducted semi-structured interviews with providers to assess acceptability and implementation issues. Results Overall 478 specimens were taken: 311 tests were performed at the obstetric hospital (median child age, 1 days) and 167 six-week tests in primary care (median child age, 42 days). 9.0% of all tests resulted in an error with no differences by site; most errors resolved with retesting. POC was more sensitive (100%; lower 95% CI, 39.8%) and specific (100%, lower 95% CI, 98%) among older children tested in primary care compared with birth testing in hospital (90.0%, 95% CI, 55.5–99.8% and 100.0%, lower 95% CI, 98.4%, respectively). Negative predictive value was high (>99%) at both sites. In interviews, providers felt the device was simple to use and facilitated decision-making in the management of infants. However, many wanted clarity on the cause of errors on the POC device to help guide repeat testing. Conclusions POC EID testing performs well in field implementation in health care facilities and appears highly acceptable to health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W2778034452,"Background Traditional healers are acceptable and highly accessible health practitioners throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Patients in South Africa often seek concurrent traditional and allopathic treatment leading to medical pluralism. Methods & findings We studied the cause of five traditional illnesses known locally as “Mavabyi ya nhloko” (sickness of the head), by conducting 27 in-depth interviews and 133 surveys with a randomly selected sample of traditional healers living and working in rural, northeastern South Africa. These interviews were carried out to identify treatment practices of mental, neurological, and substance abuse (MNS) disorders. Participating healers were primarily female (77%), older in age (median: 58.0 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50–67), had very little formal education (median: 3.7 years; IQR: 3.2–4.2), and had practiced traditional medicine for many years (median: 17 years; IQR: 9.5–30). Healers reported having the ability to successfully treat: seizure disorders (47%), patients who have lost touch with reality (47%), paralysis on one side of the body (59%), and substance abuse (21%). Female healers reported a lower odds of treating seizure disorders (Odds Ratio (OR):0.47), patients who had lost touch with reality (OR:0.26; p-value<0.05), paralysis of one side of the body (OR:0.36), and substance abuse (OR:0.36) versus males. Each additional year of education received was found to be associated with lower odds, ranging from 0.13–0.27, of treating these symptoms. Each additional patient seen by healers in the past week was associated with roughly 1.10 higher odds of treating seizure disorders, patients who have lost touch with reality, paralysis of one side of the body, and substance abuse. Healers charged a median of 500 South African Rand (~US$35) to treat substance abuse, 1000 Rand (~US$70) for seizure disorders or paralysis of one side of the body, and 1500 Rand (~US$105) for patients who have lost touch with reality. Conclusions While not all healers elect to treat MNS disorders, many continue to do so, delaying allopathic health services to acutely ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2777385409,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is an unpredicted condition in patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy, and autopsy does not conclusively identify cause of death. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie this entity remain unknown, the fact that epilepsy can affect cardiac function is not surprising. The genetic factors involving ion channels co-expressed in the heart and brain and other candidate genes have been previously described. In the present study, 20 epilepsy patients with personal or family history of heart rhythm disturbance/cardiac arrhythmias/sudden death were sequenced using a custom re-sequencing panel. Twenty-six relatives were genetically analysed to ascertain the family segregation in ten individuals. Four subjects revealed variants with positive genotype-phenotype segregation: four missense variants in the CDKL5, CNTNAP2, GRIN2A and ADGRV1 genes and one copy number variant in KCNQ1. The potential pathogenic role of variants in new candidate genes will need further studies in larger cohorts, and the evaluation of the potential pathogenic role in the cardio-cerebral mechanisms requires in vivo/in vitro studies. In addition to family segregation, evaluation of the potential pathogenic roles of these variants in cardio-cerebral mechanisms by in vivo/in vitro studies should also be performed. The potential pathogenic role of variants in new candidate genes will need further studies in larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2777780150,"Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommending that electronic media be avoided in children under two years of age, screen use is common in infants and toddlers. The aims of this study were to determine how parenting style, infant temperament, and family type are associated with television viewing in two-year-old children.Participants were from the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) randomized controlled trial (n = 802) (Dunedin, New Zealand). Demographic information was collected at baseline (late pregnancy), and television and other screen time assessed by questionnaire at 24 months of age. Parenting style (Parenting Practices Questionnaire), infant temperament (Colorado Childhood Temperament Inventory), and family type (7 categories) were reported by both parents.Data were available for 487 participants (61% of the original participants). Median television viewing was relatively low at 21 minutes per day, or 30 minutes in those watching television (82%). Children who watched television played with mobile phones (12% of children) or iPads/tablets (22% of children) more frequently than children who did not (6% of children). In terms of parenting style, children of more authoritarian mothers (β = 17, 95% CI: 6-27 minutes), more authoritarian partners (β = 14, 95% CI: 2-26 minutes), or more permissive mothers (β = 10, 95% CI: 3-17 minutes) watched significantly more television. No significant relationships were observed between child temperament and time watching television after adjustment for confounding variables. Children from ""active"" families (as rated by partners) watched 29 minutes less television each day (P = 0.002).Parenting style and family type were associated with television viewing time in young children, whereas child temperament was not."
https://openalex.org/W2779431288,"Background Early detection and appropriate intervention for children with hearing impairment is important for maximizing functioning and quality of life. The lack of ear and hearing services in low income countries is a significant challenge, however, evidence suggests that even where such services are available, and children are referred to them, uptake is low. The aim of this study was to assess uptake of and barriers to referrals to ear and hearing services for children in Thyolo District, Malawi. Methods This was a mixed methods study. A survey was conducted with 170 caregivers of children who were referred for ear and hearing services during community-based screening camps to assess whether they had attended their referral and reasons for non-attendance. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 caregivers of children who did not take up their referral to explore in-depth the reasons for non-uptake. In addition, 15 stakeholders were interviewed. Thematic analysis of the interview data was conducted and emerging trends were analysed. Results Referral uptake was very low with only 5 out of 150 (3%) children attending. Seven main interacting themes for non-uptake of referral were identified in the semi-structured interviews: location of the hospital, lack of transport, other indirect costs of seeking care, fear and uncertainty about the referral hospital, procedural problems within the camps, awareness and understanding of hearing loss, and lack of visibility and availability of services. Conclusion This study has highlighted a range of interacting challenges faced by families in accessing ear and hearing services in this setting. Understanding these context specific barriers to non-uptake of ear and hearing services is important for designing appropriate interventions to increase uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2778679318,"Aim The aim of this study was to explore the online distress and help-seeking behavior of youths in Hong Kong. Methods A cross-sectional telephone-based survey was conducted among 1,010 young people in Hong Kong. Logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify the factors associated with those who reported expressing emotional distress online and the differences in help-seeking behavior among four groups of youths: (1) the non-distressed (reference) group; (2) “Did not seek help” group; (3) “Seek informal help” group; and (4) “Seek formal help” group. Results The seeking of help and expression of distress online were found to be associated with a higher lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation. The “Seek formal help” and “Did not seek help” groups had a similar risk profile, including a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, unsafe sex, and being bullied. The “Seek informal help” group was more likely to express distress online, which indicates that this population of youths may be accessible to professional identification. Approximately 20% of the distressed youths surveyed had not sought help despite expressing their distress online. Implication The study’s results indicate that helping professionals have opportunities to develop strategic engagement methods that make use of social media to help distressed youths."
https://openalex.org/W2779769952,"Our objective was to compare breast cancer mortality in two regions of the Republic of Ireland that introduced a screening programme eight years apart, and to estimate the steady-state mortality deficits the programme will produce. We carried out age- and year-matched between-region comparison of breast cancer mortality rates, and of incidence rates of stage 2-4 breast cancer, in the eligible cohorts. The regions comprised counties that, beginning in early 2000 (region 1) and late 2007 (region 2), invited women aged 50-64 to biennial mammography screening. The data were supplied by the National Cancer Registry, Central Statistics Office. As impact measures, we used age-and-year-matched mortality (from breast cancers diagnosed from 2000 onwards), rate ratios and incidence rate ratios in the compared regions from 2000 to 2013. Ratios were adjusted for between-region differences in background rates. In cohorts too old to be invited, death rates in regions 1 and 2 were 702 per 0.91 and 727 per 0.90 million women-years respectively (Ratio 0.96). In the eligible cohorts, they were 1027 per 2.9 and 1095 per 2.67 (Ratio 0.88). Thus, rates in cohorts that could have benefitted were 9% lower in region 1 than region 2: (95%CI: -20%, +4%). The incidence rates of stage 2-4 breast cancer were 7% lower in region 2 than region 1 over the entire 14 year period, and 20% lower in 2007, i.e., before the screening in region 2 began to narrow the difference. Since mortality reductions due to screening only manifest after several years, the full impact of screening has not yet been realized in region 1. The lower rate observed in that region is a conservative estimate of the steady state benefit. Additional deaths would have been averted had screening continued beyond age 64."
https://openalex.org/W2776508642,"This study examined the influence of walkability on walking behaviour and assessed whether associations varied according to life-stage and population center (PC) size. Walkability scores were obtained for the six-digit postal codes of residential neighbourhoods of 11,200 Canadians, who participated in biennial assessments of the National Population Health Survey from 1994 to 2010. Participants were stratified by age-group. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to estimate the influence of cumulative exposure to neighborhood walkability on utilitarian and exercise walking by PC size and life-stage. Associations of neighbourhood walkability with utilitarian and exercise walking varied according to age-group and PC size. Exposure to high walkable neighborhoods was associated with utilitarian walking in younger and older adults in all PC sizes, except for older adults living in a medium PC. Living in a highly walkable neighborhood in a large PC was associated with walking for exercise in younger (OR: 1.42; 95%CI: 1.20–1.67) and older adults (OR: 2.09; 95%CI: 1.51–2.89). Living in highly walkable neighbourhood in a medium PC was associated with walking for exercise in older adults (OR: 1.62; 95%CI: 1.15–2.29). These results emphasize the need to consider the size and nature of every community, and the age-group of a population when implementing strategies to promote walking."
https://openalex.org/W2780851716,"Nonhuman primates from domestic sources constitute a small, but critical, proportion of animals studied in research laboratories. Many of these nonhuman primates are raised at one facility and subsequently transported/relocated to another facility for research purposes. We examined the effects of transport, relocation, and acclimation on the phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a group of rhesus monkeys that were transported by road for approximately 21 hours from one facility to another. Using a panel of human antibodies and a set of standardized human immune assays, we evaluated the phenotype of lymphocyte subsets by flow, mitogen-specific immune responses of PBMCs in vitro, and levels of circulating cytokines and cortisol in plasma at various time points including immediately before transport, immediately upon arrival, and after approximately 30 days of acclimation. Analyses of blood samples revealed that CD3+ T-cell and CD20+ B-cell populations had decreased significantly immediately after relocation but had recovered within 30 days after arrival at the new facility. Similarly, circulating cortisol and cytokine levels in plasma were significantly higher immediately after relocation; and by the 30-day time point, these differences were no longer significant. However, immune assays of PBMCs indicated that mitogen-specific responses for proliferation, interferon γ (IFN-γ), and perforin were significantly higher after relocation and 30 days of acclimation. These findings have implications on the research participation of transported and relocated nonhuman primates in immunologic research studies, suggesting that 30 days is not sufficient to ensure return to baseline immune homeostasis. These data should be considered when planning research studies in order to minimize potential confounding factors associated with relocation and to maximize study validity."

Modern computer architectures and server farms represent untapped resources that can be used to enable higher marker densities to be processed in tractable time. Here we present a pipeline using a modified version of OneMap that parallelizes over bottleneck functions and achieves substantial speedups for producing a high density linkage map (N = 20,000). Using simulated data we show that the outcome is as accurate as the traditional pipeline. We further demonstrate that there is a direct relationship between the number of markers used and the level of deviation between true and estimated order, which in turn impacts the final size of a genetic map."

With aging, oxidation of these Zn nanoparticles eliminated the observed enhancement. The design of a polyethylene glycol coating to meet storage requirements of engineered zinc nanoparticles is evaluated to achieve maximal olfactory benefit. The zinc nanoparticles were covered with 1000 g/mol or 400 g/mol molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG). Non-PEGylated and PEGylated zinc nanoparticles were tested by electroolfactogram with isolated rat olfactory epithelium and odorant responses evoked by the mixture of eugenol, ethyl butyrate and (±) carvone after storage at 278 K (5 oC), 303 K (30 oC) and 323 K (50 oC). The particles were analyzed by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Doppler velocimetry. Our data indicate that stored ZnPEG400 nanoparticles maintain physiologically-consistent olfactory enhancement for over 300 days. These engineered Nanoparticles support future applications in olfactory research, sensitive detection, and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2778099649,"There is accumulating evidence suggesting that a central deficit in developmental prosopagnosia (DP), a disorder characterized by profound and lifelong difficulties with face recognition, concerns impaired holistic processing. Some of this evidence comes from studies using Navon’s paradigm where individuals with DP show a greater local or reduced global bias compared with controls. However, it has not been established what gives rise to this altered processing bias. Is it a reduced global precedence effect, changes in susceptibility to interference effects or both? By analyzing the performance of 10 individuals with DP in Navon’s paradigm we find evidence of a reduced global precedence effect: The DPs are slower than controls to process global but not local shape information. Importantly, and in contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that the DPs perform normally in a comprehensive test of visual attention, showing normal: visual short-term memory capacity, speed of visual processing, efficiency of top-down selectivity, and allocation of attentional resources. Hence, we conclude that the reduced global precedence effect reflects a perceptual rather than an attentional deficit. We further show that this reduced global precedence effect correlates both with the DPs’ face recognition abilities, as well as their ability to recognize degraded (non-face) objects. We suggest that the DPs’ impaired performance in all three domains (Navon, face and object recognition) may be related to the same dysfunction; delayed derivation of global relative to local shape information."
https://openalex.org/W2780826509,"The global shift towards diets high in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is linked to higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and most other non-communicable diseases. In Colombia, one out of every two people was overweight or obese by 2010. This study estimates price-elasticities from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2006-2007 Colombian Income and Expenditure survey. The food groups that were jointly considered were: unsweetened unflavored milks; coffee and tea; sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs); sweets and candies (including sugar); dairy products; meats and animal-based products; grains based staples; fruits and vegetables; and condiments and snacks. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing specific food and beverage groups (censored data) and endogeneity on both prices (as unit values) and total expenditure. Unhealthy beverages are price-elastic (-1.61 for SSBs) meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Also, there is a high complementarity among SSBs and major food groups (grains, meats and fruits and vegetables). In Colombia, the design of a meaningful tax to influence healthier diets is a next critical step. This study also shows that a tax of 20% on SSBs should prove to be effective, and can yield revenues of about 1% of the Colombian government's total annual fiscal revenue, which can potentially be directed towards public health promotion and investments."
https://openalex.org/W2776854916,"Background Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) and contributes to poor cardiovascular outcomes. Enlarged glycemic variability (GV) is a risk factor of cardiac events independently of average blood glucose level, but the influence of SDB on GV is uncertain. In this study, we examined whether the impact of SDB on GV is modified by the presence of DM with or without HF. Methods and results Two hundred three patients (67.5±14.1 [SD] years old, 132 males) who were admitted to our institute for examination or treatment of DM and/or HF underwent continuous glucose monitoring and polysomnography. Both HbA1c (8.0±2.0 vs. 5.7±0.4%) and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE, median: 95.5 vs. 63.5 mg/dl) were significantly higher in a DM group (n = 100) than in a non-DM group (n = 103), but apnea-hypopnea index (AHI: 29.0±22.7 vs. 29.3±21.5) was similar in the two groups. AHI was correlated with log MAGE in the non-DM group but not in the DM group, and multivariate regression analysis revealed that AHI was an independent variable for log MAGE in the non-DM group but not in the DM group. We then divided the non-DM patients into two subgroups according to BNP level (100 pg/ml). AHI was positively correlated with log MAGE (r = 0.74, p<0.001) in the non-DM low-BNP subgroup, but such a correlation was not found in the non-DM high-BNP subgroup. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduced MAGE from 75.3 to 53.0 mg/dl in the non-DM group but did not reduce MAGE in the DM group. Conclusion Severity of SDB was associated with higher GV, but DM as well as HF diminished the contribution of SDB to GV. Treatment with CPAP was effective for reduction of GV only in patients without DM."

Many researchers have received much attention for their research on this subject. In this study, we propose two novel similarity measures between hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). In addition, two extensions of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are proposed in the hesitant fuzzy linguistic environments. Furthermore, an example of an application concerning traditional Chinese medical diagnosis and an MCDM problem have been given to illustrate the applicability and validation of these similarity measures of HFLTSs. Furthermore, the results of examples demonstrate that the Dice and Jaccard similarity measures are more reasonable than the cosine similarity measure with respect to HFLTSs."
https://openalex.org/W2606810435,"The process of desertification in the semi-arid climatic zone is considered by many as a catastrophic regime shift, since the positive feedback of vegetation density on growth rates yields a system that admits alternative steady states. Some support to this idea comes from the analysis of static patterns, where peaks of the vegetation density histogram were associated with these alternative states. Here we present a large-scale empirical study of vegetation dynamics, aimed at identifying and quantifying directly the effects of positive feedback. To do that, we have analyzed vegetation density across $~2.5 \times 10^6 \ \rm{km}^2$ of the African Sahel region, with spatial resolution of $30 \times 30$ meters, using three consecutive snapshots. The results are mixed. The local vegetation density (measured at a single pixel) moves towards the average of the corresponding rainfall line, indicating a purely negative feedback. On the other hand, the chance of spatial clusters (of many ""green"" pixels) to expand in the next census is growing with their size, suggesting some positive feedback. We show that these apparently contradicting results emerge naturally in a model with positive feedback and strong demographic stochasticity, a model that allows for a catastrophic shift only in a certain range of parameters. Static patterns, like the double peak in the histogram of vegetation density, are shown to vary between censuses, with no apparent correlation with the actual dynamical features."
https://openalex.org/W2778596791,"Ex-vivo brain quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) allows investigation of brain characteristics at essentially the same point in time as histopathologic examination, and therefore has the potential to become an important tool for determining the role of QSM as a diagnostic and monitoring tool of age-related neuropathologies. In order to be able to translate the ex-vivo QSM findings to in-vivo, it is crucial to understand the effects of death and chemical fixation on brain magnetic susceptibility measurements collected ex-vivo. Thus, the objective of this work was twofold: a) to assess the behavior of magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter of human brain hemispheres as a function of time postmortem, and b) to establish the relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements on the same hemispheres. Five brain hemispheres from community-dwelling older adults were imaged ex-vivo with QSM on a weekly basis for six weeks postmortem, and the longitudinal behavior of ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter was assessed. The relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements was investigated using QSM data from eleven older adults imaged both antemortem and postmortem. No systematic change in ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility of gray or white matter was observed over time postmortem. Additionally, it was demonstrated that, gray matter magnetic susceptibility measured ex-vivo may be well modeled as a linear function of susceptibility measured in-vivo. In conclusion, magnetic susceptibility in gray and white matter measured ex-vivo with QSM does not systematically change in the first six weeks after death. This information is important for future cross-sectional ex-vivo QSM studies of hemispheres imaged at different postmortem intervals. Furthermore, the linear relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter magnetic susceptibility suggests that ex-vivo QSM captures information linked to antemortem gray matter magnetic susceptibility, which is important for translation of ex-vivo QSM findings to in-vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2778385273,"Background Suboptimal quality of care and disparities in services by healthcare providers are often reported in Nepal. Experience and perceptions about quality of care may differ according to women’s socio-cultural background, individual characteristics, their exposure and expectations. This study aimed to compare perceptions of the quality of maternal healthcare services between two groups that are consistently considered vulnerable, women with disabilities from both the non-Dalit population and Dalit population and their peers without disabilities from both non-Dalit and Dalit communities. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 343 total women that included women with disabilities, Dalits and non-Dalits. Women were recruited for interview, who were aged 15–49 years, had been pregnant within the last five years and who had used maternal care services in one of the public health facilities of Rupandehi district. A 20-item, Likert-type scale with four sub-scales or dimensions: ‘Health Facility’, ‘Healthcare Delivery’, ‘Inter-personal’ and ‘Access to Care’ was used to measure women’s perceptions of quality of care. Chi-square test and t test were used to compare groups and to assess differences in perceptions; and linear regression was applied to assess confounding effects of socio-demographic factors. The mean score was compared for each item and separately for each dimension. Results All groups, women with disabilities and women without disabilities, Dalit and non-Dalit rated their perceptions and experiences of quality of care lowly in a number of items. While perceived quality of care between women with disabilities and without disabilities in the ‘Health Facility’ dimension and associated items, was found to differ (p<0.05), this difference was linked to disability status, but was not linked to caste differences. For example, differences in mean scores relating to ‘Cleanliness and Facilities’, ‘Open and Friendliness’ and ‘Compassion and Kindness’ were highly significant (p<0.001), with women with disabilities rating these as better than women without disabilities. On the other hand, women without disabilities rated the ‘Availability of cash Incentives’ more highly (p<0.01). No significant differences were found between Dalit and non-Dalit women in perceived quality of care, except in relation to ‘Cleanliness and facilities’, which Dalit women rated lower than non-Dalits (p<0.05). Conclusions Perceptions about the quality of care differed significantly by disability status but not by caste. All groups rated the quality of healthcare delivery, interpersonal and personal factors as well as access to services ‘low.’ Poor service user experiences and perceptions of quality of care undermine opportunities to translate increased healthcare coverage into improved access and outcomes. Greater attention is required by policy makers, health planners and providers to the improvement of quality of care in health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2780147173,"Percutaneous osseointegrated (OI) implants for direct skeletal attachment of upper extremity prosthetics represent an alternative to traditional socket suspension that may yield improved patient function and satisfaction. This is especially true in high-level, transhumeral amputees where prosthetic fitting is challenging and abandonment rates remain high. However, maintaining mechanical integrity of the bone-implant interface is crucial for safe clinical introduction of this technology. The collection of population data on the transhumeral loading environment will aid in the design of compliance and overload protection devices that mitigate the risk of periprosthetic fracture. We collected marker-based upper extremity kinematic data from non-amputee volunteers during advanced activities of daily living (AADLs) that applied dynamic loading to the humerus. Inverse dynamic analysis was applied to calculate the axial force, bending and torsional moments at three virtual amputation levels representing 25, 50, and 75% residual humeral length. The influences of amputation level, elbow flexion constraint, gender and anthropometric scaling were assessed. Results indicate that the proximal (25%) amputation level experienced significantly higher axial forces and bending moments across all subjects when compared to distal amputation levels (p≤0.030). Constraining elbow flexion had a limited influence on peak transhumeral loads. Male subjects experienced higher axial forces during all evaluated activities (p≤0.023). Peak axial force for all activities occurred during jumping jacks (174.5N). Peak bending (57.6Nm) and torsional (57.2Nm) moments occurred during jumping jacks and rapid internal humeral rotation, respectively. Calculated loads fall within the range of implant fixation failure loads reported in cadaveric investigations of humeral stem fixation; indicating that periprosthetic fracture may occur during non-contact AADLs. These kinematic data, collected over a range of AADLs, will aid in the development of overload protection devices and appropriate post-operative rehabilitation protocols that balance return to an active lifestyle with patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W2781056526,"Optical illusions provide powerful tools for mapping the algorithms and circuits that underlie visual processing, revealing structure through atypical function. Of particular note in the study of motion detection has been the reverse-phi illusion. When contrast reversals accompany discrete movement, detected direction tends to invert. This occurs across a wide range of organisms, spanning humans and invertebrates. Here, we map an algorithmic account of the phenomenon onto neural circuitry in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Through targeted silencing experiments in tethered walking flies as well as electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we demonstrate that ON- or OFF-selective local motion detector cells T4 and T5 are sensitive to certain interactions between ON and OFF. A biologically plausible detector model accounts for subtle features of this particular form of illusory motion reversal, like the re-inversion of turning responses occurring at extreme stimulus velocities. In light of comparable circuit architecture in the mammalian retina, we suggest that similar mechanisms may apply even to human psychophysics."
https://openalex.org/W2781337935,"Understanding the processes that drive population genetic divergence in the Amazon is challenging because of the vast scale, the environmental richness and the outstanding biodiversity of the region. We addressed this issue by determining the genetic structure of the widespread Amazonian common sardine fish Triportheus albus (Characidae). We then examined the influence, on this species, of all previously proposed population-structuring factors, including isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-barrier (the Teotônio Falls) and isolation-by-environment using variables that describe floodplain and water characteristics. The population genetics analyses revealed an unusually strong structure with three geographical groups: Negro/Tapajós rivers, Lower Madeira/Central Amazon, and Upper Madeira. Distance-based redundancy analyses showed that the optimal model for explaining the extreme genetic structure contains all proposed structuring factors and accounts for up to 70% of the genetic structure. We further quantified the contribution of each factor via a variance-partitioning analysis. Our results demonstrate that multiple factors, often proposed as individual drivers of population divergence, have acted in conjunction to divide T. albus into three genetic lineages. Because the conjunction of multiple long-standing population-structuring processes may lead to population reproductive isolation, that is, the onset of speciation, we suggest that the multifactorial population-structuring processes highlighted in this study could account for the high speciation rate characterising the Amazon Basin."
https://openalex.org/W2777114917,"The most frequent disorder of glycosylation, PMM2-CDG, is caused by a deficiency of phosphomannomutase activity. In humans two paralogous enzymes exist, both of them require mannose 1,6-bis-phosphate or glucose 1,6-bis-phosphate as activators, but only phospho-mannomutase1 hydrolyzes bis-phosphate hexoses. Mutations in the gene encoding phosphomannomutase2 are responsible for PMM2-CDG. Although not directly causative of the disease, the role of the paralogous enzyme in the disease should be clarified. Phosphomannomutase1 could have a beneficial effect, contributing to mannose 6-phosphate isomerization, or a detrimental effect, hydrolyzing the bis-phosphate hexose activator. A pivotal role in regulating mannose-1phosphate production and ultimately protein glycosylation might be played by inosine monophosphate that enhances the phosphatase activity of phosphomannomutase1. In this paper we analyzed human phosphomannomutases by conventional enzymatic assays as well as by novel techniques such as 31P-NMR and thermal shift assay. We characterized a triple mutant of phospomannomutase1 that retains mutase and phosphatase activity, but is unable to bind inosine monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2777659383,"Coastal ecosystems and the livelihoods they support are threatened by stressors acting at global and local scales. Here we used the data produced by the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity program (CARICOMP), the longest, largest monitoring program in the wider Caribbean, to evidence local-scale (decreases in water quality) and global-scale (increases in temperature) stressors across the basin. Trend analyses showed that visibility decreased at 42% of the stations, indicating that local-scale chronic stressors are widespread. On the other hand, only 18% of the stations showed increases in water temperature that would be expected from global warming, partially reflecting the limits in detecting trends due to inherent natural variability of temperature data. Decreases in visibility were associated with increased human density. However, this link can be decoupled by environmental factors, with conditions that increase the flush of water, dampening the effects of human influence. Besides documenting environmental stressors throughout the basin, our results can be used to inform future monitoring programs, if the desire is to identify stations that provide early warning signals of anthropogenic impacts. All CARICOMP environmental data are now available, providing an invaluable baseline that can be used to strengthen research, conservation, and management of coastal ecosystems in the Caribbean basin."

Therefore, we investigated the value of these echocardiographic parameters in predicting clinical outcomes among patients in the Korean Heart Failure (KorHF) Registry.The KorHF Registry consists of 3,200 patients who were hospitalized with AHF from 2005 to 2009. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival and readmission, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. Predictors of survival were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.Echocardiograms from 2,910 of the 3,200 patients (90.9%) were evaluated. The median LVEF and LVEDD (37% and 56 mm, respectively) were used as cut-offs for the binary transformation of each parameter. The cumulative death-free survival rates for all patients did not significantly differ based on LVEF or LVEDD quartiles; however, an LVEF greater than the median was associated with a better prognosis in ischemic HF patients (log-rank test; p = 0.039). Among ischemic HF patients, LVEF (dichotomized) was a significant predictor of death in a Cox model after adjusting for a history of HF, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum sodium, sex, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), atrial fibrillation (Af) and anemia (hazard ratio (HR) 1.475, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.099-1.979, p = 0.010). The cumulative readmission-free survival rates significantly differed among ischemic HF patients only when based on LVEDD quartiles (log-rank test; p = 0.001). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, LVEDD (dichotomized) remained a significant variable only among patients with ischemic HF after adjusting for sex, age, AMI, DM, COPD, serum sodium, SBP, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and anemia (HR 1.401, 95% CI 1.067-1.841, p = 0.015).Among ischemic AHF patients in the KorHF Registry, LVEF is associated with mortality, whereas LVEDD is only associated with readmission in a binary transformed form."
https://openalex.org/W2776968073,"α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are key mediators of central cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, respectively. In addition to numerous well-established functional interactions between α7 nAChRs and NMDARs, the two receptors have been proposed to form a multimeric complex, and in the present study we have investigated this putative α7 nAChR/NMDAR assembly in human and murine brain tissues. By α-bungarotoxin (BGT) affinity purification, α7 and NMDAR subunits were co-purified from human and murine cortical and hippocampal homogenates, substantiating the notion that the receptors are parts of a multimeric complex in the human and rodent brain. Interestingly, the ratios between GluN1 and α7 levels in BGT pull-downs from cortical homogenates from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains were significantly lower than those in pull-downs from non-AD controls, indicating a reduced degree of α7 nAChR/NMDAR complex formation in the diseased tissue. A similar difference in GluN1/α7 ratios was observed between pull-downs from cortical homogenates from adult 3xTg-AD and age-matched wild type (WT) mice, whereas the GluN1/α7 ratios determined in pull-downs from young 3xTg-AD and age-matched WT mice did not differ significantly. The observation that pretreatment with oligomeric amyloid-β1–42 reduced GluN1/α7 ratios in BGT pull-downs from human cortical homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner provided a plausible molecular mechanism for this observed reduction. In conclusion, while it will be important to further challenge the existence of the putative α7 nAChR/NMDAR complex in future studies applying other methodologies than biochemical assays and to investigate the functional implications of this complex for cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, this work supports the formation of the complex and presents new insights into its regulation in healthy and diseased brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2779687312,"The use of interleukin-7 (IL-7) as an immunorestorative therapeutic has proven effective in HIV infection, cancer and bone marrow transplantation. Mediating its activity through membrane-bound IL-7 receptor α (mCD127), IL-7 therapy increases T-cell numbers and survival. A soluble form, sCD127, is found in plasma, and we have previously identified increased plasma sCD127 concentrations in HIV infection. Furthermore, patients with high sCD127 exhibited the best viral control, implicating a role for IL-7 or sCD127 directly in improved virologic/immunologic outcomes. The role of the cytokine IL-7 in elevating sCD127 levels was addressed here through assessment of retrospective samples obtained from SIV-infected antiretroviral (ART)-treated Rhesus macaques. IL-7 was administered in clustered weekly doses, allowing for an assessment prior, during and following IL-7 administration. The levels of sCD127 remained relatively unchanged during both early SIV infection and following initiation of ART. However, treatment with IL-7 increased sCD127 concentrations in most animals, transiently or persistently, paralleling increased T-cell numbers, correlating significantly with CD8+ T-cell levels. In addition, proliferating CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells (measured by Ki67) increased in association with elevated sCD127 concentrations. Finally, a high concentration of sCD127 in IL7-treated animals was associated with increased retention of T-cells (measured by BrDU). In addition, a lack, or loss of viral control was associated with more pronounced and frequent elevations in plasma sCD127 concentrations with IL-7 therapy. In summary, plasma sCD127 levels in SIV-infected ART-treated macaques was associated with therapeutic IL-7 administration, with higher sCD127 levels in macaques demonstrating the best T-cell responses. This study furthers our knowledge regarding the interrelationship between increased IL-7 levels and elevated sCD127 levels that may have implications for future IL-7 immunotherapeutic approaches in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2779040211,"To describe a large cohort of women with non-puerperal inflammatory breast and to identify characteristics of inflammatory breast cancer.All patients consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome in the breast unit of our tertiary University hospital between September 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included. We excluded women who were pregnant or in the postpartum period. Patients underwent systematic clinical examination and imaging (breast ultrasonography and mammography). A biopsy was performed if the clinician suspected a malignant lesion of the breast. Clinicopathologic and radiologic data were registered. Statistics were performed using R (3.0.2 version) software.Among the 76 patients screened and included, 38 (50%) had a malignant lesion at final diagnosis, 21 (27.6%) were diagnosed with infectious disease and 17 (22.4%) with inflammatory disease of the breast. When compared to patients with benign disease, patients with a malignant lesion were significantly older (p = 0.022, CI95% 1.78-14.7), had a significantly bigger palpable mass (p<0.001, CI 95% 22.8-58.9), were more likely to have skin thickening (p = 0.05) and had more suspicious lymph nodes at clinical examination (p<0.001, CI 95% 2.72-65.3). Precise limits on ultrasonography were significantly associated with benign lesions. The presence of a mass (p = 0.04), micro calcifications (p = 0.04) or of focal asymmetry (p<0.001, CI95% 1.3-618) on mammography was significantly associated with malignant disease.Inflammatory breast cancer was common in our cohort of women consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome. Identifying these patients with high-risk malignancy is crucial in the management of an inflammatory breast."
https://openalex.org/W2776383587,"We develop and test a new theory for pressure dependent outflow from the eye. The theory comprises three main parameters: (i) a constant hydraulic conductivity, (ii) an exponential decay constant and (iii) a no-flow intraocular pressure, from which the total pressure dependent outflow, average outflow facilities and local outflow facilities for the whole eye may be evaluated. We use a new notation to specify precisely the meaning of model parameters and so model outputs. Drawing on a range of published data, we apply the theory to animal eyes, enucleated eyes and in vivo human eyes, and demonstrate how to evaluate model parameters. It is shown that the theory can fit high quality experimental data remarkably well. The new theory predicts that outflow facilities and total pressure dependent outflow for the whole eye are more than twice as large as estimates based on the Goldman equation and fluorometric analysis of anterior aqueous outflow. It appears likely that this discrepancy can be largely explained by pseudofacility and aqueous flow through the retinal pigmented epithelium, while any residual discrepancy may be due to pathological processes in aged eyes. The model predicts that if the hydraulic conductivity is too small, or the exponential decay constant is too large, then intraocular eye pressure may become unstable when subjected to normal circadian changes in aqueous production. The model also predicts relationships between variables that may be helpful when planning future experiments, and the model generates many novel testable hypotheses. With additional research, the analysis described here may find application in the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2776496750,"We observed some cases of lung abscess (LA) in ICU patients suffering S.aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia (S.aureus-VAP). We aimed to assess which of the host and/or bacteria-related features are associated with LA.We conducted a retrospective study from January 2009 to July 2013 in a trauma surgical ICU within a teaching hospital. All adult patients presenting with S.aureus-VAP were included. We compared two groups of patients according to the formation or not of LA concomitantly to S.aureus-VAP.Seventy-nine S.aureus-VAP patients, predominantly males (85%) of rather young age (mean [SD]: 35yr [21-64]) with severe trauma (initial Simplified Acute Score II = 42 [32-52]) related-ICU admission, were included. Among them, 10 (14%) developed LA. Patient's characteristics significantly associated with LA development were: a younger age (p = 0.003), road traffic accidents admission (p = 0.017), head injury (p = 0.002), lower Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0.009), blunt chest trauma (p = 0.01) pneumothorax (p = 0.01) and lung contusions (p = 0.002). No microbiological factors were significantly associated with LA formation. Abscesses were mostly bilateral, ≥5 cm of diameter and with a posterior location.Our results do not favor a specific virulence of S.aureus, but rather highlight the role of multiple insults to the lung, promoting LA formation. Despite a similar severity score, patients with LA had more serious trauma, combining severe both chest and head insults."
https://openalex.org/W2779963643,"The effect of resolving metabolic syndrome on target organ damage in hypertensive patients is not well described. We evaluated whether treating metabolic syndrome (MetS) with an angiotensin receptor blocker subsequently reduced microalbuminuria in the K-MetS cohort.Among 10,601 total metabolic syndrome patients, 3,250 (52.2% male, 56.2±10.0 years) with sufficient data on five specific metabolic components were included in this study. Patients were divided into four groups based on MetS status at baseline and 3 months. All patients received an angiotensin receptor blocker, fimasartan, for these 3 months; thereafter, treatment was modified at the discretion of each patient's physician. Microalbuminuria and the albumin/creatine ratio were evaluated as a proxy of organ damage.Blood pressure and waist circumference decreased from baseline to 3 months and 1 year. The average albumin/creatinine ratio significantly improved during the first three months of the study from 36.0±147.4 to 21.0±74.9 mg/g (p<0.05) and was persistently high in patients with MetS at baseline and 3 months versus other groups. Women in comparison with men showed significantly lower ACR among patients with newly developed MetS at 3-month.Treatment of hypertensive patients for one year with the angiotensin receptor blocker fimasartan significantly reduced the albumin/creatine ratio, irrespective of whether the patient had MetS; however, the albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly higher in patents with persistent or newly developed MetS compared to patients without MetS. Additionally, these findings were more prominent in women than in men."
https://openalex.org/W2780023049,"Land tenure and tenure security are among the most important factors determining the viability and success of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives. The premise of the present paper is that territorial conflicts lead to forest loss and compromise the successful implementation of REDD+. Within this context, the main objectives of this paper are to (i) document, relying on participatory methods, the extent to which land conflicts drive deforestation and (ii) reflect on the legal context of REDD+ examining if, from an Indigenous perspective, it offers tools to resolve such conflicts. We used the Upper Bayano Watershed in eastern Panama as a case study of complex land tenure dynamics, and their effects on forest conservation in the context of REDD+. Combining a range of participatory methods including participatory mapping and forest carbon stock assessment, we estimated the consequences of land invasions on forest carbon stocks. Our analysis shows that invasions of Indigenous territories amounted to 27.6% of the total deforestation for the period of 2001-2014. The situation is of paramount concern in the Embera territory of Majé where 95.4% of total deforestation was caused by colonist invaders. Using and validating the maps made freely available by the Global Forest Change initiative of the University of Maryland, we then developed a reference level for the watershed and carried out a back of the envelop estimation of likely REDD+ revenue, showing its potential to bring much needed income to Indigenous communities striving to protect their forest estate. Our analysis of current legislation in Panama highlights confusion and important legal voids and emphasizes the strong links between land tenure, carbon ownership, and territorial invasions. The options and shortcoming of implementing REDD+ in Indigenous territories is discussed in the conclusion taking our legal review into account."
https://openalex.org/W2778062157,"Snail, a zinc-finger transcription factor, controls the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and ectopic expression of this protein may produce cells with stem cell properties. Because the effect of Snail expression in ovarian epithelial cells remains unclear, we generated Drosophila ovarian follicle stem cells (FSCs) with homozygous Scutoid (Sco) mutation. The Sco mutation is a reciprocal transposition that is known to induce ectopic Snail activity. We found that Sco mutant FSCs showed excess proliferation and high competitiveness for niche occupancy, and the descendants of this lineage formed outgrowths that failed to enter the endocycle. Surprisingly, such phenotypes were not rescued by suppressing Snail expression, but were completely restored by supplying Lethal giant larvae (Lgl). The lgl allele is a cell polarity gene that is often mutated in the genome. Importantly, Sco mutants survived in a complementation test with lgl. This result was probably obtained because the Sco-associated lgl allele appears to diminish, but not ablate lgl expression. While our data do not rule out the possibility that the Sco mutation disrupts a regulator of lgl transcription, our results strongly suggest that the phenotypes we found in Sco mutants are more closely associated with the lgl allele than ectopic Snail activity."
https://openalex.org/W2778663816,"The evolutionary theory of language predicts that a language will tend towards fewer synonyms for a given object. We subject this and related predictions to empirical tests, using data from the eBay Big Data Lab which let us access all records of the words used by eBay vendors in their item titles, and by consumers in their searches. We find support for the predictions of the evolutionary theory of language. In particular, the mapping from object to words sharpens over time on both sides of the market, i.e. among consumers and among vendors. In addition, the word mappings used on the two sides of the market become more similar over time. Our research contributes to the literature on language evolution by reporting results of a truly unique large-scale empirical study."
